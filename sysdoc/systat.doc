           stating the base is other than UP is given; otherwise,  the state
           of the DISPATCH  base is given.  The  version number of  the base
           code is  given followed  by a  number of  counters, which  are as
           follows:

           PFSR    Power failsafe restart count
           STCT    Restart count

           PEDB    BASE-HOST data transfer parity error crash count

           The restart address ring buffer  is then dumped.  This is  a list
           of the last seven (7) addresses which crashed the  DISPATCH base.
           A "*" is given by the most recent crash address.

           Error information given during DISK printout

           Following unit types are recognized:

               FH - (1) RC10 kontroller with RD10 or RM10B drum
               DP - (2) RP10 kontroller with RP01, RP02 or RP03 disk pack
               BP - (4) SA10 kontroller with 3330 disk pack

           SYSTAT will output a series of short messages followed by numbers
           (except as noted below).  These messages are as follows:

           HDAT    Number of Hard Data errors
           HCONI   CONI status returned from the last Hard error
           HDATAI  DATAI status returned from the last Hard error
           HLBN    Last logical block number of the last Hard error
           SDEV    Number of Soft Device errors
           SDAT    Number of Soft Data errors
           SCONI   CONI status returned fron the last Soft error
           SDATAI  DATAI status returned fron the last Soft error
           SLBN    Last logical block number of the last Soft error
           RET     Number of retries on last error
           SATFAIL Number of SAT failures (software)

           HUNG    Number of times unit hung (other than THUNG)

           When a hard  or soft CONI is  reported, SYSTAT will output  a "("
           and  then  print  a  series  of  self-explanatory  messages which
           "decipher" the CONI.

           When a hard or soft LBN is reported, SYSTAT will output a "(" and
           then print a  series of messages  which "decipher" the  LBN.  The
           messages which are not self-explanatory are detailed below.

           The following commands are  issued to the system and  call SYSTAT
           indirectly.   All  of  them except  SYSNO  accept  the additional
           command "?" which causes a brief set of instructions to be listed
           on the terminal.

           The following commands must be issued to SYSTAT, not  the system.
           However, they do not combine with other SYSTAT commands.
