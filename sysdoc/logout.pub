.description
With no arguments, these commands all log out the current frame.
The command circuit is zapped.

All forms except EXIT print the accumulated TRUs and network connect
time since the frame logged in.

If KJOB or LOGOUT is specified with arguments,
the system attempts to log out the frames indicated by the specified
frame numbers.
If the user has Tymshare Proprietary status,
he may logout any frame logged in to his username.
If the user has Account Supervisor status,
he may logout any frame logged in in his Global Account.
If the user has Write Core license,
he may logout and frame in the system.

If the frame being logged out has a different user name than the current user,
a confirmation message is printed indicating the username and program name.
The user must then answer with Y to log the frame out.
