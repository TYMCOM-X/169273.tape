CAL
.description
The CAL program is a simple interpreted programming language
intended for performing quick calculations.  The following commands
are documented here:
.nofill;

	TYPE exp, exp, exp, ...
	TYPE FORMULA f
	TYPE ALL FORMULAS
	LET f = exp		; function def, not assignment
	LET f(a,b,c,...) = exp
.fill;

TYPE displays the result of the expression.  LET defines a function for
later evaluation.
Expressions may contain the following operators (shown in order of precedence):
.begin table(8); preface 0; skip;
!x!\absolute value
(x)\evaluation order
x^e\exponentiation
a*b\multiplication
a/b\division
a+b\addition
a-b\subtraction
.end;
The following prefix functions are built in:
.begin table(17); preface 0; skip;
arg(x,y)\angle of vector in radians
cos(t)\cosine of t radians
dp(x)\digit part: dp(13456.5432)=1.34565432
exp(x)\exponential: e^x
fp(x)\fraction part
ip(x)\integer part
log(x)\natural logarithm
sgn(x)\0 if x=0, else 1 with the sign of x
sin(t)\sine of t radians
sqrt(x)\square root
xp(x)\exponent part: xp(13456.5432)=4
.end;

Formulas or functions defined with the LET command may be saved in a file
with the commands
.nofill;

	USE FILE 1.
	FILE ALL FORMULAS AS ITEM 1.

And restored by

	USE FILE 1.
	RECALL ITEM 1.

And displayed by

	TYPE ALL FORMULAS.
.fill;
