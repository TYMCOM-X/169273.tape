   SYNOPSIS

           Display names and contents of tempcore files.

   SYNTAX

           TC
           R TC

   DESCRIPTION

           When  first run,  the  program displays  a list  of  all existing
           tempcore files, including those of the form jjjXXX.TMP  where jjj
           is the  current frame  number.  The program  then prompts  with a
           colon (:).

           At the colon  the user may  type <CR> to quit,  or the name  of a
           tempcore file to display.  If the file being displayed is RPG, TC
           translates the binary contents into symbolic form, otherwise, the
           simple ASCII contents of the file are displayed.
