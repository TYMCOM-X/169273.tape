			 ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN
                         ----------------------


		  All The Presidents Men, by Carl Bernstein and Bob
		  ----------------------
 	Woodward is about the Watergate scandal and how the events unfolded

	to leave the nation stunned at the realization that this was the

	biggest political crisis in our nation's history.

		  As the story begins, a reporting is receiving an assign-

	ment to cover the break in at  the Democratic Headquarters. Earlier,

	five men had broken into the Watergate Hotel, the centeral head-

	quarters for the democrats, and had bugged it. The five men,

	Bernard L. Barker,Virgilio R. Gonzalez, Euginio R. Martinez, Frank A.

	Sturgis, (all Cubans from Miami) and James W. McCord, were found

	with large somes of money, mostly in hundred dollar bills. After

	the reporter got his assignment, he went to the court room where

	the burglars were before a judge. Bob Woodward, the reporter, began

	questioning Marcum, a lawyer who was present. He told Woodward that

	the burglars had arranged their own council, a Mr Starky. That seemed

	strange to Woodward because they had not even made a call.

		  Since there had been no call made, they must have been

	connected with someone else who would have known they were caught.

	In two of the burglars phone books they found strange entries. One

	was a H. H. and the other was a Howard Hunt. They both probably

	referred to the same person which is a sign of someone connected.

		  When Woodward left the court room, he began looking for

	information on Howard Hunt to see if he could find a connection

	between him and the burglars. He also began working with his part-

	ner on the story, Carl Bernstein.

		  One of the Woodward's sources, DEEP THROAT, whose identity

	is still not known today, gave Woodward a lot of information. In

	one of their meetings, DEEP THROAT, told Woodward to "follow the

	money", meaning the money the burglars had. His partner, Bernstein,

	followed the money and went to Miami where he got one of his sour-

	ces to give him all the financial information on Keneth H. Dahlberg.

	Dahlberg was the finance chairman of The White House and in his

	file were some Mexican checks. The checks had been deposited in

	the name of Bernard L. Barker (one of the burglars). Dahlberg was

	asked about the checks and he said that he gives all his money to

	the committee.

		  After talking to Dahlberg Woodward and Bernstein were

	confused about where the money was coming from and where it was

	going. They tried to get information about the money from several

	people involved. From another one of their sources they got a list

	of all the people involved. It was quite a large list, but Woodward

	and Bernstein went down list and spoke to every person. Out of

	all of the 100's of people they talked to, only one person would

	tell them anything. One woman told them three initials, L., P., and

	M. Those were three of the men who controlled the funds for CREEP.

	There were five men altogether and they eventually got out of her

	that they were: Gordon Liddy, Herbert L. Porter, Jeb Stuart Magruder,

	Maurice H. Stans, and Kenneth H. Dahlberg. These five men received

	large sums of money severals times. The person they worked under

	was John N. Mitchell. Woodward and Bernstein's source, woman implied

	that Mitchell was doing something wrong when she said that if they

	caught Mitchell it would be beatifull.

		  After they got this information from the woman they con-

	tacted the men and told them what she had said. There were some

	denial, but there was enough confirmation on the story that decided

	to go ahead and print story and run it. After the story was run

	it informed the people of everything that was going on with the

	Watergate scandal and got an investigation going. After the inves-

	tigation, the five burglars and some of the Presidents men were

	found guilty and President Richard M. Nixon, the top guy in

	the whole situation, resigned.

	CONCLUSION:
	----------
		  In the years following Watergate, the word has become 

	synonymous with scandal. Nothing could have prepared our nation

	for the political holocast that was revealed when these two young

	reporters broke open Watergate. People want to think well of their

	leaders. A series of political crimes and misconduct in public

	office had reached all the way to the White House. Our nation was

	left stunned and bruised.

		  But what have we learned since then? For democracy to 

	survive, leaders must be trusted and the system must work. Have we

	been placing too much power in the hands of a few? One thing we can

	take pride in is that when Watergate did surface we refused to bury-

	it. We made sure it was highly visible to everyone. Democracy allowed

	for that. Hopefully we have learned our lesson------
