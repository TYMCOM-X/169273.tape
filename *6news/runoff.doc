                                  INTRODUCTION



          Runoff is a Tymcom-X program to facilitate  the  preparation
          of  typed  or  printed  manuscripts, such as specifications,
          manuals, etc.  The user prepares his material on a file  and
          includes  not  only  textual  material,  but  also  case and
          formatting information.  Runoff  then  takes  the  file  and
          reproduces it onto the terminal or another file to produce a
          final copy.  It performs the formatting and case shifting as
          directed,  and  will  also  perform line justification, page
          numbering and titling, etc., as desired.

          The principal benefit  of  such  a  program  is  that  files
          prepared for use with it may be edited and corrected easily.
          Unchanged material need not be  retyped.   After  a  set  of
          changes,  the program may be run to produce a new copy which
          is properly paged and formatted.  Documentation may thus  be
          updated as necessary without requiring extensive retyping.

                               ON-LINE OPERATION



          Runoff is a program accessed by the  usual  "R"  command  in
          TYMEX.  For example, the user would type:

                    -R RUNOFF

          The program will then ask:

                    INPUT FILE:

          The input file name  should  then  be  typed.   The  default
          extension  for  Runoff  source  files  is  .RNO  and  may be
          ommitted if desired.  The file name may  be  a  full  source
          file  descriptor,  with device, name, and extension.  If the
          input file name is terminated with an altmode in PDP-10 mode
          or  Control-d  in  Tymex  mode,  then further interaction is
          suppressed, and the output file will be produced  in  normal
          mode,  and  written  to  the  disk.  If a carriage return is
          typed, then the program will ask:

                    OUTPUT FILE:

          The output  file  name  should  be  entered.   TTY:  may  be
          specified  if terminal output is desired.  If a file name is
          specified without an extension, the extension '.LST' will be
          used.   If  no  file name is specified, the program will use
          the name of the input file, with extension .LST.   The  file
          name  may  be a full file descriptor, with device, file name
          and extension.

          If the output file name  is  terminated  by  an  altmode  in
          PDP-10  mode  or  a  Control-D  in  Tymex mode, then further
          interaction will be suppressed and processing started  using
          the normal conventions.

          If the output  file  name  is  terminated  with  a  carriage
          return, then the program will ask:

                    UNDERSCORE (L, C, B OR N)?

          to which the user must reply L, C, B, or N.

          L (LINE) is used for a  line  printer  with  underlining,  a
          terminal   with   underlining,   or  for  files  which  will
          eventually be copied to such a line printer or terminal.  It
          causes  underscoring  (where  specified  by &) to be done by

          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE   3



          overprinting a line.

          C (CHARACTER) is used for files which will be printed with a
          terminal which has a non-spacing underscore character.

          B (BACK SPACE)is normal and causes each underline  character
          in the output file to be followed by a back space character.
          This mode should be used for terminals  which  have  both  a
          spacing  underscore  and a back space function.  This is the
          mode that is available on many TYMSHARE terminals.

          N (NO) causes underlining requests to be discarded.  This is
          the case with the TYMSHARE model 200 (teletype).

          The program will next ask:

                    SIMULATE FORM FEED (Y OR N)?

          to which the user must reply Y or N.  NO is normal and means
          that  a  form-feed  character  (control-L)  will  be used to
          advance the listing to the top of a page.  This mode  should
          be  used  for  terminals  with  mechanical form feeds or for
          files to be listed on terminals with form  feed  capability.
          This  option  may  also  be  used  in files being printed in
          Editor with the PRINT command.   It  should  be  noted  that
          files  to be printed with the PRINT command in Editor should
          have the page size  reduced  to  54.   YES  means  that  the
          program  will advance to a new page by typing an appropriate
          number of line-feed characters.  It must be  used  with  any
          terminal which does not have mechanical form feed.

          The program will then ask:

                    PAUSE?

          A YES answer means that the program will stop at the top  of
          each page to allow the paper to be positioned manually.  The
          user should type a space to cause printing  to  be  resumed.
          This mode is appropriate for typing the output onto pages of
          special forms or materials.   (On  2741  type  of  selectric
          terminals, the space-ATTN keys are required.)

          When the program has completed processing, it will type  END
          OF JOB, and return to TYMEX.

                               SOURCE FILE FORMAT



          As stated  above,  the  source  file  contains  the  textual
          material   which   will  appear  on  the  final  copy,  plus
          information to specify formatting.  Most importantly,  upper
          and lower case information may also be supplied so that copy
          can be prepared on any  type  terminal  which  can  normally
          input  only  upper  case  letters.   All command information
          consists of regular ASCII  printing  characters  so  that  a
          listing of the source file may be examined if the final copy
          is not exactly as desired.

          All material in the source file is taken to be  source  text
          except   those  lines  beginning  with  a  period.   A  line
          beginning with a period is assumed to be a command, and must
          match  one  of those listed below.  The commands provide the
          formatting information, and control various  optional  modes
          of operation.

          Usually the text is filled and justified as it is processed.
          That is, the program FILLS a line by adding successive words
          from the source text until one more  word  would  cause  the
          right  margin to be exceeded.  The line is then JUSTIFIED by
          making the word spacings larger until the last word  in  the
          line exactly meets the right margin.

          The user may occasionally wish to reproduce the source  text
          exactly   which   is   done   by   disabling   filling   and
          justification.  The program may  be  set  to  fill  but  not
          justify, in which case the output will be normal except that
          lines will not be justified to the right margin.

          When the FILL  mode  is  on,  spaces  and  carriage  returns
          occurring  in  the  source  text  are  treated  only as word
          separators.  Multiple separators are ignored.  However,  two
          spaces will be used after a period.

          Some of the commands cause a BREAK in the output.   A  break
          means that the current line is output without justification,
          and the next word goes at the beginning of  the  next  line.
          This occurs at the end of paragraphs.

          The program will advance to new pages as necessary,  placing
          the  title (if given) and the page number at the top of each
          page.  The user may explicitly call for a page advance where
          desired,  and  may  inhibit the occurrance of a page advance
          within specified material.

                            CASE CONTROL INFORMATION



          Specification of case for files prepared on the terminal  is
          done with two characters, up arrow , and back slash.  If the
          input  file  was  created  in  upper  and  lower  case,  the
          following  does  not apply.  It should be remembered that it
          is necessary, however, to begin the file with two up arrows.
          The  appearance of an up arrow causes the letter immediately
          following to be transmitted in upper case.   The  appearance
          of  a  back slash causes the letter immediately following to
          be converted to lower case.  Any letter not preceeded by one
          of these characters is transmitted in the current mode.  The
          mode  is  initially  lower  case,  and  is  changed  by  the
          occurrance  of  two successive case control characters.  Two
          up arrows cause the mode to be set to upper  case,  and  two
          back  slashes  cause the mode to be set to lower case.  This
          convention should be used if the file is  created  in  upper
          and  lower  case.  If the file contains both upper and lower
          case characters, two up arrows should occur at the beginning
          of  the file and thus the remainder of the file will have no
          case conversion performed by the program.

          The use of the above corresponds to the use of the shift and
          shift-lock keys on a typewriter.  Usually, typing appears in
          lower case.  To type one letter in upper case, the shift key
          is  used.   The  shift-lock is set to type a series of upper
          case letters, after which it is released.

          Note: Case conversion takes place only on ASCII codes 101 to
          132  octal,  that  is,  the  upper case letters.  Any actual
          lower case letters (codes 141 to 172 octal) appearing in the
          source  will  be  transmitted  unchanged.   If the source is
          prepared on a terminal which produces letters of the  proper
          case,  the mode should be set to upper case at the beginning
          of the file and left unchanged for the remainder.

                               SPECIAL CHARACTERS



          The character ampersand (&) is used to specify underscoring.
          The  ampersand  will  cause the character following it to be
          underscored, e.g.  &f&o&o becomes foo.

          Underlining of a string of characters can also be specified,
          similarly  to the use of the shift lock operations described
          above.  An appearance of  ampersand  preceded  by  up  arrow
          (circumflex  on ASCII devices) will cause underlining of all
          following  characters  except  space.   An   appearance   of
          ampersand  preceded  by  back  slash will disable this mode,
          e.g.  ^&foo\& becomes foo.

          It is occasionally necessary to include spaces in  the  text
          which  should  not  be treated as word separators.  For this
          purpose, Runoff treats number sign as a quoted  space;  i.e.
          it will print as exactly one space in the output, will never
          be expanded nor changed to a carriage return.

          To  allow  the  appearance   of   the   special   characters
          (ampersand,  number  sign,  up  arrow, or back slash) in the
          output,  the  character  left  arrow  (underscore  on  ASCII
          devices)  is  used  as  a  quote  character.   The character
          immediately following a left arrow will  be  transmitted  to
          the output with no formatting effect.  The left arrow itself
          is thus another case requiring quoting.

                                    COMMANDS



          The following commands will be recognized if they are at the
          beginning  of a line started with a period.  Any line in the
          source file beginning with a period is assumed to be one  of
          these  commands.   If it is not, an error diagnostic will be
          typed and the line will be ignored.  Some commands take  one
          or  more  numbers  following.   These are separated from the
          command by a space.



                              Formatting Commands
                              -------------------

          .CENTER n

               This command causes a break after which it centers  the
               next  line following in the source file.  The centering
               is over the column n/2, independent of the  setting  of
               the  left  and  right  margins.   If n is missing, n is
               assumed to be the  paper  width,  initially  60.   (See
               PAPER SIZE command.)

          .BREAK

               Causes a break, i.e.  the current line will  be  output
               with  no justification, and the next word of the source
               text will be placed at the beginning of the next line.

          .SKIP n

               Causes a break after which n*(line spacing)  lines  are
               left blank.  If the skip would leave room for less than
               two printed lines on the page (i.e.  if there are  less
               than  n+2*(line  spacing)  lines  left),  the output is
               advanced to the top of the next page.

          .BLANK n

               Exactly like SKIP, except that n (rather  than  n*(line
               spacing))  lines  are  specified.   BLANK is used where
               space is to be left independent of  the  line  spacing;
               SKIP, where the space should be relative to the size of
               line space.

          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE   8



          .FIGURE n

               Like BLANK except that if less than n lines  remain  on
               the  current  page,  the  page  will be advanced, and n
               blank lines will be left at the top of  the  new  page.
               Principally  used where it is desired to leave room for
               a figure to be drawn in manually.

          .INDENT n

               Causes a break and sets the next line to begin n spaces
               to  the right of the left margin.  n may be negative to
               cause the line to begin to the left of the left  margin
               (useful for numbered paragraphs or offset titles).

          .PARAGRAPH n

               The number is optional and, if present, sets the number
               of  spaces  which  paragraphs  are to be indented.  The
               initial setting is 5.  The command causes a  break  and
               leaves (m+1)/2 blank lines, where m is the regular line
               spacing.  The next line will be indented  as  indicated
               above.

          .PAGE

               Causes a break and an advance  to  a  new  page.   Does
               nothing  if  the  current  page  is empty.  Titling and
               numbering as for automatic page advance.

          .TEST PAGE n

               Causes a break followed by a conditional page  advance.
               If  there  are n or more lines remaining on the current
               page, no advance is made  and  no  lines  are  skipped.
               Otherwise,  the  page  is  advanced  as for PAGE.  This
               command should be used to ensure that the  following  n
               lines are all output on the same page.

                             ---------------------



          .JUSTIFY

               Causes a break and sets subsequent output lines  to  be
               justified.  (Initial setting)

          .NOJUSTIFY

               Causes a break and prevents justification of subsequent
               output lines.

          .FILL

               Causes a break and  specifies  that  subsequent  outpu             lines  be  filled.   Sets  the justification mode to be
               that specified by the last  appearance  of  JUSTIFY  or
               NOJUSTIFY.  (Initial setting)

          .NOFILL

               Causes a  break  and  prevents  filling  of  subsequent
               output lines.  Also turns off justification.

               Note:

                  1. The nofill-nojustify mode need be used only where
                     there  are several lines of material to be copied
                     exactly.  A single line example will not  require
                     using  these  commands if there are breaks before
                     and after.

                  2. Normally FILL and NOFILL are used  to  turn  both
                     filling  and  justification  on  and  off.  It is
                     usually  desirable  to  do  both.   A  subsequent
                     appearance   of   a  justification  command  will
                     override the fill command however.

                  3. Because  of  the  action  of   FILL,   a   single
                     occurrance  of NOJUSTIFY will cause the remainder
                     of the file to be unjustified,  with  filling  as
                     specified.  In order to justify but not fill (not
                     recommended), a JUSTIFY command must follow every
                     NOFILL command.

          .NUMBER n

               Turns on page numbering (normal) and, if n is supplied,
               sets the current page number to n.

          .NONUMBER

               Turns off page numbering.  Pages will  continue  to  be
               counted,  so  the  normal  page  number  will appear if
               numbering is re-enabled.

                           Parameter Setting Commands
                           --------------------------



          .LEFT MARGIN n

               Causes a break after which the left margin is set to n.
               n must be less than the right margin, but not less than
               0.  The initial setting is 0.  The amount of any indent
               plus the left margin must not be less than 0.

          .RIGHT MARGIN n

               Causes a break after which the right margin is  set  to
               n.   n  must  be  greater  than  the  left margin.  The
               initial setting is 60.

               The number of characters on a line will be equal to  or
               less  than the right margin minus the left margin minus
               any indenting which may be specified.  Even if  filling
               has  been disabled, lines will not be extended past the
               right margin.

          .SPACING n

               Causes a break after which the line spacing will be set
               to  n.   n  must  be  within  the range 1 to 5.  Single
               spacing is 1, double spacing is 2,  etc.   The  initial
               spacing is 2.

          .PAPER SIZE n,m

               Sets the number of lines per page  to  n.   n  must  be
               greater  than  10.   The  initial  setting  is  58.   n
               includes the top margin of 5 lines.   The  page  number
               and  title  appear  on  the  second  line.   The second
               argument, m, is optional.   If  present,  it  sets  the
               paper  width  in  columns  (initially  60).  It must be
               greater than the left margin, and it is  set  into  the
               right  margin  as  if a RIGHT MARGIN m command had also
               been typed.  This command is usually used only  at  the
               beginning  of  a  file,  but  may be used throughout if
               needed.


          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE  12



          .TAB STOPS n ... n

               Clears all previous tab stops and sets new tab stops as
               specified.  The several n (max 32) must be greater than
               zero and in increasing order.  They are  the  positions
               of  tab  stops  independent  of the setting of the left
               margin, although any  which  are  less  than  the  left
               margin  will  not  be  seen.   There  are  no tab stops
               initially.

               Tabs should  be  used  only  in  lines  which  will  be
               unjustified   and  unfilled,  i.e.   where  filling  is
               disabled or a break immediately follows.  Clearly,  the
               spaces  specified  by  a  tab  character  should not be
               expanded to justify the line.  This  would  defeat  the
               effect  of  tab formatting.  The appearance of a tab in
               the source text will  be  translated  to  one  or  more
               spaces, the amount necessary to advance to the next tab
               stop.  If a tab appears at a point where no further tab
               stops  have been set on a line, the tab will be treated
               as though it had been a space.

                             Miscellaneous Commands
                             ----------------------



          .TITLE tttt ... tttt

               This command takes the remaining text (after the  first
               space) on the line as the title.  This text will appear
               at the top of all subsequent pages, at position  0,  on
               the  second  line  with  the page number.  The title is
               initially blank.

          .SUBTITLE tttt ... tttt

               This command takes the remaining text (after the  first
               space)  on  the  line  as the subtitle.  This text will
               appear on the line immediately following the title  and
               page  number.   The  subtitle  is initially blank.  The
               subtitle is  not  indented,  but  may  contain  leading
               spaces to achieve the same effect, if desired.

          .FOOTNOTE n

               Allocates n*(line spacing) lines at the bottom  of  the
               current  page  for a footnote(1).  If insufficient room
               remains on the current page, space will be allocated at
               the  bottom  of  the  following page.  The text for the
               footnote begins on the line following the command,  and
               it  may contain any appropriate commands (e.g.  CENTER,
               SKIP) necessary to format the footnote.   The  footnote
               is  terminated  by a line beginning with an exclamation
               point (the remainder of which is ignored).   The  lines
               delimited by this line and the FOOTNOTE command are put
               into a buffer to be processed when the output moves  to
               within  the  stated distance of the bottom of the page.
               If a page has multiple footnotes, the  allocated  space
               is  the  sum  of  the  allocations  for  all  footnotes
               assigned to the page.  The user must include his choice
               of footnote-designating symbols within the text.

               The current values of left and right  margin  and  line
               spacing  are  saved  and  restored  after processing of
               footnotes.  Therefore, a footnote may contain  commands

                             - - - - - - - - - - -
          (1) This is a footnote.  This text  and  the  dividing  line
          above  were  specified  by  text  and  commands  following a
          FOOTNOTE 5 command.

          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE  14



               which change these parameters, and the effect  will  be
               limited to the footnote text.

               The actual space taken by the footnote may be  more  or
               less  than that specified by n.  The n merely allocates
               space and should be the user's best guess.   If  it  is
               considerably  off,  the footnote lines may overflow the
               page, or extra space may be left at  the  bottom.   The
               user may wish to adjust n after examining a first draft
               printout.

          .INDEX tttt ... tttt

               This command takes the remaining text (after the  first
               space)  on the line as a key word or words and adds it,
               along with the current page  number,  to  the  internal
               index  buffer.  The command does not cause a break.  It
               should  appear  immediately  before  the  item  to   be
               indexed.   A key word or words may be indexed more than
               once.

          .PRINT INDEX

               Causes  a  break  after  which  it  prints  the  entire
               contents  of  the index buffer.  Entries are printed in
               alphabetical  order,  and  are  set  against  the  left
               margin.   Regular  line  spacing is used, except that a
               blank line is left between entries of  different  first
               letters.   The  number  of the first page on which each
               entry appeared is put on the same line  as  the  entry,
               beginning at the middle of the line (midway between the
               left and right margins).  Additional page  numbers  for
               multiple  entries  follow,  separated  by  commas.  The
               index buffer is left empty.

                          NOTES AND HINTS ON OPERATION



          Runoff is not a supported Tymshare product, but bug  reports
          are being kept on file, and will be addressed if the program
          status changes.

          The following comments and notes are offered as a  guide  to
          current use and convention of Runoff:

          1)  No command abbreviations, macro command  strings,  local
          variables,  or  multiple  commands per line are permitted in
          Runoff.

          2)  One can, apparently, have a comment on  a  command  line
          after a semicolon.  For example:

                     .; THIS IS A COMMENT

          3)  The SKIP n command will not work correctly as the  first
          thing in a page.  Use FIGURE n in this case.

          4)  A common  beginner's  mistake  is  to  forget  that  the
          characters  ampersand,  number sign, up arrow (circumflex on
          ASCII devices), back arrow (underscore  on  ASCII  devices),
          and  back  slash  must be preceded by back arrow in order to
          print correctly.

          5)  Note that terminal periods are normally followed by  two
          spaces  in  final output.  Periods in names or titles may be
          "joined" to the following characters by typing number  signs
          for spaces, viz:

                    Mr.#A.J.#Simpson

          would print as

                    Mr. A.J. Simpson

          6)  Exclamation points and question marks used  as  terminal
          punctuation  are not automatically followed by two spaces in
          the final output, as are periods.  At least two  spaces  may
          be  forced in these cases by following the exclamation point
          or question mark with a single  number  sign  in  the  input
          file.   This  may cause an apparent justification problem if
          an exclamation point or question mark were to  be  the  last
          item on a line to be filled.

          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE  16



          7)  The convention of beginning each sentence on a new  line
          seems  to  be  a  common  one  for  people  who  use  Runoff
          frequently.

          8)  Lines which begin with a period may be generated in  the
          output  text  by  starting  the  line with a space or number
          sign, and indenting -1.

          9)  Note the comment about the size  of  pages  used  in  an
          Editor  PRINT  command.   (See page 3.) An alternative is to
          change the Editor's page size  ("LINES  58")  and  trim  off
          excess paper.  If the system command TYPE is used, then form
          feeds should be simulated in  the  output  file  unless  the
          terminal device has form feed capability.

          10)  A bug will cause the message

                    POSITION PAPER, TYPE SPACE

          to appear if the question

                    SIMULATE FORM FEED (Y OR N)?

          is answered "Y".  Just type  a  space  and  Runoff  will  be
          happy.

          11)  If  you  accidentally  output  to   your   input   file
          (disaster),  then  look at your .TMP files -- there may be a
          salvagable copy around.

          12)  Numbered paragraphs seem to look  nicer  if  the  first
          words  of the text are spaced over precisely two spaces from
          the number; two number signs will do the trick.

          13)  Paragraphs may be formatted, as this one is,  with  the
               text   justified   independently   of  the  number.   A
               combination of .LEFT MARGIN n, and .INDENT -m  for  the
               first  line  will  work.  Here, for instance, the first
               line of this paragraph  was  indented  -5  spaces,  and
               number signs were used to force the "P" in "Paragraphs"
               to fall in the 6-th character position.

          14)  Runoff is quite intolerant of minor  syntax  errors  in
          commands;  key  words,  for  example,  must  be separated by
          precisely one space.

          15)  Runoff has been known to completely ignore input  lines
          which began with a period and which it could not understand.
          Beware.

          Runoff; May 1974                                    PAGE  17



          16)  A bug causes precisely the next line  after  a  .CENTER
          command to be centered -- this includes lines beginning with
          a period -- exercise caution when indexing  things:  do  not
          put a .INDEX after a .CENTER.

          17)  Runoff does understand lower case commands.

          18)  There is a suspicion that page numbers are lost by  the
          indexing  operation  when  the  list  of  page numbers for a
          particular entry exceeds the line capacity for printing.

          19)  Editor will find all blank  lines  in  input  text  and
          replace  them  with  .PARAGRAPH  by  the following operation
          sequence:

                    FIND NOT "Control-G" MARK 1
                    @1 SUBSTITUTE
                    ".PARAGRAPH Control-V Control-M
                    Control-D" FOR "Control-V Control-M
                    Control-D"
                    WAIT?N


          20)  The  horizontal  position  of  the   page   number   is
          controlled by the page size (the width).

          21)  Little or no error checking is done by Runoff on margin
          settings.  Beware.

          22)  Runoff wants to put page numbers, starting with "2", on
          the  second  page, et seq.  This is fine if you have a title
          page, but causes problems when  one  wants  the  first  page
          numbered  "1"  (or n).  Put out a dummy first page with some
          printable garbage on it and a .NUMBER 0 command (or  .NUMBER
          m where m=n-1) to get around this.

          23)  Runoff thinks that the physical page size is  66  lines
          when  simulating  form  feeds.  The .PAPER SIZE command will
          result in squeezing more lines on a page in this case.   The
          combination  of  the Editor LINES command, and simulation of
          form feeds may solve problems in this  area.   Something  is
          fishy  about  PAPER  SIZE.  It doesn't set the right margin,
          for example, and sometimes  doesn't  change  the  number  of
          lines  per  page.  Please send bug reports -- more specimens
          are needed.

          25)  If you work on a terminal with  upper  and  lower  case
          facilities,  then  you  will likely want to start your input
          file with two up arrows.

          26)  Be sure to give titles and  subtitles  before  ejecting
          the page preceding the one they are to be printed on.

          27)  If you are using TABs, and using the Editor to  prepare
          your  input  file, then type them in as Control-V Control-I,
          else they will be expanded to spaces by  Editor.   Tabs  are
          generally a bother.

          28)  The following rubric has been  used  by  several  staff
          members  as  a  standard  input file header.  It sets up the
          spacing, page size, upper and lower case, allows .SKIP n  to
          work initially, and generally seems to save effort:
