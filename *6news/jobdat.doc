JOBDAT.DOC -- Changes from V430(443) to V431(447)
January 1979


1.0  SUMMARY

This release changes JOBDAT to eliminate JOBXXX from the  entry  block
if FTJOB=0.

This version of JOBDAT supersedes  all  previous  versions.   It  runs
under  all  monitors.  It may be loaded with all monitors.  There have
been no bug reports.

JOBDAT is documented in the Monitor Calls  Manual,  Software  Notebook
Volume 4.



2.0  CHANGES

Edit #

444       If FTJOB=0, don't put JOBXXX symbols in the entry block.

445,446   Add 2 new monitor symbols to make  it  possible  to  support
          full file specifications on RUN and GET monitor commands.

447       Define exec data vector (.JBEDV=112) used  by  DDT  to  find
          symbols not in monitor virtual address space.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

No changes  for  old  procedures.   To  produce  the  UNIVERSAL  file,
assemble  with  a  parameter  file  defining  the  symbol %..UNV.  For
example,

     .COMPILE UNV.MAC+JOBDAT.MAC

where UNV.MAC defines "%..UNV==0".

JOBDAT.DOC -- Changes from V427(440) to V430(443)
March 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release changes JOBDAT to allow  the  creation  of  a  JOBDAT.UNV
UNIVERSAL  file for the convenience of MACRO programs which want to do
address arithmetic such as LOC with the JOBDAT locations.

This version of JOBDAT supersedes  all  previous  versions.   It  runs
under all monitors.  It may be loaded with all monitors.  This version
has no dependency upon the DATE-75 project and there have been no  bug
reports.

JOBDAT is documented in Software Notebook vol.2B.



2.0  CHANGES

441  (SPR 10-13,901) Add an option to make JOBDAT  a  universal  file.
     The  only  changes in this mode are to suppress the object (.REL)
     file and to make the symbols LOCAL rather than ENTRY.

     This change allows  the  JOBDAT  symbols  to  be  used  in  MACRO
     programs  anyplace  that  predefined  symbols  are required.  For
     example,

          SEARCH  JOBDAT          ;GET UNIVERSAL OF JOBDAT
          %%JOBD==%%JOBD           ;SHOW VERSION

          ........

          LOC     .JBVER          ;SET TO .JBVER
          BYTE    (3)2 (9)1 (6)0 (18)223 ;SET VERSION
          RELOC                   ;RETURN TO REGULAR CODE

     Note that if this is done and C or UUOSYM is used, then they must
     be  used as UNIVERSALs and searched after JOBDAT, e.g., as SEARCH
     JOBDAT,C.

442  Purge the local symbol MJDA.  This will affect no programs.

443  Also purge the macro definitions so the universal file is clean.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

No changes  for  old  procedures.   To  produce  the  UNIVERSAL  file,
assemble  with  a  parameter  file  defining  the  symbol %..UNV.  For
example,

     .COMPILE UNV.MAC+JOBDAT.MAC
where UNV.MAC defines "%..UNV==0".

JOBDAT.DOC -- Changes from V426(431) to V427(440)
December 1973



1.0  SUMMARY

This change updates JOBDAT for the 5.07/6.01 monitor release.  It also
includes  new  symbols  needed  for  version  2  of  LINK-10.  It also
completes the removal of symbols of the form JOBxxx in favor of  those
of  the  form  .JBxxx.  The old form was removed in order to eliminate
naming restrictions for FORTRAN subroutines.

This version of JOBDAT supersedes  all  previous  versions.   It  runs
under all monitors.  It may be loaded with all monitors.  This version
has no dependency upon the DATE-75 project  and  there  have  been  no
SPRs.

JOBDAT is documented in Software Notebook vol.3 and the monitor  calls
handbook.



2.0  CHANGES

432  Make cosmetic improvements to clean  up  the  comments.   Symbols
     which  do  not  define  words  are now indented.  Define all user
     symbols at constants, rather than floating.

433  Add checkout instructions.

     434 Add new user symbols in the vestigial (high-seg)  data  area:
     .JBHSA, .JBH41, and .JBHRN.

435  Make all the changes needed for the 6.01 monitor (VM) and  define
     the  new  user  symbols:   .JBPFH (low seg 123, pointer to user's
     page fault handler), and .JBHGA (high seg 7, bits  9-17  are  the
     default GETSEG starting page).

436  Define user symbol .JBOVL for LINK-10 version 2.  This is low seg
     location  131  and  points  to the root segment control block for
     overlays.

437  Remove the user symbol .JBCN6  (and  JOBCN6)  since  LOADER/CHAIN
     have  not used these for several years.  If an installation needs
     these symbols, they can be  restored  by  reassembling  with  the
     symbol FTCN6=1.

440  Remove the old format symbols of the form JOBxxx.   They  can  be
     restored   if   needed   by   defining  the  symbol  FTJOB=1  and
     reassembling.

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

No change except for assembly instructions  for  5.07/6.01,  which  is
covered in MIG507.



5.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.

JOBDAT.DOC -- Changes from V425 to V426(431)
June 1971



1.0  SUMMARY

This change updates JOBDAT to make one high segment  symbol  available
for  user programs (JOBHCR), and defines the low segment area 135-137.
The principal change is that all user symbols now have the form .JBXXX
rather than JOBXXX.  The old form is still available in order to allow
a gradual changeover of all user programs.   The  old  form  is  being
removed   in   order   to   remove  naming  restrictions  for  FORTRAN
subroutines.

This version of JOBDAT supersedes  all  previous  versions.   It  runs
under  all  monitors.   It  may  be  loaded  with all monitors.  It is
documented in Software Notebook Vol.1A.


2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES


2.1  New User Symbols

135 (.JBOPS) is now reserved for all operating systems

136 (.JBCST) is now reserved for all customers
2 in high segment (.JBHCR) high-seg copy of JOBCOR


2.2  Redefinition of Location 137

Location 137 (.JBVER) is now defined to be in the following format:

     BITS      USAGE
     ----      -----
      0- 2     who last changed this routine:
               0=Digital Development Group
               1=Other Digital
               2-4=Reserved to Customer
               5-7=Reserved to Customer's Users
      3-11     Digital major version number (usually increments by one
               just after a release.)
     12-17     Digital minor version number (usually 0.  used only  if
               an  update is needed after plans or work has started on
               a major new version.)
     18-35     Edit Number (usually not reset.)


2.3  New Format of User Symbols

All future symbols will have the form .JBXXX.  The  old  symbols  have
both  the new form and the old form.  Eventually, the old form will go
away and just the new form will be left.
JBT426.DOC                                                      Page 9


3.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Two new MACROs were created to implement the change in 2.3.

Change to key the EXEC version off the new AC names P and R  (the  old
names PDP and PROG still work for old monitors).
