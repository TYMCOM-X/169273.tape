                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Please feel free to call  the  sales  department  of  the  Boston
Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

To run the 1802 cross assembler, at the monitor level type:

     -R CA1802      _ ______

The assembler will respond with the following:

     1802 Cosmac Cross Assembler Version 1B(15)
     Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc. 1977
     (617) 894-7800
     *
At the asterisk, type:

     *PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________________

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST  are  the  object  and  listing  files  the
assembler  will  create  and PROG.SRC is the source program being
assembled.   If  file  name  extensions  are  not  specified  the
defaults  .OBJ,  .LST  and  .SRC will be inserted.  The filenames
PROG.OBJ, PROG.SRC and PROG.LST are  used  for  example  purposes
only.   Any  acceptable  file names and extensions desired may be
used.

If either the object or listing file is not desired,  it  may  be
omitted   from  the  specification,  as  the  following  examples
illustrate:

     *PROG.OBJ=PROG.SRC      _________________

     *,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________

Note that the comma is required when a listing  file  is  desired
but not an object file.

The listing file is in ASCII format and may be typed  or  printed
as follows:

    -TYPE PROG.LST           On your terminal     ____ ________

    -LIST TTY:=PROG.LST      On your terminal, page formatted     ____ _____________
The default object file format is an ASCII file and this  can  be
punched with the following command:

    -TYPE PROG.OBJ           On your terminal, if so equipped     ____ ________

The object and listing files may be printed or  punched  at  your
local branch office;  contact your salesman for details.

2.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION    ______ _______ ___________

PROGRAM ENTRY

Source programs may be placed on the host computer disk either by
the  use of a text editor to build new programs, or by reading in
an existing file from paper tape, magtape, etc.  Once  a  program
resides on disk a text editor may be used to alter or correct the
file in preparation for assembly.  It is not necessary to  remove
line  numbers  from  a  file before assembly;  the assembler will
ignore them if they are present.


PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source statement consists of  strings  of  ASCII  characters
(fields)   terminated   by   a   carriage   return - line   feed.
Statements, or lines, of more  than  90  characters  will  appear
truncated  in  the  listing file but will be assembled correctly.
Blank lines are not allowed.  Lines beginning  with  two  periods
(..)  will be treated as comments.  Lines with only a label field
will generate no code.  Any label on such a line will be assigned
to  the next available address.  Each source statement is made up
of four fields:  the  label,  instruction,  operand  and  comment
fields,  which are defined below.  Multiple statements, separated
by semicolons, may appear on a line,  optionally  followed  by  a
semicolon  and  a  comment.  The last line of a program must only
have an "END" statement.

Label Field - A statement label consists of up to  6  characters,_____ _____
the  first  of which must be alphabetic and appear in column one.
The remaining characters may  be  alphabetic  or  numeric.   Each
label,  including  macro  definitions,  must end with a colon.  A
label identifies a particular location in the program and  should
not  duplicate  another label or one of the assembler's permanent
symbols, which include  all  of  the  instruction  mnemonics  and
pseudo ops.

The label field is optional except in statements  with  a  $MACRO
statement.

Instruction Field - The instruction field must contain either  an___________ _____
instruction  mnemonic,  a pseudo op or the name of a user defined
macro (i.e., a macro call).  The field must be separated  from  a
preceding label by at least one space or tab.

Operand Field - The operand field, if required,  may  consist  of_______ _____
constants  or  statement  labels.  These elements may be combined
into expressions with arithmetic operators, as  described  below.
This  field  must  be  separated from the instruction field by at
least one space or tab.

Comment Field - This field is optional;  it will  appear  on  the_______ _____
assembly  listing  but  will  be  ignored  by the assembler.  The
comment field must begin with two periods (..).  
                                                           Page 7


EXPRESSIONS

Expressions can be  made  up  of  user  symbols,  numbers,  ASCII
constants,  statement  labels  and  the  instruction counter (*).
These elements may be combined by the + and - operators  to  form
complex expressions.

Symbols - Any alphanumeric symbol, up to 6 chars, which has  been_______
used  as  a  statement  label or set or equated to a value may be
used in an expression.

Numeric Constants - Numeric Constants may be specified as  binary_______ _________
or  hexadecimal  constants.   To  do  this  the  number should be
immediately preceded by a constant and enclosed in apostrophes to
indicate the radix used, as shown in the examples below:

         B'...' - binary     (e.g., B'0101')
         # or X'...' - hex   (e.g., #F8 or X'F8')

Numbers without any indication of  radix  are  considered  to  be
decimal.

ASCII Constants - An ASCII constant is represented by one or  two_____ _________
characters  enclosed  in  apostrophes and preceded by a "T".  For
example, T'NA'.

DATA LISTS - A data list starts with either a comma or  "DC"  and____ _____
consists  of  expressions and long constants separated by commas.
Long constants are  used  to  extend  the  number  of  characters
allowed  in  the  constants shown above (8 for hex, 32 for binary
and four for ASCII) to any desired length.

ADDRESS CONSTANTS - There are three forms of  address  constants,_______ _________
depending upon which byte(s) is being addressed, as shown below:

     A(TOM)          ..IS A FULL TWO BYTE ADDRESS
     A.1(TOM)        ..IS THE UPPER BYTE ONLY
     A.0(TOM)        ..IS THE LOWER BYTE ONLY

Any type of symbol, constant or expression  shown  above  may  be
used in the parentheses.

4.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO OPS)    _________ __________ _______ ____


This cross assembler recognizes  the  following  pseudo  ops.   A
detailed  explanation of each may be obtained by referring to the
microprocessor manufacturer's programming manual and chapters 5.0
and 6.0 of this manual.


        END
        ORG
        PAGE
        $IF
        $ENDIF
        $MACRO
        $ENDM
                                                          Page 10


5.0 MACRO STATEMENTS    _____ __________

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by just writing the macro  name
in  the  instruction.   This  makes  it  possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

MNAME:  $MACRO  DUM1,DUM2,...
          .
          .
        $ENDM

where MNAME is the name of the macro and DUM1,DUM2,...  are dummy
argument  names  (if  any).  Dummy argument names must conform to
the rules for a macro call, as shown below, and for a symbol, but
have  no  meaning  outside  a macro definition.  Within the macro
definition they may  appear  anywhere  (in  any  field)  and  all                                                              ___
occurrences  of  a  dummy argument will be replaced by the actual
argument strings when the macro is used.  Macro  definitions  may
be nested.

Macro calls are of the form:

LABEL:  MNAME   ARG1,ARG2,...

where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual  arguments  (ARG1,ARG2,...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
commas.   Arguments omitted from a macro call are treated as null
strings;  extra arguments are ignored.  Notice that arguments can
be  expressions,  instruction  mnemonics,  comments or labels for
statements inside the macro expansion.  The  macro  processor  is
only  concerned  with  character  strings, which it passes to the
rest of the assembler.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 11


MACRO EXAMPLES


..WAIT 4 MACHINE CYCLES
PAUSE:  $MACRO
        NOP
        NOP
        NOP
        NOP
        $ENDM




..BUILD 4 CHARACTER TABLE ENTRIES
ENTRY:  $MACRO  Q,R,S,T,VALUE
        DC      T'Q'
        DC      T'R'
        DC      T'S'
        DC      T'T'
        DC      VALUE
        $ENDM


An example of a macro call to build entry WXYZ using  the  second
example above:

WXYZ:   ENTRY   W,X,Y,Z,27


This would result in the following expansion:

        DC      T'W'
        DC      T'X'
        DC      T'Y'
        DC      Z'Z'     ..NOTE BOTH T'S ARE REPLACED
        DC      27

6.0 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY    ___________ ________

Portions of a program can be assembled or not depending upon  the
value  of  an  expression.  This is accomplished by preceding the
conditional section of code with a statement containing  the  $IF
pseudo  op  and  the  expression  to  be evaluated and ending the
section with the pseudo op $ENDIF.  This is useful for  producing
several versions of the same program from a single source file by
changing only one parameter.

The expression following the $IF pseudo op will be  evaluated  by
the assembler and the results compared to zero.  If the result is
not zero the code will be assembled.  If the result is zero,  all
the code up to the next $ENDIF statement is ignored.  Conditional
statements may be nested to any depth.




Example of a conditional section of code:


        $IF     VER-1   ..DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE=6
        $ENDIF
        $IF     VER     ..DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE=8
        $ENDIF

7.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT    ______ ____ ______

The object file produced by this cross assembler is an ASCII file
in the format specified by RCA for the COSMAC.  The record layout
is shown below:


        4 chars         Hex load address for data following
        1 char        pace (delimiter)
        2 chars         First data byte
        2 chars         Each additional data byte
        ;               End of record (except last record)
                        Carriage return - line feed
                                                          Page 14


8.0 ERROR HANDLING    _____ ________

The cross assembler will  print  error  messages  at  the  user's
terminal  and  on  the  program  listing  if the listing file was
requested in the specification.  Errors are indicated by  one  or
more  characters  at  the  left of the listing line in which they
occurred.  In all cases the assembler will  attempt  to  generate
some  code  for  each  source line so addresses further on in the
program do not get out of phase.  This also allows for a location
into which a patch may be inserted if the object tape is used for
debugging, even with its errors.


ERROR CODES


B -     Blank lines not allowed

C -     Invalid character encountered in input source

D -     Name previously defined (multiply defined)

E -     Phase error (label changed value from pass1 to pass2)

G -     Invalid expression encountered

H -     Missing apostrophe in X, B, or T constant

I -     Device number too large

J -     Immediate byte made into legal value

P -     Branch out of 256 byte page

Q -     Unrecognized or questionable statement

T -     Illegal constant

U -     Undefined symbolic name 

V -     Missing operand

X -     Register number truncated to legal value

Y -     Table space overflow during macro call;  call ignored

Z -     Missing name for $MACRO

9.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES    _______ __ ___________

This cross assembler  is  compatible  with  the  cross  assembler
supplied  for  the CDP1802 (COSMAC) by RCA with a few exceptions.
These exceptions are listed below:


     1.  The following features conform to BSO standards and  may
         conflict   with   similar   features   offered   by  the

     2.  Extended instruction mnemonics (IDLE,  IF,  SKIP,  etc.)
         are not allowed.

     3.  D-sequences are not allowed.

     4.  Macro and conditional statements are allowed.

     5.  At least one space or tab must separate the  instruction
         field and the operand field.


Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
