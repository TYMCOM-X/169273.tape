UUOSYM.DOC -- Changes from V13A(406) to V14(457)
August 1979



1.0  SUMMARY

This release of UUOSYM conforms to the 700 and later monitor releases.

This version is upwards compatible from previous  versions  of  C  and
fully supersedes all previous versions.  No SPR'S have been received.

The contents of UUOSYM.MAC are documented throughout the Monitor Calls
Manual of the software notebooks.  Changes for the support of 700 will
be published in the Monitor Calls Manual.

Note that UUOSYM.MAC is used to compile many programs on  the  release
tape.   None of these changes affect the resulting .REL or save files,
but other software distributed this month and in future months depends
upon  this version to assemble.  This version was assembled with field
image MACRO version 53.


1.1  Purpose of UUOSYM.MAC

UUOSYM.MAC is designed to form a consistent definition of monitor  UUO
symbols which occur frequently in the development of user-mode support
programs.  A table  of  contents  gives  the  general  layout  of  the
information.   The definition of a particular symbol can best be found
from the CREF listing of UUOSYM.  All symbols are ASUPPRESSED so  that
unreferenced definitions are deleted.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

Edit #

407-440   Update symbols to 7.00 load 345 for 7.00 field test.

441-444   Update symbols to load 60353 for 7.00 field test #3.

445-447   Update symbols to load 60360 for 7.00 field test #4.

450-454   Update symbols to load 60366 for 7.00 field test #5.

455-457 Update symbols to load 60367 for 7.00 field test and release



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.

4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile using MACRO version  53  or  later.   There  are  no  assembly
options or parameters.  The command to compil UUOSYM is:

          .COMPILE UUOSYM/CREF

The only output is a UNIVERSAL file UUOSYM.UNV.  This should be placed
on UNV:  (or on SYS:).

To create a file identical in specification  and  effect  to  the  old
C.MAC,  including  its  use as either a patameter file or a UNIVERSAL,
concatenate  CHEAD.MAC,  MACTEN.MAC,  and  UUOSYM.MAC  into  one  file
(C.MAC):

          .R PIP
          *C.MAC/A=CHEAD.MAC,MACTEN.MAC,UUOSYM.MAC

and use this file as a replacement for C.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.

UUOSYM.DOC -- Changes from V10 to V11
September 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

This release  of  UUOSYM  conforms  to  the  6.02  and  later  monitor
releases.

This version is upwards compatible from previous  versions  of  C  and
fully supersedes all previous versions.  No SPR's have been received.

UUOSYM.DOC -- Changes from V7 to V10
January 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

This release splits  C  to  form  UUOSYM.   It  also  completes  minor
omissions from the 5.07/6.01 release.

This version is upwards compatible from previous  versions  of  C  and
fully supersedes all previous versions.  No SPR's have been received.

UUOSYM.MAC is  documented  implicitly  throughout  the  monitor  calls
manual of the software notebooks.

Note that UUOSYM.MAC is used to compile many programs on  the  release
tape.   None of these changes affect the resulting .REL or save files,
but other software distributed this month and in future months depends
upon  this version to assemble.  This version depends on MACRO version
50.  There are no DATE-75 dependencies.


1.1  Purpose of UUOSYM.MAC

UUOSYM.MAC is designed to form a consistent and convenient  definition
of  monitor  UUO  symbols which occur frequently in the development of
user-mode support programs.  It is defined for use as a universal from
any  MACRO  program.   A table of contents gives the general layout of
the information.  The definition of a particular symbol  can  best  be
found from the CREF listing of UUOSYM.  All symbols are ASUPPRESSed so
that unreferenced definitions are deleted.

2.0  EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CHANGES

201       Split C.MAC into MACTEN.MAC and UUOSYM.MAC.  UUOSYM contains
          all  the  definitions  which  are  part  of  the monitor UUO
          interface for  both  privileged  and  unprivileged  programs
          except  PEEK.   UUOSYM produces only a UNIVERSAL and depends
          upon MACRO version 50.  Because of the corrections in  MACRO
          version  50,  the JOBDAT symbol ".JBVER" which was commented
          out of C.MAC has  been  restored.   Note  that  if  the  new
          JOBDAT.UNV  is  used, then it must be ahead of UUOSYM in the
          MACRO universal search list to work.

202       Add those few symbols defined  near  the  end  of  5.07/6.01
          development  which  did  not make version 7.  This completes
          the documented 6.01 interface.

203       Add definitions of the privileged function ".FSDEF"  of  the
          STRUUO  call.   This  is  the  last undocumented part of the
          TOPS-10 UUO interface.

204       Add error symbols for MTAID.  which were defined as part  of
          a bug fix in 5.07A/6.01A.

205       (Internal only) Change the way the UUOs are defined to  make
          the definitions independent of external references.

206       Remove bug introduced since last release.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Compile using MACRO version 50  or  better.   There  are  no  assembly
options   or   parameters.   The  only  output  is  a  UNIVERSAL  file
UUOSYM.UNV.  This should be placed on UNV:  (or on SYS:):

          .COMPILE UUOSYM/CREF

To create a file identical in specification  and  effect  to  the  old
C.MAC,  including  its  use as either a parameter file or a UNIVERSAL,
concatenate  CHEAD.MAC,  MACTEN.MAC,  and  UUOSYM.MAC  into  one  file
(C.MAC):

          .R PIP
          *C.MAC/A=CHEAD.MAC,MACTEN.MAC,UUOSYM.MAC

and use this file as a replacement for C.

5.0  SUGGESTIONS

The numbers used when GETTABs fail should be symbolized.
