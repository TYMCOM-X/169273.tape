1.0 INTRODUCTION TO CLmicro

     CLmicro    is    BSO's    general-purpose     microprocessor
cross-linkage editor.  It reads files in BSO's relocatable object
format (produced by BSO's relocating cross-assemblers) and  links
these  modules together to produce an absolute load module in any
of several microprocessor manufacturers' output formats.

     CLmicro is normally custom-configured by BSO to default to a
mode  that  the customer expects to use most often.  For example,
if a customer is expected to use CLmicro  to  link  8080  program
modules,  the  version he receives will produce Intel hexadecimal
format output by default.  The customer could, however,  use  the
same  program  to  link  6800  object  modules (produced by BSO's
relocating  6800  assembler),  and  produce  Motorola's  standard
absolute  format.   This variation from default mode operation is
accomplished easily through the use of  simple  commands  to  the
program.

     The input files to the Cross-Linkage Editor fall into  three
categories:   Relocatable  object  modules in standard BSO format
(produced by all BSO relocating cross assemblers), absolute  load
modules  in  any  one  of several standard manufacturers' formats
supported by BSO,  and  object  library  modules  (produced  from
relocatable  modules  by  BSO's  librarian  program).  The output
files consist  of  an  absolute  load  module  in  any  supported
manufacturer's  format and (optionally) a load map, showing where
relocatable sections were loaded in absolute memory,  the  values
of global and (optionally) local symbols, and other information.

     CLmicro, together  with  BSO's  relocating  assemblers  also
support  a  relocatable expression ("Polish fixup") feature which
permits arbitrarily complex expressions (consisting of  absolute,
relocatable,  and  external  global  symbols) to be passed by the
assembler to CLmicro, which then  resolves  the  expressions  and
includes  their  values  where  indicated  in  the  absolute load
module.

     CLmicro includes a  "verb  style"  command  processor  which
allows  the  user  to  specify  parameters  and  instructions via
full-word  commands  to  the  program.   Each  command   may   be
abbreviated  to  its first few letters;  the minimum length of an
acceptable abbreviation for a  command  keyword  is  governed  by
whether  or  not  such  an abbreviation would uniquely define the
command.  For example, two of the command keywords  supported  by
CLmicro  are "INPUT" and "INCLUDE".  The "INPUT" command could be
abbreviated if desired to the letters "INP" or "INPU", or spelled
out,  "INPUT";   the  "INCLUDE"  command  could be abbreviated to
"INC", "INCL", "INCLU",  "INCLUD",  or  spelled  out,  "INCLUDE".
However, the abbreviations "I" or "IN" would be invalid for these
commands, since the  abbreviations  are  ambiguous;   they  could
stand for either "INPUT" or "INCLUDE".
                                                           Page 3


     A typical session with CLmicro could be broken up into three
logical  segments.  The first phase involves the specification of
files to be used in the linking process.  During this phase,  the
user  specifies  the  names  of  all  the input files and all the
output files.  Also during this phase,  CLmicro  checks  for  the
existence  and  validity of each of the input files, and collects
global symbol information for each one.

     The second phase of a CLmicro session involves  the  setting
of  parameters  by  the  user  which govern the base addresses of
program sections, the order in which sections are loaded, and the
formats of the object and map files.

     The final phase is the actual generation of the  object  and
map files.  It occurs automatically, without user intervention.

     Each of  these  segments  is  documented  in  the  following
sections.  A summary of commands appears in Appendix A at the end
of this document.
                                                           Page 4


2.0 PHASE I - FILE SPECIFICATION

     Before beginning phase I of a CLmicro session, the user must
first  run  the  Cross  Linkage  Editor program.  This is done by
typing the command

          -R CLMICR

at monitor level.  CLmicro, in turn, will respond with  a  header
message and a command prompt:

          Cross Linkage Editor version 1A(1)
          Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc.  1979
          (617) 894-7800
          For help type "HELP"

          /

     At this point, CLmicro is waiting for the  user  to  specify
the  names  of  the  files with which it will work.  The commands
applicable  (all  typed  in  response  to  the  "/"  prompt)  are
summarized below:

INPUT filespec[,filespec,filespec,...]

     This command specifies input files for the linkage  process.
     Each  file  listed  is  read immediately in order to collect
     global symbol and section size information;  the  files  are
     also  each  read a second time during phase 3 of the linkage
     process.

     Each file specified can be in any of several  formats.   The
     format   assumed   for   the   file  is  inferred  from  the
     three-character file extension in  the  file  specification.
     The recognized file extensions and their implied formats are
     summarized below:

     Extension      Implied Format
     
     .OBJ           Default absolute format
     .LIB           BSO library format
     .ROB           BSO relocatable format
     (other)        BSO relocatable format

     Note that the "default absolute format" assumed  by  a  .OBJ
     extension is, as explained in section 1.0, a parameter which
     differs for each Cross-Linkage Editor supplied by BSO.   The
     default format can be determined with the "PDEFAULT" command
     (see below).

     Each file specification "filespec" in the command is of  the
     general form:
                                                           Page 5


     dev:filename.ext[ppn]

     where "dev" is a device name (e.g.  "DTA0:" for DECtape unit
     0),  and  can  be  omitted  to use the user's default system
     device;  "[ppn]" is  the  project  programmer  number  (UFD)
     under  which  the  file is stored, and can be omitted to use
     the user's default directory area;   and  "filename.ext"  is
     the  1  to  6  character  filename and 1 to 3 character file
     extension of the file (if extension is  omitted,  ".ROB"  is
     assumed).

     Example:
          /INPUT ABC,DEF,A.LIB,SYS:B.LIB

     This command would specify input load modules ABC.ROB in BSO
     relocatable format, DEF.ROB, also in BSO relocatable format,
     and A.LIB, a library file.  B.LIB  will  be  retrieved  from
     system area.

     As many INPUT commands may be specified as necessary to name
     all  the  input files for the linkage process.  Each command
     must be followed by at least  one  file  specification,  but
     several may also be specified, separated by commas.

INPUT:type filespec[,filespec,filespec...]

     This command functions identically  to  the  typeless  INPUT
     command,  except  that the type of the input files specified
     are declared to  be  type  "type"  (the  argument  following
     "INPUT:"),  rather than being implied by the file extensions
     of the specified files.  In addition,  rather  than  omitted
     extensions  being  assumed  to  be  .ROB,  they  are instead
     assumed to be inferred from the specified type.   Acceptable
     "type"   keywords   (which   may   be   abbreviated  if  the
     abbreviations are unambiguous)  and  their  associated  file
     formats and default file extensions are detailed in Appendix
     B at the end of this manual.

     Example:
          /INPUT:8080 A,B,C.ROB

     This command would cause the absolute modules A.OBJ,  B.OBJ,
     and  C.ROB to be loaded in Intel hex 8080 format.  Note that
     C.ROB is forced to be considered in 8080 format, even though
     it has the ".ROB" which is normally used for BSO relocatable
     object modules.

LIBRARY filespec[,filespec,filespec...]

     This command is functionally equivalent to the INPUT:LIBRARY
     command.   It  loads the specified files, forcing them to be
     of type LIBRARY, regardless of their extensions.
                                                           Page 6


     As with the INPUT:LIBRARY command, the files are assumed  to
     have the extension ".LIB" if this is omitted.

     Example:
          /LIBRARY MATH,FOR.

     would cause MATH.LIB and FOR. (with a null extension) to  be
     loaded in library format.

PDEFAULT

     This command, which takes no arguments, is used  to  request
     that  CLmicro  type  out the current default absolute object
     file format.  This is the format  produced  for  the  output
     object  file and the assumed format for input files with the
     extension ".OBJ" in the INPUT command and all files  in  the
     INPUT:DEFAULT command.

     Example:
          /PDEFAULT
          Default format:  8080

          /

     The output resulting from the PDEFAULT command should always
     be the same for a given distributed version of CLmicro.

OUTPUT filespec

     This command specifies the name of the output file (absolute
     load  module)  to  be  produced by the CLmicro session.  The
     file specification (only one is permitted) is  of  the  same
     form  as  is  described under the INPUT command.  The output
     file is  of  default  absolute  format  and  has  a  default
     extension of ".OBJ".

     Example:
          /OUTPUT PROG

     specifies an output file named PROG.OBJ in default format.

OUTPUT:type filespec

     This command is identical to  the  OUTPUT  command,  but  it
     accepts  an  output object format (type) as well as the name
     of the output file.  This command functions similarly to the
     INPUT:type   command,  except  that  only  absolute  formats
     appearing in Appendix B are valid (i.e.,  OUTPUT:RELOCATABLE
     and  OUTPUT:LIBRARY are illegal commands).  This command can
     be used to specify an output load module in a  format  other
     than the originaly-supplied default absolute format.
                                                           Page 7


     Example:
          /OUTPUT:6800 PROG2

     The above command would create an absolute output file named
     PROG2.OBJ  in  6800  format,  even  if  the default absolute
     format were, for example, 8080 format.

NOOUTPUT

     If no OUTPUT commands are given to CLmicro, the program  can
     operate  in a mode which produces no output load module, but
     still verifies the validity of various parameters given in a
     session  and  possibly  produces  a load map (if requested).
     Once an OUTPUT command is given, the program is then set  up
     to  produce an output file of the specified name and format.
     If the user should make an error in  specifying  his  output
     file,  he can respecify another OUTPUT command to cancel the
     original OUTPUT command and specify a different file or file
     format.   Alternatively,  the  user may decide at some point
     after issuing an OUTPUT command that he really does not want
     an output file after all.  If this is the case, the NOOUTPUT
     command may be specified.  It returns CLmicro to the initial
     condition of having no output object file.

     Example:
          /OUTPUT FOO
          /NOOUTPUT
          /

     In the above sequence of commands, the user first  specified
     an  output  file  in default format called FOO.OBJ, and then
     cancelled the specification by issuing a NOOUTPUT command.

     NOOUTPUT may actually be specified at any time before typing
     the GO command (i.e., any time during phase I or phase II of
     the CLmicro session).

MAP filespec

     This command specifies the  name  of  a  load  map  file  to
     CLmicro.   The  load  map  is  a  text  file which lists the
     locations of the program sections and global symbols in  the
     absolute  load  module developed during the linkage process.
     The load map is produced at the beginning of phase III of  a
     CLmicro session (immediately after the GO command is given).
     The file specification is of the same  format  as  described
     earlier,  and  the  map file has a default file extension of
     ".MAP".

     Example:
          /MAP JOE
                                                           Page 8


     specifies a map file named JOE.MAP.

NOMAP

     The NOMAP command functions like  the  NOOUTPUT  command  in
     that it cancels a previous MAP command.  It may be specified
     any time before the GO command is given.

INCLUDE keyword
EXCLUDE keyword

     The map file output produced by  CLmicro  normally  contains
     the  values  of  global symbols used in the linkage process.
     These two commands may be  used  to  change  what  types  of
     symbols  are  listed  in  the load map (if one is produced).
     The INCLUDE command specifies that the named type of  symbol
     SHOULD  be  included  in the map;  EXCLUDE specifies that it
     should  NOT.   The  keywords  associated  with  INCLUDE  and
     EXCLUDE,  their  defaults with respect to inclusion, and the
     types of symbols they represent are shown below:

     Keyword   Default   Category of symbols
     
     GLOBALS   INCLUDE   Global (intermodule) symbols
     LOCALS    EXCLUDE   Local (module-specific) symbols
     ZERO      INCLUDE   Symbols from zero-length modules (see text)
     ALL       see text  All symbols

     Notes on above:

     1- The keyword "ZERO" refers  to  those  symbols  which  are
     defined  in  modules  which  generate no code, i.e., modules
     which contain only symbol definitions.  The action  of  this
     keyword  is  to some degree dependent on what other keywords
     are supplied.  In particular, "INCLUDE ZERO" does not  force
     all  local  symbols  from  zero-length modules when "EXCLUDE
     LOCALS" has been specified.  The  main  use  of  the  "ZERO"
     keyword  is in the "EXCLUDE ZERO" command.  It would cause a
     symbol to excluded from the load map  if  that  symbol  were
     defined in a module which generated no code but only defined
     symbols.

     2- The keyword "ALL"  implies  all  of  the  above-mentioned
     categories,  and  its  default is really neither INCLUDE nor
     EXCLUDE.  The command "INCLUDE ALL" would cause ALL types of
     symbols  to  be  included  in  the  load  map;   the command
     "EXCLUDE ALL" would cause NO symbols to be included.

     Examples:
          /INCLUDE LOCALS
          /EXCLUDE ZERO
          /
                                                           Page 9


     In the above sequence of commands, a user specifies that his
     load  map should include local symbols from each module, but
     that no symbols from zero-length modules should  be  printed
     in the load map.

PASS keyword
NOPASS keyword

     When the absolute file produced by a CLmicro session  is  to
     be  used  with one of BSO's symbolic simulator/debuggers, it
     is desirable to include a program symbol table with the load
     module  to  make  debugging  easier at simulation time.  The
     PASS and NOPASS commands control what types of  symbols,  if
     any,  are  to  be  included  at the end of the absolute load
     module.  The keyword argument is either "LOCALS", "GLOBALS",
     or  "ALL".  The default (initial) condition is "NOPASS ALL",
     which says to not put any symbol definitions in  the  output
     file.   The  PASS command may be used to specify which types
     are to be included ("LOCALS" for  local  symbols,  "GLOBALS"
     for  global  symbols,  "ALL"  for  all  symbols  (local  and
     global).   NOPASS  complements  PASS  and  can  be  used  to
     counteract previously-specified erroneous PASS commands.

     Example:
          /PASS ALL

     This command causes a specially-formatted  symbol  table  of
     all  module symbols, local and global, to be appended to the
     end of the absolute load module.  This  special  format  can
     then be read by a BSO symbolic simulator/debugger later on.
                                                          Page 10


3.0 PHASE II - PARAMETER ADJUSTMENTS

     After the CLmicro user specifies all his files, he may  then
optionally  type  a  series of commands to tell the Cross Linkage
Editor where and in  what  order  his  program  sections  may  be
loaded.   In  addition  to  commands  for  modifying  parameters,
commands exist to type out current parameter values.

     The commands used during this phase are described below:

PRINT section-name

     This command is used to print information about  a  specific
     program section.  The command argument, "section-name", is a
     one to six character name of a program  section  which  must
     exist  in  at  lease  of the modules which were read in
     during phase I.

     Example:
          /PRINT RAMSEC
          RAMSEC  R Base=0100   Length=00BC  Float

          /

     The output includes the following:

     1- The name of the section being  printed,  RAMSEC  in  this
     case.

     2-  A  one-letter  code  indicating  the  type  of   section
     (A=Absolute, R=Relocatable, Z=Page Zero Relocatable).

     3- The current base address of the section.

     4- The current length (in bytes) of the section.

     5- The current position status of the section.  This is  one
     of   three   words:    "Fixed"   indicates  the  section  is
     relocatable or page zero relocatable and has been  requested
     for  loading at a fixed absolute address with a BASE command
     (see below).  "Float" indicates the section  is  relocatable
     or  page zero relocatable and currently "floats" in absolute
     memory to immediately follow the section loaded  before  it.
     The  order  of  loading of sections can be changed;  see the
     "ORDER" command, below.  Finally, the word "Abs" is  printed
     for  absolute sections to indicate that their base locations
     are not movable under any circumstances.

PRINT

     The PRINT command with no argument is similar to  the  PRINT
     command followed by a section name, except that it lists ALL
                                                          Page 11


     program sections, in the order they  are  currently  loaded.
     This command can be used to aid the user in specifying ORDER
     and BASE commands.

     Example:
          /PRINT
          .ABS.   A Base=0000   Length=0010  Abs
          .MAIN.  R Base=0100   Length=0108  Fixed
          SUBS    R Base=0208   Length=004C  Float
          RAM     R Base=2000   Length=010A  Fixed
          
          /

     The output produced by this command  is  identical  to  that
     produced  by  the  PRINT command with arguments, except that
     several sections are listed.

BASE section-name=address[,section-name=address,...]

     This command  tells  CLmicro  that  section  "section-name",
     which  must  be  a  relocatable  or  page  zero  relocatable
     section,  is  to  be  loaded  at  fixed  address  "address".
     Initially, all relocatable sections are loaded at "floating"
     addresses  (they  immediately  follow  the  sections  loaded
     before  them).   This command could be used, for example, to
     see to it that all RAM code (which was previously  assembled
     into a specific section) was loaded starting at the physical
     start of RAM addressing space.

     Example:
          /BASE RAM=0100

     might perform a function like the one just  described.   All
     code  in  relocatable  section  "RAM"  would  be  loaded  in
     absolute memory starting at location 0100.

FLOAT section-name[,section-name,...]

     This command informs CLmicro that the  named  section(s)  is
     (are)  to  be  "floated"  in  absolute  memory  as described
     earlier.  This is the initial condition for all  relocatable
     sections,  and  this  command  is  provided  to counteract a
     previously-given erroneous BASE command.

     Example:
          /FLOAT XYZ

     This command specifies that section XYZ is to be floated  in
     absolute memory instead of being fixed with a BASE command.

ORDER section-name,section-name[,section-name,...]

     Initially,  program  sections  are  ordered  by  CLmicro  as
     follows:   All absolute sections are loaded first into their
     respective  absolute  locations.   Page   zero   relocatable
     sections  follow  at  floating  addresses starting after the
     last byte of absolute code;  the  order  of  these  sections
     depends  on  the  order in which they were loaded with INPUT
     commands and is somewhat indeterminant  as  such.   Finally,
     relocatable  sections  follow page zero relocatable sections
     at floating addresses starting at the end of the  last  byte
     of  page  zero  relocatable  code.   Again, section ordering
     among relocatable sections is  dependent  on  the  order  in
     which the sections are seen at input time.

     The user may often wish to change  this  order  to  fit  the
     needs of the system being developed.  This is the purpose of
     the ORDER command.  It  takes  as  an  argument  a  list  of
     section  names  in the order the user wishes the sections to
     be loaded.  Normally, the  user  will  specify  all  program
     sections  in  one ORDER command.  However, if several groups
     of sections are to be arranged, each starting  at  different
     physical base addresses, several ORDER commands may be used.
     The sections named are placed in the  specified  order,  and
     then  the  newly-ordered group of sections are placed at the
     beginning of any sections not specified in the command.  Any
     sections not specified are thus left in their original order
     following the sections specified in this command.

     Example:
          /ORDER RAM1,RAM2
          /ORDER ROM1,ROM2
          /BASE RAM1=0000,ROM1=1000

     The command sequence above  might  be  used  by  a  user  to
     logically group two sections of ROM code and two sections of
     RAM code, and then specify  base  addresses  for  the  first
     section  of  each  type.   The  second  section of each type
     (i.e.,  RAM2  and  ROM2)  would   immediately   follow   its
     predecessor  at  a  floating  address,  since  no  BASE  was
     specified for it.

     The PRINT command (with no argument) is extremely useful  in
     aiding  users  of  the  ORDER  command,  since  it  displays
     sections in their currently-loaded order.

4.0 MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS

     CLmicro has several additional commands which cannot  easily
be classified as part of phase I or phase II.  They are:

EXIT

     This command causes  CLmicro  to  return  to  the  operating
     system and abort any current operation.

     Example:
          /EXIT


HELP

     This command will print a short summary of commands, similar
     in content to Appendix A of this manual.

RADIX keyword

     Initially, numbers  typed  out  by  the  PRINT  command  are
     printed  in  hexadecimal  radix, and numbers typed in to the
     BASE command are assumed to be hexadecimal  as  well.   This
     may  be  changed  to  decimal (base 10) or octal (base 8) by
     using the RADIX command.  It takes one argument, a  keyword,
     which  is  either  "HEXADECIMAL"  for base 16, "DECIMAL" for
     base 10, or "OCTAL" for  base  8.   These  keywords  may  be
     abbreviated to one letter.

     Examples:
          /RADIX DECIMAL or RADIX D
          /RADIX H or HEXADECIMAL

     These two commands change the radix to decimal and  back  to
     hexadecimal,  respectively.   The  radix may be changed with
     this command as often as is desired.

RESET

     If the user  has  typed  several  commands  to  CLmicro  and
     decides  to  start  over  again,  he  may  type this command
     instead of exiting CLmicro and re-executing the program.  It
     essentially restarts the CLmicro program from the beginning,
     but does not reprint CLmicro's signon message.  An  implicit
     RESET is done after the completion of a linkage session.
                                                          Page 14


5.0 PHASE III - THE ACTUAL LINKAGE PROCESS

     Once the user is  satisfied  with  the  parameters  he  sets
during  phase  II,  he  types the command "GO" to tell CLmicro to
begin acting on the commands typed during phase I and  phase  II.
The go command has no arguments:
          /GO

     The "GO" command signifies the start of phase III, which  is
non-interactive.   The  cross  linkage  editor  proceeds  to link
together the specified files, inform the user of any errors,  and
produce  (if  requested)  map  and/or output object module.  When
done, CLmicro prints the message:

          ** Linkage complete **

and then reprompts for more commands.  At this  point,  the  user
has the option of doing another linkage with new files or exiting
the linkage editor by typing EXIT or control/Z.
                                                          Page 15


6.0 INDIRECT COMMANDS

     A user of CLmicro may frequently find  himself  linking  the
same  sequence  of  modules  together  to produce the same output
file(s) with the same set  of  parameters  very  frequently.   In
cases  like this, it often becomes cumbersome to have to type the
same sequence of commands over and over for  each  usage  of  the
program.

     In order  to  make  the  process  easier,  CLmicro  supports
indirect  (batch)  command  files,  which allow the user to put a
sequence of commonly-used  CLmicro  commands  in  a  file,  which
CLmicro can then read in lieu of terminal input at linkage time.

     A command file, which can be  created  and/or  edited  using
standard  system  editor utilities, may be executed by CLmicro by
typing a command of the form
          /@filespec

     This causes the file named in "filespec" (which has in  this
case a default extension of ".CMD") to be read by CLmicro and the
commands contained therein to be processed as if they  came  from
the user's terminal.  Once finished with this file, the user once
again has control over CLmicro, and may type more  commands  from
his  terminal,  if  desired.   Indirect  command  files  may  not
currently be nested;  that  is,  no  indirect  command  file  may
contain an "@" command.
