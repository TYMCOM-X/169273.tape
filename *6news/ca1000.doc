                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

To run the 1000 cross assembler, at the monitor level type:

     -R CA1000      _ ______

The assembler will respond with the following:

     Texas Instruments TMS 1000 series Cross Assembler Version 2(7)
     Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc. 1976
     (617) 894-7800

     *

At the asterisk, type:

     *PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________________

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST  are  the  object  and  listing  files  the
assembler  will  create  and PROG.SRC is the source program being
assembled.  If specific file name extensions are desired they may
be  entered.  File name extensions must be entered;  there are no
defaults.  The filenames PROG.OBJ, PROG.SRC and PROG.LST are used
for  example  purposes  only.   Any  acceptable  file  names  and
extensions desired may be used.

If either the object or listing file is not desired, they may  be
omitted   from  the  specification,  as  the  following  examples
illustrate:

     *PROG.OBJ=PROG.SRC      _________________

     *,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC       _________________

Note that the comma is required when a listing  file  is  desired
but not an object file.

2.0 PRINTING AND PUNCHING OUTPUT FILES    ________ ___ ________ ______ _____

The listing file is in ASCII format and may be typed as follows:

     -TYPE PROG.LST          On your terminal      ____ ________

     -LIST TTY:=PROG.LST     On your terminal, page formatted      ____ _____________

The default object file format is an  ASCII  file  and  this  can
punched with the following command:

     -TYPE PROG.OBJ          On your terminal, if so equipped      ____ ________

Object and listing files may also be printed or punched  at  your
local Tymshare branch office;  contact your salesman for details.

3.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION    ______ _______ ___________

PROGRAM ENTRY

Source programs may be placed on the host computer disk either by
the  use of a text editor to build new programs, or by reading in
an existing file from paper tape, magtape, etc.  Once  a  program
resides on disk a text editor may be used to alter or correct the
file in preparation for assembly.  Line numbers must  be  removed
before assembly.


PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source statement consists of  strings  of  ASCII  characters
(fields)   terminated   by   a   carriage   return - line   feed.
Statements, or lines, of more  than  90  characters  will  appear
truncated  in  the  listing file but will be assembled correctly.
Lines beginning with an asterisk (*) will be treated as comments.
Blank lines will be ignored.  Each source statement is made up of
four fields:  the label, instruction, operand and comment fields,
which are defined below.

Label Field - A statement label consists of up to  6  characters,_____ _____
the  first  of which must be alphabetic and appear in column one.
Remaining characters may be alpha or numeric.  A label identifies
a  particular  location  in  the program and should not duplicate
another label or one of the assembler's permanent symbols,  which
include all of the instruction mnemonics and pseudo ops.

The label field is optional except in statements with an  EQU  or
MACRO statement.

Instruction Field - The instruction field must contain either  an___________ _____
instruction  mnemonic,  a pseudo op or the name of a user defined
macro (i.e., a macro call).  This field must  be  separated  from
any  preceding  label  field by at least one space or tab and may
not start in column one.

Operand Field - The operand field, if required, may consist of  a_______ _____
symbol previously defined by an EQU statement, a symbol used as a
label or a decimal number.  This field must be separated from the
instruction field by at least one space or tab.

Comment Field - This field is optional;  it will  appear  on  the_______ _____
assembly  listing  but  will  be  ignored  by the assembler.  The
comment field should be separated from the operand  field  by  at
least one space or tab.

4.0 INSTRUCTION SET    ___________ ___

The following mnemonics represent the instruction  set  supported
by  this  cross assembler.  a detailed explanation of each may be
obtained  by  referring  to  the  microprocessor   manufacturer's

5.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO-OPS)    _________ __________

This cross assembler  recognizes  the  following  pseudo-ops.   A
detailed  explanation of each may be obtained by referring to the
microprocessor manufacturer's programming manual and chapters 6.0
and 7.0 of this manual.

          BL
          CALLL
          EJECT
          END
          ENDM
          EQU
          MACRO
          OPTION
          ORG
          PAGE
          SPACE
          TITLE
                                                          Page 10


6.0 MACRO STATEMENTS    _____ __________

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by just writing the macro  name
in the instruction field.  This makes it possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

MNAME     MACRO     DUM1,DUM2,...
            .
            .
          ENDM

where MNAME is the name of the macro and DUM1,DUM2,...  are dummy
argument  names  (if  any).  Dummy argument names have no meaning
outside a macro definition.  Within the macro definition they may
appear  anywhere  (in  any  field) and all occurrences of a dummy                                       ___
argument will be replaced by the actual argument strings when the
macro  is  used.  It should be noted that spaces or tabs trailing
the final argument in both the  definition  and  call  statements
will be taken as part of that argument.  To avoid this, the first
character after the last argument in  each  statement  should  be
either a CR-LF or a semicolon.

Macro definitions may not be nested.  The macro body may  contain
the  words  MACRO  or  ENDM.   A macro may contain calls to other
macros.

Macro calls are of the form:

LABEL:    MNAME     ARG1,ARG2,...

where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual  arguments  (ARG1,ARG2,...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
commas.   Arguments omitted from a macro call are treated as null
strings;  extra arguments are ignored.  Notice that arguments can
be  expressions,  instruction  mnemonics,  comments or labels for
statements inside the macro expansion.  The  macro  processor  is
only  concerned  with  character  strings, which it passes to the
rest of the assembler.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 11


MACRO EXAMPLES


*  Macro definition for zeroing 16 digit register

CLEAR     MACRO     XX,LABEL
          LDX       XX
          TCY       15
          CLA
LABL      TAM
          DYN
          BR        LABL
          ENDM
*
*  Macro call to clear register 3
          CLEAR     3,LABL3
*  Notice that each macro call must use a different
*  label name, or there will be multiple definition of labels.
                                                          Page 12


7.0 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY    ___________ ________

The IF pseudo op is useful for producing several  versions  of  a
program  from  the  same  source  file.   The  operand  of  an IF
directive is evaluated, and, if it is  zero,  all  the  following
statements  will  be  ignored until a matching ENDIF statement is
found.  If the operand is not zero, the following statements will
assemble normally.

Example of a conditional section of code:


        IF      VER-1   ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE   EQU     6
        ENDIF
        IF      VER     ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE   EQU     8
        ENDIF
                                                          Page 13


8.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT    ______ ____ ______

The object file produced by the CA1000 cross assembler is a  card
image  file  which  specifies  the  contents of an entire 1K ROM.
Each line defines 17 consecutive ROM locations in  the  following
manner:

      Columns      1-3:  ROM location of first data byte on card.
      Columns      4-5:  Checksum
      Columns        6:  Flag - always 0
      Columns     7-12:  6 character title from TITLE card.
      Columns    13-80:  17 4 character data bytes, representing
                         the contents of 17 consecutive bytes 
                         of ROM.
                         The first 2 characters are zero for 
                         each byte.

The checksum is calculated as the negative of the sum of 17  data
bytes and 2 address bytes on the line.
                                                          Page 14


9.0 ERROR HANDLING    _____ ________

The cross assembler will  print  error  messages  at  the  user's
terminal  and  on  the  program  listing  if the listing file was
requested in the specification.  Errors are indicated by  one  or
more  characters  at  the  left of the listing line in which they
occured.  In all cases the assembler  will  attempt  to  generate
some  code  for  each  source line so addresses further on in the
program do not get out of phase.  This also allows for a location
into which a patch may be inserted if the object tape is used for
debugging, even with its errors.


ERROR CODES

F - Format error.   Usually  caused  by  ending  the  operand  or
    instruction field with an unexpected character.

M - Multiple definition error.  Either the same symbol  was  used
    to  identify  two  different statements, or a statement label
    was the same as an instruction mnemonic.  The assembler  will
    always   use   the  first  definition.   (the  EQU  assembler
    directive can define the same symbol more than  once  without
    error.)

N - Nesting error.   Caused  by  improperly  paired  IF:ENDIF  or
    MACRO:ENDM directives.

O - Overflow.  More than 64 instructions on one ROM page, or page
    number exceeds size of ROM in ORG or PAGE pseudo-ops.

P - Phase error.  A statement label is not at the  same  location
    in  pass  2  as it was in pass 1.  Usually caused by previous
    error or a macro call to a macro before it was defined.

Q - Questionable  syntax.   Misspelled  or  omitted   instruction
    field.

U - Undefined symbol used in expression.  Value used  for  symbol
    is zero.

V - Value error.  Value of symbol or constant is  too  large  for
    operand field.

10.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES     __ __ ___________

The CA1000 cross  assembler  is  basically  compatible  with  the
assembler  described in Texas Instrument's Programmer's Reference
Manual for the standard instruction set of the  TMS  1000,  1200,               ________ ___________ ___
1070   and   1270   microprocessors.   However,  there  are  some
differences which are summarized below:

     1.  The following features conform to BSO standards and  may
         conflict   with   similar   features   offered   by  the
         manufacturer.

                (A)  Macro Processing
                (B)  Conditional Assembly Directives
                (C)  Listing Control
                (D)  Relocation Directives and Control


     2.  Only the standard  instruction  set  is  avaiable.   The
         INSTRUCTIONS assembler directive is not processed.

     3.  Assembler directives which affect the simulator are  not
         processed (FETCH, TRACE and NOTRACE).

     4.  Labels and other symbols must be unique in  their  first
         six characters.  (Texas Instruments allows eight.)


Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
