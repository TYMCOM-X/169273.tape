                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Please feel free to call  the  sales  department  of  the  Boston
Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

To run the F8 cross assembler, at the monitor level type:

     -R CAF8      _ ____

The assembler will respond with the following:

     F8 Cross Assembler Version 2(6)
     Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc. 1975
     (617) 894-7800
     *
At the asterisk, type:

     *PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________________

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST  are  the  object  and  listing  files  the
assembler  will  create  and PROG.SRC is the source program being
assembled.  If file name extensions are  desired,  they  must  be
specified  explicitly;   there  are  no  defaults.  The filenames
PROG.OBJ;  PROG.SRC and PROG.LST are used  for  example  purposes
only.   Any  acceptable  file names and extensions desired may be
used.

If either the object or listing file is not desired,  it  may  be
omitted   from  the  specification,  as  the  following  examples
illustrate:

     *PROG.OBJ=PROG.SRC      _________________

     *,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________

Note that the comma is required when a listing  file  is  desired
but not an object file.

The listing file is in ASCII format and may be typed  or  printed
as follows:

    -TYPE PROG.LST              On your terminal     ____ ________

    -LIST TTY:=PROG.LST         On your terminal,     ____ _____________
                                        page formatted

The default object file format is an ASCII file and this  can  be
punched with the following command:

    -TYPE PROG.OBJ              On your terminal, if so     ____ ________
                                equipped

The object and listing files may be printed or  punched  at  your
local branch office;  contact your salesman for details.
                                                           Page 6


2.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION    ______ _______ ___________

PROGRAM ENTRY

Source programs may be placed on the host computer disk either by
the  use of a text editor to build new programs, or by reading in
an existing file from paper tape, magtape, etc.  Once  a  program
resides on disk a text editor may be used to alter or correct the
file in preparation for assembly.  It is not necessary to  remove
line  numbers  from  a  file before assembly;  the assembler will
ignore them if they are present.


PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source statement consists of  strings  of  ASCII  characters
(fields)   terminated   by   a   carriage   return - line   feed.
Statements, or lines, of more  than  90  characters  will  appear
truncated  in  the  listing file but will be assembled correctly.
Lines beginning with an asterisk (*) will be treated as comments.
Blank  lines  and  lines with only a label field will generate no
code.  Any label on such a line will  be  assigned  to  the  next
available address.

Each source statement is made up  of  four  fields:   the  label,
instruction, operand and comment fields, which are defined below.

Label Field - A statement label consists of up to  6  characters,_____ _____
the  first  of which must be alphabetic and appear in column one.
The remaining characters may be alphabetic or numeric.   A  label
identifies  a  particular  location in the program and should not
duplicate another label  or  one  of  the  assembler's  permanent
symbols,  which  include  all  of  the  instruction mnemonics and
pseudo ops.

The label field is optional except  in  statements  with  an  EQU
instruction.

Instruction Field - The instruction field must contain either  an___________ _____
instruction  mnemonic,  a pseudo op or the name of a user defined
macro (i.e., a macro call).  The field must be separated from the
preceding  label  field  by at least one space or tab and may not
start in column one.

Operand Field - The operand field, if required, should consist of_______ _____
either  a  user  defined  symbol or a decimal number.  This field
must be separated from the instuction field by at least one space
or tab.

Comment Field - This field is optional;  it will  appear  on  the_______ _____
assembly  listing  but will be ignored by the assembler.  It must
be separated from the instruction field by either an operand plus
a space (or tab) or by two tabs.
                                                           Page 7


EXPRESSIONS

Expressions can be made up of symbols and constants, both numeric
and  ASCII.  These may be combined by the use of the operators +,
-, * and /.  Expressions will be evaluated  from  left  to  right
without  regard  for  operator  hierarchy.   Parentheses  are not
allowed.

Symbols - Any alphanumeric  symbol  which  has  been  used  as  a_______
statement  label  or  equated  to  a  value  may  be  used  in an
expression.  The symbol * may be used to indicate the location of
the  first byte of the current instruction.  Care should be taken
not to confuse its use with that of the multiply  operator,  also
indicated by an asterisk.

Numeric Constants - Numbers may be specified  as  binary,  octal,_______ _________
decimal  or  hexadecimal constants.  To do this the number should
be enclosed in apostrophes and preceded by a character indicating
the radix used, as shown in the following examples:

         B - binary                     (e.g., B'0101')
         O - octal                      (e.g., O'015')
         D - decimal                    (e.g., D'19')
         H - hexadecimal                (e.g., H'F8')


There should  be  no  embedded  blanks  within  the  apostrophes.
Numbers  without  any  indication  of  radix  (no  letters and no                                                           ___
apostrophes, e.g., 174 ) will be treated as decimal numbers.

ASCII Constants - An ASCII constant is represented by the  letter_____ _________
"C"  followed by a character string enclosed in apostrophes.  The
string may contain  any  of  the  characters  with  octal  values
between 40 (space) and 137 (backarrow).  For example, C'NAME'.

Timer Counts - The letter "T" followed by  a  decimal  number  in_____ ______
apostrophes  will be assembled as a constant which will cause the
F8 timers to delay for  the  specified  number  of  counts.   For
example, T'128' will cause a delay of 128 counts.

4.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO OPS)    _________ __________ _______ ____

This cross assembler recognizes  the  following  pseudo  ops.   A
detailed  explanation of each may be obtained by referring to the
microprocessor manufacturer's programming manual.


          DC
          END
          ENDIF
          EQU
          IF
          ORG
          MACRO
          MEND

                                                          Page 10


5.0 MACRO STATEMENTS    _____ __________

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by just writing the macro  name
in the instruction field.  This makes it possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

MNAME     MACRO   &DUM1,&DUM2,...
            .
            .
          MEND

where MNAME is the name of  the  macro  and  &DUM1,&DUM2...   are
dummy  argument  names  (if  any).   Dummy argument names have no
meaning outside a macro definition.  Within the macro  definition
they  may appear anywhere (in any field) and all occurrences of a                                             ___
dummy argument will be replaced by the  actual  argument  strings
when  the  macro is used.  It should be noted than spaces or tabs
trailing the final argument in both the definition and  the  call
statements  will  be  taken  as  part of that argument.  To avoid
this, the first character after the last argument in each  should
be either a CR-LF or a comma.

Macro definitions may be nested.  The macro body may contain  the
words MACRO or MEND.  A macro may contain calls to other macros.

Macro calls are of the form:

LABEL     MNAME   ARG1 ARG2 ...

where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual   arguments  (ARG1,ARG2...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
spaces  (or  tabs).  Actual arguments to a macro call are treated
as null strings;   extra  arguments  are  ignored.   Notice  that
arguments  can be expressions, instruction mnemonics, comments or
labels for statements inside  the  macro  expansion.   The  macro
processor  is  only  concerned  with  character strings, which it
passes to the rest of the assembler.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 11


MACRO EXAMPLES


          MACRO           WAIT 4 MACHINE CYCLES
          PAUSE
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          MEND




          MACRO           BUILD 4 CHARACTER TABLE ENTRIES
          ENTRY   &A &B &C &D &VALUE
          DC      C'&A'
          DC      C'&B'
          DC      C'&C'
          DC      C'&D'
          DC      &VALUE
          MEND


An example of a macro call to build entry WXYZ using  the  second
example above:

WXYZ      ENTRY   W X Y Z 27


This would result in the following expansion:

          DC      C'W'
          DC      C'X'
          DC      C'Y'
          DC      C'Z'
          DC      27
                                                          Page 12


6.0 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY    ___________ ________

Portions of a program can be assembled or not depending upon  the
value  of  an  expression.  This is accomplished by preceding the
conditional section of code with a statement  containing  the  IF
pseudo  op  and  the  expression  to  be evaluated and ending the
section with the pseudo op ENDIF.  This is useful  for  producing
several versions of the same program from a single source file by
changing only one parameter.

The expression following the IF pseudo op will  be  evaluated  by
the assembler and the results compared to zero.  If the result is
not zero the code will be assembled.  If the result is zero,  all
the  code up to the next ENDIF statement is ignored.  Conditional
statements may be nested to any depth.




Example of a conditional section of code:


          IF      VER-1   DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE     EQ 6
          ENDIF
          IF      VER     DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE     EQU     8
          ENDIF
                                                          Page 13


7.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT    ______ ____ ______

The object file produced by this cross assembler is an ASCII file
in  the  format  specified  by  Fairchild for the F8.  The record
layout is as shown below:

First line        S         Start of file
                  4 chars   Load addresss of first date byte

Data lines        X         Record mark
                 16 chars   8 data bytes, padded with zeros if
                            necessary
                  1 char    checksum

Last line         *         End of file

The checksum is the sum of the 16 data  characters  with  carries
ignored.

A sample object file is shown in Section 10.0.

8.0 ERROR HANDLING    _____ ________

The cross assembler will  print  error  messages  at  the  user's
terminal  and  on  the  program  listing  if the listing file was
requested in the specification.  Errors are indicated by  one  or
more  characters  at  the  left of the listing line in which they
occured.  In all cases the assembler  will  attempt  to  generate
some  code  for  each  source line so addresses further on in the
program do not get out of phase.  This also allows for a location
into which a patch may be inserted if the object tape is used for
debugging, even with its errors.


ERROR CODES

A - Address error.  Address expression too large for  the  number
    of  bits  in  the address field or instruction (8 or 16) or a
    branch further than 128  bytes.   Address  is  truncated  and
    used.

D - Macro Definition Error.   The  definition  is  ignored.   The
    error is caused by one of the following conditions:

          1) The MACRO statement does not have a label

          2) The MACRO statement has over ten arguments

E - Expression error.  Poorly constructed expression or use of an
    instruction  mnemonic in an expression.  The latter case will
    contribute a one byte value to the expression  in  case  that
    was really intended.

F - Format error.  Usually caused by terminating the  operand  or
    instruction field with an unexpected character.

I - Illegal character.  Occurs if a digit in a number  is  larger
    than the radix specified (e.g., O'98').

L - Improper operands for an LR instruction.

M - Multiple definition of symbol.  Either the  same  symbol  was
    used  to  label two different statements or a statement label
    is the same as an instruction mnemonic.  The  assembler  will
    always  use  the  first  value  of  a label which is defined.
    (Note:  the EQU pseudo op can define  the  same  symbol  more
    than once without error.)

N - Nesting error.   Caused  by  improperly  paired  IF:ENDIF  or
    MACRO:ENDM or by a missing delimiter in a constant.

P - Phase error.  A statement label is not at the  same  location
    in assembler pass 2 as it was in pass 1.

Q - Questionable syntax.  Caused by leaving out or misspelling an
    instruction.

U - Undefined  symbol.   An  undefined  symbol  was  used  in  an
    expression.  A value of zero was used for the symbol.

V - Value of the operand is not within  the  limits  allowed  for
    this instruction.  The value will be truncated and used.

9.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES    _______ __ ___________

This cross assembler is compatible with the one supplied for  the
F8  by  Fairchild  with  a few exceptions.  However, BSO makes no
claim of  compatibility  between  its  cross  assembler  and  the
version  supplied  by  Mostek  for  its  F8  microprocessor.  The
following differences exist between this cross assembler and  the
one produced by Fairchild:



     1.  The following features conform to BSO standards and  may
         conflict   with   similar   features   offered   by  the
         manufacturer.

          (A)  Macro Processing
          (B)  Conditional Assembly Directives
          (C)  Listing Control
          (D)  Relocation Directives and Control

     2.  A symbol may have up to six characters.

     3.  The pseudo ops BASE, EJECT, MAXCPU,  SYMBOL,  TITLE  and
         XREF have not been implemented.

     4.  A sorted symbol table is always appended to the  listing
         file.

     5.  Statements may not be continued from  one  line  to  the
         next.

     6.  Expressions are evaluated from  left  to  right  without
         regard  for  operator  precedence.   Parentheses are not
         permitted.

     7.  Macros must be defined before they are used.

     8.  Conditional assemblies of several versions of one source
         program are allowed.

Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
