Introduction


                             INTRODUCTION


      TELECOPY is a program for transferring the contents of files
      between TYMCOM-IX, -X, and -370 operating systems.  This
      document describes how to use TELECOPY on the TYMCOM-IX and
      TYMCOM-X systems.

      TELECOPY uses TYMNET to log into the target, or remote, system.
      The user name that will be logged into is the same as the one
      that is logged into by the user that is running TELECOPY.  Thus,
      once a circuit has been built by TYMNET, the user begins to
      accrue connect time and other system resources on both the
      system running TELECOPY (the TELECOPY "controller") and the
      target system.

      The TELECOPY controller communicates with a slave program on the
      target system, hereafter referred to as the TELECOPY "slave".
      The controller and slave send commands and data to each other
      over the circuit built by TYMNET.  The user need not be familiar
      with this protocol, and in fact will never see any part of it
      during the running of the program.

Conventions


                             CONVENTIONS


      In this manual, (cr) is used to indicate that a carriage return
      must be typed.  Brackets "[]" are used to enclose optional user
      input.  Braces "{}" are used to denote that the user must type
      one of the operands enclosed within the braces.

      In a command form, the minimum abbreviation for a command or
      operand name on the TYMCOM-X is indicated by the use of
      uppercase letters.  On the TYMCOM-IX, the mininum abbreviation
      is always the first three characters of a command.

      A string of characters appearing entirely in lowercase indicates
      that the user must type information of the type described in the
      command form or command description.

Entering TELECOPY


                          ENTERING TELECOPY


      The user enters TELECOPY from the Executive level in either of
      the following ways:

      -TELECOPY(cr)         on TYMCOM-IX systems

      -R TELECOPY(cr)       on TYMCOM-X systems

      On the TYMCOM-X, TELECOPY may be abbreviated to TELECO.

      Commands will be taken from the terminal and messages will be
      directed to the terminal.  On the TYMCOM-IX system, input may be
      taken from a command file, but output will always be directed to
      the terminal.

      On the TYMCOM-X system, the user may create a .TMP or .COM file
      containing the commands.  There are two ways of initiating input
      from a command file.  The first requires that the file be named
      XXXTEL.TMP or XXXTEL.COM, where XXX is the PJOB number as typed
      by the PJOB command, with sufficient leading zeroes as required.
      Several jobs logged into the same user name may use different
      command files, each with its own PJOB number.  Input from the
      command file may be initiated by entering TELECOPY as follows:

      -GET (SYS)TELECO(cr)

      -REE(cr)

      TELECOPY will then begin execution, taking commands from the
      .TMP or .COM file, until it reaches a QUIT command or
      end-of-file.  Furthermore, TELECOPY will run detached if the
      command file has the .COM extension.  In this case, terminal
      output may be found in a command output file named XXXTEL.OUT.
      TELECOPY will continue to run detached until it reaches a QUIT
      command or end-of-file, when the job will log itself out.

      The second method of initiating input from a command file on the
      TYMCOM-X is simply to enter TELECOPY in the usual way and give
      the COMMANDS command, as described later in the TELECOPY
      COMMANDS section.

      When input is from a command file, questions requiring a YES/NO
      type of response may not always be anticipated.  The user is
      advised to include a REPLACE or KEEP command at the beginning of
      the command file, as described later.

Transmission Modes


                          TRANSMISSION MODES


      TELECOPY may select from a number of transmission modes.  This
      is done automatically based on type of target system and type of
      controller system.  The user may override the automatic
      selection by use of the MODE command.  The transmission modes
      currently defined are listed below.


ASCII     Data is translated to external ASCII for transmission.  This
          mode is common for transfer of symbolic files between
          dissimilar machine types (see the table at the end of this
          section).  Compressed blanks are expanded.  Tabs are
          expanded using standardized tab stops.  The TYMCOM-370 and
          TYMCOM-IX, having no known tab settings, will not expand
          tabs.  Line numbers imbedded in files created by TYMCOM-X
          LNED and EDIT10 are stripped out.  NULs and RUBOUTs are
          discarded.  Lowercase is converted to uppercase, unless the
          ONLC command has been issued.

EBCDIC    Like ASCII except that internal data is translated to EBCDIC
          for transmission.

BINARY    Bytes from the donor file are unpacked from the donor word
          using one set of binary parameters and packed at the
          receiving end using another set of binary parameters.
          Parameters that may be user-selected are:  (1) bytesize
          (generally 7 or 8 bits); (2) blocking, that is, the number
          of bytes per machine word; and (3) left or right fill,
          indicating how the bytes are to be assembled or disassembled
          from the machine word.  Any unused bits in the receiving
          word are zeroed.

          Binary mode transmits only the contents of a file, without
          regard for record boundaries.  A file is thought to contain
          a single variable length record, with additional records
          added by the filing system if and only if the maximum size
          for a record is exceeded.

          Two modes--SERIAL and NATIVE modes--are special cases of
          binary transmission.

          SERIAL   In SERIAL mode, data is transmitted bitwise from
                   the donor file and stored sequentially bitwise in
                   the receiving file.  Bytes will cross word
                   boundaries if word length is not evenly divisible
                   by 8 bits.  While this mode is least confusing
                   conceptually, it may not be useful to existing
                   software, especially on the TYMCOM-X.  For this
                   reason, the blocking and unblocking parameters have
                   been added to binary mode.

TELECOPY USER'S GUIDE                                           Page 5
Transmission Modes


          NATIVE   NATIVE mode is the mode that identical machine
                   types use for transmitting files.  This binary mode
                   has its own name to relieve the user of the
                   requirement of knowing the binary parameters most
                   suited to a particular machine.

BINARY UPDATE

          When copying onto an old file, the donor and receiver agree
          on a blocksize (typically 1 disk block) and exchange
          checksums for each block in the file.  A 69-bit checksum
          algorithm is used to help prevent false matches.  Instead of
          transferring all of the data in the file, TELECOPY sends
          only the blocks in the file which are different.  This
          greatly speeds up the transfer of files that were modified
          in a random fashion.  It may prove somewhat slower for files
          that were modified sequentially.  For this reason, a NO
          UPDATE option has been supplied, which will force copying of
          the entire file.

KATAKANA  Like ASCII except that internal data is translated to the
          192-character JIS-8 Katakana character set for transmission.
          This mode will be automatically selected instead of ASCII
          mode when a file is transferred from the TYMCOM-X to the
          TYMCOM-370 and bit 10 in the RBLIC word is on.  Conversely,
          if KATAKANA mode is used to transfer a file from the
          TYMCOM-370 to the TYMCOM-X, bit 10 will be set in RBLIC.

IMAGE     Same as SERIAL mode, but the data presents an image of a
          hypothetical file system wherein variable length records are
          represented as a two-byte header containing the data length
          (in 8-bit bytes) of a data string which follows.  The
          TYMCOM-370 will use this information to create a V-formatted
          file with the indicated record lengths, and will use this
          mode to copy an image of a V-formatted file to the TYMCOM-IX
          or TYMCOM-X.

Data Compression


                           DATA COMPRESSION


      TELECOPY will automatically attempt data compression in order to
      maximize bandwidth utilization of the TYMNET circuit.  TELECOPY
      may select from one of two compression methods.  In the first
      method, or DUPLICATE compression, duplicated bytes are
      represented by a repeat count and the character to be
      duplicated.

      The second compression method applies especially well to
      symbolic data.  Characters are ranked according to the frequency
      of their occurrence in the data.  Each character is then
      transmitted as its rank, instead of its value.  Commonly
      occurring character pairs are sent as a single byte rather than
      two.  Duplicate compression is also applied.  This method is
      named the RANK method.

      TELECOPY applies a sensitive test to the file data to see if the
      RANK method is likely to succeed.  If this test fails, TELECOPY
      automatically selects the DUPLICATE method.

      The RANK compression algorithm has its best chance of succeeding
      when the bytesize being examined is the same as that with which
      the file was written.  For example, in TYMCOM-X to TYMCOM-X file
      transfers, when SERIAL mode (bytesize=8) is being used, little
      opportunity for compression exists if the data is recorded as
      five 7-bit bytes per word.  TELECOPY on TYMCOM-X has been
      instructed to examine the extension of the donor file and to use
      NATIVE mode on files that are likely to contain symbolic data,
      and to use SERIAL mode on files that are likely to contain
      binary data.  The following file extensions are candidates for
      SERIAL mode:

               .BAC            .HGH            .RMT
               .BIN            .LOW            .RTB
               .BUG            .MSB            .SAV
               .CAL            .OVR            .SFD
               .CHN            .QUE            .SHR
               .DAE            .QUF            .SVE
               .DCR            .REL            .SYS
               .DMP            .RIM            .UFD
                                               .XPN

      There will be instances in which the automatic selection of
      transmission mode or the automatic selection of DUPLICATE
      instead of RANK compression will fail to produce the fastest
      possible file transfer.  If a task is performed frequently it
      may be worth experimenting with the MODE and COMPRESS commands
      in order to optimize program performance.

TELECOPY Commands


                          TELECOPY COMMANDS


      When TELECOPY is ready to accept commands from the terminal, it
      prints a colon (:) followed by a blank.  The following commands
      are implemented:

RUn                     Begins program execution.  Will prompt for
                        "copy from" file name and "copy to" file name.
                        When entered from the RUN command, file names
                        must be specified in full with only one file
                        name per line in the form:

                        (user-name:{sysno})file-name
                                   { *   }

                        See the EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS section for
                        more information.

COMMands [file-name]    Causes TELECOPY to begin executing commands
                        from a command file on the TYMCOM-X.  The file
                        name defaults to that described in the
                        ENTERING TELECOPY section.  If a file name is
                        given, its extension must be either .TMP or,
                        if the job is to be detached from, .COM.  If
                        .COM is used and the job is detached from, the
                        .OUT file will have the same file name as the
                        .COM file.

VErsion                 Prints the controller version number.

ONlc                    Allows lowercase to appear in ASCII
                        transmission.  Unless this command is issued,
                        lowercase will be converted to uppercase when
                        transferring files between dissimilar
                        operating systems.

OFlc                    Turns off lowercase (default for ASCII
                        transmission).

Truncate length         Affects ASCII transmission from TYMCOM-370 to
                        TYMCOM-X or TYMCOM-IX.  The length must be an
                        integer from 2 to 255.  Indicates that
                        TYMCOM-370 files should be truncated starting
                        at the specified column in order to delete
                        sequence numbers.  Usually, this option must
                        be specified when a file has sequence numbers
                        before SUPRESS will have any useful effect.

No Truncate             Turns off truncate feature of TYMCOM-370.
                        This is efault setting.

SUpress                 Affects ASCII transmission from TYMCOM-370 to
                        TYMCOM-X or TYMCOM-IX.  Causes trailing blanks
                        to be discarded from TYMCOM-370 records,
                        greatly shortening transmission time and the

                        size of the target file.  This is the default
                        setting.

No Supress              Stops the removal of trailing blanks by the
                        TYMCOM-370.

Fixed [frecl]           Causes a TYMCOM-370 to create fixed length
                        file records of length frecl, where frecl is
                        an integer not to exceed 65536.  If frecl is
                        omitted, 80 is assumed.  The TYMCOM-370 will
                        use blanks to pad the records it receives to
                        the desired length.

VAriable [vrecl]        Causes a TYMCOM-370 to create variable length
                        file records of maximum length vrecl, where
                        vrecl is an integer not to exceed 65536.  When
                        vrecl is omitted, 65536 is assumed.  The
                        default setting is such that the TYMCOM-370
                        will create variable length records of maximum
                        length 65536 unless the FIXED option has been
                        set.

     { Ascii }
     { Katakana }
     { Image }

                        Forces the setting of the transmission mode to
                        other than the program default.  In the case
                        of binary mode, parameters may be set
                        differently for the transmitter (file donor)
                        and the receiver.  n1 is the number of bytes
                        to be packed (unpacked) per machine word; it
                        must be between 1 and 16.  n2 is the bytesize
                        in bits, and must be between 1 and 8 When
                        FILL=LEFT, bytes are packed left justified and
                        unused bits to the right are zeroed.  When
                        FILL=RIGHT, bytes are packed right justified
                        and the more significant bits are zeroed.

                        SERIAL, NATIVE, and IMAGE are all special
                        cases of binary transmission which have been
                        given their own names.  When BLOCKING, FILL,
                        and BYTESIZE specifications are all omitted
                        from the binary parameter list, BINARY becomes
                        equivalent to SERIAL mode.

                        ASCII and KATAKANA modes are nearly identical
                        in their character sets and are subject to the
                        same option switches.

         { Off        }
Compress { Duplicate  }
         { Rank [Auto]}

                        Forces the setting of the data compression
                        method to other than the program default.
                        Compression may be disabled altogether by
                        specifying OFF.  The AUTO option of RANK
                        causes TELECOPY to decide for itself whether
                        to use the RANK or the DUPLICATE method.

SCratch                 Clears all user-supplied MODE and COMPRESS
                        switches so that the normal program defaults
                        will be reinstated.

Talk [sysno]            Builds a TYMNET circuit to the system number
                        given by the integer sysno.  If sysno is
                        omitted, an existing circuit will be used if
                        one exists.  Once the circuit has been
                        established, the logged-in user name begins to
                        accrue usage charges just as if it had been
                        logged directly into the remote system from a
                        terminal.  Input from the local terminal is
                        passed along to the remote system, and its
                        terminal output is directed to the local
                        terminal, allowing the user to converse with
                        the remote system.  This feature is needed to
                        use TELECOPY when the logged-in user name has
                        a PROFILE EXEC or initialized file that asks
                        questions before proceeding to the system
                        command level.  It is also useful for
                        modifying the environment at the remote system
                        prior to file transfer.

                        TALK mode may be exited by typing %%F(cr) at
                        the local terminal.  A %%U(cr) sends a unit
                        separator to the remote system.  Escapes typed
                        at the local terminal will be sent to the
                        remote system.

                        Due to the difference in echoing rules of the
                        TYMCOM-370 and the TYMCOM-IX or TYMCOM-X, echo
                        is currently doubled by a TYMCOM-IX or
                        TYMCOM-X system, and typeahead is not
                        supported.

                        When a connection is made to a TYMCOM-X or
                        TYMCOM-370 via the TALK command, the
                        possibility exists that the user may be
                        detached for up to a half hour if the circuit
                        is broken.  The recommended procedure for
                        breaking such a circuit is to use the TALK
                        command and to send a LOGOUT command to the
                        remote system.  The warning message "CIRCUIT
                        REMAINS TO SYSTEM xx--USE TALK COMMAND TO
                        LOGOUT" will be given by TELECOPY prior to
TELECOPY USER'S GUIDE                                          Page 13

                        breaking the TYMNET circuit.  The QUIT command
                        will ask if the user wishes to exit if a TALK
                        connection to a TYMCOM-X or TYMCOM-370 exists.

Loquacious              Causes checkpoint and other messages to be
                        printed on the terminal during program
                        execution.  Information about modes selected
                        and progress reports are given.  The progress
                        reports are useful when copying very large
                        files.

Not Loquacious          Stops printing of checkpoint information.
                        This is the default setting.

Ask                     Causes TELECOPY to require a "Y" or "N"
                        confirmation before copying over an existing
                        file.  This is the default mode of operation.

REplace                 Causes TELECOPY to copy over any existing
                        files without requiring confirmation.
                        TELECOPY will print "REPLACING FILE ..." when
                        this option is in effect and a file is to be
                        overwritten.

Keep                    Causes TELECOPY to bypass copying over an
                        existing file, without requiring confirmation.
                        TELECOPY will print "KEEPING FILE ..." when
                        this option is in effect and an existing file
                        was specified to be overwritten.

Update                  Forces TELECOPY to update the contents of an
                        old file being replaced, rather than copy an
                        entire file.  This is the default setting.  It
                        is effective only for BINARY, SERIAL, or
                        NATIVE mode file transfers between TELECOPY
                        controllers and slaves that have UPDATE
                        capability (that is, all except TYMCOM-370).

No Update               Forces copying the entire contents of a file
                        even if UPDATE mode could have been used.  May
                        be faster than UPDATE mode if the old file
                        being replaced has been modified sequentially
                        starting near the beginning, or greatly
                        differs from the replacement.

Gateway gateway-number;user-name:sysno

                        Enables the user to run TELECOPY on a system
                        on another network via a gateway node.  For
                        example:

                        GATEWAY 9;OPER:55(cr)

                        will build a circuit to OPER:55 on a network
                        that connects through gateway 9.  If the
                        PASSWORD command has not been given, TELECOPY

                        will prompt for a password.

HOst sysno=systype      Allows the user to override an existing
                        default for the system type for a given system
                        number.  Normally this command will be used
                        before using the GATEWAY command and logging
                        into other networks whose hosts are of a
                        different type for a given number on TYMNET.
                        It may also be used in the event that one of
                        the host numbers on TYMNET is changed to a
                        type other than the default given for it.
                        Currently there are three system types, which
                        may be specified several different ways:

                                (TYMCOM-X)      TYM-X
                                                X
                                                TYM-XX
                                                XX

                                (TYMCOM-IX)     TYM-IX
                                                IX
                                                940

                                (TYMCOM-370)    TYM370
                                                TYMCMS

                                                MVS

                        For example,

                        HOST 37=370

                        would make TELECOPY think system 37 is a
                        TYMCOM-370.

Password(cr)            Useful when using the GATEWAY command in a
password                command file.  After typing "PASSWORD(cr)",
                        the user types the password, which will not
                        print at the terminal.  The specified password
                        will apply to the next GATEWAY command.  This
                        command allows the password to remain secure;
                        it is useful before a GATEWAY or COMMANDS
                        command.

Execution Instructions


                        EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS


      There are two ways to begin program execution.  The first is to
      issue the RUN command, which will prompt for the "copy from" and
      "copy to" file names as shown in the following example:

      : RUN(cr)

      COPY FROM FILE:  (YOUNGERC:38)TELECO.RNO(cr)

      COPY TO FILE:  (YOUNGERC:33)TELECO.RNO(cr)

      COPY STARTING

      (YOUNGERC:38)TELECO.RNO COPIED TO (YOUNGERC:33)TELECO.RNO

      32000 (26454) CHARS. TRANSMITTED

      :

      Only one file can be specified for transfer when the RUN command
      is used.  The file name must be preceded by the user name and
      system number.  The syntax for both the "FROM" and the "TO"
      specifications is:

           (user-name:{sysno})file-name
                      { *   }

      The file name must obey the syntax rules on its respective
      system.

      An asterisk "*" may be used in place of the system number on
      which TELECOPY is being run.  The system numbers in the "FROM"
      and the "TO" specifications must not specify the same system,
      and at least one of them must be the system on which TELECOPY is
      being run.

      In the example above, if the file TELECO.RNO already existed on
      the destination system and was to be replaced, TELECOPY would
      print

      OKAY TO WRITE ON OLD FILE?

      to require confirmation of the replacement.  This question must
      be answered "YES" or "NO" (or an abbreviation).  If the answer
      is affirmative, and file transfer is between identical system
      types (except TYMCOM-370's), or is a binary mode transfer
      between dissimilar system types (but neither is a TYMCOM-370),
      then TELECOPY will switch to UPDATE mode and send only those
      blocks of the donor file which differ from blocks in the
      destination file.  In this case, TELECOPY would print "UPDATING
      STARTING" instead of "COPY STARTING".

Execution Instructions


      Two commands, REPLACE and KEEP, may be used to provide automatic
      confirmation or rejection, respectively, of file replacement.
      The KEEP command, for example, will cause TELECOPY to retain any
      existing files that would otherwise have been written over.
      Still another command, ASK, restores the normal mode of
      requiring confirmation from the terminal.  These commands are
      useful when command files are being created and it is uncertain
      whether the files to be copied will need a "Y" or "N" response
      in the command file.

      When TELECOPY has finished copying the file, it will print a
      message to this effect, including complete "FROM" and "TO"
      specifications.  TELECOPY also prints the total number of 8-bit
      characters transferred, and the number of TYMNET characters
      transmitted (in parentheses).

      The second, and preferred, method of beginning program execution
      is to type the "FROM" and "TO" file name specifications directly
      at the prompting ":".  When the command dispatcher sees a left
      parenthesis as the first character of any command, a RUN is
      implied and extended syntax rules apply.  The format for this
      command line is:

           "FROM"-specifications[,]"TO"-specifications(cr)

      The comma separating the "FROM" and "TO" specifications is
      optional.  The "TO" specifications will be recognized by the
      presence of a colon (:) somewhere in the "TO" system number
      specification.

      The total length of the line cannot exceed 300 characters.  A
      line feed may be used to continue typing the line.

      The form of the "FROM" specifications is:

           (user-name[:{sysno}])file-name1[,file-name2[,...]]
                     [:{ *   }]

      A number of file names belonging to the same user name may be
      specified.  If the system number and its preceding colon (:) are
      omitted altogether, ":*" is assumed (the system on which
      TELECOPY is run).

      The form of the "TO" specifications is:

           (user-name:{sysno})[file-name1[,file-name2[,...]]]
                      { *   }

      or

           :{sysno}[file-name1[,file-name2[,...]]]
            { *   }

      If the "TO" user name is omitted, the "FROM" user name is
      assumed.  The "TO" system number and its preceding colon ":" may
      never be omitted.  If fewer file names are listed in the "TO"
TELECOPY USER'S GUIDE                                          Page 18
Execution Instructions


      specifications than appear in the list of "FROM" file names,
      then the name given in the "FROM" specifications is assumed.
      The "TO" file names may be omitted altogether, and then all
      files specified on the "FROM" system will be copied to identical
      file names on the "TO" system.

      Here are some examples:

      : (YOUNGERC:38)TELECO.RNO,:33(cr)

                        Copies the file (YOUNGERC)TELECO.RNO from
                        system 38 to system 33.

      : (YOUNGERC)TELECO.RNO,:33(cr)

                        Same as the preceding example, assuming that
                        we are logged into and running TELECOPY from
                        system 38.

      : (YOUNGERC:38)A,B,C,:33D,E(cr)

                        Copies the file (YOUNGERC)C from system 38 to
                        system 33.  Copies files (YOUNGERC)A and
                        (YOUNGERC)B to files (YOUNGERC)D and
                        (YOUNGERC)E, respectively, on system 33.

      The following example illustrates how the COMMANDS, GATEWAY, and
      PASSWORD commands may be used together on the TYMCOM-X.

      Suppose a user wishes to copy some files from his system to a
      system on a foreign network through a gateway node.  If he
      wishes to do this with a command file that will detach his job
      so that he may continue other work, he may create a command file
      called COMFIL.COM containing

      GATEWAY 9;OPER:55(cr)

      followed by the commands for copying the files.  Then he may
      issue the following commands from the terminal:

      -R TELECOPY(cr)
      : PASSWORD(cr)
      password(cr)
      : COMMANDS COMFIL.COM(cr)

      His job will now be detached and TELECOPY will begin executing
      the commands in COMFIL.COM.  The output file name will be
      COMFIL.OUT.
