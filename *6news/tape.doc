TAPE 11.00 (NOVEMBER,1976) FOR THE TYMCOM-X
-------------------------------------------

THIS DOCUMENT IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE USE OF THE TAPE
PROGRAM.  FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE THE
REFERENCE MANUAL.

TAPE WILL PRINT A NUMBER FOLLOWED BY A ":" WHEN IT
IS READY FOR A COMMAND.  ALL COMMANDS MAY BE ABBREVIATED
TO THE LEAST NUMBER OF CHARACTERS THAT MAKE THE COMMAND
UNIQUE.

THE DEFAULT RADIX FOR NUMERIC INPUT IS DECIMAL.  THE USER MAY
CHANGE THIS MODE TO OCTAL OR ANOTHER DESIRED RADIX.  ANY NUMBER MAY
BE SUFFIXED WITH EITHER A "D" FOR DECIMAL OR A "B" OR "O" FOR OCTAL
TO INDICATE ONE OF THESE MODES REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT RADIX.

VALID TAPE COMMANDS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  THE FULL EDITING
PACKAGE IS IN EFFECT DURING ALL COMMAND INPUTS TO TAPE.

COMMAND- HELP
-------------

"HELP" MAY BE GIVEN ANY WHERE IN A COMMAND LINE.  IT CAUSES TAPE
TO GIVE A DETAILED LIST OF ALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE AT THE POINT "HELP"
APPEARS IN THE COMMAND STRING.

COMMAND- ?
----------

THE COMMAND "?" IS SIMILAR TO "HELP" (ABOVE) EXCEPT THAT IT
GIVES ONLY THE OPTIONS LIST WITH NO DESCRIPTIONS.

COMMANDS- CREDITS, CHARGES, VERSION, INSTRUCTIONS, CAPABILITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------

THESE STANDARD FRONT END COMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE AT COMMAND LEVEL
AND GIVE THE STANDARD INFORMATION BACK.

COMMAND- TYPE
-------------

THIS COMMAND IS USED TO PRINT THE NUMERIC CODES (IN THE CURRENT RADIX)
CORRESPONDING TO THE SPECIFIED CHARACTERS, TO PRINT THE CHARACTER
NAMES WHOSE CODES ARE GIVEN, OR TO PRINT A MESSAGE (USEFUL WITHIN
A COMMAND FILE).
EXAMPLE:

4: RADIX OCTAL
OK

5: TYPE A
A (101)

6: TYPE BACKARROW,B,DC1,103+,C,104+
BACKARROW (137)
B (102)
DC1 (21)
C (103)
C (103)
D (104)

7: TYPE 'THIS IS A MESSAGE'
THIS IS A MESSAGE

NOTE:  TO PRINT THE CHARACTER NAME CORRESPONDING TO A NUMERIC CODE,
SUFFIX THE CODE WITH A "+".

COMMAND- NO
-----------

THIS COMMAND WILL TURN OFF ANY OF SEVERAL TAPE OPTIONS SETTABLE
BY OTHER COMMANDS.  ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS ARE:

HUSH            (SAME AS TALK COMMAND) - TURNS ON LIMITED
                CONVERSATION.

TALK            (SAME AS HUSH COMMAND) - TURNS OFF LIMITED
                CONVERSATION.

PARITY          (SAME AS PARITY NO) - TURNS OFF PARITY CONTROL
                SUCH THAT PARITY IS NOT USED.

EDITING         TURNS OFF ALL EDITING DURING PAPER TAPE READING

SUBSTITUTE      TURNS OFF ALL SUBSTITUTION (DELETES THE
                CURRENT TABLES).

TITLE           (SAME AS TITLE NO) - RESETS DEFAULT TITLE TO NONE

LENGTH          SETS LENGTH OF LEADER/TRAILER TO DEFAULT (5D)

ECHO            (SAME AS ECHO OFF) - TURNS OFF ECHOING DURING READING

REPRESENTATION  (SAME AS REPRESENTATION NONE) - READS TEXT
                AND WRITES OUT WITH NO SPECIAL CONVERSION

CONTINUOUS      TURNS OFF CONTINUOUS MODE

COMMAND- PARITY
---------------

THIS COMMAND CONTROLS THE USE OF THE PARITY [8TH LEVEL] BIT AND
ALSO CONTROLS WORD PACKING FORMATS.

*** OPTIONS FOR SYMBOLIC READ/PUNCH

EVEN            TAPE BEING READ MUST HAVE EVEN PARITY.  EVEN
                PARITY WILL BE PUNCHED ON OUTPUT.

ODD             TAPE BEING READ MUST HAVE ODD PARITY.  ODD
                PARITY WILL BE PUNCHED ON OUTPUT.

NONE/OFF        PARITY BIT IGNORED ON READ AND NEVER PUNCHED.

DATA            TAPE BEING READ MUST HAVE THE PARITY BIT PUNCHED.
                ON OUTPUT, PARITY IS ALWAYS PUNCHED.

ALL READING IS 1 CHARACTER/PAPER TAPE FRAME AND WRITTEN ON
THE DISK AS 5 7-BIT CHARACTERS/MACHINE WORD (STANDARD ASCII FORMAT).

*** OPTIONS FOR BINARY READ/PUNCH

PACK            8-BIT CHARACTERS ARE READ FROM TAPE DEVICE.  ON
                DISK, PACKING IS 8-BIT CHARACTERS ACROSS WORD
                BOUNDARIES (SIMPL IOCS "PACK" FORMAT).  PUNCH READS
                PACK FORMAT FILE AND PUNCHES 8-BIT CHARACTERS, ONE
                PER FRAME.

DATA            8-BIT CHARACTERS ARE READ FROM TAPE DEVICE.  ON 
                DISK, PACKING IS ONE 8-BIT CHARACTER PER WORD, RIGHT
                JUSTIFIED IN THE WORD.  PUNCH READS 8-BIT CHARACTERS
                (ONE PER WORD ON THE FILE) AND PUNCHES 8-BIT
                CHARACTERS (ONE PER FRAME).

THE FOLLOWING CAUSE CHARACTERS ON TAPE TO BE CONSIDERED AS 8-BIT
CHARACTERS.  ON DISK, ONLY SIX BITS ARE USED AS DATA; PACKING
IS SIX 6-BIT CHARACTERS PER WORD.

EVEN            PARITY [8TH] BIT MUST BE EVEN

ODD             PARITY [8TH] BIT MUST BE ODD

NO/OFF          BITS 7-8 ON TAPE ARE IGNORED DURING READING AND
                NEVER PUNCHED.

COMMAND- HUSH
-------------

THIS COMMAND CONTROLS CONVERSATION FROM THE TAPE PROGRAM.
ARGUMENTS ARE:

YES/ON          TURNS OFF LIMITED CONVERSATION.
NO/OFF          TURNS ON LIMITED CONVERSATION.

COMMAND- TALK
-------------

THIS COMMAND IS THE OPPOSITE OF HUSH.  ARGUMENTS ARE:

YES/ON          TURNS ON LIMITED CONVERSATION.
NO/OFF          TURNS OFF LIMITED CONVERSATION.


COMMAND- ECHO
-------------

THE ECHO COMMAND CONTROLS ECHOING OF READING TAPE.  ARGUMENTS ARE:

YES/ON          TURNS ON ECHOING
NO/OFF          TURNS OFF ECHOING

COMMAND- SUBSTITUTE
-------------------

THIS COMMAND CAUSES ENTRIES TO BE MADE INTO TRANSLATION
TABLES.  THE TRANSLATION TABLES GOVERN CHARACTER SUBSITUTIONS
WHEN READING AND PUNCHING.  THE FORMATS ARE:

        N: SUB <INTERNAL> FOR <EXTERNAL>
        N: SUB <INTERNAL> , <EXTERNAL>
        N: SUB          (IN THIS CASE, TAPE PROMPTS THE USER FOR
                         THE TABLE ENTRIES.)

WHERE:

        <INTERNAL>::= INTERNAL CODE OR CODES (THOSE ON DISK)
        <EXTERNAL>::= EXTERNAL CODE OR CODES (THOSE ON TAPE)
                         DEVICE)

EXAMPLES:

N: SUB "A" FOR "B"      FOR EVERY "B" READ, WILL WRITE OUT "A"
                        AND FOR EVERY "A" FROM DISK WILL PUNCH "B"

N: SUB CR,LF FOR CR     FOR EVERY CARRIAGE-RETURN READ, WILL WRITE
                        ON DISK A CARRIAGE RETURN AND A LINE FEED.
                        FOR EVERY CARRIAGE RETURN ON DISK, WILL
                        WRITE OUT A CARRIAGE-RETURN.

N: SUB

SUBSTITUTE:
FILE,TAPE               TAPE TYPES THESE TWO LINES.
"C","D"
104,144
243,245
DC1,BACKARROW           USER TYPES CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER
                        AFTER THE LAST ENTRY.

SPECIAL NOTES:

(1) MULTIPLE STRINGS MAY BE WRITTEN OR PUNCHED, BUT AS FAR
    AS SEARCHES GO, ONLY THE FIRST CHARACTER OF "EXTERNAL"
    ON READING, AND ONLY THE FIRST CHARACTER OF "INTERNAL"
    ON PUNCHING WILL BE LOOKED FOR.

(2) A "," MAY BE USED AS A SEPARATOR ONLY IF THERE IS ONE
    CHARACTER ON "INTERNAL" AND ONE CHARACTER ON "EXTERNAL"
    (I.E.,  N: SUB "A","B"   OR  N: SUB CR,LF)
    IN ALL OTHER CASES, "FOR" MUST BE USED.

COMMAND- PRINT
--------------

THIS COMMAND PRINTS THE CURRENT SUBSTITUTION TABLE AT THE TERMINAL.

COMMAND- REPRESENTATION
-----------------------

THIS COMMAND IS USED TO INVOKE A SPECIAL CONVERSION OPTION WHICH
ALLOWS THE USER TO CONVERT CHARACTER VALUES READ FROM A TAPE OR
FILE TO A CHARACTER REPRESENTATION OF THE NUMERIC CODES (LITERAL
REPRESENTATION) OR TO CONVERT THIS LITERAL INTERPRETATION BACK
TO STANDARD CHARACTER CODES DURING READING OR PUNCHING.  A
LITERAL REPRESENTATION CONSISTS OF THE NUMERIC CODE REPRESENTATIONS
(IN THE CURRENT RADIX) SEPARATED BY CARRIAGE RETURNS AND IS BY NATURE
A SYMBOLIC FILE.  LEGAL ARGUMENTS ARE:

EXTERNAL        TAPE FORMAT IS A LITERAL REPRESENTATION.

INTERNAL        DISK FILE FORMAT IS A LITERAL REPRESENTATION.

BOTH            BOTH FILE AND TAPE ARE IN LITERAL REPRESENTATION
                FORMAT.

COMMAND- EDITING
----------------

THIS COMMAND SETS CHARACTERS TO BE USED FOR EDITING PURPOSES DURING
PAPER TAPE READING.  FORMAT IS:

        N: EDI <VERB>=<CHARACTER> [<VERB>=<CHARACTER>]

WHERE:

        <VERB>::= LINE (EDITOR CONTROL-Q FUNCTION),
                  CHARACTER (EDITOR CONTROL-A FUNCTION)
        <CHARACTER>::= ANY VALID CHARACTER REPRESENTATION

EXAMPLES:

N: EDI LINE="^" CHARACTER="_"
N: EDI LINE=NOTHING             (TURNS OFF LINE-EDITING CHAR)
N: EDI CH=BACKARROW L=1

COMMAND- LENGTH
---------------

THIS COMMAND SETS THE LENGTH OF LEADER/TRAILER DURING PUNCHING.
THE FORMAT OF THE LEADER IS:

        <LENGTH INCHES OF NULLS>        ----.---
        <THREE RUBOUTS>                 ****.***
        <ACTUAL START OF DATA>

THE FORMAT OF THE TRAILER IS:

        <THREE RUBOUTS>                 ****.***
        <LENGTH INCHES OF NULLS>        ----.---

AN OPTIONAL TITLE MAY PRECEED THE LEADER.

ARGUMENT TO THIS COMMAND IS:  THE NUMBER OF INCHES FOR THE LEADER AND
TRAILER TO BE.  (THE DEFAULT IS 5.)

COMMAND- TITLE
--------------

THIS COMMAND IS USED TO CAUSE TAPE TO PUNCH A TITLE OF READABLE TEXT
ON A PAPER TAPE TO IDENTIFY IT TO THE USER.  THIS COMMAND TAKES ONE
OF THE FOLLOWING FORMS:

        N: TITLE "TITLE"        (SPECIFIES A TITLE TO BE PUNCHED
                                DURING PAPER TAPE PUNCHING.)

        N: TITLE PUNCH "TITLE"  (PUNCHES ONLY A TITLE, WITHOUT CHANGING
                                ANY TITLE PREVIOUSLY DEFINED TO BE
                                PUNCHED DURING PAPER TAPE PUNCHING.)

COMMAND- USE
------------

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A PERSON WITH GET-DEVICES LICENSE TO USE THE
PAPER TAPE READER AND PUNCH ON THE TYMCOM-X CENTRAL-PROCESSOR.  THE
ARGUMENTS ARE:

PDP10           USE PDP10 UNITS WHEN READING/PUNCHING
TERMINAL        USE THE USER'S TERMINAL WHEN READING/PUNCHING

COMMAND- CASSETTE
-----------------

ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS ARE "ON" OR "OFF" TO TURN ON OR GET RID OF
CASSETTE MODE.  WHILE IN CASSETTE MODE, THE LEADING AND TRAILING
RUBOUTS AND THE PREAMBLE TITLE ARE NOT PUNCHED.

COMMAND- CONTINUOUS
-------------------

ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS ARE "ON" OR "OFF" TO TURN ON OR GET RID OF
THIS MODE WHICH ALLOWS CONTINUOUS READING OF A TAPE CONTAINING X-OFF
CHARACTERS ON A READER WHICH CAN NOT IGNORE THOSE CHARACTERS.  THE
READER IS FORCED ON WHEN EACH NEW INPUT IS REQUIRED AND MUST TIME
OUT TO TERMINATE THE TRANSMISSION.

COMMAND- PROMPT
---------------

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO HAVE TAPE PROMPT HIM FOR QUESTIONS
BEFORE READING/PUNCHING.

NOTE:  ANSWERING ANY QUESTION WITH A C.R. OBTAINS THE DEFAULT VALUE 
OR THAT LAST SET BY AN OPTION SETTING COMMAND (SUCH AS PARITY, ETC.)
ALSO, THE SUBSTITUTE TABLE IS NOT CLEARED WHEN LOADING FROM A FILE.
IN ORDER TO START ANEW, A "NO SUBSTITUTE" COMMAND SHOULD BE GIVEN
PRIOR TO "PROMPT:"

** A. HOW TO PUNCH TAPE

N: PROMPT

SYMBOLIC OR BINARY?  (EITHER "SYMBOLIC" OR "BINARY" FOR TYPE OF
                        PUNCH/READ TO BE DONE; C.R. ASSUMES DEFAULT,
                        WHICH IS SYMBOLIC)

PARITY: (APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OR C.R.)

INPUT FROM:  (FILE NAME)

OUTPUT TO:   ("TERMINAL"; C.R. ASSUMES THIS)

SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION? (APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OR C.R.)

SUBSTITUTE: (SUBSTITUTE COMMANDS; C.R. TERMINATES QUESTION)

TITLE: (APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OR C.R.)

LENGTH OF LEADER AND TRAILER: (APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OR C.R.)

TYPE CARRIAGE-RETURN OR LINE-FEED.
THEN TURN ON PUNCH.

** AT THIS POINT YOU CAN TYPE
        A. CR, IN WHICH CASE A PREAMBLE TITLE WILL BE PUNCHED, AND THEN
           THE FILE WILL BE PUNCHED
        B. LF, IN WHICH CASE PREAMBLE TITLE IS SKIPPED AND FILE PUNCHED


** B. HOW TO READ TAPE

N: PROMPT

SYMBOLIC OR BINARY? (ANSWER)

PARITY: (ANSWER)

INPUT FROM:  ("TERMINAL"; C.R. ASSUMES THIS)

OUTPUT TO:   (FILE NAME)
 NEW/OLD FILE (CARRIAGE-RETURN)

SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION? (ANSWER)

SUBSTITUTE: (ANSWER; C.R. TERMINATES QUESTION)

ECHO: (APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT OR C.R.)

TURN ON READER

** AT THIS POINT, TURN ON THE READER. TAPE TERMINATES
** THE READ WHEN A 10 SEC DELAY IN CHARACTERS OCCURS.

COMMAND- RUN
------------

THIS COMMAND IS USED FOR SYMBOLIC READING AND PUNCHING AND CAUSES
TAPE TO PROMPT THE USER FOR EACH OPTION.

** A. HOW TO PUNCH TAPE

N: RUN

INPUT FROM: (FILE NAME)

OUTPUT TO: ("T" FOR "TERMINAL" OR C.R.)

TITLE: ("TITLE")

TYPE CARRIAGE RETURN OR LINE-FEED.
THEN TURN ON PUNCH.

** B. HOW TO READ TAPE

N: RUN

INPUT FROM: ("T" OR C.R.)

OUTPUT TO: (FILE NAME)
NEW FILE OR OLD FILE

EDITING: ("YES" OR "NO"  OR "B")

TURN ON READER

N CHARACTERS ON FILE

NOTE:  THE "B" ANSWER TO EDITING QUESTION IS USED TO INDICATE A
BACKARROW FOR CHARACTER DELETION.  NO LINE DELETION IS PERFORMED
UNLESS THE USER HAS DEFINED A LINE-DELETING CHARACTER PREVIOUSLY
WITH THE EDITING OPTION.

COMMAND- SPLICE
---------------

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH DURING PAPER
TAPE READING.  THIS COMMAND IS USED WHEN THE TEMPORARY FILE THAT
TAPE CREATES (OF THE FORM B##TAP.TMP) STILL REMAINS.  THE ARGUMENT
IS THE JOB ID GIVEN TO THE USER BY TAPE WHEN IT WAS FIRST CALLED
FROM A SYSTEM COMMAND.  THE DIALOGUE IS AS FOLLOWS:

        N: SPLICE <JOBID>

        READ IN ABOUT 10 INCHES OF TAPE

        (TURN ON READER, READ IN REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TAPE, STOP READER)

(IF TAPE FINDS A MATCH,)

        FOUND MATCH.  TURN ON READER

(YOU CAN NOW TURN THE READER ON AND PROCEED.)

(IF TAPE CANT FIND A MATCH,)

        NO MATCH FOUND.  TRY AGAIN? (YES OR NO ANSWER)

"NO" CAUSES RETURN TO COMMAND LEVEL, "YES" REPEATS THE "READ IN ABOUT
10 INCHES OF TAPE" QUESTION.  BEFORE TYPING "YES<CR>" USER SHOULD
REPOSITION TAPE SO IT IS ABOUT 5 FEET BACK.

COMMAND- SPLICEREAD
-------------------

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH DURING PAPER
TAPE READING IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY FILE CREATED BY TAPE NO LONGER
EXISTS.  THE ARGUMENT IS THE NAME OF FILE TO BE SPLICED.

        N: SPLICEREAD <FILE NAME>

EXAMPLE:

3: SPLICEREAD SPFILE

THE LAST 48 CHARACTERS ON THE FILE ARE:

"ED AND THE LAST FILE NAME
BY A CARRIAGE RE"

READ IN ABOUT 10 INCHES OF TAPE

FOUND MATCH

TURN ON READER

8032 CHARACTERS ON FILE
1003 TOTAL CHARACTERS READ

SPLICE COMPLETED.

COMMAND- SAVE
-------------

TAKES FILE NAME AS ARGUMENT AND SAVES CURRENT TRANSLATION TABLE IN
READABLE EDITOR-TYPE CODE ON A FILE.

COMMAND- LOAD
-------------

MERGES THE CURRENT TRANSLATION TABLE WITH THAT OF A TRANSLATION TABLE
SAVED BY "SAVE" COMMAND.  IF RELOADING IS DESIRED, "NO SUBSTITUTION"
SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIOR TO LOAD COMMAND.

COMMAND- RESET
--------------

THIS COMMAND CAUSES TAPE TO INITIALIZE ITSELF TO ITS VIRGIN STATE.

COMMAND- LIST
-------------

THIS COMMAND LISTS THE STATE OF ALL TAPE OPTIONS ON THE TELETYPE.

COMMAND- [B]READ
----------------

THIS COMMAND IS IDENTICAL TO "RUN" EXCEPT IT USES ALL DEFAULT VALUES
OF OPTIONS WHICH ARE CHANGEABLE BY OPTION-SETTING COMMANDS. "READ" READS
IN SYMBOLIC FORMAT, "BREAD" READS IN BINARY FORMAT.

COMMAND- [B]PUNCH
-----------------

IDENTICAL TO [B]READ EXCEPT PUNCHES TAPE INSTEAD OF READS.

COMMAND- DO
-----------

THIS COMMAND IS USED TO OPEN A SPECIFIED COMMAND FILE AND MAY BE GIVEN
AT THE COMMAND LEVEL ONLY.  ITS ARGUMENT IS A COMMAND FILE NAME.

COMMANDS-FROM FILES
-------------------

ANY WHERE IN A USER COMMAND STRING, THE SYNTAX

        @<FILE NAME><CARRIAGE-RETURN>

MAY BE GIVEN.  IT CAUSES TAPE TO START TAKING COMMANDS FROM THE
SPECIFIED FILE NAME.  EXAMPLE:

        N: @COMM

        N: TITLE @TITL

        N: RUN
        SYMBOLIC OR BINARY? @FILENAME

IN ADDITION, DURING "N: RUN"

        SUBSTITUTE: @SAVEFILE

WILL CAUSES THE TRANSLATION TABLE TO BE LOADED FROM THE SPECIFIED FILE.

COMMAND- QUIT
-------------

RETURNS THE USER TO TYMEX.
