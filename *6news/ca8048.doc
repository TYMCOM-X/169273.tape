                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Please feel free to call  the  sales  department  of  the  Boston
Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

To run the 8048 cross assembler, at the monitor  (system)  level,
type:

     -R CA8048

The assembler will respond with the following:

     8048 Cross Assembler version 3A(44)
     Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc. 1979
     (617) 894-7800
     Type "/H" for help
     *

By typing "*", the  assembler  is  indicating  its  readiness  to
accept  a  command  and perform an assembly.  To this prompt, you
should type a command of the form

*PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC/X/Y...

The filenames shown above (PROG.OBJ, PROG.LST, PROG.SRC) are used
for example purposes only, and any acceptable file specifications
may be used.

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST are the names of the object and list  files
the assembler will create, respectively.  If either of these file
specifications is  omitted,  the  associated  file  will  not  be
generated.

If a list file is desired without an  object  file,  the  command
string  should  start  with  a  comma,  followed by the list file
specification, i.e., if only the  object  file  is  omitted,  its
trailing comma must still be included.

If only an object file is desired, without a list  file,  neither
the comma nor the list file specification need appear on the left
side of the "=" sign in  the  command  string  (see  examples  in
section 1.5).

The source program to be assembled is specified on the right side
of the "=" sign.  A source file is always required.

The source file is optionally  followed  by  "switches"  for  the
command string.  These take the form of a slash "/" followed by a
single letter (shown in the above example by "/X and /Y"), and as
many of these may be specified as desired (including none).  Each
switch slightly modifies the operation  of  the  assembler.   The
available switches are detailed in section 1.2.

If extensions are omitted from the  file  specifications  in  the
command string, the following assumed default extensions apply:

Object file     .OBJ
List file       .LST
Source file     .SRC
                                                           Page 7


1.1 USING THE LISTING AND OBJECT FILES

The listing and object files created are in ASCII formats and may
be   printed  or  punched  by  using  standard  operating  system
commands.  Any normal system commands may also be  used  to  move
these  files from device to device.  Consult your computer system
user's guide for more details.



1.2 SWITCH SUMMARY

The following switches are available in this assembler:

     /H  "Help".  Ignore command line and print helpful
         information.
     /N  Do not print assembly errors on user's terminal
     /P  Indicate the start of pass 2 on the terminal
     /T  No symbol table in listing (see section 1.4)
     /D  Debug switch; include symbol information in object file
         (for use by BSO symbolic simulator/debuggers)
     /B  BNPF format object file
     /X  Cross reference mode.  Produces a symbol table in the
         list file which includes cross reference information.
                                                           Page 8


1.3 LISTING OPTIONS

1.3.1 OMIT SYMBOL TABLE (/T)

The listing normally contains a table of user symbols  and  their
values.   This  table  can  be  omitted  by  specifying /T in the
command line.

1.3.2 CROSS-REFERENCE MODE (/X)

By adding the /X switch to the end of  the  command  string,  the
user  instructs the assembler to operate in cross-reference mode.
In this mode, the symbol table produced contains, in addition  to
the symbol names and values, the cross reference information.



1.4 OBJECT FILE OPTIONS

1.4.1 DEBUGGER SUPPORT (/D)

When the user adds the /D  switch  to  the  end  of  the  command
string,  the  assembler  includes  its symbol table in the object
module.  This symbol table is subsequently read by BSO's symbolic
simulator/debugger,  which  then  has access to the user's symbol
definitions.

This information is merely appended to the end  of  the  absolute
load  module  (object  file)  generated  by  the  assembler.  The
simulator recognizes the sepcially formated  information  at  the
end  of the file and loads the and loads the symbols accordingly.
Note that this information may or may not be considered a serious
error   by  various  manufacturer-supplied  loaders  and/or  PROM
burners.

1.4.2 BNPF OBJECT FORMAT

This  cross  assembler  has  the  capability  of  producing   two
different  object  formats.   One  format  is  the standard INTEL
object format The other format is the  so-called  "BNPF"  format.
Both  of  these  formats  are  described  in  section 5.0 of this
manual.  The INTEL format is produced normally;  BNPF  format  is
produced when the /B switch is specified.
                                                           Page 9


1.5 SAMPLE COMMANDS

The following examples are provided as illustrations of the sorts
of  commands normally given to the assembler.  Commentary text is
provided with each one.   Only  the  command  strings  are  shown
below;   note  that  they  are  always  typed  in response to the
assembler's prompt, "*".

     A.OBJ,A.LST=A.SRC
          Assemble source  file  A.SRC,  generating  object  file
          A.OBJ  and  list file A.LST.  The object and list files
          are in standard format.  Assembly errors appear on  the
          user's terminal and in the list file.

     A,A=A
          Same  effect  as  above  command  string,  because   of
          defaults.

     A=A
          Assemble source  file  A.SRC,  generating  object  file
          A.OBJ.  No list file is generated.  Erroneous lines are
          printed on the user's terminal.

     ,A=A
          Assemble source file A.SRC, generating list file A.LST.
          No  object  file.   Assembly  errors appear both in the
          list file and on the user's terminal.

     FOO,BAR=PROG/X/N
          Assemble source  program  PROG.SRC,  generating  object
          file FOO.OBJ and cross reference of symbols in the list
          file BAR.LST.  Erroneous lines appear only in the  list
          file;  they are not typed on the user's terminal.

2.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION

2.1 PROGRAM ENTRY

In general, source programs for this assembler are placed on  the
host  computer  disk either by use of a text editor program or by
copying an existing source program from paper tape, punch  cards,
magnetic  tape,  etc.   Once  a  program  resides on disk, a text
editor program can be used  to  alter  or  correct  the  file  in
preparation  for  assembly.  Consult the operating system manuals
supplied with your computer for further  information  on  copying
and editing files on your system.

2.2 PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source program for the 8048 consists  of  several  lines  of
ASCII   characters.   Each  line  must  be  no  longer  than  132
characters;  longer lines will be truncated and produce a warning
message from the assembler.

Lines beginning  with  a  semicolon  (";")  will  be  treated  as
comments.   Blank  lines  will  be  ignored.   Each  source  line
(statement) consists of four parts or "fields":  The label field,
the  instruction  field, the operand field and the comment field.
These are described below.

2.2.2 LABEL FIELD

A statement label may consist of any  number  of  characters  but
only  the  first  6  will  be  used  by  the  program.  The first
character of the label must be alphabetic and, unless  the  label
is  terminated  by  a  colon,  must start in column one.  A label
identifies a particular location in the program  and  should  not
duplicate  another  label  or  one  of  the assembler's permanent
symbols, which include  all  of  the  instruction  mnemonics  and
pseudo ops.

The label field is optional except in statements with an  EQU  or
MACRO statement.

2.2.2 INSTRUCTION FIELD

The  instruction  field  must  contain  either   an   instruction
mnemonic,  a pseudo op or the name of a user defined macro (i.e.,
a macro call).  The field may not start in column one.

2.2.3 OPERAND FIELD

The  operand  field,  if  required,  may  consist  of  constants,
symbols,  statement labels, the instruction counter ($) or labels
EQUated to or defined as values.  These elements may be  combined
into  expressions  with  arithmetic  and  logical  operators,  as
described  below.   This  field  must  be  separated   from   the
instruction field by at least one space or tab.

                                                          Page 11


2.2.4 COMMENT FIELD

This field is optional;  it will appear on the  assembly  listing
but  will  be  ignored  by the assembler.  The comment field must
begin  with  a  semicolon  (;).   Comments  are  not  allowed  on
statement lines which define or call a macro.

2.3 EXPRESSIONS

Expressions can be  made  up  of  user  symbols,  numbers,  ASCII
constants,  statement  labels  and  the  instruction counter ($).
These may be combined by the various operators and  contained  by
parentheses to form complex expressions.  The expression handling
and operators available are a function of the assembler.  Many of
the   operators   have  no  simple  implementation  on  the  8048
microprocessor.

2.3.1 SYMBOLS

Any  alphanumeric  symbol,  except  an  instruction  mnemonic  or
reserved  operand  symbol  (see  4.0),  which  has been used as a
statement label  or  equated  to  a  value  may  be  used  in  an
expression.   In  addition,  the  instruction  counter ($) may be
used.

2.3.2 NUMERIC CONSTANTS

Numeric constants may be specified as binary, octal,  decimal  or
hexadecimal   constants.    To  do  this  the  number  should  be
immediately followed by a constant to indicate the radix used, as
shown in the examples below:

         B - BINARY  (E.G., 0101B)
         Q - OCTAL  (E.G., 015Q)
         D - DECIMAL  (E.G., 19D or 19)
         H - HEXADECIMAL (E.G., 0F8H)

Note that hex constants must always start with a decimal digit (0
if  necessary)  to  distinguish  them from user symbols.  Numbers
without any indication of radix  (no  trailing  letter)  will  be
treated as decimal numbers.

2.3.3 ASCII CONSTANTS

An ASCII  constant  is  represented  by  one  or  two  characters
enclosed in apostrophes.

2.3.4.  EXPRESSION OPERATORS

The operators available for constructing expressions include both
the unary and binary operators listed below:

   UNARY:  +       BINARY:    EQ    LE    AND   /
           -                  NE    LT    +     MOD
           NOT                GT    OR    -     SHR
           HIGH               GE    XOR   *     SHL
           LOW
                                                          Page 12


The full word operators must be separated from their operands  by
at  least  one  space  or  tab.   Expressions  will  be evaluated
according to the following operator precedence, and from left  to
right when of equal precedence:

     1)  parenthesized sub-expressions
     2)  *, /, MOD, SHR
     3)  +, - (unary and binary)
     4)  EQ, LT, LE, GE, GT, NE
     5)  NOT
     6)  AND
     7)  OR, XOR
     8)  HIGH, LOW

3.0 INSTRUCTION SET

This assembler supports the standard set of instruction mnemonics
for  the 8048.  A detailed explanation of each may be obtained by
referring  to  the  microprocessor   manufacturer's   programming
manual.  The supported instruction mnemonics are:


     ADD     EN      JNC     MOVP    RLC
     ADDC    ENTO    JNI     MOVP3   RR
     ANL     IN      JNT0    MOVX    RRC
     ANLD    INC     JNT1    NOP     SEL
     CALL    INS     JNZ     ORL     STOP
     CLR     JBn     JTF     ORLD    STRT
     CPL     JC      JT0     OUTL    SWAP

4.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO-OPS)

In  addition  to  normal  8048   instructions,   this   assembler
recognizes   a  number  of  assembler  directives,  or  so-called
"pseudo-ops".  These may appear in the instruction field  of  any
statement instead of an instruction mnemonic.  Various directives
are provided for  equating  symbols  to  values,  for  generating
various  types  of  data  (instead of instructions), for handling
macro definitions and conditional assembly, and  for  controlling
the  list  file  format.   These directives are summarized below;
most of them are also explained in more depth  in  the  following

4.1 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY

It is often necessary to make minor  changes  in  assembled  code
based  on  frequently-altered  parameters.   This assembler has a
conditional assembly feature which permits  such  changes  to  be
made with minimum effort.

Portions of a progran can be assembled or not depending upon  the
value  of  an  expression.  This is accomplished by preceding the
conditional section of code with a statement  containing  the  IF
pseudo op and the expression to be evaluated.  The end of a block
of conditional code is indicated  by  an  ENDIF  directive.   The
expression  following  the  IF pseudo op will be evaluated by the
assembler and the results compared to zero.   If  the  result  is
non-zero,  the conditional is true and the code will be assembled
normally.  If the condition is not true (zero result), all  lines
of source text between the conditional assembly directive and its
associated ENDIF directive are ignored by the assembler.

In addition, an optional  "ELSE"  directive  exists  which,  when
appearing  in  a  block of conditional code, reverses the current
true/false state of the conditional.  As many ELSE directives may
appear   as   are   desired;   each  causes  a  reversal  of  the
conditional.

The following example illustrates the use of conditional assembly
in a program.

EXAMPLE OF A CONDITIONAL SECTION OF CODE:


                         IF VER-1 ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE                    EQU 6
                         ENDIF
                         IF VER ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE                    EQU 8
                         ENDIF

Conditional assembly directives may be nested to any depth;  that
is,  a  conditional  block  of  code  may  itself  contain  other
conditional blocks, each starting  with  one  of  the  previously
listed directives, ending with an ENDIF directive, and optionally
containing one or more ELSE directives.

4.2 THE BSO MACRO FACILITY

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by writing just the macro  name
in the instruction field.  This makes it possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

          MNAME     MACRO DUM1,DUM1,...
                      .
                      .
                    ENDM

where MNAME is the name of the macro and DUM1,DUM2,...  are dummy
argument  names  (if  any).  Dummy argument names have no meaning
outside a macro definition.  Within the macro definition they may
appear  anywhere  (in  any  field) and all occurrences of a dummy
argument will be replaced by the actual argument strings when the
macro  is  used.  It should be noted that spaces or tabs trailing
the final argument in both the  definition  and  call  statements
will be taken as part of that argument.  To avoid this, the first
character after the last argument in  each  statement  should  be
either a CR-LF or a semicolon.

Macro definitions may not be nested.  The macro body may  contain
the  words  MACRO  or  ENDM.   A macro may contain calls to other
macros.

Macro calls are of the form:

          LABEL:    MNAME ARG1,ARG2,...

Where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual  arguments  (ARG1,ARG2,...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
commas.   Arguments omitted from a macro call are treated as null
strings;  extra arguments are ignored.  Notice that arguments can
be  expressions,  instruction  mnemonics,  comments or labels for
statements inside the macro expansion.  The  macro  processor  is
only  concerned  with  character  strings, which it passes to the
rest of the assembler.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 17

4.2.1 NESTING OF MACROS

The BSO macro facility  permits  a  variety  of  types  of  macro
nesting  and redefinition.  These features prove quite useful for
various purposes.  Macros may be redefined at any time;  that is,
if a macro "ABC" is defined (and used), and another definition of
"ABC" appears subsequently, the new definition supersedes the old
definition  and is in effect beginning with the next occurance of
a call to "ABC".  Macros may call other macros  (that  is,  macro
definitions  may  include  calls  to  other  macros).   When this
occurs, all macro expansion is done at macro call time,  so  that
it  is not necessary to define macros in any particular order, as
long as all nested macros have been defined by the  time  one  is
called.   This  feature,  combined with the redefinition feature,
makes it possible to use the macro  facility  to,  for  instance,
build  corresponding  entries  in  parallel tables.  Consider the
following lines of code:

          STUFF     MACRO
                    XX 1,1
                    XX 2,4
                    XX 3,9
                    ENDM
          XX        MACRO %A,%B
                    DB %A
                    ENDM
          NUMTAB    STUFF
          XX        MACRO %A,%B
                    DB %B
                    ENDM
          SQRTAB    STUFF

The first thing we see in the example above is a definition for a
macro  called "STUFF".  This macro simply contains three calls to
another macro, called "XX".  The XX macro has  not  as  yet  been
defined, but this is of no consequence, since the user has merely
defined the "STUFF" macro, but has not yet attempted to call  it.
Had  the  user followed the definition immediately with a call to
"STUFF", the assembler would encounter three references to  "XX",
which  would  be an undefined instruction at that point and which
would generate errors.  Also note that the "STUFF" macro  has  no
parameters.   This  is  permissable.   A  macro need not have any
dummy arguments at all.

Following the definition of STUFF, we see a definition  of  "XX".
Note  that this macro has two dummy arguments, "%A" and "%B", but
that only "%A" is actually used within  the  macro  body.   While
this  is  not  probably normally done, the macro processor of the
assembler does not consider the condition an  error;   it  merely
notes  that "XX" has two dummy arguments, but that the second one
is never used.

The next line contains a label (NUMTAB) and a call to  the  macro
STUFF.   This  time,  XX  has been defined, so that STUFF expands
into three calls to XX, and each of them generates a DB directive
to  generate a byte containing the first argument to XX.  The end
result is a table which looks like
                                                          Page 19


          NUMTAB    DB 1
                    DB 2
                    DB 3


Next, we see that "XX" is redefined.  This definition is  similar
to the first definition of XX, except that this time it generates
a byte for the SECOND argument,  and  ignores  the  first.   This
definition of XX supersedes the earlier definition.

Now, STUFF is  called  again,  and  generates  another  table  of
entries, which looks as follows:

          SQRTAB    DB 1
                    DB 4
                    DB 9

The end result of all this work is that  we  have  generated  two
parallel tables, one containing integers and one containing their
associated squares.  More entries could easily be added to  these
tables  by  adding more "XX" entries within the definition of the
"STUFF" macro.  The two tables are guaranteed  to  be  in  phase,
because  they  are  generated  using  the  macro  facility of the
assembler.

BSO macros can directly and  indirectly  call  and  define  other
macros,  and  can  even  call or define themselves.  When a macro
calls itself, the user must be careful to  see  to  it  that  the
calling  process  does  not  continue indefinitely.  When a macro
defines itself, the new definition  takes  effect  in  subsequent
calls  to  the  macro,  but the current macro expansion continues
from the old definition.

Macro calls may be nested to a level of ten.  This parameter  can
be  altered  to  customer  specification.   Contact  BSO for more
information.

4.3 LISTING CONTROL

This cross assembler permits the user to control to  some  extent
the  format of the list file produced.  The directives which deal
with this listing control are summarized below.

4.3.1 LIST/NLIST

The user can turn off the listing of sections of code  completely
by  using  NLIST.   The NLIST directive will cause the listing to
stop;  LIST will cause it to resume.

4.3.2 TITLE

The TITLE directive, in addition to  naming  the  object  module,
also specifies the title to be printed at the top of each listing
page.  Only one TITLE directive may appear in any program.

4.3.3 PAGE

The PAGE directive causes the listing to advance to  the  top  of
the  next  page.   This also occurs if a form feed (control/L) is
encountered in the source file, and automatically every 55  lines
(see  FORMLN, 4.3.9).  If a PAGE directive is used, only the page
throw occurs in the listing;  the PAGE directive itself does  not
appear.

4.3.4 FORMLN

The directive
                    FORMLN n
where n is a decimal integer,  changes  the  assembler's  default
form  length  to  "n" lines.  Initially, this value is 55.  After
every n lines, the assembler will advance  automatically  to  the
next page in the list file.

5.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT

5.1 STANDARD ABSOLUTE OBJECT FILE

The default object file produced by this assembler  is  an  ASCII
file in the format required by the INTEL 8048.  The layout of the
INTEL absolute object file is as follows:

          :           A colon for the record mark
          2 chars     number of data bytes (0 for end of file)
          4 chars     load address of first byte of record
          2 chars     record type (always 00)
          2 chars     first data byte
          2 chars     for each additional data byte
          2 chars     checksum

The checksum is the negative of the sum of all the 8-bit bytes in
the  record,  including  the  one  byte  count  and two byte load
address, with carries above 8 bits ignored.
                                                          Page 22


6.0 ERROR HANDLING

This assembler will print error messages at the  user's  terminal
and  in the program listing if the list file was requested in the
command line.  Errors are indicated by one or more characters  at
the  left  of  the  listing  line in which they occurred.  In all
cases, the assembler will attempt to generate some code for  each
source line so addresses further on in the program do not get out
of phase.  This also allows for a location into which a patch may
be  inserted  if the object file is used for debugging, even with
its errors.

The following error codes and explanations apply to this, and  in
many cases, other BSO assemblers for different microprocessors.

Error   Meaning
 Code


A       Argument Error.  An instruction was followed  by  invalid
        arguments.  

C       Constant Error.  A numeric constant contained an  illegal
        character  (e.g.,  128Q)  or  a character constant was of
        improper syntax.  The assembler uses a value of zero  for
        the constant.

D       Macro Definition Error.  The definition is ignored.   The
        error is caused by one of the following conditions:

        1.  The MACRO statement does not have a label

        2.  The MACRO statement has over ten arguments

        3.  The MACRO statement label is the same as a previously
            defined user symbol or pseudo-op.


E       Expression  Error.   Caused  by  one  of  the   following
        conditions:

        1.  Incorrect syntax, a value of zero assumed

        2.  Numeric  expression  overflowed  16   bits,   it   is
            truncated


L       Label Error.  Caused by one of the following conditions:

        1.  A symbol defined during pass 2 was not defined during
            pass 1.  The symbol is left undefined.

        2.  A SET or EQU pseudo-op was not preceded by a label

                                                          Page 23


M       Multiple Definition of SYMBOL.  The user is attempting to
        define  a  symbol  (with something other than DEFL) which
        was already defined.  The second definition is ignored.

N       Nesting Error.  An ENDM or ENDIF appeared which  was  not
        paired  with  a  MACRO or IF statement.  The statement is
        ignored.


O       Operator Error.  An undefined mnemonic  was  encountered,
        two bytes of zeros are generated.

P       Phase Error.  A symbol has a different value  in  pass  2
        than  in  pass 1.  The pass 1 value prevails.  This error
        is usually caused by one of the following conditions:

        1.  An IF statement had a different value during  pass  2
            than in pass 1.

        2.  A macro was called before it was defined.


Q       Questionable Syntax.  The  assembler  has  encountered  a
        statement which it does not completely understand, due to
        such   things   as   surplus   arguments,    unrecognized
        instruction or null label.

R       Range Error.  An "In-Page Jump" target address is out  of
        range.  The address is truncated to 8 bits and then used.

S       Symbol Error.  A macro name was used as a  symbol  in  an
        expression and is assumed to have a value of zero.

U       Undefined Symbol.  A symbol was undefined and is  assumed
        to have a value of zero.

V       Value Error.  Use of an  expression  too  large  for  the
        instruction field or one that is negative.

7.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES

This assembler is compatible with the one supplied for  the  8048
by Intel with several minor exceptions.  These are listed below.

(1) The following features  conform  to  BSO  standards  and  may
conflict with similar features offered by the manufacturer.

        (A)  Macro Processing
        (B)  Conditional Assembly Directives
        (C)  Listing Control
        (D)  Relocation Directives and Control

(2) The following special characters are not recognized  as  such
and may not be used to produce specific results:

        &  -  AMPERSAND
        <> -  ANGLE BRACKETS
        ;; -  DOUBLE SEMICOLON
        !  -  EXCLAMATION POINT
        %  -  PERCENT SIGN
(3) The following pseudo-ops have not been implemented:

        ELSE
        EXITM
        IRP
        IRPC
        REPT

Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
