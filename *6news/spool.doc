          The following represent changes to SPOOL since V4.00

     June 9, 1976

     1.  When specifying the files to be spooled, the  copies  specified
     in  the  options section may be over-ridden by placing a /N (TYMCOM
     X) or a #N (TYMCOM IX) after the file names, where N will stand for
     the number of copies to be made of the file.

             FILEA,FILEB/3,FILEC,FILED/10


     2.  When spooling, if a delivery mode is specified that requires  a
     delivery address to be entered, the delivery address may be located
     in a file and specified as such by entering @filename (TYMCOM X) or
     .filename  (TYMCOM  IX)  when  asked for the delivery address.  The
     address will then be taken from the file specified.  All address's,
     whether taken from the terminal or from a file should be restricted
     to a maximum of 6 lines, 40 characters per line and be in the basic
     format of:

              YOUR NAME
              COMPANY NAME
              STREET ADDRESS
              CITY, STATE       ZIP

                              CONVENTIONS

          In this document the following conventions apply:

          <number>     Refers to SPOOL Request Number
          [option]     The option need not be specified

          All commands and subcommands may be shortened  to  any  length
     which  insures uniqueness.  In examples in this document, lowercase
     characters represent input, uppercase is output.


                            THE SPOOL SYSTEM

          SPOOL is a system which copies files from a  user's  directory
     and,  without  the  intervention  of an operator, applies the print
     switches requested by the user and prints the files on the printer.
     SPOOL  also allows the user to determine the status of his requests
     and to cancel any outstanding requests.  To enter the SPOOL system,
     type the following:

     -SPOOL          on TYMCOM IX systems

     -R SPOOL        on TYMCOM X systems




                             REQUEST STATUS

          All requests in the SPOOL system have a status associated with
     them.  They are:

     PEND           The request has not yet been printed
     PROC           The request is in the process of being printed
     CANC           The request has been canceled by the user
     COMP           The request has been printed



                            PRINTER LOCATION

          All requests are to be printed either at a computer center  or
     on  a  remote  printer.   To  indicate this in the status commands,
     SPOOL prints the location information as follows:

     CEN            To be printed at a computer center
     REM            To be printed on a remote printer

                   Spooling a file - the SPOOL command

          In order to spool files the user must enter the  SPOOL  system
     and  give the SPOOL command.  The spool command will cause a series
     of questions to be printed which must be answered.  Example 1 gives
     a  typical terminal session with SPOOL.  The questions in the SPOOL
     command are described below.


     REQUESTED BY:

          This should be the requester's name.  This information will be
     printed on the header page of the listing.


     PROJECT CODE:

          The project code is used for accounting purposes.  A  carriage
     return may be used to indicate no project code.


     TELEPHONE NUMBER:

          This should be a telephone number at which the  requester  may
     be reached in the event that the job is unable to be completed.


     FORMS:

          This should be the type of paper to be used  in  printing  the
     request.  Available forms are (width by length):

     SMALL      11 by 9
     BIG        14 by 11
     LARGE      14 by 11
     TTY        8 1/2 by 11
     SPECIAL    FOR SPECIAL FORMS


     PARTS:

          This should be the number of parts of  paper  to  be  used  in
     printing the request.  Available types are 1, 2, 3 or 4 part paper.
     If multiple part paper is requested, the requester will be asked if
     the forms should be decollated prior to delivery.

                                  USER'S MANUAL


     OPTIONS:

          If any special actions need to be taken regarding  the  format
     of  the  files  spooled,  or  the  location  that  the job is to be
     printed, they must be entered in response to  this  request.   Only
     valid  options  are  accepted.  Options are separated by commas and
     input is terminated by a carriage return.  Options are as follows:

     DOUBLE         Provides double spacing between lines.
     FULLCH         Printout requires 96 character printer.
                    Not a vaild option on requests to TYMCOM-IX
                    Computer Centers.
     INDENT=        Amount of margin from left side of page. 
                    Default is zero.  Maximun is 35.
     HEAD           Provide headings and page numbers.
     LINES=         Number of lines before automatically
                    providing a top of form.
                    Defaults are    TYMCOM-IX     TYMCOM-X
                    BIG, LARGE, TTY    54            60
                    SMALL              39            45
     COPIES=        Number of times to print each file spooled.
                    Default is 1.
                    When copies are greater than 1, the files will
                    be printed sequentially, i.e. A, B, C, A, B, C, etc.
     CENTER         Force printing to high speed printers
                    at computer center.
     REMOTE         Print files on a remote printer.  This is
                    the default.
     FORTRAN        TYMCOM-X only.  Provides Fortran carriage control
                    conversion for all files spooled.

     The following two options are for indicating the requesters
     desire to have his request printed at some other remote location.

     NODE=          Request will be printed at the remote printer
                    associated with the node indicated.
                    See special note at end of manual.
     TRANSFER       To be used in place of the NODE command when the
                    node number is not known.  The desired print
                    location will be asked at a later time.


     TRANSFER LOCATION:  

          This is asked if the TRANSFER option was used.  At this  point
     you  should  enter  the  location  of  where  you  want the request
     printed.  A city and state  are  all  that  is  needed.   Input  is
     limited to 24 characters and is terminated by a carriage return.

                                  USER'S MANUAL


     DELIVER BY:

          The  means  by  which  the  user  will  receive  the  listing.
     Available choices are:

     MAIL           Send by US mail
     COURIER        Send by courier service
     AIR EXPRESS    Send by air express company
     PICKUP         The listing is to be picked up by the user.
                    The system will type an address of where
                    the listing can be picked up.

     For all responses other than PICKUP, the system will  request  that
     you type the delivery address, ended by a control D.


     ADDITIONAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS:

          This section allows the  user  to  enter  any  extra  delivery
     instructions  that  will  assist  in  delivery of the output.  This
     section should not be used for additional printing instructions.  A
     carriage return to this question is a null response.  For any other
     response, the information must be terminated by a control-D.


     FILES:

          File specifications are entered separated by spaces, commas or
     linefeeds.    This   input  is  terminated  by  a  carriage  return
     immediately following  a  file  specification.   A  maximum  of  20
     specifications may be made in a request.

          File specifications are considered to be individual file names
     and command files.  Command files may also be used to supply a list
     of file names to be spooled.  To use this feature, the  user  types
     an  at  sign  (@) (TYMCOM-X) or a period (.) (TYMCOM-IX) before the
     file name.  In this mode the restriction on the maximum  number  of
     files  is  not  enforced,  and  files are spooled until the list is
     exhausted.

          Wild characters (* and #) are  allowed  on  TYMCOM-X  but  are
     restricted  to  the  file name and are not allowed in the extension
     area.


     REENTER FILES NOT SPOOLED?

          This message will be printed only if any files specified could
     not be located, could not be opened for input, or were not symbolic
     (TYMCOM-IX only).  The user must type either a YES or NO answer.  A
                                  SPOOL DOCUMENTATION             Page 6
                                  USER'S MANUAL


     NO answer will enter the request as it stands at that point.  A YES
     answer  repeats  the  FILES:   request.   Files   already   spooled
     correctly need not be reentered.

          An escape at this point will cancel the request.


     REQUEST NUMBER

          This section contains information concerning the request  that
     may  be  important to the requester.  The request number is used in
     determining the status of the request using the STATUS,  REPORT  or
     LIST commands.  Confirmation of the number of files spooled and the
     number of pages that the user will be charged for the  request  are
     printed  out also.  This section also contains the current date and
     time.

                         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

     1.  SPOOL does not print files from the user's directory  but  from
     SPOOL's directory.  Therefore, a user may delete spooled files from
     his directory if he so wishes.  It should be  remembered  that  the
     user cannot retrieve his files back from the spooler.

     2.  Should the  user  attempt  to  escape  while  files  are  being
     spooled, the program will halt spooling and cancel the request.

     3.  Files are printed in the sequence that they were spooled.

          The following applies only to the TYMCOM-X systems.

          Besides the ability to run the  SPOOL  system  from  the  EXEC
     level  by  doing  a R SPOOL, there is also the ability to run SPOOL
  a a Fortran subroutine call.  There are two different calls which
     may  be made, CSPOOL and FSPOOL.  The difference between the two is
     that when calling via CSPOOL, a QUIT command will log the user off,
     while  FSPOOL  will  return  the  user  to the EXEC.  When SPOOL is
     called via one of these two  calls,  there  is  no  return  to  the
     calling Fortran program.

          When using these calls, input to the  SPOOL  system  is  taken
     from  a  file and output from the SPOOL system can be directed to a
     file or to the users  terminal.   Thus  when  using  these  Fortran
     calls,  two  parameters  are expected, i.e., the names of the input
     and output files.  The name TTY:  may be substituted for the output
     file  name,  in  which  case  output  will be directed to the users
     terminal.  If either of the two parameters  are  missing  or  zero,
     default  input  and output names will be assumed.  The defaults are
     INPUT.SPL and OUTPUT.SPL.  If the output file does not  exist,  one
     will be created or if it does exist, output will be appended to it.
     If the input or output file cannot be used, an error  message  will
     appear on the users terminal and a QUIT command will be executed.

          Some examples of the Fortran calls to SPOOL  would  look  like
     this:

           CALL CSPOOL
           CALL FSPOOL('TEST.IN','TTY:')
           CALL CSPOOL(0,'TTY:')
           CALL FSPOOL('TEST.IN')
           CALL CSPOOL('(JOHNDOE)TEST.IN','(GEOSMITH)')


          The input and output  to  the  SPOOL  system  when  using  the
     Fortran  calls  is  slightly different than when running SPOOL from
     the EXEC level (R SPOOL).  The following are the differences:

     SPOOL Command
       (1)  On input with the SPOOL command, a short message may
            follow the actual command.  This message will be echoed
            to the users specified output device.
            This message is terminated by a carriage return.
       (2)  On output, none of the SPOOL command questions or user
            supplied answers will be echoed to the output device.
            Only the pickup address (if any), the files spooled and
            the request number information will be output to the
            users device.

                                  USER'S MANUAL


     REPORT Command
       (1)  On input, for those subcommands which require a
            user supplied date, the date will not be asked or accepted.
            It will automatically be assumed to be the first of the
            previous month.
       (2)  On output, no differences.

     CANCEL Command
       (1)  On input, no date confirmation is asked or accepted.
       (2)  No output differences.

     WHERE Command
       (1)  On input, no date confirmation is asked or accepted.
       (2)  No output differences.


          There is an additional command which is only  accessible  when
     SPOOL is called via the CSPOOL or FSPOOL Fortran calls.

     RUN Command

          This command may be used in lieu of  the  QUIT  command.   The
     purpose  of  the RUN command is to start the program specified.  If
     this command fails, a QUIT command will be executed.

          Also, if the input file terminates and no QUIT or RUN  command
     has been issued, a QUIT command will be assumed.

          Note:  The NODE= option should be used only when the user  has
     a  Remote-Node  listing for reference.  This list of Remote Printer
     locations and their associated nodes  may  be  obtained  from  your
     Tymshare representative.  When referencing the list, there are some
     instances where the  same  node  will  be  used  at  two  different
     locations.  The only difference being that at one location the node
     number is followed by a "+".   Should  you  pick  a  location  that
     specifies a node number followed by a "+", the "+" must be included
     when entering the number.  Exclusion of the "+" when specified will
     cause the request to be spooled to the other remote location.

                                  CSPOOL.MAC

        The purpose of this program is to allow the user to run
        the SPOOL system under SYS with a subroutine call from
        a FORTRAN program.  The program has two entry points:
        CSPOOL and FSPOOL.

        When a QUIT or implied QUIT command (end of input file before
        QUIT command) is received, an entry via CSPOOL will cause the user
        to be logged off the system.  A QUIT command received via FSPOOL
        entry will cause the user to be returned to the Exec.
        
        There is no return to the calling FORTRAN program once the
        subroutine call is issued.
        
        This routine will accept a maximum of two parameters which
        are considered to be the file names that the SPOOL system is
        to work with.  User names may be attached to the file names in
        the usual way.  The program will validate the user names
        before going to the SPOOL system.
        
        The program also does a GETTAB to get the user's and the running
        program's license, which is also passed to the SPOOL system.
        
        The program then transfers the built buffer to registers
        5 - 14 and does a RUN UUO on the SPOOL system.  The built
        buffer or registers 5 - 14 look like this:
