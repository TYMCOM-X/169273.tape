	BIONIC IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL ACCEPT INPUT FROM THE FOLLOWING
DEVICES:  CASSETTE, PAPER TAPE READER, TERMINAL CARD READER, AND REMOTE
CARD READER.

	THE USER STARTS THE PROGRAM GOING BY TYPING 'R BIONIC', FOLLOWED
BY THE 'RUN' COMMAND WHEN THE PROGRAM PROMPT (*) APPEARS.
A LIST OF VALID COMMANDS MAY BE OBTAINED BY ENTERING THE COMMAND 'HELP'.

	UPON RECEIVING THE 'RUN' COMMAND, THE PROGRAM WILL PROMPT
THE USER FOR THE FILE NAME TO BE GIVEN TO THE INPUT RECEIVED.
IF THE USER IS RUNNING FROM A 2780 TYPE DEVICE, THE CARD GIVING THE
FILE NAME MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A CARD TO HALT THE CARD READER
TEMPORARILY TO ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO DO SOME HOUSEKEEPING BEFORE
BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT INPUT.

	WHEN THE PROGRAM IS READY FOR INPUT, THE MESSAGE 'READY
FOR INPUT' WILL BE PUT TO THE USER'S TERMINAL.  AT THIS POINT THE
USER SHOULD READY THE DEVICE SO THAT THE DATA WILL BE TRANSMITTED.

	THE FOLLOWING IS THE COMMAND SEQUENCE FOR RUNNING BIONIC.

	1.  R BIONIC

	2.  RUN

	3.  FILENAME	(THIS IS THE FILE NAME TO BE CREATED FOR THE
			 INPUT AND IS IN RESPONSE TO THE 'OUTPUT TO'
			 QUERY.)

    NOTE:  FOR COPE TERMINALS A /$ CARD MUST BE LOCATED
	AT THIS POINT FOLLOWING THE FILENAME CARD.  THIS ALLOWS THE
        TYMCOM-X TO SET UP THE FILE FOR ACCEPTING THE
        INPUT.  OTHER REMOTE BATCH TERMINALS WILL HAVE TO PAUSE AT THIS
        POINT USING THE TERMINAL'S STANDARD WAY OF TEMPORARILY STOPPING
        ITS CARD READER.

    NOTE:  ON SOME REMOTE BATCH TERMINAL DEVICES, THE READER (OR
	SIMULATED READER) GOING EMPTY SHUTS OFF THE READER AND SENDS
	THE NECESSARY EOT (END OF TRANSMISSION).  IF THIS IS NOT
	THE CASE WITH YOUR DEVICE, THE LAST RECORD IN THE INPUT
	MUST PERFORM THAT FUNCTION.

	WHEN THE LAST RECORD HAS BEEN READ, A TIME LAPSE OF ABOUT
10 SECONDS WILL GO BY BEFORE THE PROGRAM RESPONDS BACK TO THE TERMINAL.
AT THAT TIME, A MESSAGE WILL APPEAR TELLING HOW MANY RECORDS WERE
READ AS INPUT.  EACH RECORD IN THE FILE WILL BE TERMINATED BY A
CARRIAGE RETURN AND A LINE FEED.
