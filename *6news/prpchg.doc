  This document assists the user in making changes to command files which  ran
  under  the  Tymshare PERP system, so they can run under the new Tymcom-X Job
  Processor System.  The following is a list of commands  to  PERP  and  their
  implementation  in  the Job Processor, followed by a list of commands to the
  Job Processor which do not have equivalent commands in PERP.



                 Implementation of PERP Command File Commands
                     in the Tymcom-X Job Processor System


  PERP Command                    Job Processor Implementation
  ------------                    ----------------------------
  :<command>                      Same.  Colon (:) prefix precedes all
                                  commands to the Job Processor.

  ::<label>                       Same.  Additional (preferred) format:
                                    <label>:: 

  :<logfile name>                 Ignored.  Logfile name is now specified in
                                  INSERT command, when running SUBMIT.

  :<var>=[1 | 0]                  Changed.  Now used to assign value to
                                  parameter.  Now same as :DEFINE command,
                                  which is preferred.  Formats:
                                    :<para>= "<string>"
                                    :<para>= '<string>'

  :AFTER <expression>             Ignored.  (Not needed.)
     [THEN <command>]

  :CONTINUE                       Ignored. (Not needed.)

  :DEFINE                         Changed. Now used to assign value to
     <var>='<string>'             parameter.  Formats:
                                    :DEFINE <para>= "<string>"
                                    :DEFINE <para>= '<string>'

  :ESCAPE                         Same.

  :FIND <var>,[<var>, ...]        Ignored.

  :GO <label>                     Changed.  Cannot be part of :AFTER ... , 
                                  :IF ...  , or :UNLESS ... commands 
                                  (they're not currently implemented).
                                  Slight format change:
                                    :GOTO <label>      (label following)
                                    :GO <label>        (label following)
                                    :BACKTO <label>    (label preceding)

  :IF <expression>                Not currently implemented.  Ignored.
     THEN <command>

  :LOOK <expression>              Ignored. (Not needed.)

  :PAUSE                          Ignored. (Not needed.)

  :QUIT                           Same.

  :RESTART <minutes>              Not implemented.  Ignored.

  :STOP                           Same as :QUIT.  (The pause is not needed.)

  :TIME <minutes>                 Same function.  Slight format change:
                                    :TIMELIMIT <minutes>
                                    (Old format is valid abbreviation.)

  :UNLESS <expression>            Not currently implemented.  Ignored.
     THEN <command>

  :WAIT                           Ignored.  (Not needed.)


  ----------------

  NOTE:

  PERP control files will generally run under  control  of  the  Tymcom-X  Job
  Processor,  with  few  changes.  However, the line of the command file which
  names the log file (if used, the first line)  should  be  removed  from  the
  file.  This line cause no action, except an error report (question marks).

  Any PERP commands in this list that are not currently  implemented  will  be
  ignored.   However,  they  may  be  implemented  in  the  future,  with  new
  functionality.  To avoid any problems, take them out of your  command  files
  before running the command files under the Tymcom-X Job Processor system.

  Any PERP commands that are not recognized by the new system  will  cause  an
  error.   Currently  this  error  is  only  reported,  as two question marks.
  However, in the future it could cause the job to abort.

  A VARIABLE, as used in PERP, does not exist in the new Job Processor System.
  Variable  string values are not used for comparisons in searching "terminal"
  output.

                        Commands For The Job Processor
                     With No Equivalent Commands In PERP


  Job Processor Command                Function
  ---------------------                --------
  .<command to monitor>           Period (.)  prefix cause job processor to
                                  send command only to the monitor.

  *<command to program>           Asterisk (*) prefix causes job processor to
                                  send line only to a users' program.

  =<command to program>           Equals sign (=) prefix causes job processor
                                  to send line only to a users' program,
                                  without the terminating carriage-return.

  :COM <file id> <parameters>     Begin taking commands from the named command
                                  file, passing the listed parameters to it.

  :PARAMETERS <parameter list>    Define strings in list as parameter names.

  :REMARK                         A comment.  Ignored.

  :REVIVE                         Turn back on logging which has been turned
                                  off with :SILENCE.

  :SEND CHARACTER <nnn>           Transmit character represented by octal
                                  number <nnn>.

  :SEND FILE <file>               Transmit the contents of <file>.

  :SEND STRING "<text>"           Transmit the literal string <text>.

  :SILENCE                        Turn off logging (if log file is being
                                  written to).


  ----------------

  NOTE:

  Parameters are used in the Tymcom-X Job Processor System.  These  parameters
  are  given  initial  values  in  the  command  file, but these values may be
  changed  by  specifying  parameter  values  when  submitting  a  job.   (See
  Parameters Option in Reference Manual.) Changes to parameters, such as which
  label is the object of a GOTO or what are the names of  files  to  store  to
  tape,  can  allow one command file to be used to perform many jobs which are
  quite similar but not exactly alike.

  Any command files executed by the Job Processor's  command  file  running  a
  program  such  as  COM,  any  user's  copy of COM, or AFDCOM or PCOM, can be
  easily and  successfully  run  with  the  Tymcom-X  Job  Processor  System's
  ":COM <file id>"  command.   This  method  of running command files does not
  have the problem with royalty packages that  PCOM  has,  and  is  much  more
  dependable than the COM program and its variations.

  All processing of command files in the  new  system  employs  Tymnet's  flow
  control  protocol  (orange  ball-yellow ball logic) to permit the sending of
  each line of the command file only when  the  job  is  ready  for  it.   The
  characters  used  are  not  seen  by the user's job.  This is in contrast to
  PERP, which sent a printable character  to  the  job  and  paused  until  it
  returned.   The character used by PERP could affect some programs, so PERP's
  flow control had to be turned off under  some  circumstances,  and  required
  special commands to turn it off or back on when needed.
