                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Please feel free to call  the  sales  department  of  the  Boston
Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

To run the 9900 cross assembler, at the monitor level type:

     -R CA9900      _ ______

The assembler will respond with the following:

     9900 Cross Assembler Version 1(107)
     Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc. 1977
     (617) 894-7800
     Type /H for help
     *
At the asterisk, type:

     *PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________________

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST  are  the  object  and  listing  files  the
assembler  will  create  and PROG.SRC is the source program being
assembled.  If file name extensions are  desired,  they  must  be
specified  explicitly,  there  are  no  defaults.   The filenames
PROG.OBJ, PROG.SRC and PROG.LST are  used  for  example  purposes
only.   Any  acceptable  file names and extensions desired may be
used.

If either the object or listing file is not desired,  it  may  be
omitted   from  the  specification,  as  the  following  examples
illustrate:

     *PROG.OBJ=PROG.SRC      _________________

     *,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC      __________________

Note that the comma is required when a listing  file  is  desired
but not an object file.

Switches now available:

     /H - type help text
     /L - enlarge symbol table by 1K,
          may be repeated
     /P - announce when pass 2 begins
     /S - include symbols in object file

3.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION    ______ _______ ___________

PROGRAM ENTRY

Source programs may be placed on the host computer disk either by
the use of a text editor, to build new programs, or by reading in
an existing file from paper tape, magtape, etc.  Once  a  program
resides on disk a text editor may be used to alter or correct the
file in preparation for assembly.  It is not necessary to  remove
line  numbers  from  a  file before assembly;  the assembler will
ignore them if they are present.


PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source statement consists of  strings  of  ASCII  characters
(fields)   terminated   by   a   carriage   return - line   feed.
Statements,  or  lines,  of  more  than  60  characters  will  be
truncated.   Lines beginning with an asterisk (*) will be treated
as comments.  Blank lines and lines with only a label field  will
generate  no  code.  Any label on such a line will be assigned to
the current location value.  Each source statement is made up  of
four fields:  the label, instruction, operand and comment fields,
which are defined below.

Label Field - A statement label consists of up to  6  characters,_____ _____
the  first  of which must be alphabetic and appear in column one.
The remaining characters may be alphabetic or numeric.  More than
6  characters  may  be  entered  but  the  7th and beyond will be
ignored by  the  assembler.   A  label  identifies  a  particular
location in the program and should not duplicate another label or
one of the register names, R0 thru R15.

The label field is optional except in statements with an  EQU  or
$MACRO instuction, which require a label.

Instruction Field - The instruction field must contain either  an___________ _____
instruction  mnemonic,  a pseudo op, a 16-bit number, or the name
of a user defined macro (i.e., a macro call).  The field must  be
separated from the preceding label field by at least one space or
tab and may not start in column one.

Operand Field - The operand field, if required,  may  consist  of_______ _____
constants,  statement  labels,  the  instruction  counter  ($) or
labels EQUated to values.  These elements may  be  combined  into
expressions  with arithmetic operators, as described below.  This
field must be separated from the instruction field  by  at  least
one space or tab.

Comment Field - This field is optional;  it will  appear  on  the_______ _____
assembly  listing  but  will  be  ignored  by the assembler.  The
comment field must be separated from  the  instruction  field  by
either an operand plus a space (or tab) or by tabs or spaces.
                                                           Page 8


EXPRESSIONS

Expressions can be  made  up  of  user  symbols,  numbers,  ASCII
constants,  statement  labels  and assembler reserved symbols for
the registers and instruction counter.   These  elements  may  be
combined  by  the  various operators to form complex expressions.
The expression handling and operators available are a function of
the assembler.

Symbols - Any alphanumeric  symbol  which  has  been  used  as  a_______
statement  label  or  equated  to  a  value  may  be  used  in an
expression.  In addition, the instruction  counter  ($)  and  the
register symbols (R0 thru R15) may be used.

Numeric Constants - Numeric constants are assumed to  be  decimal_______ _________
unless  they  are preceded by a greater than sign (>) to indicate
hexidecimal, as in the following example:  >F8 .

ASCII Constants - An ASCII constant is represented by one or  two_____ _________
characters enclosed in apostrophes.  For example, 'N' or 'NA' .

Operators - The operators available for constructing  expressions_________
are  the binary operators +, -, * and /.  Expressions using these
operators will be evaluated from left to right, in all cases.

5.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO OPS)    _________ __________ _______ ____

This cross assembler recognizes  the  following  pseudo  ops.   A
detailed  explanation of each may be obtained by referring to the
microprocessor manufacturer's programming manual and chapters 6.0
and 7.0 of this manual.


          AORG    END     RORG
          BES     EQU     TEXT
          BSS     EVEN    TITL
          BYTE    IDT     UNL
          DATA    LIST    $MACRO
          DEF     PAGE    $END
          DORG    OPTION  $IF
          DXOP    REF     $ENDIF

                                                          Page 11


6.0 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY    ___________ ________

Portions of a program can be assembled or not depending upon  the
value  of  an  expression.  This is accomplished by preceding the
conditional section of code with a statement containing  the  $IF
pseudo  op  and  the  expression  to  be evaluated and ending the
section with the pseudo op $ENDIF.  This is useful for  producing
several versions of the same program from a single source file by
changing only one parameter.

The expression following the $IF pseudo op will be  evaluated  by
the assembler and the results compared to zero.  If the result is
not zero the code will be assembled.  If the result is zero,  all
the  code  up  to  the  matching  $ENDIF  statement  is  ignored.
Conditional statements may be nested indefinitely.




Example of a conditional section of code:


          $IF     VER-1   DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE     EQU     6
          $ENDIF
          $IF     VER     DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE     EQU     8
          $ENDIF






In the above example, if VER had been EQUated to 1, HSIZE will be
EQUated  to  8.   If  VER  equals  anything  but 1, HSIZE will be
EQUated to 6.
                                                          Page 12


7.0 MACRO STATEMENTS    _____ __________

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by just writing the macro  name
in the instruction field.  This makes it possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

MNAME     $MACRO  DUM1,DUM2,...
            .
            .
          $END

where MNAME is the name of the macro and DUM1,DUM2,...  are  from
zero  to fifteen dummy argument names.  Dummy argument names have
no  meaning  outside  a  macro  definition.   Within  the   macro
definition  they  may  appear  anywhere  (in  any  field) and all                                                              ___
occurrences of a dummy argument will be replaced  by  the  actual
argument  strings  when  the  macro  is used.  Replacement in the
macro body will be done in the order of appearance of  the  dummy
arguments.   In  the  last example on page 10, the dummy argument
'AB' in the macro body  will  not  be  found  because  the  prior
argument, 'A', will be replaced first.

Macro definitions are stored in the symbol table.  if this causes
the  symbol  table  to  overflow, use the /L switch.  A macro may
contain calls to other previously defined macros, for up  to  ten
deep.

Macro calls are of the form:

LABEL     MNAME   ARG1,ARG2,...

where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual  arguments  (ARG1,ARG2,...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
commas.   Arguments omitted from a macro call are treated as null
strings;  extra arguments are ignored.  Notice that arguments can
be  expressions,  instruction  mnemonics,  comments or labels for
statements inside the macro expansion.  The  macro  processor  is
only  concerned  with  character  strings, which it passes to the
rest  of  the  assembler.   The  only   characters   illegal   in
aurguements are linefeeds, formfeeds, and altmodes.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 13


MACRO EXAMPLES


PAUSE     $MACRO          WAIT 4 MACHINE CYCLES
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          $END




BUILD 4 CHARACTER TABLE ENTRIES
ENTRY     $MACRO  M,N,O,P,VALUE
          BYTE    'M'
          BYTE    'N'
          BYTE    'O'
          BYPE    'P'
          BYTE    VALUE
          $END


An example of a macro ca build entry WXYZ using  the  second
example above:

WXYZ      ENTRY   W,X,Y,Z,27


This would result in the following expansion:

          BYTE    'W'
          BYTE    'X'
          BYTE    'Y'
          BYTE    'Z'
          BYTE    27



The following is an example of the substitution order:


EXAMP     $MACRO  A,AB    MACRO DEFINITION
          BYTE    'AB'
          $END


TEST      EXAMP   2,18    MACRO CALL


          BYTE    '2B'    MACRO EXPANSION

8.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT    ______ ____ ______

The object file produced by this cross assembler is an ASCII file
in  the  standard Texas Instrument object record format, which is
described below:

       1 char     Tag
       4 chars    Hexadecimal field
  6 to 8 chars    Second field

Each object record consists of a number of 'tag' characters, each
followed  by  one  or  two  fields,  depending  upon  the tag, as
described in the following table.   Each  record  has  up  to  71
characters,  the  last  six of which are the tag '7', followed by
the checksum and the tag 'F', for end-of-record.


    TAG      HEXADECIMAL FIELD              SECOND FIELD

     0       length of all reloc code       8-char prog label
     1       entry address (absolute)       none
     2       entry address (relocatable)    none
     3       loc of last use of sym (rel)   6-char symbol
     4       loc of last use of sym (abs)   6-char symbol
     5       loc (rel ext ref)              6-char symbol

9.0 ERROR HANDLING    _____ ________

The cross assembler will  print  error  messages  at  the  user's
terminal  and  on  the  program  listing  if the listing file was
requested.  Error codes  appear  in  the  left  hand  margin  and
represent the following errors:


A - Argument has wrong relocatability

D - Attemping to redefine a macro or a pass 2 definition

E - Improper use of an external

F - Form error during an expression evaluation

I - Invalid character found on input

J - Jump address is an odd byte

L - No label on an EQU or MACRO statement

M - Multiple definition of symbol

N - Nesting error on conditions or macro

O - Operator not defined

P - Phase error, pass 1 value doesn't equal pass 2 value

R - Expression out of range

S - Illegal syntax

T - String or argument list truncated

U - Undefined symbol

W - Expession not clearly defined

*BLECH* - More than seven errors in one line

If an error occurs more  than  once  within  a  line,  its  error
message will print out more than once at the margin.

10.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES     _______ __ ___________

This cross assembler  is  compatible  with  the  cross  assembler
supplied  for the 9900 by Texas Insruments with a few exceptions.
These exceptions are listed below:



     1.  The following features conform to BSO standards and  may
         conflict   with   similar   features   offered   by  the
         manufacturer.

             (A)  Macro Processing
             (B)  Conditional Assembly Directives
             (C)  Listing Control
             (D)  Relocation Directives and Control


     2.  Macros and conditionals are as explained above

     3.  OPTION is a no-op

     4.  All non-characters are legal in  strings  and  character
         constants (7 bit ASCII)

     5.  The legal range of a number includes negative numbers

     6.  A number in the instruction field is considered a 16-bit
         constant


Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
