                       GENERAL INFORMATION

This symbolic  simulator/debugger,  one  of  a  family  of  cross
assemblers and simulator/debuggers produced by The Boston Systems
Office,  is  a  powerful  programming  tool   used   to   develop
microprocessor  software.   It  allows  the  user  to  take  full
advantage of a larger computer,  whether  in  a  time-sharing  or
in-house  mode,  thereby  significantly  reducing  the  number of
man-hours spent in program  development.   The  advantages  of  a
larger computer include:

          .Faster processing speeds
          .More powerful editors
          .Higher speed peripherals

Another advantage, rather critical  on  many  projects,  is  that
program  development  and testing may begin before receipt of the
actual target hardware system.

This simulator is itself written  in  assembly  language  and  is
therefore faster, more efficient and hence, much more economical.

The simulator/debugger consists of  three  discrete  systems,  as
described below:

         .Loader - loads standard format object  code  and  reads
         symbols  from  a  listing  file  produced by BSO'S cross
         assembler.

         .Simulator - a DECsystem10 program  that  simulates  the
         operation of a virtual microprocessor system.

         .Debugger -  a  symbolic  debugger  "invisible"  to  the
         simulated microprocessor.  It allows the user to examine
         and modify interactively  the  program  in  an  absolute
         and/or  symbolic  mode.   It  also gives the user strong
         control over the step-by-step execution of  his  program
         by   the   use   of   trace  printouts  of  any  of  the
         microprocessor registers or memory locations.


The symbolic instruction set of this  simulator/debugger  is  the
same  as documented in the manuals supplied by the microprocessor
manufacturer.  Mnemonics  exist  for  data  manipulation,  binary
arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.


Please feel free to contact The Boston Systems Office for further
information  on  this or any other microprocessor related product
you require for program development.  BSO  also  has  a  complete
line  of  cross-assemblers for all commercial microprocessors and
will produce custom assemblers,  simulator/debuggers,  and  other
system  software  and  microprocessor  applications on a contract
basis.

3.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

To run the S1000 simulator, at the monitor level type:

         -R SI1000          _ ______


The simulator will respond with the following:

         1000 Simulator Version 1C(42)
         Copyright, The Boston Systems Office, Inc.  1976
         (617) 894-7800
         #


The pound  sign  prompt  (#)  indicates  that  the  simulator  is
awaiting  input.  Your first response to this prompt should be as
follows:

         #<LOAD SI1000.OBJ,SI1000.LST          _____ _____________________


The files SI1000.OBJ and  SI1000.LST  represent  the  object  and
listing  files  you  have already created by using the BSO CA1000
cross assembler and which now  reside  on  disk.   The  filenames
SI1000.OBJ  and  SI1000.LST  are  used for example purposes only.
Any filenames and extensions acceptable to the  operating  system
may  be  used.   If no extensions are specified, the program will
default to the extensions .OBJ and .LST respectively.

Full word commands (those beginning with a "<")  begin  execution
when  a  (CR)  is  typed.   Short  commands are executed when the
command character is typed.


4.0 EXPRESSIONS    ___________

Expressions can be made up of symbols and hex numbers.  These may
be  combined  by  the  operators  "+"  or "-".  Symbol values are
evaluated based on the current ROM  reference  mode  (see  "MODE"
command).   All hex numbers must start with a digit (0-9) or will
be considered to be symbols.   Symbols  may  contain  up  to  six
characters and must not begin with a digit.
                                                           Page 7


5.0 OPENING ROM LOCATIONS    _______ ___ _________

     (expr)/    will open the ROM location specified by the
                expression.  The actual location opened is
                based on the current reference mode.

When a ROM  location  is  opened  (examined),  its  contents  are
printed  out  in symbolic form, with a label if one is defined at
that address.  for example, to open  the  second  location  after
"FOO":

     #FOO+2/FOO1:  YNEC 5      _____

Where location FOO+2 contains the  instruction  "YNEC5"  and  the
label "FOO1" is defined at that address.


6.0 OPENING RAM LOCATIONS    _______ ___ _________

     n$/        will open RAM location n.  "n" must be a hex
                number from 00 to 3F.

The high order hex digit (0-3) specifies the  RAM  register,  the
low  order  hex  digit (0-F) specifies one of 16 locations within
that register.  To open RAM location A3, type A3$/.   The  system
will print out the contents of address A3.  For example:

     A3$/68     ____


7.0 OPENING MICRO-CPU REGISTERS    _______ _________ _________

     Reg%       where "Reg" is any one of the following 
                microprocessor registers: PC, PA, PAPC, PB,
                X, Y, XY, A, S, CL, SL, SR, R, O, ETIME
                (see register name table)
                                                           Page 8


8.0  DEPOSITING INTO ROM LOCATIONS     __________ ____ ___ _________

To deposit a specific ROM address, open the  location,  type  the
instruction  (or  hex  value) to be deposited, and then close the
location with either (CR) or (LF).  Either a symbolic instruction
or a hex number (00-FF) can be deposited into ROM.

To put the instruction "BR LOOP" in location FOO+2, type:

     #FOO+2/FOO1:  YNEC 5 BR LOOP (CR)      ______              __ ____ ____

Note that "LOOP" must have been previously defined.


9.0 DEPOSITING INTO RAM LOCATIONS    __________ ____ ___ _________

To deposit into RAM, open the location, type the hex value  (0-F)
to  be deposited, and then close the location with either (CR) or
(LF).  Only a hex number  (0-F)  can  be  deposited  into  a  RAM
location.

To put 3,4,5 into register 1, location A, B, and F:

     #1A$/ 0 3 (LF)      ____     ____
      1B$/ 0 4 (CR)      ____     ____
     #1F$/ 0 5 (CR)      ____     ____


10.0 CLOSING OPEN LOCATIONS     _______ ____ _________

(CR) - closes the currently open location  (if  any),  depositing
into the location anything specified.

(LF) - closes the currently open  location.   The  location+1  is
then  opened and its contents printed.  If the last open location
was in ROM, the next location in ROM  is  opened  (based  on  the
current  "MODE").   If the last open location is in RAM, then the
next location in RAM is opened.   If  a  micro-CPU  register  was
open, nothing is opened.
                                                           Page 9


11.0 ROM REFERENCE     ___ _________

The TI TMS1000 Microcomputer Program Counter doesn't  follow  the
usual  sequential  ordering  of  values.   On  each of the 16 ROM
pages,  the  Program  Counter  follows  a  defined  pseudo-random
sequence.   This  6  bit  program  counter  address  is  in  turn
translated to the actual ROM address.  (See ROM address table.)

The  "MODE"  command  allows  the  programmer  to  consider   the
simulated TMS1000 ROM as being arranged by:

     "SEQ"      the sequence the program actually follows
                (this is the initial setting)

     "PAPC"     the Program counter values

     "LOC"      the actual ROM locations

To change the mode:

     #<MODE arg      _____ ___

where "arg" is SEQ, PAPC or LOC.  To print the current MODE:

     #<MODE      _____
     SEQ
     #


12.0 DEFINING/REDEFINING SYMBOLS     ___________________ _______

A symbol may be defined at the last opened ROM location by typing
the new symbol followed by a ":".  This will not close a location
if one is already open.  For example:

     #3C0/ COMX FOO:  TMA (CR)      ____      ____  ___ ____

will define symbol "FOO" at location 3C0 (in  current  MODE)  and
then deposit "TMA" in that location in place of the COMX.
                                                          Page 10


13.0 BREAKPOINTS     ___________

Breakpoints may be set or cleared at any ROM location.  When  the
program   being  simulated  reaches  a  breakpoint,  the  current
location is printed and control returns to the debugger.

     (expr)$B   will set a breakpoint at the ROM location
                specified by (expr)

     (expr)$$B  will clear a breakpoint at the ROM location
                specified by (expr)

     $B         will set breakpoints at all ROM locations                                        ___

     $$B        will clear all breakpoints

After a breakpoint is reached, program execution may be continued
by  the  use  of  the  $P  or  $$P  command.   For  example,  set
breakpoints at 001, 004 and 005 and start execution at 001:

     #001$B(CR)      _________
     #004$B(CR)      _________
     #005$B(CR)      _________
     #001$G(CR)      _________
     STOP AT 001

The system stopped because breakpoint was set at 001.  $$P  would
then restart execution at that location.  (NOTE:  'P' will always
cause at least one instruction to be executed.)

14.0 TRACEPOINTS     ___________

A trace  printout  will  occur  whenever  the  simulated  program
reaches a tracepoint (see "TRACE" command).

     (expr)$T   will set a tracepoint at the ROM location
                specified by (expr)

     (expr)$$T  will clear a tracepoint at the ROM location
                specified by (expr)

     $T         sets tracepoints at all ROM locations                                    ___

     $$T        will clear all breakpoints

Note that program execution must have started with a $G or $P  if
printout   is   to   occur  at  tracepoints.   For  example,  set
tracepoints at 004 and 005, execute instructions with TRACE,  and
begin executions at 001.

     #004$T      _____
     #005$T      _____
     #006$B      _____
     #001$G      _____
     004 00F 03C
     005 01F 03F
     STOP AT 006

                                                          Page 11


15.0 TRACE COMMAND     _____ _______

The TRACE command sets up the output form  for  trace  printouts.
The  user  may  select  any  of the items listed in the table for
trace output.

     #<TRACE (args)     where (args) is a list of registers      ______ ______

For example, to set trace printout to be two lines of the form:

     Program Counter
     Instruction

     #<TRACE PC, CR, INST      ______ ___ ___ ____

To obtain the current trace list:

     #<TRACE      ______
     PC CR INST
     #


16.0 EXECUTION CONTROL     _________ _______

The simulator can be instructed to execute  the  program  at  any
starting  location  and  proceed,  with  or  without  tracing  at
tracepoints, through a given number  of  either  instructions  or
breakpoints.   In  each case, trace information will be generated
with one escape (or dollar sign) as a prefix to the command,  and
not  generated with two escapes (or dollar signs) as a prefix.  G
is the  command  to  start  execution,  therefore  the  following
commands are possible:

     #n$G       means GO, starting at location n

     #$G        means power-up start

With both commands, trace information will be  generated  at  any
tracepoints  that  have been set.  If two escapes or dollar signs
had been typed instead of one, no traces would be  printed.   'P'
instructs the simulator to proceed to the next breakpoint, if the
P is preceded by a number, e.g., 10$P, proceed through that  many
(in our example, 16) breakpoints.  X works the same way as P only
X means execute so many instructions rather than breakpoints.

17.0 KEYBOARD DEFINITION     ________ __________

A matrix keyboard can be defined by the command "<KEY",  followed
by the key being defined, followed by a list of K-R connections.

To define the key "A" to connect K-input line 3 to R-output  line
5 and also K-input 3 to R-output 0, type:

     #<KEY A 3-5, 3-0      ____ _ ____ ___

Up to forty keys may be defined in this way.

Any key may be redefined at  any  time  by  typing  the  new  key
specification.

The command "CLRKEY"  will  delete  all  previously  defined  key
definitions.

The keys will stay down  for  a  defined  number  of  instruction
times.  This time is defined by the command "<KEYDWN" followed by
the number of cycles  keys  stay  down.   The  following  defines
keydown time to be 3FF16 cycles:

     #<KEYDWN 3FF      _______ ___


18.0 SWITCH DEFINITION     ______ __________

In addition to momentary key connections, K-input  lines  may  be
"permanently"  connected  to  R-output  lines  with  the  "<ONSW"
instruction followed by a list of K-R connections.

To connect K3 to R0 and K1 to R9:

     #<ONSW 3-0, 1-9      _____ ____ ___

To clear a  connection  (disconnect),  use  the  command  "OFFSW"
followed  by  a  list  of  K-R  connections.  To clear connection
K-3-R0:

     #<OFFSW 3-0      ______ ___

The command "<CLRSW" will disconnect all K-R connections.

The "<KINPUT" command followed by a hex digit will set that value
on  the K-input lines.  "<KINPUT" with no argument will clear the
K-input lines.  NOTE:  the "<KINPUT" command will also clear  any
key that may be down.
