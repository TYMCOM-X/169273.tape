                       GENERAL INFORMATION

The Boston Systems Office offers a family of extremely  effective
microprocessor   software   development  tools.   These  products
(cross-assembler, cross-compilers, simulator/debuggers, and other
products)  allow the user to take full advantage of the speed and
versatility of  microprocessor  program  development  on  a  host
computer,  thereby  significantly reducing the number of hours or
days spent in program development.   The  advantages  of  a  host
system  versus  a  microprocessor-based  development  programming
system include:

          - Faster processing speeds
          - More powerful editors
          - Multi-user capability
          - Higher speed peripherals
          - Multi-microprocessor capability on one system
          - Lower station cost in multi-user configurations

BSO/PASCAL is a new product of the BSO line  of  cross-compilers,
which has been specially optimized for microprocessor application
design.  Its benefits include faster software development through
the  use of a high-level language and a much higher percentage of
error-free code  because  of  PASCAL's  particular  capabilities.
Other advantages are simplified program maintenance due to better
program readability and a  recompilation  capability  which  will
permit  one source language program to be compiled for any number
of  suitable  microprocessors.   BSO/PASCAL  supports   interrupt
handling   instructions,   record-oriented   variables,  enhanced
microprocessor statements, extensive compiler-generated  comments
and many other features.

BSO's cross assemblers, unlike most other similar  products,  are
written  in  the  assembly  language  of the host computer.  They
generally require no more than 10-18K words of memory to assemble
any  program.   The  comprehensive  program  symbol  table can be
expanded for any program requirement or selectively condensed for
a  smaller  system,  as  required.  These assemblers require much
less  CPU  time  to  execute,  even  at   this   reduced   memory
requirement,  than manufacturer-supplied cross-assemblers written
in higher-level languages such as  Fortran.   Benchmarks  against
competitive  cross-assemblers  in  a timesharing environment have
shown that time  savings  of  up  to  50%  are  common.   Similar
efficiencies   can  also  be  realized  when  using  an  in-house
computer.

                                                           Page 3


The instruction set accepted by each cross-assembler is the  same
as  documented  in  the  assembly language manual supplied by the
microprocessor   manufacturer.    Mnemonics   exist   for    data
manipulation,  binary  arithmetic, jumps to subroutines, etc.  In
addition, all of  BSO's  cross-assemblers  have  full  macro  and
extended  conditional  assembly  capabilities.   The  object file
produced can then be processed by BSO's compatible  cross-linkage
editor, along with other relocatable and absolute object modules.
The assembled code can then be loaded directly  to  any  standard
peripheral  device  on  the  system.   The  absolute  load module
produced by the cross-linkage editor  can  be  punched  on  paper
tape,  loaded into a PROM burner, or downline loaded into memory,
depending on the available facilities.   The  assembler  is  also
capable  of  producing  an  object  format with additional symbol
information,  suitable  for  input  to  one  of  BSO's  companion
integrated symbolic simulator/debuggers.

Cross assemblers are now available for  all  major  manufacturers
including   Advanced   MicroDevices,   AMI,  Fairchild,  Fujitsu,
Hitachi,  Intel,  Intersil,  MOS  Technology,  Mostek,  Motorola,
National  Semiconductor, NEC, RCA, Rockwell, Signetics, Synertek,
Thomson-CSF, Texas Instruments, Zilog and others.

Please feel free to call  the  sales  department  of  the  Boston
Systems  Office  at (617) 894-7800 for further information on any
microprocessor including those not mentioned above.

1.0 OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS    _________ ____________

TO RUN THE Z80 CROSS ASSEMBLER, AT THE MONITOR LEVEL TYPE:

     -R CAZ80      _ _____

THE ASSEMBLER WILL RESPOND WITH THE FOLLOWING:

     Z80 CROSS ASSEMBLER VERSION 2A(137)
     COPYRIGHT, THE BOSTON SYSTEMS OFFICE, INC. 1976
     (617) 894-7800
     TYPE /H FOR HELP
     *

AT THE ASTERISK, TYPE:

     *PROG.OBJ,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC/(switch)      ___________________________________

PROG.OBJ and PROG.LST  are  the  object  and  listing  files  the
assembler  will  create  and PROG.SRC is the source program being
assembled.  If specific file name extensions are desired they may
be  entered.   If  extensions  are not entered the assembler will
default to .OBJ, .LST and .Z80 for the object, listing and source
files  respectively.   If no extensions are desired, a period (.)
must follow the filenames.  The filenames PROG.OBJ, PROG.SRC  and
PROG.LST are used for example purposes only.  Any acceptable file
names and extensions  desired  may  be  used.   The  use  of  the
switches, detailed below, is optional.

If either the object or listing file is not desired,  it  may  be
omitted   from  the  specification,  as  the  following  examples
illustrate:

     *PROG.OBJ=PROG.SRC/(switch)      __________________________

     *,PROG.LST=PROG.SRC/(switch)       __________________________

Note that the comma is required when a listing  file  is  desired
but not an object file.

Switches now available:      /H - ignore the command string, type
HELP file    /N  - do not print error messages on the terminal /P
- indicate the start of pass 2 on the terminal       /S - do  not
produce a symbol table       /W - produce narrow listing format

2.0 PRINTING AND PUNCHING OUTPUT FILES    ________ ___ ________ ______ _____


The listing file is in ASCII format and may be typed  or  printed
as follows:

     -TYPE PROG.LST          On your terminal      ____ ________

     -LST TTY:=PROG.LST      On your terminal, page formatted      ___ _____________

The default object file format is an ASCII file and this  can  be
punched with the following command:

     -TYPE PROG.OBJ          On your terminal, if so equipped      ____ ________

The object and listing files may be printed or  punched  at  your
local branch office;  contact your salesman for details.

3.0 SOURCE PROGRAM PREPARATION    ______ _______ ___________

PROGRAM ENTRY

Source programs may be placed on the host computer disk either by
the  use of a text editor to build new programs, or by reading in
an existing file from paper tape, magtape, etc.  Once  a  program
resides on disk a text editor may be used to alter or correct the
file in preparation for assembly.


PROGRAM FORMAT

Each source statement consists of  strings  of  ASCII  characters
(fields)   terminated   by   a   carriage   return - line   feed.
Statements, or  lines,  of  more  than  134  characters  will  be
truncated  by  the assembler and will produce a "Q" error.  Lines
beginning with a semicolon (;) will be treated as comments.  Each
source   statement  is  made  up  of  four  fields:   the  label,
instruction, operand and comment fields, which are defined below.

Label Field - A statement label may  consist  of  any  number  of_____ _____
characters but only the first 6 will be used by the program.  The
first character of the label must be alphabetic and,  unless  the
label  ends  with  a  colon,  must  start in column one.  A label
identifies a particular location in the program  and  should  not
duplicate another label.

The label field is optional except in  statements  with  an  EQU,
DEFL or MACRO statement.

Instruction Field - The instruction field must contain either  an___________ _____
instruction  mnemonic,  a pseudo op or the name of a user defined
macro (i.e., a macro call).  The field must be separated from the
preceding label field by at least one colon, space or tab and may
not start in column one.

Operand Field - The operand field, if required,  may  consist  of_______ _____
constants, symbols, statement labels, the instruction counter ($)
or labels EQUated to or defined as values.  These elements may be
combined  into expressions with arithmetic and logical operators,
as described below.   This  field  must  be  separated  from  the
instruction field by at least one space or tab.

Comment Field - This field is optional;  it will  appear  on  the_______ _____
assembly  listing  but  will  be  ignored  by the assembler.  The
comment field must begin with a semicolon (;).  Comments are  not
allowed on statement lines which define or call a macro.
                                                           Page 8


EXPRESSIONS

Expressions can be  made  up  of  user  symbols,  numbers,  ASCII
constants,  statement  labels  and  the  instruction counter ($).
These may be combined by the various operators and  contained  by
parentheses to form complex expressions.  The expression handling
and operators available are a function of the assembler.  Many of
the   operators   have   no  simple  implementation  on  the  Z80
microprocessor.

Symbols - Any alphanumeric  symbol  which  has  been  used  as  a_______
statement  label  or  equated  to  a  value  may  be  used  in an
expression.  In addition, the  instruction  counter  ($)  may  be
used.

Numeric Constants - Numeric Constants may be specified in binary,_______ _________
octal,  decimal  or  hexadecimal  format.   To do this the number
should be immediately followed by  a  constant  to  indicate  the
radix used, as shown in the examples below:

         B - binary                  (e.g., 0101B)
         Q - octal                   (e.g., 015Q)
         D - decimal                 (e.g., 19D or 19)
         H - hexadecimal             (e.g., 0F8H)

Note that hex constants must always start with a decimal digit (0
if  necessary)  to  distinguish  them from user symbols.  Numbers
without any indication of radix  (no  trailing  letter)  will  be
treated as decimal numbers.

ASCII Constants - An ASCII constant is represented by one or  two_____ _________
characters enclosed in apostrophes.

Operators - The operators available for constructing  expressions_________
include both the unary and binary operators listed below:

   UNARY:  +       BINARY: =       .LT.    .AND.   /
           -               .EQ.    .UGT.   &       **
           \               >       .ULT.   +       ^
           .NOT.           .GT.    .OR.    -       .MOD.
                           <       .XOR.   *       .SHR.
                                                   .SHL.

Expressions will be evaluated according to the following operator
precedence, and from left to right when of equal precedence:

   1)  parenthesized sub-expressions
   2)  unary +, -
   3)  **, ^
   4)  *, /, .MOD., .SHL., .SHR.
   5)  +, -
   6)  .NOT, \
   7)  .AND., &
   8)  .OR., .XOR.
   9)  =, <, >, .EQ., .LT., .GT., .ULT., .UGT.

5.0 ASSEMBLER DIRECTIVES (PSEUDO OPS)    _________ __________ _______ ____

This cross assembler recognizes  the  following  pseudo  ops.   A
detailed  explanation of each may be obtained by referring to the
microprocessor manufacturer's programming manual and chapters 6.0
and 7.0 of this manual.

          ENDIF
          ENDM
          EQU
          IF
          MACRO
          ORG

                                                          Page 11


6.0 MACRO STATEMENTS    _____ __________

The macro facility of this cross assembler permits the programmer
to  define  a  block  of  source  statements  which  can  be used
repeatedly throughout the program by just writing the macro  name
in the instruction field.  This makes it possible to have shorter
source files and more intelligible  program  listings.   Existing
programs  can also be modified by changing a macro definition and
re-assembling rather than by large scale editing.

Macro definitions are of the form:

MNAME     MACRO   DUM1,DUM2,...
            .
            .
          ENDM

where MNAME is the name of the macro and DUM1,DUM2,...  are dummy
argument  names  (if  any).  Dummy argument names have no meaning
outside a macro definition.  Within the macro definition they may
appear  anywhere  (in  any  field) and all occurrences of a dummy                                       ___
argument will be replaced by the actual argument strings when the
macro  is used.  It should be noted that all printable characters
and trailing blanks between commas, except semicolons, after  the
first  argument will be taken as part of some argument, therefore
comments are not generally used on a  macro  definition  or  call
line.

Macro definitions may be nested.  The macro body may contain  the
words MACRO or ENDM.

Macro calls are of the form:

LABEL:    MNAME   ARG1,ARG2,...

where the LABEL is optional and MNAME is the name of a previously
defined   macro.    The   actual  arguments  (ARG1,ARG2,...)  are
substituted as  character  strings  into  the  positions  of  the
corresponding  dummy  arguments  in the macro definition.  Actual
arguments to a macro call should be separated from each other  by
commas.   Arguments omitted from a macro call are treated as null
strings;  extra arguments are ignored.  Notice that arguments can
be  expressions,  instruction  mnemonics,  comments or labels for
statements inside the macro expansion.  The  macro  processor  is
only  concerned  with  character  strings, which it passes to the
rest of the assembler.

Examples of a macro are shown on the following page.
                                                          Page 12


MACRO EXAMPLES


;WAIT 4 MACHINE CYCLES
PAUSE     MACRO
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          NOP
          ENDM




;BUILD 5 BYTE TABLE ENTRIES
ENTRY     MACRO   Q,R,S,T,VALUE
          DEFB    'Q'
          DEFB    'R'
          DEFB    'S'
          DEFB    'T'
          DEFB    VALUE
          ENDM


An example of a macro call to build entry WXYZ using  the  second
example above:

WXYZ:     ENTRY   W,X,Y,Z,9


This would result in the following expansion:

          DEFB    'W'
          DEFB    'X'
          DEFB    'Y'
          DEFB    'Z'
          DEFB    9

7.0 CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY    ___________ ________

Portions of a program can be ased or not depending upon  the
value  of  an  expression.  This is accomplished by preceding the
conditional section of code with a statement  containing  the  IF
pseudo  op  and  the  expression  to  be evaluated and ending the
section with the pseudo op ENDIF.  This is useful  for  producing
several versions of the same program from a single source file by
changing only one parameter.

The expression following the IF pseudo op will  be  evaluated  by
the assembler and the results compared to zero.  If the result is
not zero the code will be assembled.  If the result is zero,  all
the  code  up  to  the  next matching ENDIF statement is ignored.
Conditional statements may be nested to any depth.




Example of a conditional section of code:


          IF      VER-1   ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 1
HSIZE     EQU     6
          ENDIF
          IF      VER     ;DON'T ASSEMBLE FOR VERSION 0
HSIZE     EQU     8
          ENDIF

8.0 OBJECT FILE FORMAT    ______ ____ ______

The object file produced by this cross assembler is an ASCII file
in Zilog's Hexadecimal Program Tape format.  The record layout is
shown below:

The checksum is the negative of the sum of all the 8-bit bytes in
the  record,  including  the  one  byte  count  and two byte load
address, with carries above 8 bits ignored.

A sample object file is shown in Section 11.0.

9.0 ERROR HANDLING    _____ ________

The cross assembler will print  error  messages  on  the  program
listing  if  the listing file was requested in the specification.
Errors are indicated by one or more characters at the left of the
listing  line  in which they occured.  In all cases the assembler
will attempt to generate  some  code  for  each  source  line  so
addresses  further  on  in  the  program do not get out of phase.
This also allows for  a  location  into  which  a  patch  may  be
inserted  if the object tape is used for debugging, even with its
errors.


ERROR CODES

A - Argument Error.   An  instruction  was  followed  by  invalid
    arguments.  

C - Constant Error.  A  numeric  constant  contained  an  illegal
    character  (e.g.,  128Q)  or  a  character  constant  was  of
    improper syntax.  The assembler uses a value of zero for  the
    constant.

D - Macro Definition Error.   The  definition  is  ignored.   The
    error is caused by one of the following conditions:

          1) The MACRO statement does not have a label

          2) The MACRO statement has over ten arguments

E -Expression Error.  Caused by one of the following conditions:

          1) Incorrect syntax, a value of zero assumed

          2) Numeric expression overflowed 16 bits,
             it is truncated

L - Label Error.  Caused by one of the following conditions:

          1) A symbol defined during pass 2 was not 
             defined during pass 1.  The symbol is left
             undefined.

          2) A DEFL or EQU pseudo-op was not
             preceded by a label.

M - Multiple Definition of Symbol.  The  user  is  attempting  to
    define  a  symbol  (with something other than DEFL) which was
    already defined.  The second definition is ignored.

N - Nesting Error.  An ENDM  or  ENDIF  appeared  which  was  not
    paired  with  a  MACRO  or  IF  statement.   The statement is
    ignored.

O - Operator Error.  An undefined mnemonic was encountered,  four
    bytes of zeros were generated.
                                                          Page 16


P - Phase Error.  A symbol has a different value in pass  2  than
    in pass 1.  The pass 1 value prevails.  This error is usually
    caused by one of the following conditions:

          1) A symbol being redefined with 'DEFL' was not
             initially defined with 'DEFL'.

          2) An IF statement had a different value during
             pass 2 than  pass 1.

          3) A macro was called before it was defined.

Q - Questionable  Syntax.   The  assembler  has   encountered   a
    statement  which  it  does  not completely understand, due to
    such things as surplus arguments,  unexpected  delimiters  or
    null label.

R - Relative Address Error.  A relative address  appearing  in  a
    'JR' or 'DJNZ' instruction overflows 8 bits.  It is truncated
    to its low order 8 bits.

S - Symbol Error.  A macro name  was  used  as  a  symbol  in  an
    expression and is assumed to have a value of zero.

U - Undefined Symbol.  A symbol was undefined and is  assumed  to
    have a value of zero.

10.0 SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES     _______ __ ___________


This cross assembler  is  compatible  with  the  cross  assembler
supplied  for  the  Z80  by  Zilog  with a few exceptions.  These
exceptions are listed below:


     1.  The following features conform to BSO standards and  may
         conflict   with   similar   features   offered   by  the
         manufacturer.
         
          (A)  Macro Processing
          (B)  Conditional Assembly Directives
          (C)  Listing Control
          (D)  Relocation Directives and Control


     2.  The "END" statement is mandatory.   All  text  following
         the "END" line is ignored, but the "END" must appear.

     3.  The "DEFM"  pseudo-op  has  been  extended  to  be  more
         flexible.  Its format is:

          DEFM 'string' ,b1,b2,b3,...

         where "string" represents a string of  ASCII  characters
         (null  string  is  O.K.),  and  "b1",  "b2",  "b3"  etc.
         represent  numeric  expressions.   This  generates   the
         string given, one character to a byte, followed by bytes
         containing the values b1, b2, b3...  These extra  values
         are optional.

     4.  The "DEFM" pseudo-op may generate any number  of  bytes,
         not limited to 63 as in the resident assembler.

     5.  IF/ENDIFS may be nested to any depth.

     6.  The   assembler   accepts   the   operator    "^"    for
         exponentiation, in addition to "**".

     7.  All symbols and label names must start  with  a  letter,
         and  consist  of  only  letters and digits.  Symbols are
         uniquely defined to 6 characters, but longer symbols may
         be typed, with extra characters ignored.

     8.  The assembler commands beginning with "*"  described  in
         the  Z80  Development  System  Software  Manual  are not
         supported.

     9.  Source lines  are  limited  to  134  characters.   Lines
         longer  than  that  will  be truncated, with a "Q" error
         printed in the listing.

    10.  Octal constants must  end  with  the  letter  "Q".   The
         letter  "O" is not acceptable, and will produce an error
         message.

    11.  Symbol table sizes are not limited.

Please note that in most cases, macros can be written by the user
to  duplicate  directives  that are supported by the manufacturer
but do not appear in BSO software.

The list of differences above is accurate  to  the  best  of  our
knowledge,  however BSO does not warrant that it is complete.  In
addition, this or  any  other  BSO  product  is  not  necessarily
compatible  with  any past, current or future implementation of a
similar product by any microprocessor manufacturer.
