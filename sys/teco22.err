The documentation for this file is at the end of the file.

?SRH	Cannot Find "17"
A search command not preceded by a colon modifier and not
within an iteration has failed to find the specified character
string "17".
After an S search fails the pointer is left positioned
at the beginning of the buffer.  After an N or _ search fails
the last page of the input file has been input and, in the
case of N, output, and the buffer cleared.
?ARG	Improper Arguments
The following argument combinations are illegal:
1)	,	(no argument before comma)
2)	m,n,	(where m and n are numeric terms)
3)	H,	(because H=B,Z is already two arguments)
4)	,H	(H following other arguments)
?BAK	Cannot Delete Old Backup File
Failure in rename process at close of editing job initiated by an EB
command or a TECO command. There exists an old backup file 08.BAK
with a protection <07> such that it cannot be deleted. Hence the
input file 10 cannot be renamed to "08.BAK". The output file
is closed with the filename "01". The RENAME UUO
error code is 03.
?COR	Storage Capacity Exceeded
The current operation requires more memory storage than TECO now has
and TECO is unable to obtain more core from the monitor.  This message
can occur as a result of any one of the following things:
1)  command buffer overflow while a long command string is being typed,
2)  Q-register buffer overflow caused by an X or [ command,
3)  editing buffer overflow caused by an insert command or
    a read command.
?COS	Contradictory Output Switches
The GENLSN and SUPLSN switches may not both be
used with the same output file.
?EBD	EB with Device 04 Is Illegal
The EB command and the TECO command may be specified only with
file structured devices, i.e., disk and DECtape.
?EBF	EB with Illegal File 02
The EB command and the TECO command may not be used with a file
having the filename extension ".BAK" or with a file having the name
"nnnTEC.TMP" where nnn is the user's job number.  The user must
either use an ER-EW sequence, or rename the file.
?EBO	E00 Before Current EB Job Closed
After an output file has been opened by a TECO command or an EB
command, no further EB, EW, or EZ commands may be given until
the current output file is closed.
?EBP	EB Illegal Because of File 02 Protection
The file 02 cannot be edited with an EB command or a TECO command
because it has a protection <07> such that it cannot be renamed
at close time.
?EMA	EM With Illegal Argument 06
The argument n in an nEM command must be greater than zero.
?EMD	EM With No Input Device Open
EM commands apply only to the input device, and so should be preceded
by an ER (or equivalent) command. To position a tape for output, that
unit should be temporarily opened for input while doing the EM commands.
?ENT	13
00Illegal Output Filename "02"
ENTER UUO failure 0. The filename "02" specified for the
output file cannot be used. The format is invalid.
01Output UFD 04:[05] Not Found
ENTER UUO failure 1. The file 02[05] specified
for output by an EW, EZ, or MAKE command cannot be created
because there is no user file directory with project-programmer
number [05] on device 04.
02Output Protection Failure
ENTER UUO failure 2. The file 02[05] specified
for output by an EW, EZ, EB, MAKE, or TECO command cannot be created
either because it already exists and is write-protected <07> against
the user, or because the UFD it is to be entered into is write-
protected against the user.
03Output File Being Modified
ENTER UUO failure 3. The file 02 specified for output
by an EW,  EZ, EB, MAKE, or TECO command cannot be created
because it is currently being created or modified by another job.
06Output UFD or RIB Error
ENTER UUO failure 6. The output file 02 cannot be
created because a bad directory block was encountered by the
monitor while the ENTER was in progress. The user may try
repeating the EW, EB, or TECO command, but if the error
persists, it is impossible to proceed. Notify your system manager.
14No Room or Quota Exceeded on 04:
ENTER UUO failure 14. The output file 02 cannot be
created because there is no more free space on device 04:, or
because the user's quota is already exceeded there.
15Write Lock on 04:
ENTER UUO failure 15. The output file 02 cannot be
created because the output file structure is write-locked.
16Monitor Table Space Exhausted
ENTER UUO failure 16. The output file 02 cannot be
created because there is not enough table space left in the
monitor to allow the ENTER. The user may try repeating the
EW, EB, or TECO command, but if the error persists he will
have to wait until conditions improve.
23Output SFD not Found
ENTER UUO failure 23. The output file 02 cannot be
created because the sub-file-directory on which it should be
ENTERed cannot be found.
24Search List Empty
ENTER UUO failure 24. The output file 02 cannot be
created because the user's file structure search list is empty.
25Output SFD Nested too Deeply
ENTER UUO failure 25. The output file 02 cannot be
created because the specified SFD path for the ENTER
is nested too deeply.
26No Create for Specified SFD Path
ENTER UUO failure 26. The output file 02 cannot be
created because the specified SFD path for the ENTER
is set for no creation.
ENTER Failure 03 on Output File 02
The attempted ENTER of the output file 02 has failed and
the monitor has returned an error code of 03. This error
is not expected to occur on an ENTER. Please
send the TTY printout showing what you were doing
to DEC with an SPR form.
?EOA	06EO Argument Too Large
The argument 06 given with an EO command is larger than the
standard (maximum) setting of EO=16 for this version of TECO.
This must be an older version of TECO than the user thinks he
is using; the features corresponding to EO=06 do not exist.
?FNF	13
00Input File 02 Not Found
LOOKUP UUO failure 0.  The file 02 specified for input by an
ER, EB, or TECO command was not found on the input device 04.
01Input UFD 04:[05] Not Found
LOOKUP UUO failure 1. The file 02[05] specified
for input by an ER, EB, or TECO command cannot be found
because there is no User File Directory with project-programmer
number [05] on device 04.
02Input Protection Failure
LOOKUP UUO failure 2. The file 02[05] specified
for input by an ER, EB, or TECO command cannot be read
because it is read-protected <07> against the user.
06Input UFD or RIB Error
LOOKUP UUO failure 6. The input file 02 cannot be
read because a bad directory block was encountered by the
monitor while the LOOKUP was in progress. The user may try
repeating the ER, EB, or TECO command, but if the error
persists all is lost. Notify your system manager.
16Monitor Table Space Exhausted
LOOKUP UUO failure 16. The input file 02 cannot be
read because there is not enough table space left in the
monitor to allow the LOOKUP. The user may try repeating the
ER, EB, or TECO command, but if the error persists he will
have to wait until conditions improve.
23Input SFD not Found
LOOKUP UUO failure 23. The input file 02 cannot be
found because the sub-file-directory on which it should be
looked up cannot be found.
24Search List Empty
LOOKUP UUO failure 24. The input file 02 cannot be
found because the user's file structure search list is empty.
25Input SFD Nested too Deeply
LOOKUP UUO failure 25. The input file 02 cannot be
found because the specified SFD path for the LOOKUP
is nested too deeply.
LOOKUP Failure 03 on Input File 02
The attempted LOOKUP on the input file 02 has failed and
the monitor has returned an error code of 03. This error
is not expected to occur on a LOOKUP. Please
send the TTY printout showing what you were doing
to DEC with an SPR form.
?FUL	Device 04: Directory Full
ENTER UUO failure 03. The file 02 specified for output
by an EW or MAKE command cannot be created on DECtape 04
because the tape directory is full.

whose argument does not satisfy the required condition) no ' command
closing the conditional execution string can be found.
Note: n"...' strings must be complete within a single macro level.
?MEE	Macro Ending with E
A command macro being executed from a Q-register ends with the
character "E". This is an incomplete command. E is the initial
character of an entire set of commands. The other character of
the command begun by E must be in the same macro with the E.
?MEF	Macro Ending with F
A command macro being executed from a Q-register ends with the
character "F" (not an EF). This is an incomplete command. F is

right now, or it is write locked, or else it does not exist
in the system.
?OLR	Cannot Lookup Output File 04:02 to Rename It
Failure in rename process at close of editing job initiated by
an EB command or a TECO command. The special LOOKUP on the output
file 02 required for DECtape in order to rename the file
to "10" has failed. The original input file 10
has been renamed "08.BAK", but the output file is closed with
the name "01". The LOOKUP UUO error code is 03.
?OUT	Output Error 11 - Output File 01 Closed
An error on the output device is fatal.
The output file is closed at the end of the last data that
was successfully output. It has the filename "01".

in the form [m,n] where m and n are octal digit strings separated
by a comma. No characters other than the ones specified may appear
between the enclosing brackets.
?RNO	Cannot Rename Output File 01
Failure in rename process at close of editing job initiated by
an EB command or a TECO command. The attempt to rename the output
file 01 to the name "10" originally specified in the
EB or TECO command has failed. The original input file 10
has been renamed "08.BAK", but the output file is closed with
the name "01". The RENAME UUO error code is 03.
?SAL	Second Argument Less Than First
In a two-argument command, the first argument
must be less than or equal to the second.
?SNA	Initial Search with No Argument
A search command with null argument has been given, but there
was no preceding search command from which the argument could be
taken.
?SNI	; Not in an Iteration
The semicolon command may be used only with a string of
commands enclosed by angle brackets, i.e., in an iteration field.
?STC	Search String too Long
The maximum length of a search string is 80 characters, including
all string control commands and their arguments.
?STL	Search String too Long
The maximum length of a search string is 36 character positions,
not counting extra characters required to specify a single
position.
?TAG	Missing Tag !12
The tag !12 specified by an O command cannot be found.
This tag must be in the same macro level as the O command
referencing it.
?TAL	Two Arguments with L
The L command takes at most one numeric argument, namely, the
number of lines over which the buffer pointer is to be moved.
?TTY	Illegal TTY I-O Device
A teletype may be specified as an input-output device in an
ER, EW, EZ, or MAKE command only if it is not being used to
control an attached job, the user's own terminal included.
?UCA	Unterminated ^A Command
A ^A message type-out command has been given,
but there is no corresponding ^A to mark the end
of the message. ^A commands must be complete within
a single command level.
?UFS	Macro Ending with Unterminated File Selection Command
The last command in a command macro being executed from a
Q-register is a file selection command (ER, EW, EB, or EZ)
with no altmode to mark the end of the file specifications.
The file selection command must be complete within the Q-register.
?UIN	Unterminated Insert Command
An insert command (possibly an @ insert command) has been given
without terminating the text argument at the same macro level.
?UIS	Undefined I/O Switch "/19"
The switch "/19" is not defined with either input or output
file selection commands. The only switches currently defined
for input or output file selection commands are /GENLSN and /SUPLSN.
?USR	Unterminated Search Command
A search command (possibly an @ search command) has been given
without terminating the text argument at the same macro level.
?UTG	Unterminated Tag
A command string tag has been indicated by a ! command,
but there is no corresponding ! to mark the end of the tag.
Tags must be complete within a single command level.
?UUO	Illegal UUO
Internal error. The illegal instruction 05 has been
encountered at address 06. This is caused by either a TECO bug
or a monitor bug. Please give this printout to your system manager,
or submit it to DEC with an SPR.
?EEE	Unable to Read Error Message File
An error, whose code was typed previous to this error message, has
occurred, and while TECO was trying to find the proper error message
in the error message file, one of the following errors occurred:
1) the error message file, TECO.ERR, could not be found on device SYS:,
2) an input error occurred while TECO was reading the file TECO.ERR,
3) the error message corresponding to that error code is missing
   from TECO.ERR,
4) the user's TECO job does not currently have enough room for a
   buffer to read the error message file into, and no more core can
   be obtained from the monitor,
5) for some strange reason device SYS: could not be initialized for
   input.
Note:	This message can obviously never be typed. It is included
	for the purpose of documentation. Also the question mark
	with which it begins serves as the terminator for the
	last real error message.

Documentation for TECO.ERR:

This file is made up entirely of ASCII text.  It
contains one entry for each TECO error number.
the format of an entry is as follows:
1)  first character is a question mark,
2)  followed by a three letter code,
3)  followed by a tab,
4)  followed by a brief explanation of the error,
5)  followed by a carriage return-line feed,
6)  followed by one or more lines that more fully explain the error.
The entry is terminated by the question mark that begins the next entry,
or by ^A, ^B, ..., ^H.
This file should not have any form feeds and there should be no
blank lines between entries. There must be no question marks
except to begin each message.

Note:	At certain places in this file there are control-N characters.
	These signal TECO to type out special information at that point.
	The information typed is determined by the two digit number
	following the ^N, as follows:
00   type last character seen in command string
01   type name of output file
02   type filename referenced by UUO
03   type monitor error code from FILNAM+1
04   type device name
05   type project-programmer number at FILNAM+3
06   type first numeric argument
07   type file protection from FILNAM+2
08   type EB filename without extension
09   type input filename
10   type EB command input filename
11   type I/O error flags
12   type missing command string tag
13   get monitor error code from FILNAM+1 and skip to the
      string ^Axx, where xx is a two digit octal number, then start
      typing text at the character after xx.
      If ^Axx is not found before ^B is encountered,
      start printing immediately after the ^B.
14   get device error code and skip as with ^N13
15   (not used)
16   type EOVAL for this version of TECO
17   type search text argument
18   type character in AC 3
19   type sixbit I/O switch
