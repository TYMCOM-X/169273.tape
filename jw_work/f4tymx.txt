;F4TymX.txt - notes on porting Tymcom-X to the Foonly F-4 (26KL)
;John Wilkes

16-Mar-84 - According to Dan Martin, the F3, on which Tymcom-X
is already up, and the F-4 both use the same disk drives and 
controllers.  He says that the machines are identical, except
for the hardware mapping.  I am beginning to think that, with
the proper microcode changes, Tymcom-X will drop right on.
The question arises: Which is a better, faster way to go?
Should the micro-code be modified to accomodate the way 
Tops-10/Tymcom-X want to do their mapping, or should an effort
be made to teach Tymcom-X to map KL/Tops-20 style??  That should be
the next thing to look at.

21-Mar-84 - i wonder how similar the microcode is in the F3 and F4? i
wonder if any of the mapping stuff in the F3 could be applicable to
the F4?  doubtful, but worth asking.
