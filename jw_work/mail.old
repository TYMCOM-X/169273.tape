  Yes, I do have a much "better" logon initialization program that
you can use.  Just setup an init program in NONAME, and when it
asks for the program and username, enter "LOGON" and "CARL".  Then,
copy the file (CARL)SWITCH.INI into your directory.  When you have
timeG@U$T/ to stop by, I'll tell you how to customize it to your likes or
dislikes.  /Carl

PS.  (CARL)LOGON works on all systems.  If it doesn't, then I need to
     update the copy on the system that it doesn't work on.  Lots of
     people are using it.   /Carl
When you have
timeG@U$Tv*/...under no circumstances should you bother to copy LOGON.SHR to your
own directory.  It isn't necessary, and you'll miss any new features
which may be added (without notice). /Carl

is an "in house" system and not heavily used.  You can log Èn

Wp;7-4%&/John,

Typically a PDL overflow results from macro recursion.  Had you possibly
defined a recursive macro, or something like that?
ä/kenç
o&eπ9r->maûken:
    in thinking about it, i think the fault was mine...  i had defined
a macro, call it A, and i had bound A to a key.  i used this macro a few
times, then defined a second macro, B.  i then bound B to the same key
as A, without doing a ^X [ to push the binding...  i had o&e99r->maûˇbeen†wonderingç
what the purpose of "push key binding onto stack" was.  now i know...
::john::
and i had bound A to a key.  i used this macro a few
times, then defined a second macro, B.  i then bound B to the same key
as A, without doing a ^X [ to push the binding...  i had Wp;7-BE'/John,

I'm curiÔus. †Did ˘our secon‰ macro, B, refer to the key to which A had
been bound?  That's the only way I can think of that the recursion could
have occured.

I'm not at all sure that the "Push/Pop Bindings" commands are useful now.
Some major modifications were madWp;7-BE'/e recently in the Macro / Key≠binding
Ïogic†which make the†effect of pushing the binding of a key automatic when
that key is re-bound.  Indeed, a new command allows you to "unbind" a macro
from a key, and this does the related Pop, restoring the previous binding.

By the erroWp;7-BE'/r message you got, I'd guess that you were not on :π30 when tËis
Ëappened to youÆ  The new macro stuff is only in version 2.0, which will be
released very soon to all systems.  (V2.0 checks for possible PDL overflow
conditions as it is evaluating macros, and after 12 levels of Wp;7-BE'/recursion,
politely objects).

e not on :930 when this
happened†to you.  ‘he nÂw ma„ro stuff Ès only in version 2.0, which will be
released very soon to all systems.  (V2.0 checks for possible PDL overflow

    Yes, macro B was bound to the same key as macro A.  And, alas, i
was on 930, using ver 2.0(26≥).  … will see if i†can duplicate the
problem.

     i talked with dan martin, and he tells me that the f-3 & f-4

There are two ways to log terminal output.  If you are on a system that
has the latest PEAK (930, and on FTSYS on 33) the CREAUX command not only
logs everything you do, but leaves you in the buffer so you can edit the
output when you†are done (and name Èt to a file if yY>N0om2jb/ou have not already
done that when invoking PEAK).

AUXIO which lives on MPL will write output to a file, and you can log into
any system (as anybody if you have sufficient license) just as you can
with PEAK.  There may even exist documentation Ôn MPL.
äAs tÔ a program thaÙY>N0om2jb/ reports disk usage, Vivian wrote a program, DUSAGE,
which lives on SYS.  The user interface is rather strange, but it does

they can be restored from the archive files.

  I noticed a strange thing that DSKCLN does (just one strange thing,
you say??), and it led me to a question:  the DSKCHR UUO returns a 23
(8) word information block, one of the words in it contains the logical
age numbeÚ of the unit's HOM ages (LH=1st HOM pg,,RH=2no&e99r4C5	1d HOM pg).
Now, that silly program goes through a loop to get the number of pages
per unit for each unit in a structure with a DSKCHR, and when he exits
the loop, he has built a table in free core of pages/unit; BUT the
buffer that he used to hold thÂ DSKCHR iÓfo block still†ho&e99r4C5	1as all 23 words
in it from the LAST unit in the structure.  Three (yes, three, count
'em, 3) listing pages and about 100 lines of code later, he magically
reaches back into this DSKCHR buffer to get the logical page number of
the HOM page so that he can read iÙ.  Are yoı folloo&e99r4C5	±wing this??  What
occurred to me through a thick haze late last night is that he is
getting the LAST unit's HOM page number and then using it to read the
HOM pages for ALL the units.  What this implies, of course, is that the
HOM pages (both copies) are always the same logicalo&eπ9r4C5	± page on the uÓit for
EACH AND EVERY unit in the structure.  Now I know that under Tops-20,
the HOM blocks must be in the same physical location for any pack, but
can this be depended on with Tymcom-X ??  Apparently it must be so, or
someone would have noticed that DSKCLN was o&e99r4C5	1broke a long tÈme ago.  All
this Ès completely aside from the issue of preserving an input buffer's
contents, after you are fininshed using it, throughout the remainder of
the program.  Terrible programming practice!  DSKCLN could potentially
get very confused if the HOM pageso&e99r4C5	1 on unit 0 were on a different logÈcaläpage†than†the HOM pages for the laÛt unit in the structure.  He would
think that the HOM pages were bad, and that the whole structure was
screwed up.

     As I have not been in this week, I feel like I should go into
Fremont tomorrow (Wednesday).  Besides, my list of questions is still in
a very disorganized state and completely in my head.  I am developing
some questions about I/O modes - old st˘le vÛ new style - bÔ&e99r4l))$uffered vs
unbuffered - and all the permutations thereof.  For instance, DSKCLN
appears to be doing "old style" unbuffered dump mode stuff.  now, my
understanding is that the monitor actually pages the stuff in and then
BLTs it into your address space when you ask it to do bufÔ&e99õr4l))$fÂred stuff.
But what does it do with "old style" unbuffered I/O?  Does it actually
map a page to your address space, or does it go through extra overhead
like it does doing buffered I/O?  I am wondering if it might be possible
to get a significant speed increase by doing I/O o&e99r4l))$b˘ maping, user
worÎing set management, pre-referencing, etc.  Essentially re-do the I/O
to use all the latest goodies...  Anyway, that's what I've been thinking

»mmmmm.  TËat ought to have some re-writing done to it (by yours truly)
to make it a lot faster, by using mapping/super-mapping.

About I/O, i.e. SIMIO, regardless of whether you are having the monitor
buffer it with buffersG@U4r/ or in dump mode (possibly dump mode in page sizes
doesn't buffÂr, but I'‰ need to Ïook at the monitor to tell).  CHANIOs
of the .chMFP, .chCFP, .chDFP, .chVMP perform mapping, creating and
deleting of file pages.  I have some "OLD" statistics for various machines
but I don't G@U4r/know if they cover all the arrangements.  Any "old-style" I/O
uses the SIMIO packageÆ  Only thÂ new-stylÂ CHANIO calls do any user-style
mapping.

Yes, mapping should give a significant speed increase to DSKCLN, to TITO,
and anything else still using SIMIO.  Pre-referencing wG@U4r/ill also help to
speed things up.

Example. My new FDM program, uses mapping & pre-referencinÁ.  The ol‰
FDM program (no-oÓe really knows what it does, is in FORTRAN, no source)
took 1:32:36 to copy (m33)*.mac into a "crunched" file.  My new version
also does a folded checksG@U4r/um of the file as it is copied, and it took only
6:14 to copy the same (m33)*.mac files.  6-1/4 minutes vs 92-1/2 miÓutes.

‘alk to me about it.† DSKCLN, TITO, et al.  Talk to me before you
undertake any of these kind of projects on TYMCOM-X, since I'm the
best historian and G@U4r/know if it's already been done, or is under-way.

     Yes, DSKCLN definitely uses old-style I/O !!!  He gets stuff in
with a CHANIO .CHIN, which goes through SIMIO and looks like it does a
BLT to user space for EACH tranÛfer!  ( I†spent my afternoon ·nd evening

     I have found what I consider to be a significant deficiency in
DSKCLN.  Being the ancient program that it is, all the I/O is
"old-style" (i.e., Tops-10 style with CHANIO .CHIN).  After listening to
the "socci tapes", I notice‰ this and†traced thÚough†the Ìonitor u-fo&e99r4o$1iche
to see exactly what a CHANIO .CHIN function does.  It turns out that
what happens is that the monitor actually maps the page (of course,
that's the only I/O there is, right?) into MONITOR space, then BLTs what
the program asked for into user space.  ƒSKCLN is ·lready de·lo&eπ9rù4o$1ing with
the disk a page at a time, but if he were taught to map, there would not
be the monitor overhead of a previous context BLT (very expensive to
do).  in fact, what happens now is that the monitor maps the page in to
a buffer (monitor buffer) on program's behalf and theno&e99r4o$1ˇ BLTs tËe ENTIRE
page into user space!!  two copies of each page for every page that
comes in!!   Insane!!  With mapping and the pre-reference UUO to fake a
reference and start the page in, I predict a significant performance
improvement.

I see two possible ways to go right nowÆ  The eas˘ thing to do would be
to simply teach his "read a page" routine to map instead of CHANIO,
without worrying about the pre-referencing stuff.  This I o&e99r4yLq$can do myself
in an afternoon (the coding, not including testing).  Doing the
pre-reference stuff is not so simple; at†least, th·t's how it looks toç

the bulk of the coding as an educational exercise if notho&e99r4yLq$ing else.  I am

the same address space.  However, you cannot simply map another page to
Ùhe same a‰dress.  YÔu must VRELEAS or VCLEAR (calli's -65 & -66) the
memory page before you map the next page.  (This also goes for G@U7P;/the FIRST
page that you map).

You can use an address BUF, which points to the address of the buffer.
Of course, this means changing all the MOVEI AC,BUF ... MOVE X¨XXX(AC)
Ùo MOVE AC¨BUF ... MOVE X,XXX(AC) but you'd have to check those anyway.

    I've been running into a few snags...† Since DSÀCLN curreÓtly does
old-style I/O, he has a 1000 word area in his address space into which
he reads a disk page.  then he references this area, often with an index

This is all well and good, but when mapping to BUF, a VCLEAR or VREMOV
UUO must be done before Âach mapping of a diÛk page.  Extra overhead.
Additionally, with a disk page mapped to BUF any writes there will
automatically update the disk page (e.o&e99r7pWl1g., MOVEM T3,BUF(T2) - which he
DOES do...)  Of course, the page can be protected "copy on write", but
this means that the monitor makes another cÔpy of the page - ex·ctly
what we're trying to avoid!  I am beginning to see why he has never been
taught to do mapping...  It is so&e99r7pWl1tarting to look to me as if teaching
DSKCLN to do mapping is not a simple thing.  I am thinking that if he is
to do mapping at all, it should be done with pre-referen„ing to get the
chaÓnels bringing the pages in asynchronously in order to get any
performance advantage at all.o&e99r7pWl1  Simply putting in a map UUO instead of

OPPS changes your OPER password throughout most of the world.
SETOP on 33 changes your OPER password, etc. throughout most of the world.
SETOP on 930, 897, 1051, 370, & various outher F3's and 2∞20's willç
      ch·nge your œPER password ONLY on those machines.
G@U9Q$a/
PASSWORD changes your NETWORK password on TYMNET.
LVALID on 930, 897, 1051, 370,... changes your local-net password on
       that particular machine (local-login-ONLY), such that if you
       log in through the network, the network pass˜ord will work fine.ç

On systems wheG@U9Q$a/re you MUST run SETOP, you must also be setup as a manager
in the OPER tree.  I believe that you may not have MG license on 33?  It
is worth checking.  On 930, if you don't have it, I'll give it to you.
