Significant changes to the TYMCOM-X Operating System.           10-Aug-87

   Part 1:  Features in P035/C that are new since P035/B.
   Part 2:  Changes from P034/P to P035/A to P035/B.

              Changes from P035/B to P035/C

Bug fixes:

 o  Fixed one cause of FILAMO crashes on a heavily loaded system.

 o  Fixed IME crash caused by inactivity timer (SET AUTOLOGOUT command).

 o  Fixed most cases of "serious restart error while writing to HOM pages".

 o  Fixed KAF crash from tape read errors caused by ONTYME accounting data.

 o  JBTUID is now cleared on logout so XEXEC can keep track of its jobs.


Support for new disk hardware:

 o  64 disks can be defined as 8 strings on 4 logical controllers.
    The current maximum supported configurations are 32 disks with 128 jobs,
    48 disks with 80 jobs, or 64 disks with 32 jobs.

 o  4 strings of disks can be connected to a single Storage Control Unit
    (Memorex 3674 or 3676).

 o  Double capacity disks (Memorex 3652) are supported and appear as two
    logical 3650 units.

New features for Operators:

 o  More information is reported about amount of memory on-line.

 o  The unit-IDs and DSKB logical unit numbers of all on-line disks are
    reported when the system comes up.

 o  The SET KSYS command has been added to tell XEXEC when to stop
    scheduling SUBMIT jobs.  (This function will be added to TAKEIT soon).


Performance improvement:

 o  RIBs to new files are always created on the unit with the most space.
    This distributes files more evenly which speeds up DSKCLN.


System reliability:

 o  AR/ARX parity error trapping is now supported.  It can be enabled from
    KLDCP by using the command "PE 36".

 o  BAT (Bad-page Allocation Table) now works.  Any disk page with a read or
    write error gets logged in the BAT page.  If it is not already marked
    there, the INFO stopcode BADPAG is output to the CTY.  To get a list of
    bad pages, use "TYPE BAT" when in FILE dialog, or use "RUN (MPL)TYPBAT"
    after the system has come up.

 o  The system can continue running after a single SAT failure, but stops on
    the second SAT failure (in case the disk system has failed).  The two new
    stopcodes are REDSAT (which means a hard read error occured while trying
    to read in a SAT), and SAT2ND (which means a 2nd SAT was detected bad).
    The old stopcode BADSAT means the count of bits in the SAT is incorrect,
    and WRTSAT means a hard write error occured while trying to write a SAT.

 o  More information is output whenever unrecognizable SA10 interrupts occur.
    Stopcode SAXINY is printed when an unknown disk controller interrupts.


More information stored in crash dumps for analysis:

 o  Locations ERASTA, SBDST1, and SBDST2 now always set up with S-bus diags
    for all types of crashes.

 o  Disk operations and status bits are stored in a circular buffer for
    tracking down problems with SA10/IBM disk system.

 o  All output to the CTY is stored in a circular buffer and can be read
    from a crash dump.  The operator's commands to ONCE are included also.


[End of P035/C changes - P035/B changes are included here for reference]
Significant changes to TYMCOM-X between P034/P and P035/B      3-Aug-87

Bug fixes:

  1)  Fixed ILLINS crashes when account supervisor logs out another job.

  2)  Fixed host initiated base crash when we sent it bad data.

  3)  Fixed ancient bug where one page per unit would not be correctly
      restored after an ASP rebuild.

  4)  Fixed the bug that caused the REFRESH option to create a file with
      a bad RIB.  This problem triggered a bug in DSKCLN and caused the
      rash of FILAUS crashes on 3650 disks.  NOTE: This monitor requires
      DSKCLN version 36J(103) or later.


Performance improvements:

  1)  The scheduler is now more responsive to interactive users.

New features for General Users:

  1)  TYMNET parameter "D" and KATAKANA mode now properly recognized.
      The old method of "SET TTY TYPE 1" still works for Japanese customers.

  2)  The SET TTY TYPE and TERMINAL TYPE commands also accept a six character
      name, such as VT100, TYM444, etc.

  3)  The SUBMIT command was added - it replaces PERP and DEFER.

  4)  The TYMVALIDATE command was added to let customers validate new users.

  5)  Error message such as "Device not avaliable" now output the correct
      device name (instead of TTY name).

  6)  The Control-T display (enabled by TTY RTCOMP in PDP mode) now outputs
      the name of the program being run and last known PC (Program Counter).

  7)  In addition to the job number, the PJOB command now prints the user
      name and GFD name.  This is a quick way for a user to verify which
      directory and which system the user is connected to.

  8)  The VERSION command outputs the name of the current program and decodes
      the version number.

  9)  The HELP command has been changed to output help on a particular program
      or a list of available topics.  For instance, "HELP DIFFER" gives help
      on the DIFFER command, "HELP *" lists the names of all help files and
      the names of all monitor commands.


New messages printed on the CTY:

  1)  Whenever the system date or time is changed, it is done so gradually and
      a message "Date/time is now ..." is output when the adjustment is done.

  2)  The time of day is reset whenever a new TYMNET supervisor takes over.
      If the change is more than 60 minutes, the system is automatically SHUT.

  3)  Most messages to the CTY are stamped with the Data Center's time zone.

  4)  The BIGBEN message comes out every four hours and prints the system
      name and the number of pages free on DSKB.  If DSKB gets below 1000
      pages, the message comes out every 10 minutes.

  5)  INFO stopcodes, EVENT stopcodes, and many other CTY messages are also
      sent to the OPR terminal.

  6)  EVENT stopcode NOBASE is output if the base stops talking to the PDP10.


New features for Operators:

  1)  The monitor verifies that it is running on the correct hardware by
      checking the CPU serial number.

  2)  The BOOTS command has been added to ONCE and to FILES so that the
      operator can quickly recover from having loaded the wrong monitor.

  3)  A "146 restart" has been defined.  If depositing 1 in location 30 or
      restarting the CPU at location 147 does not get to BOOTS, "ST 146"
      can be used as a last ditch attempt to get BOOTS loaded so a crash
      dump can be taken without wiping out memory the way "P BOTLOD$" does.

  4)  New command, "SET BIGBEN 120" causes the BIGBEN message to come out
      every 120 minutes (instead of every 240 minutes).

  5)  Anyone with license set can temporarily turn off all license using
      the DISABLE command.  The ENABLE command restores previous license.

  6)  A new license bit has been defined - QM for Queue Manager.  It is used
      only by XEXEC/EXECX/SUBMIT for job processing.


Changes to enhance reliability:

  1)  INFO stopcodes work - system stays running after outputting information.

  2)  System attempts to keep running after the base crashes.

  3)  Files with RIB errors are reported to the CTY.  Hard read errors on RIB
      pages are reported with stopcode RIBHRE, software detected failures are
      reported with RIBERR.

  4)  Cases where the system was stuck in a loop used to be reported as "System
      hung, no output on CTY".  They now show up as stopcode KAF which outputs
      the PC where the system was looping.


Changes important to Systems Programmers:

  1)  SPAGES.SYS is created when the structure is refreshed.

  2)  GETTAB item 12,,5 has date/time the system came up.

  3)  GETTAB tables +31 and +32 have GFD name corresponding to PPN in +2

  4)  Items 127,131,136,154,163 added to CONFIG table 11.

  5)  Add FINASS uuo to assign frame related interrupts.  This allows
      different software interrupt channels to be assigned to each child frame
      for logout-in-child, exit-in-child, interrupt-from-child.

  6)  EDDT takes pointer to commands in AC 0 when started at CCL entry.

  7)  The DSKCHR uuo indicates type of formatting (blocks versus pages).

  8)  The login string for CREAUX is stored in the LDB so that outgoing
      AUX circuits can be traced.

  9)  The DATUUO has been modified to handle additional formats, including
      DEC's one word date/time format.

 10)  LOGIN and CREFRM uuos take additional arguments - LDBLOG and project code.

 11)  New bit in CREFRM tells LOGINN to validate username and password.

 12)  SETUUO function 14 sets the KSYS timer.


Changes to aid Crash Dump Analysis:

  1)  NONAME stopcodes were given names after they occur.

  2)  The current job's context pages are copied to pages 3-5 before dump.

  3)  The DEBUG command added to ONCE to enable debugging routines.

  4)  Special memory locations in low core belonging to the SA10 and to the
      base are copied (snapshot) before creating a crash dump.

  5)  The CPU error bits are decoded in english on APRFAT stopcodes.

  6)  Stopcode type "PATCH" defined for counting times thru patched code.

  7)  CRASH.SAV is created for 8192 pages to be able to save all of core.

  8)  The contents of IRPPDP, ORP620, KEY620, etc are output on base crashes.
