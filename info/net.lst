                     PCNET protocol Made Simple
                        By Robert Maas
                      <PREFACE AND INTRODUCTION>
Something you will hear mentioned frequently is the term
"half duplex turnaround" which consists of 5 open square brackets
 [[[[[ or 5 close square brackets ]]]]] depending on which side is
sending them.
                         <NOTICE>
The formal layers of the protocol are deliberately obscured here
to provide a simplified way of implementing them in default mode.
Processes are described here in an entirely sequential way except
for the Half-Duplex and radix-41 parsers in the recieve pipelines
which are implemented as co-routines. 
For the full formal specifications of the protocol other PCNET
documents should be consulted.These documents are listed below for
your convienience :
               PCNET communication protocols
               by Ron Crane
               PCNET Higher level protocols
               by Peter Deutsch
               Protocol Writeup #2
               by Robert Maas
These documents should be quite sufficent for a quick and dirty 
implementation in BASIC or assembly langauage.
                    <OVERVIEW>
The hardware level provides a mechanism for the transport of 8-bit
bytes across a telephone between 2 computers. This mechanism is
characterized by frequent errors such as extra characters (usually
rubout, tilde, vertical bar, open brace, control-z) which are those
characters easily generated by a noise spike; other nasty things
can also occur such as modified characters, and a total loss of
UART framing usually lasting from when a noise spike occurs until
either either an idle line occurs or an atsign character (@) is
transmitted.
Software interface to the hardware wraps all transmitted
data in a package called a "Link-Transmission-Block" or LTB for
short. An LTB contains header information and checksum; atsigns are
placed between LTBs to protect against permanent UART misframe in
addition to providing a way to delimit LTBs. Software at the
recieving end checks each LTB for validity and unwraps the data from
good packets as well as causing the transmitter to acknowledge all
good LTBs. LTBs not acknowledged in a reasonable time, typically
a half duplex turnaround which amounts to between 4 and 10 seconds,
are retransmitted, as many times as needed until they finally get
acknowledged.
The result of this software is a bidirectional flow of about 140
bits per second of binary data under error free conditions, with
an undetected error rate of about 1 LTB per 5*2**18 seconds which is
approximatly 15 days under conditions of incredibly severe phone
line noise usually conditions can be expected to be much better.
See the note below this section on how exactly this was calculated.
Using this relativly reliable bit-transport mechanism, the higher

levels of the software transmit data between various processes, 
the foremost being MAIL/FTP which transmits electronic mail and
computer files from a source node to a destination node, either
directly or indirectly through intermediate forwarding nodes.
Each file is wrapped in an envelope that contains the destination
and other routing and commentary information, thus facilitating
automatic forwarding and delivery.
                         <BIT TRANSPORT MECHANISM>
                       (Link Level)
 This part of the software begins where binary data enters the link
level of the transmit pipeline of one node, including buffering, packaging
an LTB, transmission, reception, checking the recieved LTB for
validity, unwrapping the binary data from the good LTBs, and ends
where the data emerges from the link level of the recieve pipeline
of the second node. For test purpose the link level can operate as
a stand-alone program except for the simple procedure to insert data from
the controlling terminal into the transmit pipeline and another simple
procedure to type out data which emerges from the recieve pipeline.
To allow upgrading later, global variables will be kept the same
in meaning as for the general case of upto 4 out of 8 outstanding
block window, only the procedures for binding these globals are simplified
and the number of buffers reduced. The 'official' names each composed of six
letters, are used here. In BASIC some two letter abbreviations will need
to be substituted. 
XMTGEN is the sequence number to be assigned to the next LTB
to be generated anew. Since the preceding LTB, already generated
may be interposed, XMTGEN is not necessarily the number of the 
next TRANSMITTED block. Initially XMTGEN is zero , so the first LTB
will be numbered zero. XMTGEN is incremented upon each creation
of an LTB. 
RCVOOB is the sequence number of the oldest incoming LTB not yet
recieved. All validity checks must succeed before an incoming LTB
is accepted as "recieved" otherwise it is treated as line noise and
ignored. This variable is sent to the other node, in order to
in order to inform the it as to what we have recieved which is everything
preceding RCVOOB and what we haven't recieved yet which is RCVOOB
and all later LTBs ; this is done by copying the it's current value
into each LTB we transmit, specifically into the REVOOB field of the
LTB.
                    ;;;boy would an anatomy of an LTB
                    ;;; thingie be nice here
XMTOOB is the sequence number of the oldest outstanding LTB not
yet acknowledged. It is initially 0. When XMTOOB = XMTGEN nothing
is outstanding so a new LTB can be created.
When XMTOOB = XMTGEN - 1 then one block is unacknowledged
and may need to be retransmitted; All other possibilities indicate errors.
 There are three possible states of a node:
(1)  RECIEVING DATA
     (2)  READY TO TRANSMIT DATA with XMTOOB = XMTGEN - 1
     hence  the LTB numbered XMTOOB will have to be retransmitted
   (3)  READY TO TRANSMIT DATA with XMTOOB = XMTGEN
     hence  A new LTB can be created and then increase
            XMTGEN by one and finnally transmit the new
            LTB for the first time.
Also note that XMTOOB is initially zero; XMTOOB is updated

by the recieve pipeline upon the reciept of a valid LTB.
The RCVOOB variable in each node is thus copied to the XMTOOB
by means of the REVOOB field. Normally both variables will
increase in a node each time an LTB is recieved, indicating
both that the LTB has just been recieved and that it carried
with it an new a new REVOOB value implicitly acknowledging an
LTB in the reverse diredtion. XMTOOB will fail to increase by
one if REVOOB didn't get larger, thus indicating the loss of
the immediately preceding LTB in the other direction (outgoing).
Both XMTOOB and RCVOOB will fail to increase if the incoming
packet was rejected.
Each LTB contains a header consisting of the SEQ, REVOOB, ORIG/ANS,
ESCAPE and LENGTH fields. After these follow the real data, and 
finnally a two bit checksum. (;;;Further breakdown follows below)
The SEQ field is the sequence number for the LTB , affixed to it
at the time it was created. At that time it was equal to XMTGEN
which was just before XMTGEN was increased by one. The REVOOB field
is copied from the RCVNAK variable of the sending node each time the
LTB is retransmitted, and stored in the XMTNAK variable of the 
recieving node. The ORIG/ANS bit tells who is sending a given LTB, 
it is 0 for the "originate" or dial-out-node and 1 for the "answer"
node; this allows echo back to be ignored. The other fields are
discussed later.
The SEQ and REVOOB fields of the LTB are each 3 bits, thus
representing a value modulo 8. XMTOOB in each node is obviously
a 3 bit number since it is obtained REVOOB of the same LTB.
The global variables XMTGEN and RCVOOB in each node may be reduced 
modulo 8 (masked down to 3 bits each) or kept as full 8-bit or
larger variables, but all comparisons must be done modulo 8.
For example, where the rest for XMTOOB = XMTGEN - 1 is done,
the actual test is (XMTGEN-XMTOOB) MOD 8 = 1
Although half-duplex turnaround will be discussed in more detail
later it is necesary to introduce it here in order for one to
understand the starup procedure. Each node when completly done
with transmission and wanting to go into recieve mode while the
other transmits; issues 5 copies of a special half-duplex turnaround
character. To remind those who may have forgotten the half-duplex
turnaround characters are [[[[[ and ]]]]] otherwise know as open
and close square brackets as you can see I have shown you 5 of them.
If the other node gets at least 3 of them it will start transmitting.
In the rare case where fewer than 3 get through a "deadlock" condition
will result which will require either manual intervention or
timeout. To avoid acting upon it's own echo, each node has it's
own half-duplex turnaround character and furthermore each node
responds only to the other's. When the originating node wishes 
to stop transmitting it sends 5 close square brackets ]]]]].
When the recieving node wishes to stop transmitting it sends 5
open square brackets [[[[[.
Initially the originating node transmits the necessary characters
to log into the answering node's dialup port and start up the PCNET
program. It then sits in a wait loop until it recieves at least 
3 open square brackets. Upon getting them it enters the transmit
pipeline and sends the first formal transmission. Everything before
this point is called Initial Connect Protocol or ICP for short.
Upon getting the phone call the answering node initializes itself,

then transmits 5 open square brackets and enters the recieve 
pipeline awaiting the first formal transmission.
Protocol will be desribed in the terms of the originate-node which
after ICP first transmits then recieves; repeating the TRANSMIT-
-THEN-RECIEVE as often as needed. Protocol for answer is the same
execpt that after ICP it jumps into the middle of the loop.
short. 
Protocol will be described in terms of the originate-node which
first transmits theieves ; repeating the TRANSMIT-THEN-RECIEVE
as often as needed. Protocol for the answer node is the same except
that initially it jumps into the middle of the loop.
                 <LINK-LEVEL-DETAILS>
               <LINK LEVEL TRANSMIT DETAILS>
1. TRANSMIT FIVE ATSIGNS
   Note:This may partially overlap the square brackets
        from the other node.
2. Compare  XMTGEN AND XMTOOB.
   If XMTGEN = XMTOOB (modulo 8)
   then construct an LTB as follows:
     2.1 Read in as much binary data as there is available
         providing you don't exceed the limit of approximately
         60 bytes.
     2.2 Append 2 bytes in front of it as follows:
         (Note all masks are in hexidecimal)
            First Byte , mask 07: REVOOB, leave 0 for now
              "    "     mask 38: SEQ, set equal to XMTGEN
              "    "     mask 40: unused, so set to 0
              "    "     mask 80: ORIG/ANS set to your node #
                                  i.e. 0 if you are the originator(dialout)
                                       1 (80) if you are the answerer.
              Second Byte; LENGTH set to the total number of bytes so
                           far which is 2 plus the number of data bytes.
                           Checksum bytes which are added later don't
                           count.  
          2.3 Increase XMTGEN by 1
         The user may choose either to maintain this variable modulo
         8 or keep the full value (perhaps modulo 256 or 65536).
         In the later case, reduction modulo 8 must be done when setting
         XMTGEN to SEQ as done in step 2.2 above. 
         Reguardless of whether steps 2.1 thru 2.3 were executed
         (XMTGEN = XMTOOB (MOD 8) above) or shipped 
         It is safe now to assume XMTGEN = XMTOOB+1(modulo 8). In advanced
         versions this may not be true, but the programmer may install a check
         here, generating an error message if not true.
          ;;; I'll let scribe do the indenting and outdenting (exactly right)
          ;;; when document goes into production....
4. TRANSMIT THE LTB NUMBERED XMTOOB AS FOLLOWS:
     4.1 Copy the RCVOOB variable (mod 8) and patch in the REVOOB
         field of the header. Note that if this is a retransmission the
         new value Replaces the old value!
     4.2 Compare the odd/even checksum (see the appendix)
     4.3 If the length which is the content of the second byte is odd
         append an extra byte of exactly 0 after the checksum.
         Do not modify the second byte!!!
     4.4 Transmit an atsign to signal the start of an LTB.


                                   13
Text: PCNET; The personal computer network                        page 5

     4.5 Step through the LTB, translating each pair of bytes to three 
         bytes of MOD-41, mapping each MOD-41 byte to a RADIX-41 character.
         Going into the binary to MOD-41 conversion, the first byte of each 
         pair is the low-order (1) and the second is the high-order (256)
         byte. Coming out of the conversion, the low-order (1) byte is
         transmitted first, the the middle order (41), then the high order
         (1684) last.
     4.6 Transmit an atsign (to signal end of LTB and to re-sync the
         other node's UART if line noise threw it out of correct framing.)
5. In advanced nodes, step 4 could be repeated for additional LTBs, 
   but in the default half-duplex 1-of-8 window mode, there is nothing
   useful to do now, so proceed to half-duplex turaround.
LINK LEVEL HALF-DUPLEX TURN-AROUND
Node 1 (answer) starts here as soon as it is warmed up after ICP,
and this piece of code actually sends the [[[[[ thatt signal the 
end of ICP.
1. (Anwering node begins here) Transmit five square-brackets.
    If this is the answering node (node #1) they should be open square
    brackets. If this is the originate node (node #0) they should be
    close  square brackets ]]]]]. 
LINK-LEVEL-RECIEVE-PIPELINE
1. Setup co-routine linkage or save variable so that the first time
   the LTB-parser is called it will initially start at statement 1.
   Later calls will resume where it left off, by appropriate modification
   of the co-routine linkage (automatic) or the variable (explicit).
2. The HDX-parser will be given control initially at statement 1.
   Then the HDX-parser will and the LTB-parser will pass control back
   and forth, each continuing where it left off after the other returns 
   control. See appendix for examples of how to do this.
Note in the HDX-parser where it says "pass <anything> to the LTB
parser" it means : (1) save the current address so that upon return
the next statement gets executed, (2) put that <anything> into the
accumulator so that it will be accessable to the LTB parser, (3)
jump (indirect) to whatever address is in the LTB-parser continuation
address.
In the LTB-parser where it says "return control to the HDX-parser"
it means step 1 and 3 of above but with roles of HDX and LTB reversed.
The term "the byte" refers to the value in the accumulator, which 
had just previously been stashed there by step(2).
LINK-LEVEL-HDX-PARSER
1. Set TURNCT to 3. When this reaches 0, half duplex turanaround occurs.
2. Wait for characters from the UART, input it.
3. If it is the other node's flavor of square brackets then do this:
     3.1 Decrease TURCNT by 1.
         If it has reached 0 jump to the transmit pipeline.
     3.2 Otherwise go to 2.
4. If the character is atsign (@) then do this:
     4.1 If TURCNT < 3 then increase TURNCNT by 1.
     4.2 Pass a byte of -1 to the LTB-parser.
     4.3 Upon returning go to 2.
5. Convert the character to MOD-41. If it is illegal go to 2,
   otherwise pass the MOD-41 byte to the LTB-parser and upon
   return go to 2.
RECIEVE-PARSER-LTB-PARSER
 Save the byte from the HDX-parser where it won't get clobbered


                                   14
Text: PCNET; The personal computer network                        page 6

 by the following.
1. Erase the recieve LTB buffer area and MOD-41-to-BINARY
   3 byte buffer. Restore the byte from where it was saved.
2. If the byte is less than zero (i.e. it is a -1 derived from an
   incoming atsign) then go to 6.
3. Deposit the byte in the MOD-41-to-BINARY buffer.
   If it is now full (it was the 3rd byte) then do the following:
     3.1 If the recieve-LTB buffer is also full, it is an error
         condition caused by too much data from the other node
         therefore go to 5.
     3.2 Convert the 3 bytes of MOD-41 to 2 bytes of binary;
         notice this is the inverse of the operation done in
         the transmit pipeline.
     3.3 Deposit the 2 bytes i the recieve-LTB buffer, low order
         byte first.
     3.4 Reinitailize the 3 byte MOD-41-to-BINARY buffer to 0.
4. Return control to the HDX-parser, upon return go to 2.
5. Loop, passing control to the HDX-parser, on return check the
   byte, if not -1 keep looping, if -1 then announce the error
   "LONG LTB" and go to 19.
6. If both the recieve-LTB buffer and the MOD-41-to-BINARY buffer
   are empty, a null string between consecutive atsigns was seen
   pas control to HDX-parser, on return go to 1.
7. TRACE: Announce that an apperent LTB has been parsed.
          (Next we check its validity)
8. If the recieve-LTB buffer contains fewer than 4 bytes (2 pairs
   from 2 sets of MOD-41 triples), it is too short give error 
   message and go to to 19.
9. If the MOD-41 buffer isn't empty and the LTB was not a multiple of 3 bytes 
   give error message and go to 19.
10. Compute Checksum (please see appendix)
    If both parts aren't 0, bad parity, give error message and
    then go to 19.
11. If the second byte of the LTB-buffer is old and the last byte is
    exactly 0 then delete that last byte creating an odd lenght buffer.
12. Delete the last 2 bytes of the LTB buffer.
13. If the second byte doesn't equal the length of the LTB-buffer
   then length is wrong give error message and then go to 19.
14. If the ORIG/ANS bit is the same as my own node #
    (0 = ORIG , 1 = ANS) echoplex, semi-error message go to 19.
15. If the UNUSED (ESCAPE) bit is non-zero protocol violation
    then give error message go to 19.
16. Extract the REVOOB field and store in XMTOOB variable.
17. Extract the SEQ field, compare with the RCVOOB variable 
    If SEQ = RCVOOB (mod 8) then proceed to 18; 
    Else if SEQ = RCVOOB-1 (mod 8) then announce DUPLICATE <SEQ>
    and go to 19;
    Else protocol violation go to 19.
18. Ignore the first 2 bytes which are the header, pass the remaining
    bytes up to the pure binany control point. In an echoback test
    setup these buffered bytes are fed back into the transmit pipeline
    other test setups would merely output the octal and/or text for
    each byte. 
19. Pass control to the HDX-parser, upon return go to 1.
                  <MODIFICATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PPSs>


                                   15

Attached to each Process-to-Process Stream are the following attributes:
       PPS-NO                    <MODIFICATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PPSs>
Attached to each stream are the following attributes : PPS-NO
(an 8-bit number identifying the particular stream uniquely
 with respect to the given direction, i.e. each stream assigns
 it's own outgoing stream numbers), SRC-PROC (an 8-bit number 
identifying the originator of a stream, used by the other node
to establish a reply stream if one doesn't already exist), DEST-PROC
(an 8-bit number specifying the process to which a stream is 
addressed). When a PPS is started, all these attributes must be
specified, later to continue a PPS only the PPS-NO used need be
specified.
Formally a PPS is up into segments called PPSBs (Process-to-Process
Stream Blocks) with a 3 or 5-word header at the front of each
PPSB. These PPSBs are then sent as the data portion of an LTB.
In default mode, it is more convenient to combine the LTB and
PPSB wrapping and unwrapping into a single pair of procedures,
and to reguard each LTB/PPSB to have a toal of 5 or 7 bytes of
header and 2 bytes of checksum.
After the 2 byte of LTB header, the next byte is the PPSB-MULT
byte which is subdivided into several fields: FIRST-BLOCK-BIT
(mask 80) is on if this is the first block in a new PPS, i.e.
an END-OF-STREAM signal will be generated in the recieving node
upon completion of unwrapping of this block; UNUSED (mask 38)
should be 0; MOD-8-BLOC-NO (mask 07) the sequence number of this
block WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR PPS. The next byte is the 8-bit PPS-NO.
The next-byte is the 8-bit THIS-BLOCK-LEN which includes the PPSB
header and PPSB data but not any of the the LTB header, this 
field is always two less than the second byte of the LTB header.
(If THIS-BLK-LEN is checked for validity, the error rate on a
noisy phone line drops by 256, becoming less than I error in 256.3
days = 2 years.)
If this is the first block in a PPS, i.e. the FIRST-BLK-BIT is
set, then next comes the SRC-PROC followed by the DEST-PROC
followed by the data, otherwise the data immediately follows 
THIS-BLK-LEN. 
When transmitting data, when constructing a new LTB because
XMTOOB=XMTGEN, simply skip of 2+3 or 2+5 instead on 2 bytes,
fill data until data runs out or the maximum size of the LTB
if filled, then patch in the PPSB header fields and then proceed
with patching in the LTB header (except REVNAK of course) as
before. One important restriction, a control message, i.e a PPS
with DEST-PROC = 0, absolutely must fit within a single PPSB.
It is mandatory to ignore the data of any not-FIRST-BLOCK
for any unknown or ignored PPS, and it permissable toignore
any PPS that is addressed to some process not present on this node,
or to ignore any new PPS while an old one is still open. Normally,
in default mode, only one PPS will be active at a time, greatly
reducing buffering requirements and simplifying programming.
At this point a test setup may permit the operator on one node to
generate PPSs "from" one "process" to another, have the software
generate sample PPS-NOs and do blocking, and the operator on the
other node may read the trace of PPS output and verify it's
correctness based on a-priori test conditions.

After an error return from the CREAUX UUO, if the lh(AC) is 0,
the right half is a supervisor error code:
  1	Format error
  2	User not in MUD
  3	Bad MUD
  4	System not available
  5	Downline load/dialout request failure
  6	Timeout
  7	Access barred

These error codes are found imediately after label AUXERR in
the supervisor source code.

Text: DIALOUT1; Tymnet-I dialout protocol                         page 1

Date: 2/25/77           Dialout I
	To use dialout in TYMNET I the host program must have auxiliary
circuit license and know the node number of a node with a dialout unit.  The
host program makes an auxiliary circuit request with login string:
		NNNN:197;
where NNNN is the octal number of the node the circuit is to be built to.  If
the remote has no dialout driver there will be no response after the circuit
is complete and the supervisor's log will get a BAD RECORD entry that
looks like:   2NNNN, 100015, 3NNNN.  Furthermore, dialout circuits will look
to PROBE as dead end circuits.
	Once the circuit is established the host program will recieve a 08 (hex)
followed by the port number assigned.  After recieving this confirmation the
host program sends the telephone number (any number of digits) as ASCII digits
(eg 0 is 30X) followed by a line feed.  Immediately following the line feed
may be data destined for the terminal.  (The first data after the line feed
should be instructions to the ascii driver about baud rates in and out, and
carriage return parameters.)  If all goes well with the call the remote will
send a 09, 08.  All subsequent data will be from the terminal called.
	The normal termination of a dialout is for the host program to send
a hang character pair.  (This facility does not presently exist on the PDP10,
it is recommended for the present to send a yellow ball and zap the circuit
after receiving an orange ball.)  The remote will respond with 09,0C to
indicate it is ready for another telephone number.  The host program should
respond as if it had just received the 08, port number originally.

		General notes:
	If the attempt to build the auxiliary circuit fails with supervisor
error type 5 it is for one of the following reasons:  1. the supervisor does
not have complete control of the requesting base of destination remote, 2. no
more ports are available on the reqesting host, 3. requesting and
destination node numbeers are the same, 4. the destination node is out of
passthrough buffer pairs, 5. circuits busy, 6. destination is not an
Interdata remote.
	When the circuit is first built the dialer driver will immediately
zap the circuit if the dialout port if being hung, if the phone line is busy,
or the driver is not in the idle state.
	When the circuit is first built a 15 second timeout is started.  The
phone number and line feed must be received and accepted by the dialer by this
time.  An explanation of timeouts follows.


			Anomolous Occurances

1. Line to dialed out terminal goes away
	presently this causes a zapper to be generated.  As soon as the PDP10
	system and base codes are enabled to trigger a software interrupt
	in response to a special network character pair, the remote will be
	modified to send that character pair followed by 09, 0D.  The remote

				MAINTENACE

	The code currently drives only one data set (103A) and dialer (801C).
Ports 0-4 are used to drive both units.  The cable used has a single connector
panel plug and two cannon plugs at the other end.  The data set is connected
to one of the cannon plugs in the standard way on port 4.  Ports 0-3 are used
to drive the 801C.  The connections are as follows:

Date: 4/26/78                   Dialout II

I.  Introduction.

This document provides an overview of the hardware and software that
comprise OnTyme's Dialout system.  The major components are:

    A.  The Vadic VA820 Multiline Automatic Calling System, described
        in the following Vadic manuals:
        18008-011       MACS
        18008-012       MACS dialers
        18008-013       MACS RS232C adaptor
        18008-014       MACS modems

    B.  Tymnet support for the VA820 MACS, described in section II.

    C.  The OnTyme dialout package, described in section III.

II.  Network aspects.

The Vadic MACS hardware is accessed through a modified asynchronous
Tymcom.  The Tymcom represents a single logical host;  predefined user
names on that host select the adaptor/dialer or a particular group of
equivalent modems (i.e., modems connected to the same class of telephone
service -- local, WATS, etc.).  When a circuit is built to a user name
on the Tymcom, the Tymcom selects a group member it believes to be free,
establishes a connection to it, and sends back two Ascii characters
representing the slot address (which is required when dialing) of the
selected member, expressed in decimal.  This is true even when the user
name refers to the adaptor, which is in a group by itself.

Except for the above-mentioned character pair which is sent upon login,
the Tymcom communicates with Dialout exclusively by means of port status
messages, which cause a software interrupt on the PDP-10 and convey a
four-bit status code.  Currently-defined codes are:

    1   Answer tone detected.  The Tymcom also sends this code as soon
        as a circuit is built to the adaptor, to signify that the dialer
        is ready.

    2   Hangup acknowledgment, sent in response to a hang character
        pair.

    3   Line lost.

    The next four codes are responses to an attempt to log into the
    Tymcom:

    4   All ports busy.

    5   Bad Sup port.

    6   No host.

    7   Please try again.

The Tymcom, having been designed to interface a host to the network,
knows essentially nothing about dealing with the terminals that it 
dials;  in particular, it does no echoing and no padding after CR's and
LF's.  The one exception to this rule is that it recognizes and 
correctly handles the "set output baud rate" network message;  the
default rate appears to be 110 baud.

III.  OnTyme Dialout Design Overview.

A.  Introduction.
This section provides an overview of the design of Dialout II.  The
procedure descriptions are schematic; in particular, abnormal condition
detection, reporting, and recovery, which account for a great deal of
the complexity of the design, are ignored here.  For more detail, see
the individual module specifications.

B.  Design goals.
    1.  Maximize concurrency in the use of the Vadic dialers.  This
        implies one process per modem.
    2.  Minimize the number of auxiliary circuits built and torn down.
        This implies that Dialout must identify all the calls it needs
        to make and sort them by node and dialer before making any
        calls.
    3.  Minimize the number of disk accesses. Special provisions have
        been made in the DBM for determining whether a user may have a
        message waiting without examining his entire IN-list, and for
        determining whether some user assigned to a station may have a
        rush message waiting without examining all users' IN-lists.
    4.  Maximize modifiability.  Since changes are sure to be required
        as experience accumulates, an effort has been made to keep the
        design straightforward and modular.

C.  Overview.
Dialout II may be regarded as a tree with three branches.  The root
(DO000) serves as a driver for the three branches and is responsibile
for scheduling itself periodically.  The first branch (modules named
DO1nn) is responsible for deciding which stations must be called;  the
second branch (modules named DO2nn) determines which dialer and modem
group to use and sorts the calls to be made by dialer and modem group;
and the third branch (modules named DO3nn) does the actual calling. 

DO000 -- Dialout (process). Sprouted at OnTyme initialization; never
    terminates. Awakens periodically and calls DO100 to decide which
    stations must be called. If DO100 returns a nonempty list, calls
    DO200 to assign the stations to modem groups and sort by MACS and
    group, then sprouts one instantiation of DO300 for each MACS to be
    used.  When all instantiations of DO300 have terminated, schedules
    the next wakeup and goes back to sleep.

    DO100 -- BuildListOfStationsRequiringService (procedure).  Returns a
        list of stations that must be called during the current
        execution of Dialout.

        DO110 -- TimeToPoll (procedure).  Determines whether a station's


                                   34
Text: DIALOUT2; Tymnet-II dialout protocol                        page 3

            regular polling time has arrived since the last time Dialout
            ran.

        DO111 -- BuildListOfUsersWithMessagesWaiting (procedure).
            Returns a list of users assigned to a given station who have
            unread messages waiting.

            DO120 -- GetUnreadMessageList (procedure).  Returns a list
                of unread messages that originated on the local host for
                a given user.

    DO200 -- AssignStationsToModemGroups (procedure).  Returns a data
        structure in which each station requiring service is associated
        with the MACS and modem group that will be used to service it.

        DO210 -- LookUpAreaCode/Exchange (procedure).  Decides which
            MACS and modem group should be used to sevice a given
            station.

    DO300 -- ServiceMACS (process).  Builds a circuit to the dialer,
        sprouts one instantiation of ServiceModemGroup for each modem
        group associated with the given MACS that is to be used, waits
        until all have terminated, zaps the circuit, and terminates
        itself.

        DO310 -- ServiceModemGroup (process).  Sprouts one instantiation
            of ServiceModem for each modem in the given group that is to
            be used, waits until all have terminated, and terminates
            itself.

            DO320 -- ServiceModem (process).  Builds an auxiliary
                circuit to the modem, calls ServiceStation repeatedly
                until no stations remain to be serviced through the
                group of which the modem is a member, zaps the circuit,
                and terminates itself.

                DO330 -- ReadSlotAddress (procedure).  Called by both
                    ServiceMACS and ServiceModem to read and interpret
                    the slot address sent by the Tymcom when a circuit
                    is built to it.

                DO331 -- ServiceStation (procedure).  Dials the station;
                    verifies the answerback, if requested;  polls for
                    input, if requested;  calls ServiceUser for each
                    user assigned to the station with messages waiting;
                    and hangs up the phone.

                    DO340 -- Dial (procedure).  Sends the phone number
                        to the dialer and waits for answertone or
                        timeout.

                    DO341 -- SetTerminalCharacteristics (procedure).
                        Informs the Tymcom of the characteristics of the
                        terminal just dialed.

                    DO342 -- LogInStation (procedure).  Initializes
                        Usercor fields which depend only on account or
                        station.

                    DO343 -- VerifyAnswerback (procedure).  Reads and
                        checks answerback code, if one is specified for
                        the terminal.

                    DO344 -- Poll (procedure).  Called only if the
                        station is flagged "poll for input".  Performs a
                        pseudo-logon for the station, sends an X-ON,
                        reads and processes text until EOT or timeout,
                        and performs a pseudo-logoff.

                    DO345 -- ServiceUser (procedure).  Performs a
                        pseudo-logon for the user, calls READ once for
                        each message waiting for the user, and performs
                        a pseudo-logoff.

                    DO346 -- Hangup (procedure).  Hangs up the telephone
                        (while retaining the auxiliary circuit to the
                        modem) and waits for acknowledgment from the
                        modem.

                        DO350 -- DialoutLogon (procedure).  Initializes
                            Usercor fields which depend on the
                            particular user;  resets counters and
                            workspace;  sets logon date and time.

                        DO351 -- DialoutLogoff (procedure).  Sets logoff
                            date and time and writes an accounting
                            record.

                        DO352 -- DialoutLineInput (procedure).  An
                            abbreviated version of Line!Input which
                            recognizes only :TEXT, :SEND, :MORE, and
                            text lines.

The CPARW word in the MUD contains 16 bits of information
about the user.  Those bits which are currently assigned are
described below:


100000	Internal billable user
 40000	Premium program access
 10000	Shut overide status
  4000	Account supervisor status
  2000	Hush (supress Tymshare message at login)

Text: MUDDY; Makes changes in MUD                                 page 1

Muddy communicates with NCUD1:1 over an aux circuit and allows
the user to make several changes to the master user directory.
The changes are written to a temp file on system 1 which is
(eventually) written to the supervisor.  The operations
available are listed on the next page.

Some (it is not clear which) of the changes are (eventually)
propogated to some (usually only 940's) of the hosts which
the user in question is currently valid.  This is especially
true of the CPARW word with 940's.  It is also true of delete
user with all hosts (watch out!).

Text: PASSWORD; Program to change passwords                       page 1

The program (WRS)PASWRD will allow any user with AC license
to change the password of any user name in the mud.
One should thus be careful.

Note: when one uses the "SET GFD only" command in MUDDY or
NONAME or 1UPDATE or such, the effect is to change the
user's password to some mush which prevents login.  The
PASWRD program will conviently undo this curse.
