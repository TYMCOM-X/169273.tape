Date: 4/26/78                   Dialout II

I.  Introduction.

This document provides an overview of the hardware and software that
comprise OnTyme's Dialout system.  The major components are:

    A.  The Vadic VA820 Multiline Automatic Calling System, described
        in the following Vadic manuals:
        18008-011       MACS
        18008-012       MACS dialers
        18008-013       MACS RS232C adaptor
        18008-014       MACS modems

    B.  Tymnet support for the VA820 MACS, described in section II.

    C.  The OnTyme dialout package, described in section III.

II.  Network aspects.

The Vadic MACS hardware is accessed through a modified asynchronous
Tymcom.  The Tymcom represents a single logical host;  predefined user
names on that host select the adaptor/dialer or a particular group of
equivalent modems (i.e., modems connected to the same class of telephone
service -- local, WATS, etc.).  When a circuit is built to a user name
on the Tymcom, the Tymcom selects a group member it believes to be free,
establishes a connection to it, and sends back two Ascii characters
representing the slot address (which is required when dialing) of the
selected member, expressed in decimal.  This is true even when the user
name refers to the adaptor, which is in a group by itself.

Except for the above-mentioned character pair which is sent upon login,
the Tymcom communicates with Dialout exclusively by means of port status
messages, which cause a software interrupt on the PDP-10 and convey a
four-bit status code.  Currently-defined codes are:

    1   Answer tone detected.  The Tymcom also sends this code as soon
        as a circuit is built to the adaptor, to signify that the dialer
        is ready.

    2   Hangup acknowledgment, sent in response to a hang character
        pair.

    3   Line lost.

    The next four codes are responses to an attempt to log into the
    Tymcom:

    4   All ports busy.

    5   Bad Sup port.

    6   No host.

    7   Please try again.

The Tymcom, having been designed to interface a host to the network,
knows essentially nothing about dealing with the terminals that it 
dials;  in particular, it does no echoing and no padding after CR's and
LF's.  The one exception to this rule is that it recognizes and 
correctly handles the "set output baud rate" network message;  the
default rate appears to be 110 baud.

III.  OnTyme Dialout Design Overview.

A.  Introduction.
This section provides an overview of the design of Dialout II.  The
procedure descriptions are schematic; in particular, abnormal condition
detection, reporting, and recovery, which account for a great deal of
the complexity of the design, are ignored here.  For more detail, see
the individual module specifications.

B.  Design goals.
    1.  Maximize concurrency in the use of the Vadic dialers.  This
        implies one process per modem.
    2.  Minimize the number of auxiliary circuits built and torn down.
        This implies that Dialout must identify all the calls it needs
        to make and sort them by node and dialer before making any
        calls.
    3.  Minimize the number of disk accesses. Special provisions have
        been made in the DBM for determining whether a user may have a
        message waiting without examining his entire IN-list, and for
        determining whether some user assigned to a station may have a
        rush message waiting without examining all users' IN-lists.
    4.  Maximize modifiability.  Since changes are sure to be required
        as experience accumulates, an effort has been made to keep the
        design straightforward and modular.

C.  Overview.
Dialout II may be regarded as a tree with three branches.  The root
(DO000) serves as a driver for the three branches and is responsibile
for scheduling itself periodically.  The first branch (modules named
DO1nn) is responsible for deciding which stations must be called;  the
second branch (modules named DO2nn) determines which dialer and modem
group to use and sorts the calls to be made by dialer and modem group;
and the third branch (modules named DO3nn) does the actual calling. 

DO000 -- Dialout (process). Sprouted at OnTyme initialization; never
    terminates. Awakens periodically and calls DO100 to decide which
    stations must be called. If DO100 returns a nonempty list, calls
    DO200 to assign the stations to modem groups and sort by MACS and
    group, then sprouts one instantiation of DO300 for each MACS to be
    used.  When all instantiations of DO300 have terminated, schedules
    the next wakeup and goes back to sleep.

    DO100 -- BuildListOfStationsRequiringService (procedure).  Returns a
        list of stations that must be called during the current
        execution of Dialout.

        DO110 -- TimeToPoll (procedure).  Determines whether a station's
            regular polling time has arrived since the last time Dialout
            ran.

        DO111 -- BuildListOfUsersWithMessagesWaiting (procedure).
            Returns a list of users assigned to a given station who have
            unread messages waiting.

            DO120 -- GetUnreadMessageList (procedure).  Returns a list
                of unread messages that originated on the local host for
                a given user.

    DO200 -- AssignStationsToModemGroups (procedure).  Returns a data
        structure in which each station requiring service is associated
        with the MACS and modem group that will be used to service it.

        DO210 -- LookUpAreaCode/Exchange (procedure).  Decides which
            MACS and modem group should be used to sevice a given
            station.

    DO300 -- ServiceMACS (process).  Builds a circuit to the dialer,
        sprouts one instantiation of ServiceModemGroup for each modem
        group associated with the given MACS that is to be used, waits
        until all have terminated, zaps the circuit, and terminates
        itself.

        DO310 -- ServiceModemGroup (process).  Sprouts one instantiation
            of ServiceModem for each modem in the given group that is to
            be used, waits until all have terminated, and terminates
            itself.

            DO320 -- ServiceModem (process).  Builds an auxiliary
                circuit to the modem, calls ServiceStation repeatedly
                until no stations remain to be serviced through the
                group of which the modem is a member, zaps the circuit,
                and terminates itself.

                DO330 -- ReadSlotAddress (procedure).  Called by both
                    ServiceMACS and ServiceModem to read and interpret
                    the slot address sent by the Tymcom when a circuit
                    is built to it.

                DO331 -- ServiceStation (procedure).  Dials the station;
                    verifies the answerback, if requested;  polls for
                    input, if requested;  calls ServiceUser for each
                    user assigned to the station with messages waiting;
                    and hangs up the phone.

                    DO340 -- Dial (procedure).  Sends the phone number
                        to the dialer and waits for answertone or
                        timeout.

                    DO341 -- SetTerminalCharacteristics (procedure).
                        Informs the Tymcom of the characteristics of the
                        terminal just dialed.

                    DO342 -- LogInStation (procedure).  Initializes
                        Usercor fields which depend only on account or
                        station.

                    DO343 -- VerifyAnswerback (procedure).  Reads and
                        checks answerback code, if one is specified for
                        the terminal.

                    DO344 -- Poll (procedure).  Called only if the
                        station is flagged "poll for input".  Performs a
                        pseudo-logon for the station, sends an X-ON,
                        reads and processes text until EOT or timeout,
                        and performs a pseudo-logoff.

                    DO345 -- ServiceUser (procedure).  Performs a
                        pseudo-logon for the user, calls READ once for
                        each message waiting for the user, and performs
                        a pseudo-logoff.

                    DO346 -- Hangup (procedure).  Hangs up the telephone
                        (while retaining the auxiliary circuit to the
                        modem) and waits for acknowledgment from the
                        modem.

                        DO350 -- DialoutLogon (procedure).  Initializes
                            Usercor fields which depend on the
                            particular user;  resets counters and
                            workspace;  sets logon date and time.

                        DO351 -- DialoutLogoff (procedure).  Sets logoff
                            date and time and writes an accounting
                            record.

                        DO352 -- DialoutLineInput (procedure).  An
                            abbreviated version of Line!Input which
                            recognizes only :TEXT, :SEND, :MORE, and
                            text lines.
