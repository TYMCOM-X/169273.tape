			====================

Key Letters - TThe soundex coding system is based upon six master
consonants, their equivalents, and the related numerical codes, as
follows:

	Key Letters	Equivalents		Numerical Code
	-----------	-----------		--------------
	    B		B, F, P, V			1
	    C		C, G, J, K, Q, S, X, Z		2
	    D		D, T				3
	    L		L				4
	    M		M, N				5
	    R		R				6

First Letter of Last Name - The first letter of a last name determines
the main alphabetical section to which the name belongs and under which
the three digit code will be files and is not coded.

Vowels and Consonants - Disreguard the consonants W, H and Y and the
vowels A, E, I, O, U in assigning the proper code.

Key Letters and Equivalents - Translate all consonants other than W, H,
and Y to their respective group number, and place the numerical codes
in the order in which the consonants appear in the name.

Double and Triple Consonants -  When two or more of the same key letters
(or their equivalents) come together, treat them as one key letter and
assign only one number.  Key letters separated by H or W, code as one
letter.

Completing Code - Each code consists of three numbers.  If there are
not enough consonants for three digits, the code is completed by adding
enough zeros.  Example 530.

W and H do not separate.  Y separates.

When first and second letters of the surname are consonants with the
SAME CODE GROUP - neither is coded.
