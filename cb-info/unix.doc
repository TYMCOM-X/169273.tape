    Introduction


     1.0 Introduction


          This  document  describes  the  fundamental  design  content  and
          functions to be implemented for an interface between Unix edition
          7  (Bell  Laboratories)  and  the  PDP-11  based   communications
          processor  (Tymshare  Distributed Systems), on Tymshare 'Dynasty'
          configurations.

          This  document  describes  the  environment  and  the  functional
          aspects  of  the  Unix  /  Local network node interface.  Another
          document   will   be   forthcoming,   describing   the    Dynasty
          configuration's functional requirements.

          The implementation of the  network  node  is  intended  to  allow
          multiplexed  input  into a host system (in this case Unix) and to
          allow diverse host systems to be included in  a  general  network
          configuration.    A  minimal  configuration  would  be  one  host
          connected to one network node which multiplexes  terminal  input.
          Logical  extensions  to  this  configuration  are the addition of
          other nodes daisy-chained or connected directly to the host,  and
          the  addition  of  logical  links  to  foreign  networks (such as
          Tymnet) to the node.

          The functionality described herein is intended to allow the above
          configurations  to  be  created with minimal modification to Unix
          yet to operate efficiently under reasonable load.   To  this  end
          the  interface  design  considers  most  sockets available on the
          network to be ttys and as such to be subject to the general  Unix
          tty character handling scheme.

     2.0 Unix i/o system


          This section gives an overview of the workings of  the  Unix  i/o
          system.    Particular  attention  is  given  to  the  design  and
          implementation of the device driver required  for  interfacing  a
          network node to Unix.

          Unix is a general purpose multi-user interactive  environment  on
          the PDP-11.  It offers a number of features, including

          1.  An  hierarchical  file   system   incorporating   demountable
              volumes,

          2.  Compatible file, device and inter-process I/O,

          3.  The ability to initiate asynchronous processes,

          4.  System command language selectable on a per-user basis,

          5.  Over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages,

          6.  High degree of portability.


          Of particular importance to this document, are points  1  through
          3.   The  Unix  kernel  can  be  considered  as  primarily an I/O
          multiplexor rather than an operating system.   All  system  calls
          implement  some  I/O  primitive,  other  calls are handled by the
          creation of a dedicated asynchronous process in  user  space,  to
          handle  the  function.   This  extends  to  incorporate the basic
          command interpretation functions.  In this way it is possible  to
          define  alternate  command interpretation processes on a per-user
          basis.

          System calls all  present  a  uniform  interface  to  the  kernel
          irregardless  of  which  device  is being addressed.  A device or
          file or inter-process "pipe" is given a filename which  is  based
          upon  an  hierarchical structure or file system.  The form of the
          filename is the path that must be traced in accessing the "file".
          Each  element  of  the  path  is  a filename and each filename is
          separated from it's successor by a  slash  "/".   A  slash  alone
          refers to the root directory file.  (A directory file consists of
          a list of filenames and their appropriate pointer into the system
          file list or "inode list".  The filename /alpha/beta/gamma refers
          to the file gamma existing as an entry in directory  beta,  which
          exists  as  an entry in directory alpha, which exists as an entry
          in the root ("/") directory.)

          To efface the difference between a device and a file existing  on
          the  file  system  volume(s),  the  notion  of "special" files is
          provided.  These files exist as  directory  entries  in  /dev/...
          These special files correspond to the hardware devices that exist
          in the system and to access these devices, it is  necessary  only
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                          Page 3
    Unix i/o system


          to     open     the     respective     special     file.     E.g.
          open("/dev/console",...) will cause I/O to be  performed  on  the
          system console.


          2.1 Device classes


               Two device classes are implemented in the Unix  i/o  system;
               block  and  character.   The block interface is suitable for
               devices such as disks, tapes etc, which can be made to  work
               in  512  byte  blocks  and  can  be  used in a direct access
               fashion.   Character-type   devices   have   a   much   more
               straightforward  interface,  although  more work is done and
               time spent, by the driver.

               Devices of both types are named  by  a  major  and  a  minor
               number.  The major number usually selects the driver and the
               minor number selects a  socket  controlled  by  the  driver.
               Both  block  and  character  devices share the same range of
               major numbers.  The overlap is of no  significance  as  both
               sets  of  minor  numbers  are  used as indices into separate
               tables.


          2.2 I/o overview


               When a user process issues an open or a creat  system  call,
               an  entry  is  made  in the per-process data area "u" in the
               table u_ofile.  This table is indexed by the file descriptor
               returned  by  the  system  and  is  used by subsequent read,
               write, status and close system calls.   The  only  entry  in
               u_ofile  is  a pointer into the per-system file table.  This
               table is maintained to map accesses to a  common  file  from
               processes  generated by fork execution.  Thus all entries in
               this table correspond exactly to  each  successful  open  or
               creat  system  call.   The  table entry pointed to, contains
               file access status bits, a count which determines  when  the
               entry  should  be flushed from the table (when all accessing
               processes have closed it.

               There is  also  a  32  bit  file  offset  pointer  used  for
               subsequent  read  or  write  operations.  Finally there is a
               pointer to another per-system table;  the  i-node  table  or
               table of file system node indices.  Each entry in this table
               corresponds to an accessed file.  This entry  describes  the
               context and characteristics of the file existing either as a
               file on a mountable file system or a device special file.

               The major and minor numbers mentioned before  are  retreived
               using this entry in the inode table.  In the case of a block
               device file , the file-system daemon is  invoked  to  return
               the major number corresponding to the device the file exists
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                          Page 4
    Unix i/o system


               on, and the minor number as the node on the device at  which
               the file appears.  With character type special device files,
               the first  word  of  the  file  block  location  vector,  is
               interpreted  as  a  word  containing the major number in the
               high byte and the minor number in the low byte.   The  major
               number  is  used  to  determine  which device, and the minor
               number (usually) is used by the device service routine, as a
               logical socket on the device.

               A user process open or creat request  will  eventually  call
               the  appropriate  device at its open routine, to perform any
               device specific operations (eg.  rewind a tape, turn on  dtr
               lead of a modem).  However, the device close routine is only
               called when the last process closes the file, ie.  when  the
               i-node table entry is being deallocated.

               When a user file access request is initiated, the file table
               entry  and  the  user's  arguments  are used to define three
               variables in the user's address space.  These are  u.u_base,
               u.u_count  and  u.u_offset.  If the file is a character-type
               special device, the appropriate  device  access  routine  is
               called;    it  is  responsible  for  transferring  data  and
               updating the count and current location  appropriately.   If
               not, the file system process is activated to map the logical
               request into the physical file system structures.

               Files can be opened in one of three modes, these are:- READ,
               WRITE and UPDATE.


          2.3 Character device drivers


               The cdevsw system table specifies the interface routines for
               all character devices.  Each device specifies five routines:
               open, close, read, write and special function.

               The open routine is called whenever the file is opened  with
               the  full device number as argument.  The second argument is
               non-zero only if the file is to be written on.

               The close routine is called when the file is called for  the
               last  time.   The  device number is passed as argument.  The
               second argument is non-zero if the last process that  closed
               the file had it open for writing.

               When write is called,  the  device  number  is  supplied  as
               argument.   The  user  buffer  is  accessed and its contents
               copied (usually) a character at a time, to the device  until
               u.u_count  goes  to zero, or the routine cpass() returns -1;
               an  error  condition.   The  routine  iomove  (local_buffer,
               offset,  count,  flag) can be called to move many characters
               at a faster rate, if this is required.
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                          Page 5
    Unix i/o system


               The read routine is  called  similarly  to  write  except  a
               return is not made until u.u_count characters have been read
               using either passc (character) or iomove.

               In the case of tty devices, the special function system call
               is  implemented  by the directives stty and gtty (or ioctl).
               The former to set device dependent parameters and the latter
               to interrogate the existing parameters.

               Communication between a device driver's  interrupt  routines
               and  the "top-half" system interface is maintained by queues
               of characters and state variables accessed by both levels.


          2.4 Terminal handling


               The last action of the Unix bootstrap procedure is to create
               a  process  whose  sole  purpose  is  to  execute  the  file
               /etc/init.  The process "init" that  is  created  opens  the
               /dev/console  device and forks a login process for it.  When
               a user has logged in on the console, a  command  interpreter
               process  is forked and the user can access any of the system
               utilities available to him.  To terminate this "single-user"
               mode,  a  control-D  (ascii  EOT)  is  typed.   This  causes
               termination of  the  command  interpreter  (shell)  process.
               Control is then returned to the main line of init which then
               opens and reads the file /etc/ttys and forks  several  times
               to  create  a  process  for  each tty specified in the file.
               Each of  these  processes  opens  the  appropriate  tty  for
               reading  and  writing.  Normally, opening the tty involves a
               delay,  since  the  open  is  not  completed  until  someone
               connects  the  tty  with  the appropriate device driver, and
               initiates communication.  Once the circuit out to the tty is
               established,  the login prompt is written out to the device.
               Characters typed by the tty are read one at a time until  an
               end  of  line sequence is detected.  Initially this input is
               read by the function "getty"  called  from  the  appropriate
               "init"  process.   This function uses the initial input as a
               username/password  combination.   The  file  /etc/passwd  is
               scanned  and  the  input  verified.   If  incorrect,  "init"
               terminates with  an  error  status  and  the  initialization
               sequence  is  restarted  for that tty.  If verified however,
               the file name specified in the command interpreter  slot  of
               the  password  file entry is executed.  Usually this program
               will be the default "shell".  When the shell is executed,  a
               prompt  is  sent  to  the  tty and the shell goes into input
               wait.

               Ultimately the shell will terminate because of an explicitly
               typed  EOT  or  as  a result of hanging up.  A hangup signal
               (#1) is generated and is trapped  by  the  "init"  process's
               main path.  Init interprets a hangup signal to mean the file
               /etc/ttys  should  be  read  again  and  the  initialization
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                          Page 6
    Unix i/o system


               procedure restarted for all terminals affected by the signal
               and also for any  other  ttys  that  have  no  active  shell
               process  executing  for  them.  In this way editing the file
               /etc/ttys to include extra or remove  tty  entries,  can  be
               used  with  a  user  generated hangup signal, to add or drop
               lines without rebooting the system.

               The file /etc/ttys contains an entry for  each  tty  in  the
               configuration.   Each  entry  is  on  a  separate  line  and
               consists of three parameters.  The first parameter is either
               "0"  or  "1",  the  former causes the line (and entry) to be
               ignored by "init", the latter causes  it  to  be  effective.
               The  second  parameter  is  passed  as an argument when init
               calls the function "getty" and specifies action to be  taken
               by   getty   when   activating  the  tty.   E.g.   baud-rate
               recognition,  reading  the  login  name  etc.    The   third
               parameter  is a string which defines the device name for the
               applicable tty.  This string  corresponds  to  the  filename
               entry located in /dev, e.g.  /dev/"tty10".


          2.5 Terminal characteristics


               The special functions entry point into  a  character  device
               driver  (sgtty)  is  used to specify or interrogate a set of
               parameters used  by  the  driver  in  processing  i/o.   The
               parameters of standard tty devices are as follows:-



               1.  a byte specifying the input speed

               2.  a byte specifying the output speed

               3.  a byte containing the character erase character (usually
                   "#")

               4.  a byte containing the  line  delete  character  (usually
                   "@")

               5.  a word specifying a mask of applicable modes as follows


                   1.  000001 - Automatic flow control(XON / XOFF)

                   2.  000002 - Return each character as typed

                   3.  000004 - map upper case to lower case on input

                   4.  000010 - echo all input (full duplex)
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                          Page 7
    Unix i/o system


                   5.  000020 - map CR into LF;  echo CR or LF as CR-LF

                   6.  000040 - raw mode;  wake up  on  all  characters  (8
                       bit)

                   7.  000100 - ority allowed on input

                   8.  000200 - even parity allowed on input

                                      NOTE

         Three special characters are  recognised  by  the  tty  device
         driver  on  input;  the End-of-file character control-D (EOT),
         the process interrupt character (DEL) and the  quit  character
         (FS).    These  characters  usually  produce  special  effects
         involving the processes that  currently  belong  in  the  same
         context  group  defined  by  the tty line on input.  EOT input
         will be recognised by any process reading on the tty line,  as
         an End-of-file indication.  DEL will usually cause any process
         within a context group to terminate (unless prior arrangements
         have  been  made  to field these interrupts).  FS has the same
         effect as DEL  except  that  any  terminated  process  in  the
         context  group  will  have a core image file created from it's
         in-core text and data segments.

     3.0 Unix / Network Interface


          This section describes the way in  which  the  network  interface
          will be implemented so as to make use of the general i/o handling
          characteristics of both Unix and the network node code.


          3.1 Hardware


               The tty driver code in Unix currently supports  only  a  few
               low  speed  asynchronous  lines  to  which  terminals can be
               interfaced, viz the KL/DL11, DH11 and DC11.   As  a  way  of
               interfacing  two PDP11 systems, two back to back DR11c's (or
               DRV11's) can be configured such that output on  one  implies
               input  on the other and vice versa.  Various measurements of
               this inter-bus parallel communication path have  shown  that
               the  rate  of  data transfer is limited by software to about
               10,000 bps, which makes  it  a  good  high  speed  link  for
               multiplexed terminal i/o.

               Unix software will run unchanged on any  PDP-11  having  the
               appropriate  memory mapping hardware (e.g.  an 11/34, 11/40,
               11/23,  11/45,  11/60,  11/70).   Note  that  separation  of
               Instruction  and  Data space using active page registers, is
               only  available  on  the  11/45  and  up.   Thus  on   these
               processors,  a user process can be a maximum of 64K words in
               length.  Whereas on the others, a process is constrained  to
               32K words.

               The Dynasty hardware configuration  consists  of  a  Dynasty
               cabinet containing an 8 slot, Q-bus backplane with 30 active
               bus sockets.  The processor used is an LSI-11/23 with memory
               management  but  without floating point.  Memory consists of
               between 96K-128K words of MOS memory.  Eight local terminals
               can  be supported (of which one is the device /dev/console),
               by two dual height DLV11Js each having 4  SLUs  and  limited
               modem  control.   Network interfacing is implemented using a
               dual height DRV11.  Online mass storage is supplied with the
               'Universal Controller' which controls a 26Mb Winchester disk
               plus up too 2 RX02/IBM double density floppies.

               Network node software runs on an LSI-11/2.  Normal  terminal
               interfaces  on  the  local  network  are DLV11's or DZV11's.
               Network interfaces to Tymnet are in  the  form  of  multiple
               logical  "tty"  circuits  over  a DUV11 synchronous protocol
               line.  Daisy-chained nodes are connected via DRV11  parallel
               interfaces or over a serial DUV11 line.  Host interfacing is
               via DRV11.

    Unix / Network Interface


          3.2 Software


               The concept of having a dynamic pool  of  character  devices
               with  arbitrary physical connection requirements, is not new
               to Unix.  The connection of dialed up lines to Unix maps  in
               identically.   Each  physical  line  is  associated  with  a
               special file name and a login process is forked  for  it  by
               init.

               The point at which the  interface  to  the  network  becomes
               orthogonal to the above scheme is when a circuit needs to be
               established from a Unix process to a network  address.   The
               implementation  will  map  special  file  names  of the form
               "/dev/DV", into  logical  ports  implemented  by  the  DRV11
               device driver, where DV indicates the mnemonic for a network
               device as follows:-

                    HS - A local network host
                    TR - A local network terminal
                    WD - A load device on a network node
                    ST - A status device on a network node
                    LP - A line printer device on a network node
                    NT - A TYMNET T.201 gateway on a network node

               In addition to the device name, a local network node or host
               must be specified.  This is accomplished by appending ':nnn'
               to the  filename  (e.g.   "/dev/HS:676"  connects  to  local
               network  host  676).   This will be implemented by modifying
               the pathname decoding logic in  the  kernel  such  that  the
               string 'DV:nnn' is passed to the driver's open routine entry
               point.  The node / host interface protocol is then  employed
               to  establish  the  outgoing  connection  within  the  local
               network.  If multiple DRV11 interfaces exist, then each will
               be  tried  in turn until either a connect ack is returned or
               either a connect nak  other  than  'device  unavailable'  is
               returned, or the DRV11 list is exhausted.

               If only the local network destination node or host number is
               specified  with  the  device name, then the 'wild' socket is
               connected to at the destination (i.e.  the  first  available
               socket  on  the  device specified).  If a specific socket is
               required, then ';mmm' is  appended  to  the  filename  (e.g.
               "/dev/lp:670;2"  connects  to  line printer number 2 on node
               670).

               Incoming connections from the  network,  will  have  a  port
               number  assigned from a dynamic pool of available sockets on
               the applicable DRV11 interface.  These sockets are  assigned
               from  n(max)  down.  Outgoing connections will have a socket
               allocated from  n(min)  up.   The  interface  is  considered
               exhausted if they meet in the middle.
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                         Page 10
    Unix / Network Interface


               When attempting an outgoing connection,  the  local  network
               requires  a connect privilege level.  The device driver will
               assign this value based  upon  who  the  user  is.   If  the
               super-user,  then  the  maximum  of 377(8) is assigned, else
               177(8).

               The host device  when  connected  to  will  be  an  incoming
               connection  request on the apropriate local network host and
               must therefore go through the applicable login sequence  via
               subsequent IO calls to the driver.

               The terminal device when connected to will allow  a  process
               to  drive  a  terminal device.  Nodes are usually configured
               such that the minimum connect privilege is 200 octal.   Thus
               only the super-user can do this.

               The load  device  when  connected  to,  will  allow  a  host
               adjacent or a node adjacent node on the local network, to be
               down-line loaded from the user process.  An  error  response
               is  generated  if  the  node specified does not exist on the
               network or the node is already loaded or is  not  processing
               it's  bootstrap.   The  load  device  for  a  node  directly
               connected to the host, is resident in the device driver  and
               thus  no  network  dialogue  is necessary.  However the node
               bootstrap protocol must be included in the device driver.

               The status device when connected to will allow a  dialog  to
               be  initiated  between  the user process and the appropriate
               software device in the node via subsequent IO calls.

               The line printer device when connected to will allow text to
               be spooled out to it from the user process.

               The TYMNET gateway device when connected to  will  create  a
               circuit  to  the TYMNET supervisor via the gateway indicated
               by 'nnn' (the local network node number).  The login  string
               is  then  written  to  the  NT  device in node 'nnn' and the
               circuit into TYMNET established.

          3.3 Protocols


               This section describes the data flow that will be handled by
               the  DRV11  device  driver  in  the  Unix host.  It deals in
               multiplexed  circuits   through   the   DRV11   to   various
               destinations in the local (and remote) network.

               3.3.1 Node loading

                    When Unix  is  first  brought  up,  the  state  of  the
                    adjacent network node ('base') is not known.  Thus when
                    the first open call causes entry  into  the  driver,  a
                    startup  handshake protocol is observed.  This involves
                    sending a reset message to the base and timing  out  on
                    the  response.   Until  an  acknowledge to the reset is
                    received, the base is considered  down.   All  outgoing
                    connection  requests  will be rejected with 'link down'
                    errors, except the open  of  "/dev/wd:nnn"  (where  nnn
                    refers  to  the  base).   At  this  point,  the startup
                    handshake protocol is suspended and the  load  protocol
                    established.   This  is  accomplished  by  reseting the
                    interface with the following message.

                         Byte     Content     Meaning
                         ----     -------     -------
                          0-1     002307      Prefix
                          2-3     177777      Node bootstrap reset
                          4-5          0      Message data checksum

                    The base is then timed out on a response for 5 seconds.
                    If  the  timeout  elapses,  the  open  is  rejected  as
                    'time-out' (no reply).  If a response is received which
                    is  not  either  100307  or  100707,  then  the open is
                    rejected  with  'inconsistent  link  data'.    If   the
                    response  is  either of 100307 or 100707 (message ack),
                    then the open is returned successful.

                    Once the open has returned successful, the user process
                    can  load data by writing it to the file.  If any error
                    is encountered in loading, then all future writes, will
                    be  returned  with  an  error value (the nak received =
                    140307 or 140707).  (It is recommended that  load  data
                    be  written in 128 byte blocks, so that an error can be
                    related to a specific write).   The  driver  sends  the
                    data  written  through  the  interface in the following
                    format.

                         Byte     Content     Meaning
                         ----     -------     -------
                          0-1     002307      Prefix
                          2-3        128      Message data bytecount
                          4-131        -      Message data
                        132-133        -      Message data checksum (4-131)
   Unix / Dynasty Interface     Jul-24-1980                         Page 12
    Unix / Network Interface


                    All data is sent in an 8 bit wide mode and the open  of
                    "/dev/wd" is done in exclusive use mode, by default.

                    When all data has been transferred,  the  user  process
                    closes the file.  This causes entry to be made into the
                    driver close routine.  The driver takes  this  to  mean
                    that  the  base  should be told to enter it's secondary
                    bootstrap (just loaded).  This is accomplished  by  the
                    message:-

                         Byte     Content     Meaning
                         ----     -------     -------
                          0-1     002307      Prefix
                          2-3          0      boot
                          4-5          0      message data checksum

                    The  driver  then  re-enters  it's  startup   handshake
                    protocol.   Eventually  the driver will receive a reset
                    from the base or a reset  ack  to  it's  own  initiated
                    reset.   The  base  will  then  be  marked  as  up  and
                    connections allowed.

                    Down line loading of a remote node (not adjacent to the
                    host)  works  in  a similar fashion at the user process
                    level, with the exception  that  a  6  character,  left
                    justified  and null padded node number, must be written
                    before the load image.  This number is the network node
                    number of the node to be loaded.  /dev/wd:nnn refers to
                    the load device in a node which  is  adjacent  to  this
                    node  number.   Thus  "cat  idmmm  svnnn > /dev/wd:mmm"
                    loads a remote network node where 'nnn' and  'mmm'  are
                    different.

                    The load sequence  at  the  driver  level  is  however,
                    totally  different.   If there are no network links up,
                    the open is refused with 'link down'.  If  the  circuit
                    cannot be built on any of the available links, the open
                    is refused with  the  first  device  specific  or  last
                    non-device  specific, error message.  If the circuit is
                    built successfully then the open is successful and  the
                    6  char node number to load is written, followed by the
                    load data.

                    There is a range of values that can be returned on  the
                    circuit from the destination load device, these are.

                    the error code for a preceding write.

                    LRFIN, an error or a response has  been  timed  out  (5
                    secs) or been received.

          3.4 Implementation


               This section describes the implementation  strategy  of  the
               interface between the network and Unix.

               3.4.1 User level


                    When Unix comes up, it comes up  in  single-user  mode.
                    The  user  at the system console decides when multiuser
                    is to be initiated and types  in  a  control  D.   When
                    multiuser  comes  up,  the process init opens /etc/ttys
                    and forks an instance of getty for each  enabled  entry
                    in that file (they correspond to "/dev/ttyX" files).

                    To  invoke  the  network  interface,   "cat   svnnn   >
                    /dev/wd:nnn", is executed where svnnn is the node nnn's
                    load  image.   Three  situations  are  handled  on  the
                    completion  of the output file open.  Firstly, the node
                    is  executing  it's  bootstrap  and  requires  downline
                    loading.   Secondly,  the  node  is  dead and cannot be
                    loaded and thirdly the node  is  up  and  communicating
                    with the host.  In both the second and third cases, the
                    open is  returned  unsuccessful.   In  the  first  case
                    however,  the  input  file  is  opened  and  written to
                    /dev/wd':nnn' until EOF.

                    Incoming connections from network ttys,  will  cause  a
                    previous  open  of  a  /dev/ttyX file, to be completed.
                    The instantiation of init will then call getty with the
                    appropriate  character from the /etc/ttys entry.  Getty
                    will use the character to determine  the  login  string
                    format  it will receive.  In particular, a modification
                    to getty is necessary to  change  the  TYMNET  supplied
                    login  message  into  the  appropriate  Unix  character
                    sequence, before login is invoked.   The  DRV11  driver
                    will  greatly  facilitate  this by propagating only the
                    username and the password.
