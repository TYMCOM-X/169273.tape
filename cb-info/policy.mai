     SUBJECT:      PROMOTION OF P. A. JELINSKI




     I am pleased to announce the promotion of Peter A. Jelinski to 
     the position of Director Business Management-Manufacturing and 
     Engineering Systems of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
     International (MDISI).  Peter will remain in The Hague and report 
     to me.

     He will have business management responsibility for international 
     sales of ISG manufacturing and engineering systems products.  
     Peter is well qualified for this position having had sales and 
     management experience in Europe since September 1982 when he 
     joined the Nordic office in Stockholm and then assumed 
     responsibility of General Manager for the Nordic operations in 
     February 1983.  In January 1984, he was promoted to European 
     Manager of CAD/CAM and moved to The Hague.

     Peter first joined MDC in July 1972 as a scientific programmer in 
     Huntington Beach.  He then joined Control Data Corporation in 
     January 1977 in Minneapolis where he was a unit manager for 
     software field support and later was promoted to senior 
     consultant for CDC computer systems marketing.  He rejoined 
     McAuto in June 1982 in St. Louis and moved to Stockholm in 
     September 1982.

     Born in London, Peter is an American citizen and attended schools 
     in Montreal and California.  He received a B.A. in mathematics 
     from California State University, Fullerton in 1971.  In 1972 he 
     was graduated with an M.S. in mathematics from the University of 
     London.

     Peter and his wife, Kerstin, are the parents of two children:  
     Rebecca, 2, and Christopher, who is 3 months old.  Peter attended 
     the ISG Marketing Achievement Club in 1984 in Jamaica.  He is a 
     member of the American Management Association.

     We are looking forward to receiving the benefits of Peter's 
     business management, insight and knowledge of planning and 
     contributing to the sales of ISG`s manufacturing, architectural, 
     engineering and construction products on an expanding scale 
     internationally in the near future.  Your cooperation with him in 
     achieving our greater goals will be greatly appreciated.
