                         USE OF THIS MANUAL.                         ___________________


     This manual has been produced to  describe  the  commands  as  of
     Version  10  of RUNOFF.  As well as the standard RUNOFF commands,
     there are some which have been implemented only on the University
     of Queensland system.  These commands have been indicated in this
     manual by enclosing them in square brackets;  "[" , "]" .   Users
     of other Digital installations are warned that these features are
     probably not available, and that use of them will cause errors to
     occur.

                             INTRODUCTION                             ____________



RUNOFF is a PDP-10 program to facilitate the preparation of  typed  or
printed   manuscripts,   such  as  memoranda,  program  documentation,
manuals, and so on.  Despite  its  simplicity  of  use  it  has  quite
powerful features which make it invaluable in the production of theses
and research papers.


The user enters his document, interspersed with RUNOFF commands,  into
the system using the Editor program, and once this has been done, uses
RUNOFF to produce his output document  formatted  as  specified.   The
principal benefit of such a system is that files prepared for use with
it may be edited and corrected easily.   Small  or  large  amounts  of
material  may  be added or deleted, and unchanged material need not be
retyped.  After a set of changes,  the  program  may  be  executed  to
produce   a   new   copy   that   is  properly  paged  and  formatted.
Documentation can be easily updated  as  necessary  without  requiring
extensive retyping.


There are many optional features which  can  be  produced  by  RUNOFF.
These  include  page  titling  and subtitling, automatic paragraphing,
ragged right hand of text, automatic chapter  titling  and  numbering,
semi-automatic  index production, adding appendices, table production,
variable output, and various other options affecting the format.


RUNOFF may also be used to prepare Program Logic Manuals from  program
source  code, allowing full up to date documentation to be produced in
a well formatted and presentable form.


It is assumed that the user of RUNOFF is familiar with  the  technique
of  logging  in  to  the  system  and creating files using the Editor.
Users unfamiliar with  either  of  these  are  referred  to  Technical
Manuals  Nos.   2  "Using the U.Q.  PDP-10 System" and 6 "Edit- A Line
Editor for the PDP-10" respectively.

This manual discusses the  instructions  for  Version  10  of  RUNOFF.
Chapter  2  is  intended  to  be  an  introduction to the basic RUNOFF
commands;  these will be sufficient in the majority of cases.  Chapter
3  discusses  advanced  features  which  will be found helpful in more
specialised applications.  Chapter 4 details  features  which  may  be
found useful in other varied applications.



1.1  Files on the PDP-10.     ____________________

All information on the PDP-10 system is stored as logical units called
files.   A  file  is a collection of characters (i.e.  it may be text,
numeric data, or a mixture of both) and each file belonging to a  user
has a unique name.  This allows each file to be referenced by name.  A
file which is used as input to a program is called an  input  file  or
source  file, and a file which is produced as output from a program is
called an output file.  A file may be entered into the  system  either
by terminal or on punched cards.


RUNOFF requires a source file as input,  and  from  this  source  file
produces an output file.  The source file is the text of your document
plus formatting and other instructions to RUNOFF.  RUNOFF  instruction
lines  are  interspersed  with  the  lines  of text in the appropriate
places throughout the file.  The output file so produced is the output
document  formatted  as  requested.   This  can either be printed on a
terminal or line-printer, or stored on disk for  later  printing.   If
the  output  is  directed  to  disk  this allows for the production of
multiple copies by use of  the  /COPIES:n  switch  when  the  file  is
printed.   (See  Tech.   Man.  2 for more information).  Output can be
printed on special stationery, including 2-part and 4-part paper.



1.2  Creating Documents.     ___________________

The text for the document may be entered freely leaving at  least  one
space  between  words.  All material in the source file is taken to be
source text except those lines beginning with a period  ".".   A  line
beginning  with  a  period  is  assumed  to be a command to RUNOFF.  A
command line must have a period in column 1, with the command starting
in  column  2.   The  commands  provide the formatting information and
control various optional modes of operation.


Usually the text is filled and justified as it is processed.  That is,
the  program  FILLS  a  line by adding succesive words from the source
text until one or more words  would  cause  the  right  margin  to  be
exceeded.   The  line  is  then  JUSTIFIED by making the word spacings
larger until the last word in the line exactly meets the right margin.
This  means that the text may be typed on the terminal in lines of any
length since RUNOFF handles the aligning of text and treats the end of
a  line as a word separator.  Should the user wish to reproduce source


                                 1-2
MNT-14 INTRODUCTION       ____________


text exactly this can be done by disabling filling and justification.


The text is usually entered in upper and lower case exactly as  it  is
to  appear  in  the  output.   Special  provision  is  made  for those
terminals which do not have upper and  lower  case  facilities  (Sect.
4.3.1).   However there are certain special characters which cannot be
used in the text in general, since they have special  effects  on  the
output produced.  If these are to appear in the text as such they must
be "quoted".  This is done by preceding the character by an underscore
character.   For  example if the text is to be "Tape drive #3" it must
be entered as "Tape drive _#3".


The special characters and the effects they have are listed below:

     1.  Underscore           _         takes next character as text

     2.  Up-arrow             ^         upper case next character

     3.  Back-slash           \         lower case next character

     4.  Number sign          #         non-expandable space

     5.  Ampersand            &         underline next character

     6.  Less-than            <         capitalise the next word

     7.  Greater-than         >         index the following word

     8.  Exclamation mark     !         end footnote or begin comment



Since all commands start with a period in column 1,  if  a  period  is
desired  as the first character of a line of text it must be quoted by
preceding it with an underscore character.  The number sign  character
can be used to signal to RUNOFF that a sequence of spaces (represented
by a string of #'s) should not be expanded  when  the  line  is  being
justified.   The other special characters are discussed in more detail
in chapters 3 and 4.


If you desire to underline a text string you can do this by  "locking"
underlining on before you enter the text string, and "unlocking" it at
the end of the text string.  Underlining is turned on by  an  up-arrow
ampersand  "^&"  combination  and  turned off by a backslash ampersand
"\&" combination.  To underline the string ABCDE you enter ^&ABCDE\&.

                              CHAPITRE 2

                           GENERAL COMMANDS                           ________________



As previously discussed a RUNOFF command is signified by a  period  in
column  1.   Commands  may  be  abbreviated  according to the standard
abbreviations listed in  this  manual.   Long  commands  may  also  be
abbreviated  by typing only enough letters to make the command unique.
Typing 6 letters should ensure  this,  however  you  should  not  make
extensive use of your own abbreviations, since they are not guaranteed
to remain unique with future versions of RUNOFF.


Some commands require arguments of one or more decimal numbers.  Other
commands  require  text arguments.  In both cases you type the command
followed by the argument(s).


RUNOFF allows you to type more than one  command  on  a  single  line.
Multiple  commands  may  be  separated  by  a  period,  a  space, or a
semicolon.  However if commands are separated by a space or  semicolon
then  each  command  must still be preceded by a period.  If the first
command has a comment or takes text as its argument,  you  cannot  use
the  period  as  a  separator.   Should  you  desire  to type multiple
commands and comments on  the  same  line,  a  semicolon  is  used  to
indicate  the end of comment.  Comments in a line of multiple commands
must be preceded by an exclamation mark.  Comments can be included  in
the  source  file  on  separate  lines by preceding the comment with a
period-semicolon combination ".;".  All comments that you  include  in
your  source  file  will be ignored by RUNOFF;  this allows you to add
explanatory notes to your input which will help others who may use the
file.

         For example,
 
                 .TAB STOPS 10,20,30!For 3 column table;.SKIP 2
                 .;This is a comment


In commands which take text strings as  their  argument,  the  period,
semicolon,  and  exclamation mark characters are considered as part of
the text.  You can only terminate these commands by typing a  carriage
return.   There  are  some  RUNOFF  commands  which  require  the text


                                 2-1
                                               MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS                                                      ________________


argument to be on the line  following  the  command.   However  it  is
possible  to  type  both  command and text on the one line if they are
separated by a semicolon.

         For example,
 
                 .CENTRE
                 Text
 
         produces the same results as
 
                 .CENTRE;Text


There are some commands which cannot have another command on the  same
line.    These  commands  are  .TITLE,  .SUBTITLE,  and  .INDEX.   All
characters after these commands are taken as part of the  argument  to
the command.

         For example,
 
                 .INDEX Files;.TITLE Creating Documents
 
         causes "Files;.title creating documents" to be placed
         in the index.


Following are a  collection  of  simple  RUNOFF  commands  with  their
allowable abbreviations.



2.1  TEXT FORMATTING.     ________________

2.1.1  Filling and Justifying.       _______________________

Usually in RUNOFF text is input from the source file until one or more
words  would exceed the right margin.  Then the space between words is
increased until the last word exactly reaches the right margin.   This
effect  is  created by means of the .FILL and .JUSTIFY commands.  Text
may be output in the same format as  it  is  entered  by  use  of  the
.NOFILL   command.    The   .FILL   command   automatically  turns  on
justification  and  the  .NOFILL  command  automatically   turns   off
justification.   A  BREAK  is  said  to occur when the current line is
output exactly as it is - i.e.  the carriage return is taken as a line
terminator  rather  than just a word separator.  A break occurs in the
last line of a paragraph, such as this line.









                                 2-2
MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS       ________________


(a)  .FILL , .F     __________

     Causes a break and specifies  that  subsequent  output  lines  be
     filled.   Sets the justification mode to be that specified by the
     last appearance of .JUSTIFY or .NOJUSTIFY.  (.FILL is the initial
     setting).


(b)  .NO FILL , .NF     ______________

     Causes a break and prevents filling of subsequent  output  lines.
     Also turns off justification.


                                   NOTE

    (i)    The NOFILL-NOJUSTIFY mode need be used only where there
         are  several  lines  of material to be copied exactly.  A
         single line example will not require using these commands
         if  there  are  breaks  before and after the line.  (c.f.
         .LITERAL - Sect 3.1.4)

    (ii)   Normally .FILL  and  .NOFILL  are  used  to  turn  both
         filling  and  justification  on  and  off.  It is usually
         desirable to do both.  However, a  subsequent  appearance
         of  a  justification  command  will  override  the  .FILL
         command.

    (iii)  Because of the action of .FILL, a single occurrence  of
         .NOJUSTIFY  will  cause  the  remainder of the file to be
         unjustified, with filling  as  specified.   In  order  to
         justify  but  not  fill  (not  recommended),  a  .JUSTIFY
         command must follow every .NOFILL command.

    (iv)   If text is filled but not justified this gives a ragged
         right,  but  text  is  not  reproduced  exactly  as it is
         entered (because filling treats a carriage  return  as  a
         line separator).  If text is justified but not filled two
         situations can arise.  When the current  line  is  longer
         than the page width an error (CAN'T JUSTIFY LINE) occurs,
         and when the current line is shorter than the page  width
         the spacing between words can be very large.




(c)  .JUSTIFY , .J     _____________

     Causes a break and sets subsequent output lines to  be  justified
     (initial  setting).   That  is,  word  spacings are increased and
     adjusted until the last word  in  the  line  ends  at  the  right
     margin.




                                 2-3

(d)  .NO JUSTIFY , .NJ     _________________

     Causes a break and prevents justification  of  subsequent  output
     lines.


The following is an example of the same text output in  two  different
formatshe  first section is with filling turned on and the second
is with filling turned off.  Remember that the changing  of  the  fill
mode automatically changes the justify mode.


     A .FILL command is  used  to  give  a  straight  right  hand
     margin,  whereas a .NOFILL command gives a ragged right hand
     margin.


     A .FILL command is used to give a straight right hand
     margin, whereas a .NOFILL command gives a ragged 
     right hand margin.



2.1.2  Spacing Commands.       _________________

With RUNOFF the spacing between lines can be set to  different  values
just  as with a typewriter, the only difference being that with RUNOFF
the spacing range is  from  1  to  5  rather  than  the  usual  values
available  on  a  typewriter.   The initial value of the spacing is 1.
The line spacing value is specified by LS in this manual.


(a)  .SKIP n , .S n     ______________

     Causes a break after which n*LS lines are  left  blank.   If  the
     skip would leave room for less than two printed lines on the page
     [i.e.  if there are less than (n+2)*LS lines left], the output is
     advanced  to the top of the next page.  If n is negative the skip
     is to n*LS lines above the bottom of the page.  If  this  is  not
     possible the skip is to this position on the following page.


(b)  .BLANK n , .B n     _______________

     Exactly like .SKIP, except that n (rather than  n*LS)  lines  are
     specified.   .BLANK is used where space is to be left independent
     of the line spacing;  .SKIP is used where  the  space  should  be
     relative  to  the  size  of line space.  Those interested in more
     control over where the blank lines are to appear should  see  the
     .TEST  PAGE (Sect 3.2.1) and .FIGURE (Sect 3.2.1) commands.  If n
     is negative for this command the effect is similar to that of the
     .SKIP  command except that the value of n is absolute rather than
     a multiple of the current line spacing.

MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS       ________________


(c)  .INDENT n , .I n     ________________

     Causes a break and sets the next line to begin n  spaces  to  the
     right  of  the  left  margin.  The n may be negative to cause the
     line to begin to the left of the left margin (useful for numbered
     paragraphs).  However n can not specify a position to the left of
     0.


The following is an example of the spacing commands.  The text  before
and after processing by RUNOFF is shown below.


         Before processing:


.left margin 5.right margin 65
.indent 5
These examples show the effects of the .SKIP, .BLANK, and .INDENT
commands
.spacing 2
.skip 2
A .SKIP command leaves n*LS lines blank.
.spacing 1
.left margin 0.right margin 70
.fill
The .BLANK command  is used to leave  a number of lines blank
regardless of the current line spacing setting. You should consult 
the .FIGURE command in section 3.2.1 if you desire more control over 
where the blank lines are to be left.
.nofill
.left margin 5.right margin 65
.spacing 2
.blank 2
A .BLANK command leaves n lines blank.
.indent -5
.spacing 1
.fill
Indentation can be set to negative as well as positive values. If 
this is done the next line is started to the left of the current
left margin.

         After processing:


          These examples show the effects of the .SKIP, .BLANK,
     and .INDENT commands.




     A .SKIP command leaves n*LS lines blank.

The .BLANK command is used to leave a number of lines blank regardless
of  the  current line spacing setting.  You should consult the .FIGURE
command in section 3.2.1 if you desire more  control  over  where  the
blank lines are to be left.


     A .BLANK command leaves n lines blank.

Indentation can be set to negative as well  as  positive  values.
     If  this is done the next line is started to the left of the
     current left margin.



2.2  PAGE FORMATTING.     ________________

2.2.1  Page Setout.       ____________

For purposes of reference, many documents carry an identification code
and  date.   The  code and date are printed at the top of each page of
the document.


Normally, the identification appears at the top right-hand corner of a
page.  However, for manuals and documents printed on both sides of the
paper, it is usual for the identification to 'swing' from side to side
so  that  it  appears  on the outermost edge of the book.  That is, on
'front' pages or odd-numbered pages,  it  appears  at  the  right-hand
corner;   on  'reverse'  or  even-numbered  pages,  it  appears on the
left-hand corner.  The  identification  is  thus  based  on  the  page
numbering  if  it is to be 'swung' from side to side.  In this case it
appears in the right-hand corner for odd-numbered  pages  1,  3,  etc;
1-1, 1-3, etc;  or 1a, 1c, 2a, 2c, etc.


Document  identification  and  date  are  not  supplied  if  the  page
numbering  mode  is  set  for  the  top of page, since the actual page
number appears in the position used by  the  document  identification.
However,  it  is  possible  to  use both title and subtitle as well as
document identification and date,  provided  the  title  and  subtitle
lines  finish  before  the starting position of the identification and
date.  



                                 2-6
MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS       ________________


If the option is to swing the identification and date from  the  right
to  left pages, users should be warned that a left-hand identification
and date will displace the title and subtitle lines to the right.


Documentation identification can be switched off by specifying a  null
identification,  and can be cleared by specifying a space.  If no date
is specified, the current date from the monitor will be used.


(a)  .PAGE , .PG     ___________

     Causes a break and an advance to a new page.  If the current page
     is  empty, this does not advance the page.  Titling and numbering
     are as for automatic page advance.


(b)  .CHAPTER text , .CH text     ________________________

     .CHAPTER is used  to  indicate  a  new  chapter.   Initially  the
     chapter  setting  is  zero  to  indicate  that  chapters  are not
     required.  In this case neither  the  zero  nor  the  intervening
     hyphen are printed along with the page number.


     The effect of the .CHAPTER command is to finish the current  page
     and advance to a new page.  The text given is used as the chapter
     title.  12 blank lines are left at the top of the page,  followed
     by  the  chapter  number  and title separated by a blank line.  2
     blank lines are left before  the  commencement  of  printing  the
     actual chapter text.  The chapter number and title are centred on
     the page and the chapter title is printed on the top of each page
     of  the  chapter.   This  command resets the margin, spacing, and
     justify/fill mode.  The chapter number is set to be  one  greater
     than  that  of  the  last  chapter unless a .NUMBER CHAPTER (Sect
     2.2.2) command is used.  The maximum number of  chapters  is  64,
     and pages per chapter is 99.


(c)  .TITLE text , .T text     _____________________

     This command takes the remaining text on the line as  the  title.
     This  text  will appear on the first line after the top margin on
     all subsequent pages, beginning at the left margin unless leading
     blanks are used for indenting.  The title is initially blank.


[ (d)  .DOCUMENT ID text , .DI text ]       ____________________________

     In effect, this command takes the place of  the  .TITLE  command.
     The  identification is placed at the top of each page, and unless
     otherwise specified, it will appear  in  the  right-hand  corner,
     indented   10   positions   from   the  specified  right  margin.
     (Specified in the .PAGE SIZE command).   The  text  should  be  a


                                 2-7
                                               MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS                                                      ________________


     maximum of 20 characters in length.


[ (e)  .DOCUMENT DATE text , .DD text ]       ______________________________

     This command stores the text as part of the subtitle line.  If no
     .DOCUMENT  DATE  command  is  given after a .DOCUMENT ID command,
     RUNOFF uses as default the current date, and  prints  it  in  the
     form  ddMmmyy (e.g.  24Aug78).  The .DOCUMENT DATE command allows
     alteration of pages of a document which has already been produced
     on a specific day.


[ (f)  .ONE SIDE m , .OS m ]       ___________________

     This command counteracts any previous .BOTH  SIDES  commands  and
     reverts the identification positioning to one side only.  (Normal
     or default setting).   The  argument  m  specifies  the  starting
     position   for   the  identification.   If  it  is  omitted,  the
     identification is assumed to start at 10 positions less than  the
     right-hand margin.


[ (g)  .BOTH SIDES n,m , .BS n,m ]       _________________________

     This command specifies the identification to be swung  from  side
     to  side  on  pages,  according  to the page number (i.e.  odd or
     even).   Odd-numbered  pages  have  the  identification  on   the
     right-hand side, and even-numbered pages on the left-hand side as
     in this manual.

     The arguments n and m specify the left and  right  hand  starting
     positions  of  the  identification.   If they are omitted, RUNOFF
     assumes the left margin and 10  positions  less  than  the  right
     margin.


(h)  .TAB STOPS n,...,k , .TS n,...,k     ________________________________

     Clears all previous tab-stops and sets new tab-stops as specified
     by the numbers n,...,k.  The several numbers (maximum 32) must be
     greater than 0 and in increasing order.  They are  the  positions
     of  tab-stops  independent  of  the  setting  of the left margin,
     although any which are less than the left margin will be ignored.
     There are no tab-stops initially.

     Tabs should be used only in lines which will be  unjustified  and
     unfilled,  i.e.  where filling is disabled or a break immediately
     follows.  Clearly, the spaces specified by a tab character should
     not be expanded by RUNOFF to justify the line;  this would defeat
     the purpose of tab formatting.  The presence  of  a  tab  in  the
     source  text  will be translated to one or more spaces, i.e.  the
     amount necessary to advance to  the  next  tab-stop.   If  a  tab
     appears  at a point where no further tab-stops have been set on a


                                 2-8
MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS       ________________


     line, the tab will be treated as though it had been a space.


The .DOCUMENT  ID  and  .DOCUMENT  DATE  commands  were  used  in  the
production  of  this  manual.  Here the document id is MNT-!4  and the
document date is 1Oct78.  A .BOTH SIDES 5,60 command was used to swing
the  manual identification from side to side.  All chapter titles were
obtained by using .CHAPTER commands.  Any chapter heading such as that
on page 2-1 shows the format produced by the .CHAPTER command


The .TAB STOPS command is useful in  the  production  of  tables.   An
example of the use of this command is given below.


         Before processing by RUNOFF:

.tab stops 10,20,30
  <tab>  ONE  <tab>  TWO  <tab>  THREE
.skip 2
  <tab>  1    <tab>  2    <tab>  3   


         After processing by RUNOFF:

          ONE       TWO       THREE


          1         2         3



2.2.2  Numbering.       __________

In memoranda and simple documents, a numbering system of 1, 2, 3, etc.
is  quite  adequate.  However, for the production of manuals and other
chapter orientated documents it is possible to have a page  number  of
the form 1-3, where 1 is the chapter number and 3 is the number of the
page within that chapter.  In addition, the pages at the  front  of  a
manual  comprising  the  foreword,  chapter  contents  and  so on, are
usually numbered in small roman numerals.  This case  is  allowed  for
also with roman numerals up to 20 (xx) being possible.


(a)  .NUMBER n , .NM n     _________________

     Turns on page numbering (initial setting) and, if n is  supplied,
     sets  the  current  page number to n.  If n is not given the page
     number defaults to the current value of the page couner.  This is
     initially 1.  If n is relative (i.e.  +n or -n) hen this value is
     either added to or subtracted from the current page counter.





                                 2-9
                                               MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS                                                      ________________


(b)  .NO NUMBER , .NNM     _________________

     Turns off page numbering.  Pages will continue to be counted,  so
     the normal page number will appear if numbering is re-enabled.


(c)  .NUMBER PAGE n  (No abbr.)     __________________________

     Sets the current page nuber to n.  If n is  omitted  the  current
     value  of the page countder is assumed.  This command can be used
     with chapter numbered documents to set the page number within the
     chapter  to n.  Relative values can also be used.  Normal chapter
     numbering continues from the new value.


(d)  .NUMBER CHAPTER n  (No abbr.)     _____________________________

     Sets the chapter number to n.  If n is omitted the current chaper
     number  is  assumed.   If  this  command is used in page numbered
     documents there is no effect on the output.


[ (e)  .TOP NUMBER , .TN ]       _________________

     Causes pages to be numbered at the top.  (This is the default  or
     initial  setting).   No  chapter  numbering or roman numbering is
     possible when page numbers appear at the top of  pages,  although
     subnumbering is available.


[ (f)  .BOTTOM NUMBER . .BN ]       ____________________

     Causes page numbers to be placed at the bottom  of  pages  rather
     than at the top.  Bottom numbering is used in this manual.


[ (g)  .ARABIC NUMERALS , .AN ]       ______________________

     This command  changes  numbers  from  roman  numerals  to  arabic
     numerals, and is the default setting.


[ (h)  .ROMAN NUMERALS , .RN ]       _____________________

     This command will ensure that normal page numbers are produced in
     roman  numerals.   The maximum number allowable in roman numerals
     is 20.  The contents pages of this  manual  were  numbered  using
     this command.








                                 2-10
MNT-14 GENERAL COMMANDS       ________________


2.3  PARAMETER SETTINGS.     ___________________

(a)  .SPACING n , .SP n     __________________

     Causes a break after which the line spacing is set to n.   The  n
     must  be  within  the  range 1 to 5.  Single spacing is 1, double
     spacing is 2, etc.  The default spacing is  1.   If  any  current
     paragraph  indentation  is  set to the left of n, the indentation
     value is reset to n.


(b)  .LEFT MARGIN n , .LM n     ______________________

     Causes a break after which the left margin is set to  n.   The  n
     must  be  less  than  the right margin, but not less than 0.  The
     initial setting is 0.  The amount of any  indent  plus  the  left
     margin must not be less than 0.


(c)  .RIGHT MARGIN n , .RM n     _______________________

     Causes a break after which the right margin is set to n.   The  n
     must be greater than the left margin.  The initial setting is 60,
     unless otherwise specified using a .PAGE SIZE command.


     The number of characters on a line will be equal to or less  than
     the  right margin minus the left margin minus any indenting which
     may be specified.  Even if filling has been disabled, lines  will
     not be extended past the right margin.


     When the right margin is reset by RUNOFF it is reset to the value
     given  by  the  last .PAGE SIZE command, otherwise to the default
     setting.


(d)  .PAGE SIZE n,m , .PS n,m     ________________________

     Sets the number of lines per page to n (initially  58)  and  sets
     the  paper  width  in  columns  to  m (initially 60).  The second
     argument m, is optional.  The number n must be greater  than  10,
     and  the  number  m  must  be  greater than the left margin.  The
     number m is set into the right margin as if  a  .RIGHT  MARGIN  m
     command  had  been given.  The .PAGE SIZE command is usually used
     only at  the  beginning  of  a  source  file,  but  may  be  used
     throughout if required.

     The n lines per page are allocated as follows;

     (I)  If page numbering is at top of page;

          (i)   top margin (initially 1 line)
          (ii)  title, page number (both on same line)


                                 2-11

          (iii) subtitle 
          (iv)  two blank lines before the start of text
          (v)   text (continues to the last line of page).

     (II)  If page numbering is at bottom of page;

          (i)   top margin (initially 1 line)
          (ii)  title, document identification (both on same
                line)
          (iii) subtitle, document date (both on same line)
          (iv)  two blank lines before the start of text
          (v)   text (continues to fourth last line of page)
          (vi)  two blank lines before the page number line
          (vii) page number (1 line).


(e)  .PAPER SIZE n,m , .PS n,m     _________________________

     This command is exactly the same as the .PAGE  SIZE  command.   A
     .PAPER  SIZE  60,70  command  was  used in the production of this
     manual.


(f)  .STANDARD n , .SD n     ___________________

     Returns all settings to the standard defaults,  however  it  does
     not alter tabs or paragraph numbering (Sect.  3.2).  The argument
     n refers to the page width.  A command .SD 60 will set  the  left
     margin  to  0, the right margin to 60, and allow for 58 lines per
     page.  The value of n, if  given,  overides  any  previous  right
     margin setting.


Now that you have learnt and hopefully  understood  the  basic  RUNOFF
commands  you are ready to run RUNOFF.  A discussion of how to do this
is given in section 5.1 .  Some switches which you may find useful  in
your application are discussed in Sect.  5.2

                              CHAPITRE 3

                          ADVANCED COMMANDS                          _________________



This chapter  discusses  those  commands  in  RUNOFF  which  are  more
powerful,  but  which  require  some  extra  knowledge  to use.  It is
assumed that the reader of this chapter has read  and  understood  the
basics covered in chapter 2 of this manual.



3.1  TEXT FORMATTING.     ________________

3.1.1  paragraph handling.       ___________________

(a)  .PARAGRAPH n,v,t , .P n,v,t     ___________________________

     Causes a break and formats the output paragraphs.  The value of n
     specifies the indentation of the first line of the paragraph.  It
     is optional and if omitted the value 5 is  assumed.   The  second
     argument  v specifies the vertical spacing between paragraphs and
     can have values from 1  to  5.   The  third  argument  t  is  the
     argument of an automatic .TEST PAGE instruction (Sect.  3.2.1).


(b)  .AUTOPARAGRAPH , .AP     ____________________

     This command causes any blank line or any line  starting  with  a
     space  to  be  considered  as  the  start of a new paragraph.  It
     allows for normally typed text to be  formatted  without  special
     commands.   It  does  not  cause  a  paragraph if blank lines are
     followed by a command.


(c)  .NO AUTOPARAGRAPH , .NAP     ________________________

     Disengages the .AUTOPARAGRAPH mode.

(d)  .AUTOTABLE , . .AT     __________________

     This command causes any  line  without  a  leading  space  to  be
     treated as the beginning of a new paragraph.


(e)  .NO AUTOTABLE , .NAT     ____________________

     Turns off the .AUTOTABLE mode.


Each paragraph in this manual which discusses  a  RUNOFF  command  was
formatted  using  the  .PARAGRAPH  command.   An example of the use of
.AUTOPARAGRAPH is given in Appendix B, the  "Simple  RUNOFF  Commands"
document.



3.1.2  Notes and Footnotes.       ____________________

(a)  .NOTE text , .NT text     _____________________

     Starts an indented note.  First 2 blank lines are left  and  both
     margins are reduced by 5.  The given text is centred, or the word
     "NOTE" is centred if no text is given.  This  is  followed  by  1
     blank  line.   The main text of the note must be terminated by an
     .END NOTE command.


(b)  .END NOTE , .EN     _______________

     This terminates the .NOTE  command,  leaves  2  blank  lines  and
     returns both margins to their former values.


(c)  .FOOTNOTE n , .FN n     ___________________

     Allocates n*LS lines at the bottom of  the  current  page  for  a
     footnote[1].   If  insufficient room remains on the current page,
     space will be allocated at the bottom of the following page.  The
     text  for  the footnote begins on the line following the command,
     and it may  contain  any  appropriate  commands  (e.g.   .CENTRE,
     .SKIP)  necessary  to  format  the  footnote.   The  footnote  is
     terminated by the .END FOOTNOTE  command  or  by  an  exclamation
     mark.  The lines delimited by this line and the .FOOTNOTE command
     are put into a buffer to be processed when the  output  moves  to
     within the stated distance of the bottom of the page.  


     If a page has multiple footnotes, the allocated space is the  sum
                        - - - - - - - - - - -
[1]  This is a footnote.  This text and the dividing line  above  were
     specified by text and commands following a .FOOTNOTE 4 command.



                                 3-2
MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


     of the allocations for all footnotes assigned to the  page.   The
     user  must  include  his  choice  of footnote-designating symbols
     within the text.


     The current values of left and right margin and line spacing  are
     saved  and  restored after processing of footnotes.  Therefore, a
     footnote may contain commands which change these parameters,  and
     the effect will be limited to the footnote text.


     The actual space taken by the footnote may be more or  less  than
     that  specified by n.  The n merely allocates space and should be
     the user's best estimate.  If it is an inaccurate  estimate,  the
     footnote  text  may overflow the page, or extra space may be left
     unnecessarily at the bottom of the page.  The user  may  have  to
     adjust n after examining a first draft print-out of the file.


(d)  .END FOOTNOTE  (No abbr.)     _________________________

     Terminates the  footnote  and  signals  the  return  to  previous
     formatting  instructions.  An exclamation mark in column 1 can be
     used to signal end of footnote also.



3.1.3  List Production.       ________________

(a)  .LIST n , .LS n     _______________

     This command starts an indented list with spacing  n.   The  left
     margin is moved 9 spaces to the right for the first .LIST command
     and 4 more spaces to the right for each subsequent nested  .LIST.
     The  normal  fill  and justify modes remain in effect;  therefore
     you must disengage them just before the .LIST command if you want
     a ragged right.


(b)  .LIST ELEMENT , .LE     ___________________

     Specifies an element of  the  current  list.   The  elements  are
     numbered  sequentially  and the number is given a negative indent
     so that the list lines up.  The number is followed  by  a  period
     and  2  spaces.  The list elements are separarted by the standard
     paragraph spacing.  Should you wish to type the text on the  same
     line as the command you must separate them by a semicolon.









                                 3-3

(c)  .END LIST , .ELS     ________________

     Terminates the .LIST command  and  returns  parameters  to  their
     former settings.


(d)  .NUMBER LIST d,c  (No abbr.)     ____________________________

     Since nested lists are possible, when you desire to  set  a  list
     element  number to a specified value you not only have to specify
     the value, but also the list to which  you  wish  the  change  to
     apply.   The  first  argument d specifies the list level, and the
     second argument c specifies the value  you  want  the  next  list
     element at this level to have.


An example of list production is given below:

         Before processing

.list
.le;First item of list 1
.le;Second item of list 1
.list
.le;First item of list 2
.le;Second item of list 2
.le;Third element of list 2
.els
.le;Third item of list 1
.els

         After processing

     1.  First element of list 1

     2.  Second item of list 1

         1.  First item of list 2

         2.  Second item of list 2

         3.  Third item of list 2


     3.  Third item of list 1

MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


3.1.4  literals.       _________

(a)  .LITERAL n , .LT n     __________________

     This command specifies that the following n lines of text are  to
     be output exactly and not interpreted by RUNOFF.  This allows for
     the inclusion of RUNOFF commands in text  as  well  as  a  ragged
     right  effect  as produced by the .NOFILL command.  Text enclosed
     in literals is not justified so care must be taken if you do  not
     wish to exceed the right hand margin.  A .LITERAL command must be
     terminated by an .END LITERAL command.


(b)  .END LITERAL , .EL     __________________

     Terminates the .LITERAL command.


The .LITERAL command is used as follows:

         The text

.literal
.left margin 50.right margin 55
.spacing 5.skip 15
.indent 5
This example shows that any RUNOFF commands enclosed in literals
have no effect on the output text.
.end literal


         is output as follows

.left margin 50.right margin 55
.spacing 5.skip 15
.indent 5
This example shows that any RUNOFF commands enclosed in literals
have no effect on the output text.

3.2  PAGE FORMATTING.     ________________

3.2.1  Page Setout.       ____________

(a)  .FIGURE n , .FG n     _________________

     Like .BLANK except that if  less  than  n  lines  remain  on  the
     current  page,  the page will be advanced, and n blank lines will
     be left at the top of the new page.  Principally used where it is
     desired to leave room for a figure to be drawn in manually.


(b)  .FIGURE DEFERRED n  (No abbr.)     ______________________________

     The .FIGURE DEFERRED command has the same effect as  the  .FIGURE
     command  except that if n lines do not remain on the page instead
     of leaving the remainder of the page blank and skipping to a  new
     page,  text  is  output on the current page and the space for the
     figure is deferred to the next page.


(c)  .TEST PAGE n , .TP n     ____________________

     Causes a break followed by a conditional page advance.  If  there
     are  n or more lines remaining on the current page, no advance is
     made and no lines are skipped.  Otherwise, the page  is  advanced
     as  for  .PAGE.   This  command should be used to ensure that the
     following n lines are all output on the same page.


(d)  .BREAK , .BR     ____________

     Causes a break, i.e.  the current line will  be  output  with  no
     justification,  and  the  next  word  of  the source text will be
     placed at the beginning of the next line.


(e)  .PAGING , .PA     _____________

     Commences breaking the output into pages.  This  is  the  default
     setting.


(f)  .NO PAGING , .NPA     _________________

     This command specifies that the output is not to be  broken  into
     pages.  It is reset by any command such as .STANDARD and .CHAPTER
     which reset all parameters.








                                 3-6
MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


(g)  .LEFT n , .L n     ______________

     Specifies that the next line is to be commenced n columns to  the
     right  of  the  left  margin.  This can be negative as long as it
     does not specify a position to the left of 0.


(h)  .RIGHT n , .R n     _______________

     Similar to the .LEFT command except here n specifies positions to
     the left of the right margin.


[ (i)  .TOP MARGIN , .TM ]       _________________

     This command allows the user to vary the  number  of  lines  that
     appear  at  the  top  of each page before the title and sub-title
     lines (See section 3.2.3 on titling).  The top margin is  set  by
     default  to 1 line and is included in the number of lines allowed
     per page.  This command is useful for positioning text on special
     stationery.



3.2.2  numbering.       __________

(a)  .HEADER LEVEL n text , .HL n text     _________________________________

     This command is used to start a numbered  section  at  the  level
     specified.   The  text is taken as the section header.  The value
     of n can be in the range of 1 to 5.  The sections are incremented
     by  1  automatically,  and the level number is output in the form
     i.j.k.l.m .  If the command  is  used  in  a  chapter  orientated
     document, i is the chapter number;  otherwise it is the number of
     the most recent occurence of a .HEADER LEVEL 1 command.  The text
     for  header  level  1  items is output in upper case, whereas the
     text for all  other  header  levels  is  output  with  the  first
     character  upper  case  and  the remaining in lower case.  Header
     levels 1 and 2 have the section text  to  which  they  correspond
     starting on a new line, but the other header levels (3 to 5) have
     the header title followed by a space dash space (#-#) combination
     and then the section text on the same line.


(b)  .NUMBER LEVEL a,b,c ...  (No abbr.)     ___________________________________

     This is used to set the next header level number to a.b.c ...









                                 3-7
                                              MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS                                                     _________________


(c)  .SUBPAGE , .SPG     _______________

     This command allows pages to be inserted into a document  without
     changing  the  document's overall paging structure.  This is done
     by  by-passing  page  number  incrementation  and  appending   an
     alphabetic (starting with 'a') to the present page number.


(d)  .END SUBPAGE , .ES     __________________

     This command is the same as the .PAGE command  and  may  be  used
     instead  of  the .PAGE command to terminate any subpaging that is
     in progress.  This command has been implemented for use in  those
     documents  where the .SUBPAGE command is to be edited out at some
     later date, with paging reverting to an automatic mode.


(e)  .NUMBER SUBPAGE ch  (No abbr.)     ______________________________

     Set the current subpage number to ch.  This is a character in the
     range of a-z.



3.2.3  Titling.       ________

(a)  .CENTRE n , .C n     ________________

     This command causes a break after which it centres the next  line
     following  in  the  source file.  The centring is over the column
     n/2, independent of the setting of the left  and  right  margins.
     To  centre  data  over  a page where the left margin is n and the
     right margin is m, the command is .CENTRE (n+m).  For example, to
     centre  over a page with a left margin of 5 and a right margin of
     70, use .CENTRE 75.  If n is not specified in the command, it  is
     assumed  to  be the last value specified.  It is initially set to
     centre over the initial paper size (i.e.  60 for  left  margin=0,
     right margin=60).  If you wish to type the command as well as the
     text to be centred on the same line they must be separated  by  a
     semicolon.


(b)  .CENTER n , .C n     ________________

     Equivalent to .CENTRE


(c)  .SUBTITLE text , .ST text     _________________________

     This command  takes  the  remaining  text  on  the  line  as  the
     subtitle.    This  text  will  appear  on  the  line  immediately
     following the title.   The  subtitle  is  initially  blank.   The
     subtitle  is  not  indented,  but  may  contain leading spaces to
     achieve the same effect, if desired.


                                 3-8
MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


(d)  .SUBTTL text , .ST text     _______________________

     Equivalent to .SUBTITLE


(e)  .NO SUBTITLE , .NST     ___________________

     Specifies that subtitles are to be suppressed.


(f)  .FIRST TITLE , .FT     __________________

     Specifies that the title is to be included on the first  page  of
     the document.


(g)  .NO HEADER , .NHD     _________________

     Specifies that page headings are to be suppressed.


(h)  .HEADER x , .HD x     _________________

     This command is used to specify the case type for  page  headers.
     The  argument  x must be one of UPPER, LOWER, or MIXED.  UPPER is
     the default setting.



3.3  INDICES AND APPENDICES.     _______________________

3.3.1  Index Commands.       _______________

It is very simple in RUNOFF to set  up  an  index  containing  various
words  throughout your source file.  By using the appropriate commands
the index is set up and printed where you  desire  in  your  document.
The  items  you index are placed in an "index buffer", from where they
are printed when you request it.  The index items are printed with the
first  character  of  the  first  word  in  upper  case, and all other
characters in lower case.


(a)  .INDEX text  (No abbr.)     _______________________

     This command takes the remaining text on the line as a  key  word
     or  words and adds it, along with the current page number, to the
     internal index buffer.  The command does not cause a  break,  and
     it  should  appear  on  either the the line preceding or the line
     following the line containing the item to be indexed.  A key word
     or words may be indexed more than once.






                                 3-9
                                              MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS                                                     _________________


(b)  .FLAG INDEX  (No abbr.)     _______________________

     Enables the > character to be used to place the word following it
     into  the  index  buffer.   Only  a  single word text item can be
     indexed in this way.  Should you desire to index items containing
     more than one word use the .INDEX command.


(c)  .DO INDEX text , .DX text     _________________________

     Forces a new page, and centres the text, if given.  Otherwise the
     word "INDEX" is centred.  A period terminates this command unless
     the period is quoted.  After  the  title  has  been  printed  the
     entire  contents  of  the index buffer is printed in alphabetical
     order.  Entries are set against the left margin and regular  line
     spacing is used between entries, except that a blank line is left
     between entries of different first letters.  The page number  for
     each  entry  is placed on the same line as the entry and multiple
     entries are separated by commas.  If chapter  numbering  is  used
     the  pages  of  the index are numbered Index-1, Index-2, etc.  If
     page  numbering  is  being  used  page  numbers  are  incremented
     normally.


(d)  .PRINT INDEX , .PX     __________________

     Similar to .DO INDEX except that there is no skip to a  new  page
     and  no  heading  is  output.  In chapter numbered documents this
     command uses the current  chapter  number  to  number  the  index
     pages.


(e)  .NUMBER INDEX (No abbr.)     ________________________

     Sets  the  current  chapter  number  to  "INDEX".   This  enables
     numbering pages which are to be additions to a document.


(f)  .SUBINDEX major >minor , .X major >minor     ________________________________________

     This command is used to create subheadings  in  the  index.   The
     major field refers to the major section heading within the index,
     and the minor item refers to a subheading which you wish to  have
     placed under the major heading .  The minor item must be preceded
     with the subindex flag character (different  to  the  index  flag
     character)  otherwise  the whole line is placed in the index just
     as if yoou had used an  .INDEX  command.   The  minor  items  are
     indented 2 spaces when they are printed in the index.

MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


3.3.2  Appendix Commands.       __________________

(a)  .APPENDIX text , .AX text     _________________________

     Similar to the .CHAPTER  command.   The  text  is  taken  as  the
     appendix    title,   if   given.    Appendix   numbering   starts
     automatically at A and proceeds  through  to  Z  for  consecutive
     appendices.   Page  numbering  is  also changed to conform to the
     appendix "number" rather than the chapter number.


(b)  .NUMBER APPENDIX ch  (No abbr.)     _______________________________

     Sets appendix number to ch (A-Z).



3.4  miscellaneous.     ______________

3.4.1  flag commands.       ______________

RUNOFF allows you to  set  various  flags  to  notify  it  of  various
different  situations.  You can set a flag to enable you to capitalize
certain words, or to index certain words, or to underline  characters,
and  various  other cases.  Each flag has associated with it a certain
flag character, and you must enable each flag that you  wish  to  use.
This  causes  RUNOFF  to take the appropriate action when it meets the
flag characters.  It is possible also to change the character which is
associated with each of the various flags.


(a)  .FLAGS ALL  (No abbr.)     ______________________

     This command enables all of the  possible  flags,  and  sets  the
     default characters (given in sect 1.2) to be associated with each
     flag.  The  flag  types  are  CAPITALIZE,  CONTROL,  ENDFOOTNOTE,
     INDEX,   LOWERCASE,   QUOTE,   SPACE,  SUBINDEX,  UNDERLINE,  and
     UPPERCASE.  Their associated flag characters are "<",  ".",  "!",
     ">",  "\",  "_",  "#",  ">",  "&",  "^"  .  Separate flags can be
     enabled by using a .FLAG flagtype command, where flagtype is  any
     one of the possible flags.


(b)  .NO FLAGS ALL  (No abbr.)     _________________________

     Turns off all flags,  except  CONTROL  and  ENDFOOTNOTE.   Single
     flags may be disenabled by using a .NO FLAG flagtype command.









                                 3-11
                                              MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS                                                     _________________


(c)  .FLAGS type ch , .FL type ch     ____________________________

     Changes the flag character for the flag of the specified type  to
     be ch, the given character.  This allows for the use of different
     characters than the default values mentioned above, which may  be
     necessary  in  some  documents  to  save  having  to  quote every
     occurence of a frequently used character.   If  no  character  is
     given the default flag character is enabled.


(d)  .NO FLAGS type , .NFL type     __________________________

     Cancels the use of a user specified character with the given flag
     type.  The flag character reverts to the default.



3.4.2  change bars.       ____________

RUNOFF allows users to add change bars  to  their  output  text.   The
default  change  bar character is "|", but can be changed by using the
/BAR:ch switch when running RUNOFF.  Change bars  are  setup  so  that
they  are  printed  to the left of all text.  To allow for this, every
line which is not  marked  with  a  change  bar  has  3  extra  spaces
preceding it.  This means that if you specify a left margin of 0, your
text will start in column 4.  You can arrange for the change  bars  to
align with your normal left margin (as is done here) if you so desire.


(a)  .ENABLE BAR , .EBB     __________________

     This command must be used to enable change bars  to  be  produced
     otherwise  the .BEGIN BAR command has no effect.  This is so that
     extensive editing is not necessary to  remove  change  bars  from
     your  document.  You should issue this command before the text of
     your input file.  This is so that  you  will  not  have  problems
     aligning  the  left margin of your output document.  This is done
     by preceding  every  .BEGIN  BAR  command  with  an  .ENABLE  BAR
     command,  and  following  every  .END  BAR  command  by a .BREAK,
     .DISABLE BAR combination.


(b)  .DISABLE BAR , .DBB     ___________________

     Disables the production of change bars.  If you do not want  your
     change  bars  to  appear  to  the  left of your left mArgin, this
     command should follow the .END BAR command.









                                 3-12
MNT-14 ADVANCED COMMANDS       _________________


(c)  .BEGIN BAR , .BB     ________________

     Starts adding a change bar to the left of your output  text.   An
     .END  BAR  command  must follow this to stop the change bar being
     output.


(d)  .END BAR , .EB     ______________

     Must follow a .BEGIN BAR command to turn off change bars.


|  This section of text is marked by a change bar.  This change  bar  was
|  obtained  by preceding this text by a .BEGIN BAR command and following
|  it with an .END BAR command.



3.4.3  other commands.       _______________

(a)  .COMMENT  (No abbr.)     ____________________

     The remainder of the line is taken to be a comment  by  the  user
     and  is  ignored  by  RUNOFF.   You can also use .;  to specify a
     comment line


(b)  .PERIOD , .PR     _____________

     This is the default setting.  It causes double spacing after  the
     characters ".", "!", "?", ":", and ";" .


(c)  .NO PERIOD , .NPR     _________________

     Stops double spacing after the above characters.


(d)  .NO SPACE , .NSP     ________________

     You can use this command if you have to split a word over a  line
     for  some  reason.  Normally RUNOFF treats a carriage return as a
     word separator.  However if you use the .NO  SPACE  command  this
     does  not  happen;   the  carriage  return  is ignored.  Use this

4.1  variables and conditionals.     ___________________________

RUNOFF provides commands to allow you to include variable sections  of
text  in  your  output,  with the output produced being dependent on a
switch value given at run time.  This means that  different  documents
can  be  produced  from  the one source file without any editing being
necessary.  The main use of such a feature is in  producing  documents
of  similar framework but with different keywords or phrases included.
Such a feature  would  be  very  useful,  for  example,  in  producing
newsletters  of  similar  contents  which  are to be sent to different
departments.  The way this feature is obtained is by declaring certain
variables  and  enclosing  the variant sections of text by conditional
statements  to  RUNOFF.   The  state  of  any  variables,  and   these
conditional statements, determine the output produced.


(a)  .VARIABLE name,ch1,ch2 , .VR name,ch1,ch2     _________________________________________

     This command declares the variable "name", where "name" can be up
     to  6  characters, and associates with it two characters, ch1 and
     ch2, to specify whether the  variable  is  "on"  or  "off".   The
     /VARIANT switch is used to specify the condition of any variables
     (see sect 5.2).  If the variable name is included in the  switch,
     the variable is "on", otherwise it is "off".


     The two characters ch1, and ch2, are  for  use  with  the  /DRAFT
     switch  (Sect  5.2).  This switch is used to include all variable
     text in the output.  The text  which  would  be  printed  if  the
     variable  were "on" is output with ch1 in column 1 of every line;
     and the text which would be printed if the variable were "off" is
     output with ch2 in column 1 of every line.









                                 4-1

(b)  .IF name  (No abbr.)     ____________________

     Specifies that the following text in the  input  file  is  to  be
     included  if  the  variable specified by name is "on".  This text
     should either be followed by an .ELSE name command or  an  .ENDIF
     name command.


(c)  .IFNOT name , .IN name     ______________________

     Specifies that the following  text  is  to  be  included  if  the
     variable is "off".  Again the text should be followed by an .ELSE
     name or an .ENDIF name command.


(d)  .ELSE name  (No abbr.)     ______________________

     The following text is to be included if the logical complement of
     the  preceding  .IF  or  .IFNOT  is true.  This means that if the
     .ELSE is preceded by an .IF name, and the variable is  "off"  the
     .ELSE  text  is  output.  An .ELSE command must be followed by an
     .ENDIF command.


(e)  .ENDIF name , .EI name     ______________________

     Must terminate any conditional sections of text.



4.2  program logic manuals.     ______________________

RUNOFF allows you to produce, from program documentation, a  formatted
documentation  manuscript.   This  can  include  selected  sections of
program documentation, and also selected sections of program code  and
declarations.   This  allows  you  to  produce  a  detailed  piece  of
documentation without any retyping.  You can include  RUNOFF  commands
in your program source code, and simply run the program through RUNOFF
to give your output.


This can be done for programs written in many  languages.   These  are
Algol,  Basic, Bliss-10, Bliss-11, Cobol, Fail, Fortran-10, Fortran-4,
Macro-10, Macy-11, and Pal-10.  Each of these languages has a specific
comment  character.   The commands to RUNOFF are included in with your
comments.


In order that you can select portions of your program to be  processed
by  RUNOFF,  a  "selection  string"  is  defined.   This consists of 4
characters in the order:  comment char., single  command  line  char.,
block  start  char., and block stop char.  The single, start, and stop
characters are "&", "+", and "-".  You follow the comment character of
the  language by the appropriate selection character, depending on the


                                 4-2
MNT-14 OTHER FEATURES       ______________


length of comments text that you want processed  by  RUNOFF.   If  you
want  a  single line processed you use the "single" character.  If you
want a block of text processed you precede the block  by  the  "start"
character, and follow it with the "stop" character.  RUNOFF processing
is initially turned off.  This means that when you want processing  to
commence you must use a "single" or "start" character.


If you have a section of program code such as constant definitions, or
record  descriptors  which you wish to include with your documentation
you proceed as follows:


     1.  Use the  .SELECT  command  to  change  the  language  comment
         character  to the first character in the lines which you wish
         to include.  This must be the same for every line.


     2.  Follow the section of code with a .SELECT command  to  change
         the  comment  character  back  to its standard value.  Should
         this character be one of the special RUNOFF  characters  such
         as ;  it must be quoted (preceded with an underscore).


The following  example  uses  a  section  of  a  Macro-10  program  to
demonstrate  these capabilities.  The comment character in Macro-10 is
a semicolon ";".

(b)  .NO SELECTION , .NSL     ____________________

     Turns off selection.  All following  text  is  considered  to  be
     input to RUNOFF

(c)  .END SELECTION , .ESL     _____________________

     All selection  is  disabled  until  the  next  occurence  of  the
     "single"  line  command  flag  character.   From  that  point  on
     selection is re-enabled.



4.3  Use of special terminals.     _________________________

Many terminals have an upper and lower case facility and on  these  it
is  easy  to  type  text  in  both  cases.   There  are, however, some
terminals on which it is only possible to type in upper case.


When using an upper case terminal, such as the Model 33  Teletype,  it
is  still  possible  to  have  upper  and  lower case output produced.
RUNOFF uses a "case offset parameter" to process upper case alphabetic
characters.   If  this  parameter  is  set  to  upper  case,  then the
upper-case charactes (A-Z) are not affected;  if it is  set  to  lower
case  then  all upper case charactes are converted to their lower case
equivalents.  The case parameter is set to either of its values by the
.UPPER  CASE  and  .LOWER  CASE commands, the format of which is given
below.


RUNOFF uses flag characters (Sect 3.4.1) to  alter  the  case  of  the
letters  in  your  input  file.   To  obtain  an  upper and lower case
document when only an upper case terminal is available you  should  do
the following:

     1.  Set the lower case parameter by using a .LOWER CASE command.

     2.  Specify your case requirements  by  use  of  the  appropriate
         flags.

     3.  Have your output document pinted on an upper and  lower  case
         line-printer.


The case formatting characters are up-arrow "^",  and  backslash  "\".
These  can be entered on an upper case terminal as shift-N and shift-L
respectively.   The  presence  of  an  up-arrow  causes   the   letter
immediately following it to be converted to upper case, and any letter
preceded by a backslash is converted to lower case.  This  means  that
the  first  letter in every sentence and any other letter you may wish
to capitalize should be preceded by an up-arrow.  If you want to  make
a  section  of text into upper case, you can "lock" on upper case mode
by preceding your text with ^^.  When you wish to return to the normal


                                 4-4
MNT-14 OTHER FEATURES       ______________


lower case you enter \\ to "lock" on lower case.  You may also use the
capitalize flag to capitalize entire words.


The following demonstrates the use of the case control characters:


.lower case
^HERE IS ^SAMPLE ^SENTENCE IN ^^UPPER CASE \\ AND LOWER CASE.


On processing by RUNOFF this becomes


Here is a Sample Sentence in UPPER CASE and lower case.


(a)  .UPPER CASE , .UC     _________________

     Causes all upper case letters A-Z appearing in  the  source  text
     following  this  command  to  be  left  unchanged.   That is, all
     alphabetics appearing after this command in the source  text  are
     left in their original case.  


(b)  .LOWER CASE , .LC     _________________

     Causes all upper case letters  A-Z  in  the  source  text  to  be
     translated to the corresponding lower case letters a-z.  That is,
     regardless of the case of letters in the  original  source  text,
     all letters in the output text will be lower case.


(c)  .FLAG CAPITALIZE  (No abbr.)     ____________________________

     Enables the < character to capitalize the word it precedes.



4.3.1  High quality terminals.       _______________________

Some terminals, such as the  Diablo  1620  and  Diablo  1610,  provide
special  features  which can be used by RUNOFF to provide high quality
output.


The Diablo 1620 terminal is micro-processor controlled, and allows you
to  produce  output  on variable size stationery, including 2-part and
4-part, at quite a reasonable rate.  The production of cut stencils is
also  simple  using  this terminal, with different print ribbons being
available depending on the quality of the output you wish to  produce.
Different  print  wheels  can  be  used  to  give a range of character
styles, such as Pica, Courier, and Elite.



                                 4-5
                                                 MNT-14 OTHER FEATURES                                                        ______________


If your output document contains numeric formulae with superscripts or
subscripts,  the  Diablo  terminal  can  be  used, using its half-line
spacing capabilities, to give you the style of output you desire.   To
obtain  this  effect  you  include certain "control" characters to the
terminal in your RUNOFF file.


Included in the standard character set used on terminals are  a  group
of  non-printing characters called control characters.  Among the uses
of  these  characters  are  the  controlling  of  the  print  carriage
mechanism.   To  include  these  in  your  RUNOFF file you must enable
control characters by means of the .CONTROL CHARACTERS command.


One control character is used with the Diablo terminal to signal  that
the  following character is not to be printed, but is a command to the
terminal.  This flag control character is ESC.  This is echoed on your
terminal  when  you  are  inputting your file as a $ character.  The $
character will not  be  printed  in  your  output  document.   ESC  is
alternately  labelled  ALT or PREFIX on some terminals.  If you cannot
find any of these keys you can type a control-[ (hold down the control
key while you type the [ character).


The two control sequences you use are ESC D and ESC U.   ESC  D  moves
the  print  carriage down a half-line spacing and is used for printing
superscripts.  ESC U moves the carriage up a half-line spacing and  is
used  for  printing subscripts.  However when using control characters
in your file you should ensure that the line containing them is output
in  nofill  mode.   This ensures that RUNOFF does not miscalculate the
number of characters in the line.


RUNOFF also allows you to have  your  file  typeset  to  a  TYPESET-10
printer,  should  this  be available.  It does this by creating a file
containing printer commands as well as your formatted text.


(a)  .CONTROL CHARACTERS , .CC     _________________________

     Allows control characters to be included in your input file.   If
     this command is not used all control characters are ignored, with
     a warning being printed on your terminal to  tell  you  of  their
     prescence.


(b)  .NO CONTROL CHARACTERS , .NCC     _____________________________

     Specifies that control characters  are  to  be  ignored  (default
     setting).

                             USING RUNOFF                             ____________



5.1  using runoff.     _____________

This section discusses how to instruct RUNOFF to take your input  file
and produce your formatted document as output.  Output can be directed
to disk or to terminal.


When you give  RUNOFF  an  input  file  name  it  expects  a  standard
extension.   This extension is .RNO .  Other extensions may be used by
typing the full file name  and  extension  to  RUNOFF.   If  the  .RNO
extension  is  used you need only type the file name to RUNOFF and not
the extension.  if you do not specify the name  of  your  output  file
RUNOFF  uses  the  name  of  your input file and gives the file a .MEM
extension.


As is the usual convention output typed on the terminal is  underlined
in this manual.  This is to distinguish it from what you type.


To run RUNOFF you must first log in to the system.  When  the  logging
in  procedure is complete the monitor responds with a period ".".  You
then proceed as follows:


         .R RUNOFF         _


RUNOFF responds with an asterisk "*" to tell you that it is ready  for
your  instructions.   The  instructions you type to the RUNOFF program
are called a command string.  These should not be  confused  with  the
actual RUNOFF commands which you include with your input file.


The command string format is as follows:

         *outputfile=inputfile/switches         _




                                 5-1
                                                   MNT-14 USING RUNOFF                                                          ____________


Your file is processed through RUNOFF, and the  system  responds  with
the  filename,  the  number of pages contained in the resulting output
file, any errors which may have occured in processing, and  the  input
and output pages where your errors occured, if any.


For example, with a file called TEST.RNO your dialogue could  look  as
follows:


         .R RUNOFF         _
         *TEST         _
         TEST    22 PAGES         ____    ________
         *^C         _
         .PRINT TEST.MEM         _


The response from RUNOFF tells you that you have no  errors  and  your
output  is  2  pages long.  If you have made any errors, your dialogue
with RUNOFF may look like this:


         .R RUNOFF         _
         *TEST         _
         TEST         ____
         %RNFJEC JUNK AT END OF COMMAND:".LM 5"         ______________________________________
                 ON OUTPUT PAGE !; ON INPUT LINE 8 OF PAGE 1                 ___________________________________________
         TOTAL 2 PAGES         _____________
         *         _


You correct your errors with the editor and rerun  your  file  through
RUNOFF.  A complete list of error messages is given in Appendix E.


Should you desire your output to be printed on your terminal,  replace
the  output  file  name in the command string by TTY:.  Using our TEST
example again, your dialogue could look as follows:


         .R RUNOFF         _
         *TTY:=TEST         _
         TEST    22 PAGES         ____    ________
         *^C         _


If you are producing your final copy, and having  it  printed  on  the
terminal, you can use the /PAUSE switch.  The effect of this switch is
that every time a new page is ready to be output,  RUNOFF  pauses  and
rings  a  bell  on  the  terminal to allow you to position your paper.
Once you have done this you type any character, such as a  space,  and
RUNOFF proceeds and outputs the next page.




                                 5-2
MNT-14 USING RUNOFF       ____________


RUNOFF allows for full wildcarding in its command string.  This  means
that  you may use an asterisk instead of a filename or an extension to
specify all files with a certain extension or all  files  of  a  given
name  with  any extension.  A question mark may be used to designate a
variable character within a filename.   For  example,  if  you  had  a
collection  of  files  on your area called TEST01.RNO, TEST02.RNO, and
TEST03.RNO, all of which you wished to run  through  RUNOFF,  and  you
wished  to  create  output  files  called  TEST01.MAN, TEST02.MAN, and
TEST03.MAN you would type:


         .R RUNOFF         _
         **.MAN=TEST??.RNO         _





5.2  useful switches.     ________________

Listed below are a number of RUNOFF switches which you may find useful
when using RUNOFF.  A brief explanation of the function of each switch
is given.  A complete list of RUNOFF switches is given in Appendix D.


/AUTOPARAGRAPH                Turns on the autoparagraph  mode.   This
                              means  that  lines starting with a space
                              force a new paragraph.

/BAR:ch                       Change the default bar character to ch.

/DRAFT                        Include all excluded contents.  For  use
                              with the .VARIABLE command.

/IRANGE:"l1/c1-p:l1:c2-p"     Only text from line l1 of page  c1-p  to
                              line l2 of page c2-p is used as input to
                              RUNOFF.  Page numbers can be of the form
                              p  rather than c-p.  Line numbers may be
                              omitted, but you still must type the "/"
                              character.   If  the  "from"  section is
                              omitted  the   default   is   from   the
                              beginning  of  the  file.   If  the "to"
                              section is omitted, it defaults  to  the
                              end of the file.

/NOAUTOPARAGRAPH              Turn off autoparagraph mode (default).

/ORANGE:r                     The range r is of the same form  as  for
                              the /IRANGE switch.  Here all input text
                              is processed but only text in the  given
                              range is output.

ONOMATOPOEIA

Formation of names or words from sounds that resemble those associated
with  the object or action to be named, or that seem suggestive of its
qualities;  babble,  cuckoo,  croak,  ping-pong,  quack,  sizzle,  are
probable  examples.   The  word is also used of a sentence whose sound
suggests what it describes, as in Tennyson's

               Myriads of rivulets hurrying thro' the lawn, 
               The moan of doves in immemorial elms,
               And murmuring of innumerable bees.


Here is an example of a source file which is to be processed and typed
out on an upper and lower case terminal.

After processing by RUNOFF is complete, the output file can  be  typed
on the terminal as shown below.


             EXAMPLE on UPPER-LOWER CASE and UNDERLINING             ___________________________________________

This example illustrates the simplest method of processing  upper  and
lower case text from a terminal with upper and lower case facilities.

Before creating the source file from the terminal, it is necessary  to
set  the  terminal  case  mode  to lower case by a SET TTY LC command.                                                   __________
Then, at the very beginning of the source file, an .UPPER CASE command                                                   ___________
is  required,  so that the text may be entered in the appropriate case
by using the shift key for capitals.

Here are a few more lines of mixed upper and  lower  case  text  which
have been placed in the source file as shown above;


   Beauty is but a blossom.

   D.E.C.  stands for Digital Equipment Corporation.

   UPPER and lower case text presents NO PROBLEMS.

                                                                      _________________________


This example shows how to set up numbered paragraphs.


The width of the lines in the source file is unimportant, as is the  
spacing between words. Simply type the text as written by the author.  
The input falls into three categories:
.left margin 5
.paragraph -5,2,6
(a)##Lines that start with a period are RUNOFF commands and must be  
typed as a distinct line. The period goes in column 1 and the command  
starts in column 2. Words are separated by exactly one space.
.paragraph
(b)##Tables and formatted text should be entered using tabs to align 
the columns. Use exactly one tab between columns, regardless of the  
width; RUNOFF will control the tabs properly. The author must include  
a .TAB STOPS command before the table.  The author should indicate  
the columns by drawing a light  vertical line showing the columns  
of the table. The author should precede the table with a .NOFILL  
command, and follow the table with a .FILL command, if necessary.
.paragraph
(c)##General text may be entered freely. In general, one space should 
be typed between each pair of words, but no harm will result if more
than one space is used. Tabs should not be used at all in general  
text. When entering the source file from a terminal which only has  
upper case letters, each required capital letter should be preceded by 
an up-arrow (_^). Whenever the exact number of spaces is important,  


                                  A-3
                                                MNT-14 RUNOFF EXAMPLES                                                       _______________


they should be entered as multiple number-signs (_#) rather than as  
spaces. This will ensure that the quoted number of spaces is never 
expanded or compressed by the justifying facility.


The output produced is:


The width of the lines in the source file is unimportant,  as  is  the

     which only has upper case letters, each required  capital  letter
     should be preceded by an up-arrow (^).  Whenever the exact number
     of spaces is  important,  they  should  be  entered  as  multiple
     number-signs  (#)  rather  than as spaces.  This will ensure that
     the quoted number of spaces is never expanded  or  compressed  by
     the justifying facility.


This example shows how to set up tables in your file.


In order to enter  a  table  with  the  rightmost  column  filled  and
justified, you must use the following technique.  


Precede the table by a .TAB STOPS line to set the columns.  Then  give
a  .LEFT  MARGIN  command  to set the left margin to the rightmost tab
stop.  Then enter the table with an .INDENT -n command to  start  each
line at the first column.  Finally, space and restore the left margin.

              SAMPLE PROGRAM TO ILLUSTRATE USE OF RUNOFF


This file just illustrates a few of the features of RUNOFF.


(a)  Spacing
     Exact spacing can be provided by the number sign '#'.

(b)  Special Characters
     Special characters, ^, \, &,  and  #,  must  be  preceded  by  an
     underline  character  since  they  have  special  significance as
     formatting characters otherwise.  That is, they must be typed  in
     as _^, _\, _&, or _# respectively.

(c)  Tabling
     Tabling can be done very simply.
               One       first entry
               Two       second entry
               Three     third entry

(d)  Other Features
     There are many other features available, but since this is only a
     sample program they will not be illustrated here.

command.  This means that the start of a new  paragraph  may       
be indicated to Runoff by simply starting the paragraph on a       
new line, commencing with  a  space.   Runoff  supplies  the       
necessary line spacing and indentation.

     The .t (title) command can be used to specify  a  title       
to  be  printed  at  the top of the page along with the page       
number.  A sub-title may also be specified to  appear  under       
the  title  with  .st.   In a document with numbered sections       
like this one, the sub-title is changed  automatically  with       
changes in section title.

.hl2Automatic Paragraphing.

 In order to simplify the division of a document
into paragraphs, autoparagraph mode can be
turned on with the .ap command.  This means
that the start of a new paragraph may be
indicated to Runoff by simply starting the
paragraph on a new line, commencing with a space.
Runoff supplies
the necessary line spacing and indentation.

.hl2Titling Documents
 The .t (title) command can be used to specify
a title to be printed at the top of the page
along with the page number. A sub-title may
also be specified to appear under the title
with .st. In a document with numbered sections
like this one, the sub-title is changed
automatically with changes in section title.

     The .s command is used to skip (insert) blank lines  in       
the  text.   It  causes  one  blank  line  to be left before       
commencing the following text.  Following the command with a       
number causes that many lines to be skipped.  It is possible       
to globally double space  (for  example)  the  document,  in       
which  case  skips are also doubled.  To cause the next text       
to start on a new line, the .br command can be used.               
                                                                   
                                                                   
                                                                   
     1.5  Automatic Section Numbering                              
                                                                   
     Runoff provides the ability to  automatically  generate       
section numbers at desired places.  This greatly facilitates       
the  maintenance  of  a  section-oriented  document,   since       
sections  may  be inserted or deleted at will without having       
to manually renumber surrounding sections accordingly.  Five       
levels  of  nesting  are  provided  with  the  numbers being       
incremented  automatically  wherever  a   .hl   command   is       
encountered.   Within  chapters  (if  specified)  the  outer       
section number is incremented at each chapter change.

     As we have already seen, certain characters (eg &) have       
special  meanings to Runoff.  To use one of these characters       
in the text it is necessary to indicate it is  to  have  its       
normal  (as opposed to Runoff Special) meaning by preceeding       
it  with  an  underline  character   "_".    Other   special       
characters to watch out for are:  ^, \, #, <, >, and !             
                                                                   
                                                                   
                                                                   
     1.7  Lists                                                    
                                                                   
     Runoff can automatically indent  and  number  lists  of       
points  for  you.   The  entire list is bracketed by .ls and       
.els whilst each element is commenced with a .le;  command.

.hl2Centering and Underlining
 Text may be centred on a line by typing it 
after a .c command. Underline characters by
preceeding them with _&. Underlining may be
locked on with _^_& and turned off with _\_&.



.hl2Spacing between lines
 The .s command is used to skip (insert)
blank lines in the text. It causes one blank
line to be left before commencing the 
following text. Following the command with a
number causes that many lines to be skipped.
It is possible to globally double space (for
example) the document, in which case skips are
also doubled. To cause the next text to start
on a new line, the .br command can be used.


.hl2Automatic Section Numbering
 Runoff provides the ability to automatically
generate section numbers at desired places.
This greatly facilitates the maintenance of
a section-oriented document, since sections
may be inserted or deleted at will without
having to manually renumber surrounding sections
accordingly.  Five levels of nesting are
provided with the numbers being incremented
automatically wherever a .hl command is
encountered.  Within chapters (if specified)
the outer section number is incremented at each
chapter change.

.hl2Reserved Characters
 As we have already seen, certain characters (eg
_&) have special meanings to Runoff. To use one
of these characters in the text it is
necessary to indicate it is to have its normal
(as opposed to Runoff Special) meaning by
preceeding it with an underline character "__".
Other special characters to watch out for are:
_^, _\, _#, _<, _>, and _!


.hl2Lists
 Runoff can automatically indent and number
lists of points for you.  The entire list is
bracketed by .ls and .els whilst each element
is commenced with a .le; command.

RUNOFF conforms to the DECsystem-10  standard  for  system  diagnostic
messages  and  error  codes.   The  following  conventions are used in
describing these messages:

               CONVENTION                    MEANING
               dev                      a legal device name
               file structure name      a legal file structure name
               file.ext                 a legal filename and extension
               adr                      a user address
               n                        a number
               abc                      a disk unit or drive
               x                        an alphabetic character
               switch                   a switch


The formats of the messages are

               ?                        RNFXXX text
               %                        RNFXXX text

where

               ?     = a fatal error message
               %     = warning or advisory message
               [     = comment line

               XXX   = 3 letter mnemonic for the message
               text  = explanation of the message


If you input RUNOFF commands incorrectly into your  source  file,  you
can receive one or several of the messages in the following list:







                                 E-1
                                                MNT-14 ERROR MESSAGES.                                                       _______________


?RNFCJL CAN'T JUSTIFY LINE
          The string of input between spaces  (and  end  of  line)  is
          greater  than  the separation between left and right margins
          and therefore does not fit in the  output  even  before  any
          attempt to expand spaces.

?RNFDVN DUPLICATE VARIABLE NAME:"command"
          This variable command is attempting to  declare  a  variable
          which  has  already been declared.  This declaration will be
          ignored.

?RNFEFD END FOOTNOTE DOESN'T FOLLOW FOOTNOTE:"command"
          This end footnote command appears at a  place  in  the  file
          which  is  not  immediately following a footnote command and
          the corresponding footnote data.

?RNFELD END LITERAL DOESN'T FOLLOW LITERAL:  "command"
          This end literal command appears at  a  place  in  the  file
          which is not immediately following a literal command and the
          corresponding literal text.  It probably reflects  that  the
          count on the literal command is incorrect.

?RNFEVL EXCEEDING VARIABLE LIST:"command"
          Only a maximum  of  20  variables  can  be  declared.   This
          command  is  attempting  to declare the 21st variable.  This
          and all  further  variable  declarations  will  be  ignored,
          although the message will not be repeated.

?RNFFIF FOOTNOTE INSIDE FOOTNOTE:  ".command"
          This command is attempting to start a  footnote  definition,
          only  it  occurs  within  a  footnote  definition,  which is
          illegal.  It probably indicates that the  previous  footnote
          definition was never terminated.

?RNFIBO INPUT BUFFER OVERFLOW
          A string of characters has  been  input  which  is  so  long
          between spaces (or the right margin is so large) that is has
          overflowed the internal line buffer storage area.

?RNFIFT ILLEGAL IN FOOTNOTE:  ".command"
          This command is illegal within a footnote.

%RNFIIF x IGNORED IN INPUT FILE
          Control characters are not normally  allowed  in  the  input
          file.  This character was input and is being ignored.  If it
          should be input, then declare ".CONTROL CHARACTERS" in order
          to make it legal.

?RNFILC ILLEGAL COMMAND:  ".command"
          This command is illegal for some reason.  Most  reasons  are
          that  a  key word was not recognized or that an argument was
          out of range.

%RNFJEC JUNK AT END OF COMMAND:  ".command"


                                 E-2
MNT-14 ERROR MESSAGES.       _______________


          The command after all its arguments, still  has  some  other
          characters which are not blanks or comments.

[RNFKCF nK CORE - FOOTNOTE]
          Core was expanded because of growth in the footnote  storage
          area.   If  this  repeats indefinitely it probably indicates
          that the footnote was improperly terminated.

[RNFKCI nK CORE - INDEX]
          Core was expanded because of growth  in  the  index  storage
          area.   In  a  well  indexed document this message should be
          output occasionally as processing progresses.

?RNFLDE LITERAL DOESN'T END WITH .END LITERAL:  ".command"
          After a counted literal, thenext line is not an end  literal
          command.  This probably indicates that the count is wrong.

          ?RNFNEC NOT ENOUGH CORE nK
          Core has been expanded to the limit of what the  monitor  is
          allowed to assign to this job.  The processing is aborted at
          this point.

?RNFNFS NO FILE SPECIFIED
          The user has specified some switches or an output file,  but
          has not specified an output file.

%RNFNIA NEGATIVE INDENT ATTEMPTED
          The sum of the indent and the left margin is less than zero,
          meaning  that  the line should start to the left of the left
          edge of the paper.  Either the left margin has  been  missed
          or  the  indent is wrong.  The indent might be implicit in a
          paragraph or table request.  This  message  is  output  only
          once until the next left margin or SD command.

%RNFNIC ANOTHER n NEGATIVE INDENTS COUNTED
          This message indicates how many additional negative  indents
          were discovered since the last NIA message.

?RNFNID NO INPUT DEVICE
          The user has failed to specify either  an  input  device  or
          file.

?RNFODE OUTPUT ERROR xxxxxx
          The output file  has  an  I/O  error  whose  octal  code  is
          included in the message.

%RNFSPO SUBPAGE OVERFLOW
          While incrementing the subpage counter, it got  larger  than
          26.  This probably indicates that the end subpage command is
          missing.

                                                MNT-14 ERROR MESSAGES.                                                       _______________


%RNFTFE TOO FEW END COMMANDS
          When the end of the input was reached  there  were  not  the
          same  number  of  end  (or end list or end note) commands as
          there had  been  list  and  note  commands.   This  probably
          indicates that an end command is missing.

?RNFTMI INSUFFICIENT CORE FOR COMMAND
          The user has specified somany input file specifications that
          RUNOFF  could not fit them into core.  The command should be
          split into several commands.

?RNFTMR TOO MANY RANGES
          The user has specified too many IRANGE or  ORANGE  pairs  to
          fit  in  the  storage space assigned (20 pairs each).  Fewer
          ranges should be specified.

?RNFTMV TOO MANY /VARIANTS
          The user has specified too many  VARIANTS  in  the  command.
          Only 20 variants can be specified in one command.

%RNFTNN TOO MANY NESTED NOTES
          More than 6 nested  notes  and  lists  has  occurred.   This
          probably indicates that one or more end commands is missing.

?RNFUKV UNKNOWN VARIABLE:  ".command"
          On  an  if,ifnot,else,or  endif  command  a   variable   was
          referenced  which  was  not  declared in a variable command.
          This  usually  indicates  a  spelling  error  or  a  missing
          variable command.

%RNFUME UNMATCHED END COMMAND
          More end commands have occurred than list or note commands.

?RNFYVZ /VARIANT VALUE ZERO
          In a VARIANT switch, the value was null or  zero.   Variants
          always have names.
