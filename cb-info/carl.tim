                                                                     / 4-16-82
PCOM - Implemented parameters with scope on a per-file basis.
PCOM - Installed Fix for COEES for Job Capacity Exceeded errors.
PCOM - Installed TMPCOR capability as well as "DSK:nnnPCO.TMP".
PCOM - Solicited for command names from section members.
PCOM - Revamped the switches for better understanding. (90% done).
PCOM - Performed comprehensive testing on all of the above.  / 4-23-82
Re-implemented PCOM switches to handle /NOxxx and /xxx better.
Finished PCOM parameter implementation and wrote documentation.
Fixed and re-transmitted TITO with license fix.  / 4-30-82
Scanning SPOOL and LISTER listings to determine the amount of
work required to resolve the district code futures for Tymshare.
At least 4 hours reloading nodes and systems related to network
all of the various outages between 552-BNET-655-etc.  / 5-07-82
(2) Installing and testing PCOM feature for make a logfile if
one is specified although the default may be to NOT create one.
(6) Tracking down Dave's reported problem with PCOM.  Did not
find any conclusive proof to support or disprove the symptom.
Put in code to report on arguments to !FOGFT failures reported
by Ken.  It appears to not have access rights to disown its child.
(2) Installing and testing ACCESS.MSG typeout routines in both
of GFD and LOGINN.
(4) Installing - revising and testing MAIL typeout routines in
RPG to eliminate a potential security problem.
(4) Helping hardware with refreshing and formatting the removable
packs on the large CDC drive.  / 5-14-82
Investigated the structure of licenses on the Tymcom-X and updated
the INFO files concerning license.  Changed the OPER program code
to reflect correct use of arrays and macro names to assemble under
both versions of MACRO-10.  Modified my sail subroutines to know
about all licenses including the set of pseudo-licenses. (LICSUB).
Made modification to PCOM to sleep longer between non-interrupt
checks for conditions if the job is detached.  This places a much
lighter load on the I/O system for swapping the job's working set
in and out of memory (needlessly).  3 sec. vs 5 min. if detached.
Also; KEN has not seen "?cannon disown inferiors..." all week.
Helped to diagnose 930's APA0 problem and getting it fixed by
Tymshare Maintenance.  Lois also called it in a second time.  / 5-21-82

PCOM - Spent most of a day making changes to catch more of the
?Can't disown inferior problem.  Also wrote some test programs in
both MACRO and SAIL to determine if PCOM; SAIL; or the system is
at fault.  So far - my program fails to fail and merely adds much
to the stream accounting files (close to 20-30 pages a minute).

to crash the system.  After some crash analysis found that certain
types of RIB error crashes (Bad pointer in RIB) did not cause a FULL
DSKCLN
such errors from being performed.  Notified WRS of my findings.
Tracking down an RPG bug which couldn't find a valid user when the
LUD search routines hashed the username to block 0 of the LUD. Fixed

Spent 24 hours attempting to get system X54 up and running after the
disk restructuring.  A skeletal system was restored but space problems
still seem to be plaguing the system.
Support-line calls dealing with logging in over-shut (2 hrs).
Re-worked the TAB and other data-massageing parts of FICHER and moved
a running copy to Fremont systems and to Tops-20, renamed FICHE.  / 9-17-82
Fixed misc. things in PCOM and re-released it as version 1.52.

other unit members (Lois; Ken; Margaret) and from other areas in
Tymshare (Roy Hendrix; Dick Rawson; Ken Be Dell; Gary Mauldin;
and Ed Gauci).  Reduced the project into 4 areas: Access to info;
printed district codes; request and output routing; and second
party billing capability.  Continuing research is attempting to
determine or verify the importance of each of these areas.  I have
written a preliminary proposal with a step by step breakdown of
the project execution.  A revised version will be completed in the

   990  TITO large file fix           

Researched the sources for "obvious" problems and found none.
Further searching found use of USETI to continue reading from

any file split after page 65.536 (block 262144) was continued
at page # modulo 65.536. Fix: Change USETI/USETO to use CHANIO.
Installed USETI/USETO conversion to CHANIO .CHFSI/.CHFSO calls.
Installed "funny" UFD check to ignore PPNs with gans > 377777.
Spent 10 hours finding out that TITO would not work on F3s as
transmitted in 15.13 due to the F3 microcode IBP bug.  It had
been patched by SOCCI to work properly without documenting it.
Installed modified SLIGOS patch to avoid file truncation during
a STORE ALL while attempting to set the DUMPED bit.
Verified that TITO only saves 10 characters of the system name for
typeout and the tape header.  Changing it to allow for the max
possible (25) involves changing the header format and was not
done.  / 2-26-82

Tracking down a classic "Off by 1" arithmetic problem in TITO.
Tito started counting at 0 - thus a second tape worked but the
third or subsequent tapes lost data since files start at 1.
Included learning a lot about TITO tape formats.
Further testing indicated that TITO half-knew about the off-by-one
block count on the restore - but not on the store.  The previous
correction of both phases broke the restore.  Removal of the
superfluous subtractions appears to resolve the problem.
Working with VF ops to test TITO and handle tapes.
Latest testing shows proper recording but improper restore.

reported anomolies by Dave; Scott; & Dmitry.  As of Friday
2 major problems and 2 minor ones need be solved and about 3
additional consistancy checks made before Field-test ready.  / 7-16-82
Most of this week has been spent testing new code and testing all
possible combinations of user options.  Some of the test results
uncovered areas which required attention and the appropriate things
were done to most areas.  As of the close of the week
still needed to be addressed.  Field test release is imminent as
soon as the last few loose ends are tied up.  Documentation also
needs some work to reflect all the new changes.  However
project is progressing according to schedule.  / 7-23-82
Fixed day-of-week bug and the outstanding help-message bugs.  Also
changed the argument name "OFF" to the /LOG switch to "DELETE" and
forced consistant behavior in all cases.  Revamped the .DOC file
and shortened it to 8 pages.  Created a 2-page .HLP file.  / 8-20-82
Fixed LABEL bug and other miscellaneous reported problems.

Spent about 4 hrs investigating new forms of buffering multiple files
for a multi-file editor inside one checkpoint file via mapping.  It
appears to be effective on Tymcom-X / Tops-20 / and Vax.  Wrote some
liberation from BLILIB routines to perform TYMCOM-X I/O routines.
Worked on my SAIL command scanner macros and subroutine package.  / 2-11-83
Finished the rough edges on a command scanner & keyword search package
as a separate subroutine which is called with an array of keywords and
other appropriate things.  See (SAILIB)CMDSCN.SAI, CMDSCN.DEF.  / 2-25-83
Spent 4 or mor hours reading the C manual and comparing it to the
EMACS listings for reference as well as writing my first few programs
on the VAX (in C).  / 5-06-83
General investigative learning about how things work:  The paging
system calls on tops-20, More about C for the Vax, memory accessing
and mapping calls on tops-20 and how thaey relate to tymcom-x.  / 5-27-83

-structure of the Tymcom-X file system.
Finished investigation into LISTER to determine fixing /FORTRAN.
Implemented a routine MPLSPL to allow migration of (MPL) programs to
-directory (SPL) and moved TAUX on all systems updating with the new
-version.  /10-08-82
Prodded PCOM around to a few more systems.  MIS wanted it on 28.

Helped Vivian with BAIL and tracing through her program.  /10-22-82
Finished the transmittal paperwork for GFD and RPG [MAIL] and
passed it along to Mike.
Consulted with Ed Imsland about a customer problem using TYMUSE in a
PCOM job.  Apparently TYMUSE reads the node-port of the user for use
in Royalty-Accounting from GTLOG (GETTAB) and not UPTLOG (FRMOP).
Spent some time re-organizing SAIL files and subroutines so that other
people would be able to use them (or parts of them) more easily.
Wrote a general-purpose slave program which checksums all the files
in the GFD'd ufd.  (Will make it more general later?).  /10-29-82
Modularized parts of a binary file updating tool.  (Used this to
implement same for (SYS)PERP.SYS called DEFSYS).

gave Ed Imsland the necessary details for him to handle it.
'(SPL)PRUNE''ed recent additions to (SPL) and (SAILIB).  /11-05-82
Made preliminary changes to TITO for DUMPED-BIT close.  Need to test
and install RANSIZ check before release to VF OPS.
Wrote subroutine for SYSTEM VERSION (major,minor,rev#,patch#).
COnsultation w/ Ken, Vivian.
Modified SEND to be useable by fat-fingered people.  Added '.' dot
commands.  (Documentation forthcoming.)
I did some more, but didn't write it down. - Forgot what.  /11-19-82
TITO changes for files-on-tape and pre-'/L' vs '/L' changes all but
the final test (VF OPS) and the transmittal has been done.
TAPE verified versions on FTSYS vs Xmittal, completed re-XMIT of 12.2.

Consulting w/ Ken on PEAK, Vivian on DUSAGE, Ed Imslande on the final
outcome of the TYMUSE problem, Joan Bryant on SAIL checksum routine,
and some other misc things.
Spent a few hours attempting to keep our lab equipment from broiling
and then reloading various nodes and hosts after power outages.  /12-03-82
Finished up TITO work and transmittal.  Followed it through to Dave
Miller since they had a question about it's license. System :33 had
much much too much license on (SYS)TITO.SAV.
Consulted with Joan Bryant (Ron saltgaver's group) about a checksum
routine written in SAIL.  I gave her a new routine which returns the
checksum, file-size, protection, license, creation date and time.
The routine 'maps' the file a page at a time.  Also used this routine
in my modified checksum program which allows an entire directory to
be checked (used DSKSCN) package.  /12-10-82
Spent some time consulting and providing some support routines for
checksumming and returning 'other' information about files for myself
and for software distribution.  Have a skeletal program to keep track
of files across directories and across systems.  Will distribute when
it works.  /12-24-82
Consulted with LOIS about SYSTAT's behavior with printing the USERS
line more than once.  A 'most-interesting' bug, LOIS is learning a
lot about the 'obvious' not being 'obvious'.  /12-31-82
Approx 2 hours consulting with Vivian.  Some teaching and some general
aid with monitor structures and other such things.  / 1-14-83
Modified MFDSCN to pass an additional argument and released it for
use in Vivian's DUSAGE program.
Created DULWLD routine to read all the DUL entries using a mask to
provide a similar level of ppn-username conversion as is available
with MFDSCN and DUL (multiple entries using a mask) rather than a
single conversion.
Helped / consulted with Vivian on Dusage and MFD/UFD info versus
DUL/LUD info and it's accuracy.
Modified CVPPN/CVUSER routine to use Chanio instead oif
of SAIL lookup.
Prodded Ed Imsland about the status of the RTYCHG stuff and pointed
him at the collected sources from Mike.
Lots of little things which took up 15 mins here - 20 mins there - etc.

Consulting with Ed Imsland on the fate of the RTYCHG sources.  Two of
the lost sources were reconstructed by me from REL file information.
Modifying PERP.SYS via DEFSYS on system 39 and preparation of the
transmittal for same.  (possibly should include test instructions).  / 1-28-83
Approx 8 hrs assisting Ed Imsland in recovering testing and
reconstructiong various parts of the RTYCHG package.  Found two
FORTRAN/LINK/LOADER problems in the process.
Aided the resolution of the MFD/LUD/DUL mismatch of user data for
determining disk usage; username lists etc.  2 hrs sporadically.
Wrote a new routine for SAILIB from my old code for command-list
scanning to facilitate common functions needed in command scanning.
Transmitted PERP.SYS after testing for each of the possible problems
and master perp systems and for a variety of user hosts (for 174 &180).
                                                                     / 2-04-83

to verify LUD vs DUL vs MFD. (2 hrs)
LICSUB fixes; consultation with Ken - 2 hrs.  / 2-11-83
Most of 2 days spent designing and implementing a program to read
all the DUL/LUD and UFD entries and decipher what is and isn't legally
there.  Unpolished version now running and copied to various systems
to gather data on a cross-section of user systems.
Need to discuss this more with Adele and someone from Validations.
Spent most of 4 hours (scatterred through the week) discussing how
subroutines are called and what various forms of indirection are used
in the PDP-10 version of MDSI Pascal with John Thompsom - Banking App.
Reworked the discussion of how and why the RTYCHG stuff works and needs
changing with Ed Imsland. 2-3 hrs.  / 2-18-83
Helped Ed Imsland get the remainder of the RTYCHG code to work using
the UPTLOG method rather than LDBLOG.  At present I am awaiting the
final test and approval of the MIS department.  Ed now has full and
complete sources for archival.
4 hrs spent researching and installing license passing and MAIL for the
Japanese (XEXECJ) mode customers.  License passing works fine - however
some circuit zap bugs have been uncovered while testing the MAIL option.
                                                                     / 2-25-83

                                                                     / 3-11-83
Spent an hour with Brian so that PERP.SYS could be moved around with
out my personal intervention each time a change is needed.  / 3-18-83
Spent a few hours developing a *replacement* for FNDFIL using many of
the building blocks written for other applications.
Found some additional deficiencies in MFDSCN which could cause problems
in programs wanting to call the procedure repeatedly.  Made some small
changes internally for testing purposes but not yet *move* to SAILIB.

Spent a total of 4 hrs attempting to co-ordinate getting the new
PERP.SYS file replacing system 10 with system 8 out to all PDP-10
systems.  Took longer than expected 'cause the master system where
the files were was down and I had to have operations restore it to
somewhere else.  I expect the minimum time to be 2 hrs next time.  / 5-13-83
Spent a total of 4 hrs reloading nodes and hosts that were affected
by the Thursday night power outage.  This includes fire-fighting time
spent on X54 on Friday afternoon as well as searching for VAX floppys

Spent a couple of hours finding out why I was getting a strange error
message from the VAX when it executed my LOGIN.COM file.  (It seems
that blank lines following $SET xxx commands do something strange.)
Spent 4 hrs handling support calls and calling people back on calls
taken by others in the group.  (Most notable problem involved system
36 for more than 2 hrs before handing it off to Darren.)
Spent about 8 hrs total in 3 or 4 sessions with the LISA computer in
Rob Dearborn's office.  (SOme of this was in producing an ORG chart!)
Spent about an hour with Dave Sutton.  / 8-05-83
Miscellaneous discussions on various projects - including: the PASSWORD
release; the product list; what needs to be done with TTR; and other
small programs.

to resolve - the most lengthy was the accounting file problem on system
36 which solved itself when CHKPNT started writing the new file.  / 8-12-83
Spent about 4 hrs on various TYMCOM-X support calls and problems.
Spent about 4 hrs re-inventing WRS's PTAP program to put a tap on
the ALARM account on system 930 before finding Bills version.  I
setup his version }
Also found some potential problems in PCOM on system 54.  Additional
places where it calls parts of SAIL to handle problems and never comes
out of waiting for the user to respond.  / 8-19-83
Worked on a re-write of the TYMCOM-X filespec scanner to include masks
generated by ? # and * and to handle funny characters in usernames.
Installed it in a pre-release re-write of my old MAP.SAI program which
copies a file using mapping calls.
Rebuild DEC Standard Runoff (stolen from system 94) for TYMCOM-X.  / 8-26-83
Finished the file-spec parser started last week.  Worked on the new
Rainbows to gain some familiarity.  Started finding 'features' in
the PEAK program which I felt needed reporting (or alterations).
Incorporated the finer parts of TTR and my template components used in
a command parsing skeleton into a viable program package.  Retro-fitted
as much as possible into TTR as an example, without changing it's
functional structure (at all).  / 9-02-83

Kept an eye on CTMKTG7 and tamperred with a PEAK version telecopy.  /12-24-82
Copying; Digging through file drawers for filed DOCs; Attempting to
straighten out all the memos which passed by my desk recently.  / 2-11-83
A minimum of 8 hrs spent packing my office neatly into 20-24 boxes
plus another 4 hrs making pictures and measuring things so the moving
company wouldn't have to.  This time was spread out over 3 days
which started on Tuesday afternoon.  / 5-13-83
Spent between 4 and 6 hrs unpacking and organizing things in my office
after our MOVE from the other area.  This also includes time spent
looking at the micro-node lines trying to see if we could get any of
them working.  This does NOT include extra hours spent decorating!  / 5-20-83
Spent about 4 hrs on the picnic - getting sunburned et al.  / 7-01-83
generated an expense report for the past 8 months of telephone bills.
cleaned off most of the paperwork lying on my desk (believe it or not).
                                                                     / 7-22-83
Picnic!
Cleaned up much of the paperwork on my desk.  / 7-29-83
Spent about 2 hrs filing papers, making XEROXs and such.  / 8-05-83
Cleared off my desk and straightened out some of my filing.  / 8-12-83
Cleaned up parts of my office again.  Spent time re-organizing some
files on 930 into better categories and also moved files into various
sub-directories.  Moved all my PSEUDO-directories on 930 into a more
accessible range so as to not conflict with the MUD.  / 8-19-83
Did some manual labor lugging the new Rainbows up from the loading dock
and setup my Rainbow in my office to insure that everything worked.  I
had some trouble with the original processor (main-board errors) and
switches with a working processor (leaving a note on the ?bad one).
After checkout - swapped the Rainbow for my home terminal.  / 8-26-83
Lost time due to network outages due to brain deficiencies in WCM.
Worked on preparations for transmitting FRMRUN, PCOM, and a couple of
other things.  / 9-02-83

  1112  TSU Wasted Time               

Two hrs lost hassling with circuits which kept going away and trying
to get a CLEAN copy of some software moved around via teleco from 930.
Four hrs lost to having all my current projects on 930 while Darren
had the system stand-alone (Wednesday evening).  / 2-18-83
The disk drive on 930 seems to be going out to lunch more often lately.
Tymnet / Buggnet was out to lunch during the storm.  / 3-04-83
Spent a minimal of 4 hrs re-organizing my office - plus more while
*waiting* for 2-3 hrs for WCM to finish playing games with node 2243
so that I could reload both our network AND system 930.  / 3-25-83
The disks on 930 are hanging again; -- much more frequently - anyway!

At least twice this week I lost time due to driving into the office
JUST to reload 930 so that I could continue working.  (It crashed!)  / 4-01-83
Lost 2 hrs due to the power failure on Thursday.  Even after reloading
various hosts - a major part of the network was still unavailable.
Lost useful time to general apathy while waiting for WCM to get 2243
up and running again on Friday evening - Approx 2 hrs causing a
complete blackout of 118 & 930 from the rest of the world.  / 5-20-83
An entire day and a half were WASTED due to the fabulous efforts of
the Tymshare Lab Organizers who pulled cables around in the VG-2 Lab
thus knocking out TYMNET access to either of 930 or 118 for most of
Saturday and Sunday.  If that wasn't bad enough: WCM or someone broke
a power-plug pin on Sunday and Node 2243 had to have major power-supply
surgery to fix it.  {Sigh}  This was time actually LOST - not counting
the [Oh GEE, what else can I work on] time spend on OTHER hosts.  / 8-26-83

  1145  Micro-fiche for "L" & TOPS/20 

Further developed FICHE to be more useable, eg. Command files.
Tested the new XLAT tables with great success.
Tested various ways to get FSHSPL to write what we want to send
-to Micrographics and to get them to read our tape in every way that
-we could imagine using their software -- without success.
Released FICHE version 4 to (SPL) and to <SUBSYS> on most systems.  /10-08-82
Modified FICHE to generate SYMLOC input for MACRO listings.  /10-15-82
Added SYMLOK output capability to FICHE.  Spruced up code to handle
cross-reference listings for MACRO-53B as well as MACRO-46.  Found
problem with line-length, but not yet fixed.  (See next week.)
Spent 4 hrs testing output and going to Fremont.  Found bad tape
drive problem in the process.  /10-22-82
Re-wrote the main read-write loop for each file to read a line at a
time to make wrapping at the end-of-line work more correctly.
Added re-configuring ablility for debugging.
Went to Fremont with a tape containing the Lockheed monitor and more.
                                                                     /10-29-82
Made the 'last' set of necessary changed to FICHE.  Bill's test file
came back ok.  SYMLOK changes and vertical spacing looks good.  Moved
to all Tymcom-X hosts on (SPL)FICHE version 7.0, not yet on TOPS-20.
                                                                     /11-05-82
Finally installed FICHE 7.0 on <SUBSYS> for TOPS-20.  Looked at the
ECL-Exec to make fiche but ran into assembly difficulties.  Still
waiting for *.lst files to make TOPS-20 fiche.  /11-26-82
Adapted new version with headers in top row for tymcom-x.  Again, I've
run into problems copying the source to tops-20.  /12-10-82
See utilities microfiche project.  THis is closed out.  / 1-14-83

  1191  LISTER /fortran fix           

Spent 4 hrs checking code against printed output to determine what
exactly needs fixing.  99% of code works.  1/3 page and pseudo top-
-of-form (i.e. 2 * 1/2 page or 6 * 1/6 page) is all that needs work.
                                                                     /10-15-82

Three bugs in LISTER fixed. (Including the one reported by CEGI).
ITSR written for F40/FORTRAN-10 incompatibility.  /10-22-82
Final testing shows CDC:=FILE/FORTRAN doesn't and NEVER worked.
Transmittal paperwork and printing.  /11-12-82

  1207  X-PERP Date Fix               

Found and fixed the 1983 problem in PERP.  Tested fine.  DEFER looks
ok.  Added table lookup in (SYS)PERP.SYS for master perp system with
entries for Default (Customer), Tymshare, French-districts for each
system 1-255.  Tests ok.  Expect 4 more hrs to install in DEFER, test
and transmit.  /11-05-82
Finished up PERP and DEFER changes and modified the PERP.SYS file on
both 930 and 39 for transmittal (to be done ASAP).  /11-12-82
Transmitted PERP 7.26 & DEFER 1.26 with PERP.SYS/DEFSYS.  Spent 12
hours searching for the Lockheed difference, mostly operational
difficulties.  Re-transmitted 7.26 PERP with updated PERP.SYS file.  /11-19-82

  1208  Evaluate TOPS20 Decus Tapes   

Initial scan shows all Decus-20 programs to be converted Decus-10
except for a few.  Mostly STAT and some engineering packages (old).
Report will be forthcoming.  /11-05-82
Moved files around for editing the report because of space constraints.
                                                                     /11-26-82
Researching possible on-line copies of the decus catalogue and
converting the on-line memo's distributed into such a document.
All that remains to do is sort the items and finalize the report.  /12-03-82
Finished DECUS product list and arranged them by catgory.  Memo wii
be printed as soon as we get a working printer.  /12-10-82

  1217  TSU Time Away From Work       

Took a day off because of the nervous tensions building because of
some non-work related items.  I wasn't feeling well enough to work.  / 6-18-82
Spent Monday and Thursday at home asleep with a migrane.  /10-15-82
Due to a severe toothache and the medication I was in either in too
much pain or too 'spaced-out' to do any useful work for a few days.  /10-29-82
A day lost to ill health on Friday.  (8 hours).
Felt 'bad' about not feeling well, so put in some extra hours this
week.  The way my health has been lately, I probably will have a short
week again sometime soon.  /11-05-82
Dental aches from root canal & general ill health. 3-days.  /11-12-82
Not feeling well yet.  Took time to rest up some more.  /11-19-82
(Thanksgiving!) [I was feeling much better this week].  /11-26-82
Hacking cough all week kept me home for a few days.  However time was
spent working while I was able.  /12-17-82

Much time spent analyzing options and potential problems as well as
the possible 'fit' programs which are also similar to DIRIT/PIP and
would have the same inconsistancy in the future.
Documentation and specifications as well as option memos written to
aid in the task clarification effort.
An entire day or so spent producing a grammer and learning about LR
parsing techniques in order to eventually build a finite state system
to be used for describing the changes needed and to aid in the process
of understanding RPG - PIP and DIRIT's command scanners dealing with
tokens and such.  / 1-21-83
Additional time spent on parsing theory and attempting to design a
simple grammer for the operations of PIP DIRIT and RPG.  Documents
revised and written describing the necessary development work, still
without actual time estimates.  / 1-28-83
Spent 4 hrs doing background work related to providing DIRIT style
wildcarding for all COPY/RENAME/UNDELETE commands.  / 2-04-83
4 Hrs spent on scaling down the design for the DIRIT rewrite to only
encompass the RENAME/COPY portion with consideration towards ignoring
RPG completely by using a separate program.  Some partial command
scanning and skeletal framework code was implemented.  Full sketch of
the time estimates will be written up next week.  / 2-25-83
Finished time estimates and sent mail to Mike regarding which were
actually feasible solutions within 2 weeks of time.  / 3-18-83

  1226  Speed Up Disk Scanning Package

Revised routines to eliminate unnecessary code.  Added UFDSCN
capability when scanning a specific UFD.  Added channel to the
return routines for faster file processing.  Added eof variable
to fileproc for potential data manipulation.  Modified 3 programs
to use the new package.  All appear to work well.  Only (startcode)
will provide more speed than it has now.  /12-10-82
Revised FILSCN and finalized changes to make it more general.  It's
new name is MFDSCN leaving Dave's old code for those who need it.
Channel/Break/Eof information as well as .CHUFD info is now available
to the user so a second lookup is no longer necessary to touch the file.
Documentation written and finalized for archive. See (SAILIB)MFDSCN.DOC.
                                                                     /12-17-82
Wrote proper documentation and made it available.  Had sources put
into archive and software distribution will telecopy it around.  /12-24-82

  1231  Make Lab Printer Work         

Converted a copy of LPTSPL to non-interrupt version of Aux circuits.
This lost data, so inplemented interrupt code and consulted with both
Dennis and Bill about what we should see in the circuit status.
Off-line condition is detected, but still not handled properly, more
on this when Dennis and I finish the details.  /12-17-82
Talked with Ishan about the changes we want to see & explained the
current operation.  (They may be interested in connecting one in BLDG

Talked with Ishan Wu about the data-printer and the LP11 driver in
the node.  He is going to look into getting it to co-operate and to
not 'throw-away' data when it goes off-line.  /12-31-82
Minor changes to fix repeat header problem.  Currrently not working
until more is done by Dennis or Ishan.  / 1-07-83
Spent time checking code and testing the printer program using a
terminal circuit on 552 while 554 has been down.  Some progress has
been made - but error correction for circuit zaps needs work.  / 2-18-83
Broke out the old LPQUE design to install into the current mini-spooler
program to get the lab printer working.  Still having operational
problems with circuit zaps -- problem is still unknown as to whether a
flakey network or flakey code is the cause.  Time pre-empted to work
on PCOM - Hope to return to this soon.  / 2-25-83

  1232  TYMCOM-X Utilities Micro-Fiche

Obtained list of products and attempted initial dat-base search for
transmittals.  Will be passing a lot of legwork to the Archive co-op
this next week to restore the latest sources.  /12-17-82
Made a dent in getting the archivist started restoring files and
had files from (MFICHE) restored to system 38 for fiching.  /12-24-82
Finished (MFICHE) files and prompted everyone to get their listings
done, ASAP.  Made a dent in the product list, however small, with
53 fiche files for 27 products.  /12-31-82
Making fiche, organizing lists, typing batch and spool requests,
coordinating the help received from Lois, Vivian, Ken, Brian and Chia,
restoring lost files and basically pulling everything together to
get the fiching finished on time.  / 1-07-83
Finished up the final fiching; Finished up attempts to finish up the
tops-20 stuff but hit too many roadblocks.  Nothing was fiched from
our tops-20 sources.  All but one installment of fiche have been
received back from Fremont.  After it is all back and filed then this
project may be closed.  / 1-14-83
Verified that we had most of what we wanted processed and managed
to have someone have Jaon at the msg center alphabetize and put all
the fiche into envelopes.  -- Project Completed --  / 1-21-83

Prodding Bill and researching what needs to be finished up.  / 1-07-83
First release has been passed to COEES with a working interface for
both FORTRAN-IV and FORTRAN-10 as well as Pascal (using F-10 calling).
DOcumentation has been revised - rewritten in some places and made to
match the current state of the world.  Everything is neatly packaged
for final transmittal pending the acceptance from COEES.  / 1-21-83

the frmrun interface;  Spent 3 hrs deciphering what additional info
needs to be written up before final release - including a good user
document for PASSWORD.  / 2-04-83
Spent 2 hrs preparing for and talking with Angela about the state of
the documentation and what it said.  Decided to rewrite it and spent
3 days on it.  Expect to send new DOCs early next week.  / 2-11-83
Three additional hours making changes to the proofread versions of
the new documentation.  Copies moved to systems 26 & 29 verified.  / 2-18-83
2 hrs consulting with Joe Lacombe qbout the state of FRMRUN which has
been causing him trouble in SAIL.  Haven't had time to check it out.

Completely re-wrote (through translation) the assembly language version
of FRMRUN into SAIL.  Modified the calling sequence slightly and added
a new error code for Illegal file specification in Program Name.
Performed thorough testing to make sure the code performed correctly.
Revised the documentation to reflect the current changes.  / 4-01-83
Updated the documentation.  If no changes need be made it is ready.  / 4-08-83
Since this still includes work on FRMRUN... The SAIL version has been
released to beta-test on (SAILIB) around the world.  Joe Lacombe who
works in NTD for Gazel will be using it initially.  / 4-29-83

  1260  TSU Startup on VAX            

Poked around.  Read through the primer and did a little searching for
non-$RMS$ file system descriptions.  / 3-04-83
Total of 8 hrs scattered throught the week spent learning about the
differences in BLISS-?? and how to use system calls --- etc.  / 3-25-83
Studied printouts of the C version of EMACS to determine what was
wrong with gettng our terminals to work.  Fixed VT100 mode and added
HP2621/TYM444/444 mode to the existing code.
Learned more about COM files and created a couple of useful commands
including an EDIT which remembers your file.  / 5-06-83
Determined the extent of operational problems with VAX-EMACS and got
things squared away as well as showing Stand how to get it going on
terminals defined in TERMCAP.  Wrote some command files for the VAX
including one to 'remember' the file that you last edited.  / 5-13-83
Not strictly VAX... but 4 hrs were spent reading the BLISS-36 manuals

  1266  PCOM for "L" Monitor          

Installed license passing using the new format of FOCFM.  Added the
switches /LICENSE and /WATCH with interaction with PEECOM.  Put in
code to handle MAIL through XEXECJ mode and fixed bugs with circuit
zaps and long lines.  Will get it ready for release next week. /Carl.

Finished making clean backup copies of each edit 1.53-1.57 for the
transmittal.  Tested /WATCH and modified 1.57 to use the simplest
method possible to interface with PEECOM.  Version 1.60 with username
prefixed to the filename everywhere is ready for release.  / 3-11-83
Testing of previous versions trying to isolate two problems which Ken
discovered: (short log files and jobs not really going away).  / 3-18-83
Some research on the problem with backing off to version 1.55 until
conclusive results are found.  (File truncation on LOG file).  / 3-25-83
Found the source of multiple problems with PCOM version 1.56 and
corrected versions 1.56 through 1.60 putting 1.60 up on sys for
field-testing.  / 4-01-83
Discussion with Bill Soley about plugging a security problem with PCOM
and some analysis on how to implement it in the current sources.
Additional testing for the [L] release.  / 4-08-83
Added the capability to PCOM to take license from the CTL file and
pass it along to the child frame.  PCOM now must be installed will
all the license bits set.  Version 1.61 is on (SYS:930) for testing.
                                                                     / 4-15-83

Implemented license passing from files to work correctly giving the
OR'ed vale of the users' process license and file license.  / 6-03-83
MOdified current version of PCOM (1.64) to fix :COM file problem when
the file is not found and other miscellaneous lookup errors.
Not yet tested.  That will come this next week!  / 8-05-83
Initial fix for :COM filename completed.  Discussions with Mike - Adele
and Bill about the original design specifications and the intended
implementation details at the beginning of the project.  Merged all
but the /ROYALTY capabilities into one version.  Recoded the /ROYALTY
stuff into SAIL instead of MACRO.  Current version now aborts at the
completion of an error regardless of the nesting level as in Bill's
original intentions.  / 8-12-83

  1268  Bring up TYMCOM-X on X54      

Exasperation and frustration is the best description here.  First the
KLINIK line seemed to be disconnected - the node was down - our 1 pack
system had a head crash completely destroying 2 surfaces - 2 disk heads

were obliterated dropping fragments all over - the rebuilt system with
2 packs took awhile to build - we had to make a new TITO tape which had
to be written on a 'running' TYMCOM-X 2020 - finally we had TITO crash
the system repeatedly restoring a file to disk - we now have a partial
system with directories (SYS) and (A???) through (CUD10) - our utility
directories have not been restored yet.  More on this next week.  / 3-11-83

  1271  TOPS-20 TITO Tape Reader      

Researched more with Tape-drive problems and techniques to read the
records generated by TITO (in SAIL) witout losing compatibility of
TOPS-20/TENEX SAIL during development on TYMCOM-X.  Resolved problems
with our Kennedy drive to be inherent in the drive and NOT in SAIL.
Re-wrote tape.in routine to be flexible enough to fit into the larger
design of the program:  DIRECTORY; SKIP; RESTORE; REWIND; mechanism.
                                                                     / 3-25-83
A guideline specification was written up and passed on to my Manager.
Small testing of tape functions and some design of the record reading
code was completed.  More to come next week.  / 4-01-83
Spent two full days implementing DIRECTORY and OUTPUT with tito-like
ranges (1-4,6,14-E).  Code for usernames has been written but not yet
installed.  The SKIP command has been scrapped since it isn't really
necessary.  Once usernames are installed- adding RESTORE will take a
day or less and then TOPS-20 installation will be all that remains to
be done.  / 4-08-83
Finished the implementation of version 1.0 on TYMCOM-X.  Ran into
problems with SAIL on TENEX/TOPS-20 and finally wrote my own ARRYIN
function to make it work.  Installed preliminary multi-reel support.
Needed: UFD's to be ignored as data, multi-reel support for actual
files split across reels.  Users split across reels works OK!
Version 2.0 is up on 930, will be moved to TOPS-20 as soon as file
split across multi-reels is supported.  / 4-15-83
Finished the design of what must be done to handle files split across
magnetic tapes.  Note: This is complicated by the fact that TITO will
duplicate some of the data on the continuation tape. {Sigh}
Began implementation but did not get very far due to the many many
interruptions this week with fires and emergencies.  Checked with
Stan about use by MAGNUM and when they'd like to start.  Documentation
on how to use TTR needs to be written - possibly a demonstration for
operations.  / 4-22-83
Finished the re-design of the multi-tape support.  Implemented it and
spent an entire day of testing afterwards.  Testing found a few quirks
in TOPS-20/TENEX SAIL not found on TYMCOM-X previously.  Shipped it
off to :94 in Fremont for field testing for a week before release.  / 4-29-83

Fixed some minor bugs and re-organized the TENEX vs TYMCOMX switches
internal to the program.  Moved TAPEIN to a separate subroutine and
integrated things under compiler!switches conditionals.  Wrote DOC
file, edited first draft and submitted 2nd draft for unit review.  Was
pushed off by disorganization caused by the move.  / 5-13-83
Spent 2 hrs editing TTR documentation after everyone finally settled
and had time to comment on content and organization.  <fixed> UFD
problem by special-case'ing UFD files in file setup routines.  Only
needs to be given to operations YET - still with appropriate warning
that a write-ring is needed for reading. Sigh!  / 5-20-83
Fixed up the documentation and directories and prepared everything for
the first release.  Called Steve Metcalf in Fremont and will be sending
the documentation to him for operations testing.  / 5-27-83
SAIL strikes again!  External sail arrays didn't work quite right in
startcode and needed some tweaking.  This caused the array descriptor
instead of the actual array to be overwritten by the tape data thus
causing all of the recent problems.  It has been fixed and the newest
version 1.2 has been installed on 118 and 94.  / 6-10-83
2 hrs finding and fixing the sail linkage bug in the tops-20 version
of TTR; 2 hrs of testing and moving files between 118 and 930 to have
identical working sources on both systems; 4 hours including two trips
to Fremont to get the tape read correctly on system 94.
(I had to read it on system 74 using backup then rewrote it so that
  dumper on tops-20 could read it.  I was originally written by
  dumper on system 118!!!)  / 6-17-83
How about calling this COMPLETED?
I doubt that we'll do anything other than fix MAJOR problems anyway.
                                                                     / 7-22-83
Haggled with some arcane TOPS-20 software in order to get reasonable
listings of TTR and get them printed.  Problems with the printer format
mangled portions of the listings but they are useable until I need a
new copy.  / 8-12-83
Spent most of the week working on TTR consistency and adding the two
new features (extended enter file info, and better documentation from
the internal HELP messages).
I've singled out the areas which need work and intend to concentrate
my efforts this week on those areas to make all of the messages more
consistent.
Also tested everything so far on both TOPS-20 and TYMCOM-X.  / 8-19-83
Spent most of the week workng on TTR in one way or another.  Started
with attempting to re-build SAIL for TOPS-20 after tracing the source
of the write-ring problem to the TENEX runtimes.  Finally decided to
hack around until a PROPER tenex solution was found.  Used GTJFN and
OPENF since all forms of OPENFILE and OPEN failed miserably.
Re-worked some of the documentation and passed it on to the MAGNUM
group for comment/approval.  The product needs to be tested by a
novice user and if that passes, it will be ready for customer release.
                                                                     / 8-26-83

Some time spent determining WHO and WHAT our CTMKTG7 friend was looking
around for this past week.  Consultation within the section- but mostly
outside with Peter Haas (int'l) and Peter Stratman (cegi) about SPOOL
and PERP.  Also set-up MCH as a user with license on 170-184-59.  / 4-08-83

use PEAK.  (Hoping that it is AVAILABLE with documentation on ALL of
our PDP-10's).  / 4-15-83
Additional consulting and fixing up problems on X54 concerning various
problems: Wrong AUN for Nick; 2 wrong AUNs for Margaret; Missing files
for TELECOPY; Node reloading/line dropping between BUBB & NX54; Not
enough license for Nick and group.
Created an ITSR on TELECO due to above - See General Technical.  / 4-29-83

  1283  TOPS-20 Product List (1st cut)

Met with Adele to discuss project & did some planning and analysis
for a rough sample of products available on Tops-20.  / 4-29-83
Spent 4 hrs collecting data from system directories for the various
products available on SYSTEM 118 (Tops-20).  2 more hours spent on
how to cull the useful info out of the marsh (the full directories).
                                                                     / 5-13-83
Minimum of 8 hrs spent gathering data from system directories and
editing it into a (still too large) list of program products.  Some
development of checking and culling hacks to determine field sizes
for the gathered information.  Many frustrating conversations with
division members to find the archeological origins of software now
running on 118 or 94 with little success.  My own guesses seem to
have been the most accurate to date.  / 5-20-83
Development was spent mostly formatting the current list that I've made
and weeding out products that should be removed.  Currently I am waiting
for Virgil to finish going over the list.  In the mean-time I'm securing
additional information on many of the products.  / 5-27-83

Mostly leg-work: Gathering info from various TYMCOM-X directories to
be added to the list as convertable or desireable software tools.
Most of the time was spent in chopping down a list of 40-60 pages
into about 16 - at least half of which can be pitched STILL.  / 6-17-83
Did a lot of scrounging & researching for various products on tymcom-x
with almost nothing additional done on the tops-20 standard list.  Most
of the week was spent doing this.  / 6-24-83
Three days spent entirely on the product list.  Sprucing up the items
in the TYMCOM-X list and adding one-liners to both TYMCOM-X and the
TOPS-20 lists.  Started Vivian on comparing items from both lists to
see if they are indeed the same products.  Should have one-liners for
all of the items sometime this week.  / 7-01-83
Singled out the things which appear on both the TOPS-20 list and the
Tymcom-X list for comparison.  Had Vivian do most of this with some
help from me.  Worked some more on one-line descriptions.  / 7-08-83
Finished One-liners and printed current lists for distribution.  / 7-15-83
Distributed lists to group members for comment.  / 7-22-83
Spent time discussing the progress of the TYMCOM-X database that Brian
is working on and what parts of the TOPS-20 database will and won't fit
the current structure.  / 7-29-83
Met with Brian and discussed what he had done with the database he
is moving from system 36 et al, and how my product list could be read
in for further revision later.  / 8-05-83

Consulted with Ken - my ideas and implementation of a buffering
mechanism which pages everything into memory (when needed) allowing
editing of any-size files.  / 6-03-83
Two hours consulting and thinking over the things discussed about
paging and redisplay differences in PEAK/VUE and version 2 of both
programs.  / 6-17-83
Miscellanenous consulting discussion on strategies for initial
development of mapping algorithm.  / 7-01-83

  1310  Investigate BLOCKIO problem   

Talked to Bill Soley; Bill Frickel; John Thompson and Peter Ng about
what was known about the BIONIC/BLOCK-IO problem.  I still need to
check with someone in NTD to determine what translations are done in
the Varian HSA from EBCDIC to Ascii before anything conclusive can be
determined.  More later.  / 7-08-83
Wrote software to compare data from bad transmissions to determine the
exact nature of the errors.  Investigated the way the network interfaces
with the HSA and how the monitor interfaces with the users buffer.
Installed a monitor patch on system 54 to track potential errors to
determine whether it is a base or host problem.  / 7-15-83
Worked up a newer patch which took into account that the CACHE needed
to be validated BEFORE the i/o request was passed to the base.  Tested

the patch when system 54 was recycled on thursday morning.  Recieved
10 hits and decided to rework the patch again to collect more info
about the affected user's job.  Installed the patch in both the running
monitor and SYSTEM.SAV and tested the running patch with a faked error.
Now waiting for more data.  / 7-22-83
Reworked the monitor patch to gather MORE info and to check all the
known possibilities for error between the base and the monitor as
well as the monitor and it's calling programs.
Revamped parts of BIONIC to facilitate the logging section which was
added for searching down the cause of our grief in this matter.
Had to re-do part of BIONIC becuase P034/K doesn't have .CHVMP in it's
meager repertoire of paging calls.
Contacted the appropriate people in order to put a TEST version of
BIONIC on SYS on system 54.
Installed BIONIC on SYS and put transmittal paperwork on Ed Imsland's
desk with copies to myself and Adele.  / 7-29-83
Spent another round patching system 54 attempting to record ONLY solid
errors of the type we suspect.  With the cache OFF we've recorded ONE
good hit.  With the cache ON many false hits have been recorded without
any reasonable explanation.  I've reworked the patch again with little
success.  My last revision now waits until after the data has been
given to the user before comparing it against my pattern.  More later.
Dan Upthegrove has found somthing to check in the base, but as yet
neither he nor I have anything conclusive.  (Maybe it's hardware?)  / 8-05-83

  1311  TOPS-20 Stream Scanner        

Finished the initial proposal memo for Adele.  Started to investigate
some implementation details and provided documentation to Vivian as to
the things still needing clarification.  Hope to have the initial
scoping out of the SCHEMA and relations within a week.  More later.  / 7-08-83
Investigated various things needed to read binary files including
sixbit and various byte sized integers.  Gave Vivian a learning project
to read data from a TYMCOM-X SPOOL.GDF file into a TOPS-20 relation.
                                                                     / 7-15-83
Worked with Vivian on alternatives and plans regarding the encoding
of SIXBIT data into the relations, the record formats in actsym and
what type of things we want to do with the data.  / 7-22-83
