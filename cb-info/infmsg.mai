I updated the INFO tree to have more information on RPG.  In particular, people
in the MACRO class were interested in the CTEST command, which is now a menu
option under the RPG keyword.  The list is complete, although the descriptions
are not.

Subject: FDM v0.7 (???) 

    What is the intent of FDM's design with regard to multiple instances of
    the same file, as regards the WRITE command?  Version 0.7 seems to romp
    sequentially through the FDM file and write all of them, making all but
    the last write useless.

    Fortunately, this is in some sense what I needed, but it also seems to
    make the n-1 preceding instances invisible.  Maybe there is something I
    can say, some primitive dance I can perform, etc.

When I rebuilt the INFO tree, it could not find (M33)GFD.INF or (M33)LOGINN.INF.
We need to decide whether the revision history information should be stored
in (OSU)*.INF, or (MONDOC)*.INF, and then change (INFO)CUSPS.NFO to point to
the right place.  Now that LOGINN.MAC and GFD.MAC have been removed from (M33),
I vote for (OSU)LOGINN.INF and (OSU)GFD.INF so that the INF file is in the

Subject: MFDSCN 

I won't go into much detail... but (SAILIB)MFDSCN is the stuff that
I told you about.  There are a bunch of programs that I've put together
that use it.  It's much cleaner than the hack in EXTEND which is shown
in INFO on system 33 (I think!).

FINDIT in (CB-SAIL) is probably the best example using just the data
       returned from the .CHUFD CHANIO call.
UNIQUE in (CARL) also uses the .CHUFD data in a slightly different
       way.  First making a list, then printing out the results.

there are lots more... however, I will go and make a copy with the
procedures turned into SIMPLE and see if it (a) works and (b) is any
faster.  /Carl

Subject: More MFDSCN 

Look at (CB-SAIL)COUNT.SAI
it is a very "boring" program which uses MFDSCN.
It merely counts all UFD's and all files.

I tried it with "SIMPLE" vs non-"SIM<PLE" and it seems to be
a tiny bit faster on 930.  Two times each, SCOUNT.SAV (slow) was 118
seconds for 45K files, and COUNT (simple) was 117 seconds.

I ran them on 39, and the results across 65.5K files was inconclusive
while I was NOT the only user.  Setting SCHPRV didn't make much of a
difference, although SCOUNT took 3:51.6 and COUNT took 3:38.8 that
time.  I'm having problems with my MODEM dropping chars, so.. till
later...

Subject: 912 modems vs power failures. 

The power flickered many times in Fremont north of Mowry several times last
night.  Each time the power came back on, the model 912 modem I have at home
went into autoanswer - it took the phone "off the hook".  This is usually not
too bad, execpt that it did not hang up after 30 seconds like it was supposed
to.  As a result, the line was kept busy and PAC BELL sent nasty warning tones
on the line.  The model 912 is the only modem I have seen to be untrustworthy,
and should be unplugged when the power is unsteady.

If you don't use autoanswer on your 912, you can disable it with one of
the switches inside and that should eliminate the problem.  You should also
have it strapped to disconnect on false data-terminal-ready which it would
not normally get unless its in use.  -Bill

Subject: TYMSHARE's EDDT won't run on a KL with the MCA-25 upgrade. 

Any program that attempts to determine whether it is running on a KL versus
a KS by looking at the APRID (CPU serial number) won't work on KLs that have
the MCA-25 cache/pager upgrade.  For instance, EDDT does:

	APRID 17
	TRNE  17,10000
	JRST  KS

On the KL, bit 23 is one of the hardware options, it is set if the MCA-25
upgrade is installed.

The only reliable way to distinguish the two processors is to use the example
in the System Reference manual.  That is:

	MOVEI	2,777777	;High-order part of a 72-bit number
	SETZB	3,5		;Clear byte pointer, string is 0 bytes long
	MOVEI	4,1		;Set double length binary result
	EXTEND	1,[CVTBDO]	;Attempt to convert binary to decimal string
	TLNN	4,200000	;This bit is set by a deliberate bug in KL
	JRST	KS		;KS and later DEC processors do not set 200000

  Maybe, a count can be passed so you can get only those fields that

Subject: USRFLT+3 really means "PC out of bounds", page 0 not in null job. 

If you do "START 147" and the processor was running the null job and you do
not reset the CPU first, the system will die at USRFLT+3=PFLLDC since the
processor is restarted in user mode, with the PC pointing to user page 0, and
the null job does not have the accessabile bit set for page zero.  It is
possible that all USRFLT+3 stopcodes occured as a result of the operator
trying to get to BOOTS by restarting at 147.  I say this because it occurs
fairly reliably on the KS, and for some of the dumps on D31, CRSHID reported
that the crash code was executed twice.  After P is out, we need to move the
test for page fault in the null job to a different location, earlier in the
code.  

The 147 restart only works if you reset the CPU so that it is in EXEC mode.
For the F3 and KI, both STOP and RESET must be toggled.  For the KS, the
command "KS10>SM" must be given to restart the microcode in EXEC mode.
(I'm not sure what is needed for the KL.)

    I think it was a wise decision to do the table by hand, and the

I fixed the version of EDDT in M33 to work with all KL-10s.  The monitor
built from OSP will work with the MCA-25, as long as you don't try to use EDDT.

To repeat: It is OK to use the CPU serial number to distinguish the KS from the
KL provided that you get the CPU serial number via GETTAB.  It is not OK to
use APRID to distinguish the two processors because APRID returns a bunch of
bits in addition to the CPU serial number.  For programs that run in EXEC mode
on all CPUs (such as EDDT), the only distinguishing feature is that the KL
returns different data on EXTEND[CVTBDO].

frame on a .FOCFM call.  We plan to allow license to be passed or
raised/lowered using the .FOWFA/.FOXFA calls (that is assuming that if
I have license, I can give it to my children, or take it away at my
leisure -has to also modify JBTSLC(J)- and need not give it to them all
at once if I choose not).
  Please comment, or save your comments till lunch on Friday.  My belief
is that you and I are the only ones doing anything with .FOCFM at the
moment.  This will affect: PCOM, XEXEC and programs using "our" FRMRUN
routine.  (FRMRUN can easily be changed to do .FOCFM,.FOWFA)...

I understand why you want to be able to pass/change it seperate from CREFRM,
but I don't understand why you want to change CREFRM.  The only comment I
have is that this should require .arSFL: set frame license access rights.
This would be a new access right with the criteria copied from .arVAW:
virtual address write.  It must be that restrictive because you can really
manipulate a running program by taking away and bestowing license at the
right times.  Effectively, this would require WC license to change the
license on a frame that wasn't "clear".  -Bill

It seems reasonable to require .arSFL and WC to change license on a frame
that isn't "clear".  However, "clear" needs some definition... if we're
at normal-program-exit, or error-exit-with-jerr-set the paren should be
able to change the license (.arSFL).  If the frame is running, then WC is
needed 'cause the child could show symptoms like cerebral palsy otherwise.

The reason we're thinking of removing license passing from .FOCFM is to
make LOGIN ac, and FRMOP ac[.FOCFM], consistant with each other.  They
each have their own idiosyncrasies at the moment, and in each case it
really is unclear what is happenning... i.e. LOGIN ac,: should error ret
if part of a project is specified, right now it just ignores project...
.FOCFM doesn't make it clear if LICENSE is part of the "count" or not,
regardless if CF.LIC is set..., defaulting license doesn't work, etc...

When the dust settles, they may even have some common code... so that
.FOCFM with CF.LOG (run LOGINN) will work properly, in the same ways.
...more on this later...  /Carl

Subject: STMAKE confusion? 

Well it's pretty difficult to remember these things when so little is
getting done these days with SAIL...  STMAKE was a routine that the old
DYNSTR routine called.  CONSTR made a "constant" pointer to a string and
the DYNSTR routine made a string copy.

The last release of SAIL, with variable width strings provided STMAKE as
a runtime call to replace the DYNSTR routine...
   "stringCopy" _ STMAKE( BytePointer, Len, ByteSize(0) );

IT's been there all along, and noone but PCOM (PCOINT) and Scott have
ever really used it... sigh!

    Carl,

    Consider the following:

        !do fdm

        FDM> o stat

        !

    STAT, it turns out, is a real file having nothing to do with FDM.  The
    probem appears to be that it found the wrong file and then didn't like
    the fact that it was the wrong file - in a major way.  PCOM does this
    too, finding the wrong file, favoring no extension to the logical
    default extension.  It seems like an easy fix. If you want to specify
    no extension, you say "STAT.".

They are not detectable.... i.e.   DATA-CR-DATA-CR-LF  looks like
                                     DATA-DATA-CR-LF  (I think).
You'll have to try it yourself to be sure.  If I detect a CR just
prior to an EOL then VMGETC(S,VM$ECR)='15 else it =0.  The way this
is implemented is that I ignore CRs all the time as a character.  If
I see one, I set a flag.  At eol I return whatever is available.  If
I see any other character, I clear the flag (going forwards) and don't
do anything going backward.  So, DATA-CR-DATA-LF going backward will
appear as the same as DATA-DATA-CR-LF  and forward as DATA-DATA-LF.
{sigh}.

I think this is how it works... the solution is to not do overstriking
and all works fine.  For normal source files, there isn't any kind
of problem.  Only for funny DDT and other files would there be a problem.

Well, I decided that I needed the capability to WRITE files using my new

  Slot_ VMFILE( StringFilename, AccessMode(0) )
	where access mode is [0]=Read,[1]=Write-single-access,[2]=Update-
	single access,[3]=Multiple-update.

  Bool_ VMTEXT( Slot, StringTextMessage )
	where text message can be any length sail will accept.  it may
	just as well be multiple lines. It works! great! even!

  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$Msg )      ::= # of text messages ending with ^D
  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$MSize )    ::= # of text messages in file ... ^D
  Value_ VMGETC( Slot, VM$Access )   ::= Access mode used by VMFILE call.

  Line_ VMLINE( Slot, Break, Dir(0) )
	such that ^D is now included in the class of "line-break" characters
	and a text messge of L1<crlf>L2<crlf><^D> is 3 lines long and one
	message long.  I've thought that it might be nice to allow ^D to go
	away and use the old behavior, but I can't imagine anyone who would
	want ^D as a text charcter, so unless you demand a way to make it
	a transparent character again... sigh!

Subject: VMFILE release! 

Ken,
  While finishing up the last set of things for VMFILE, I undertook
the task of the lone Carriage-return!  The way it's setup to work...

    Text_ VMLine( Slot, EolBreak, Direction(default=0) )

    Text      contains the line of data, or null for blank lines.

    EolBreak  contains #LF for normal lines, #FF for page marks,
              #VT if present, #EOT (^D) if present for message texts,
              #CR if a carriage-return was seen without a #LF, or
              #NUL (^@ or 0) if at the end of file.

    To check to see if the line was terminated by a CRLF, or CRFF, or
    CRVT the value returned by VMGetC(slot,VM$ECR) will have a #CR if
    seen, otherwise will be 0.

    To determine if at the end of file, Text must be null and EolBreak
    must contain a 0, otherwise there may be a string in Text without
    a valid end-of-line when at the end, or you may have a blank line.

It seems to work both directions quite well.  I'm not sure if it keeps
track of the message or page counts correctly, but I think it does now.
Let me know if you find any problems.

    I presume you got the mail about VMTEXT, so I won't repeat myself.
    Feel free to give me a call, whenever to talk about it.  Although,
    I may be unavailable for parts of tomorrow, since it so  "happens"

  Only one that I can think of off the top of my head is (NEWFDM)VMCOPY.SAI
which uses V-MOVE-Page in routine VMCOPY @ block "go with it" in block
"write out the pages".  It's pretty simple...

   It uses an array PUT[0:1]...
        PUT[0]_ !Xwd( Count,First-Mem-Page );
        PUT[1]_ First-File-Page,              or  -1  if want to add pages
                                                      on the end of the file.
        CHNIOR( Chan, PUT[0], !CHVMP );       where !CHVMP == '47

   File must be open for write/update access, and I think that's all there
   is to using it.  There is no indication in ernie's notes or darren's
   notes that using -1 will return the page number last used...  I haven't
   looked at the monitor for it since VMCOPY doesn't need to know...
 
Need anything else, let me know.  Also, (YAMM:33,35?) may have something?

After reading your mail and checking the code, I guess I saw that I left
in the code which looked for files in your AUN if you didn't specify any
username.  Since 
all my testing was in my directory, i never noticed it.

I've put in code which expects to run on a P034/P or later monitor.  We
added a few GETTABS which are nice.  '30 & '31 which are DEC's username
table entries,  *** OOPS *** well, P034/P01 and later?, I'll check ***
and we store the GFD username there instead.  (In one version, we just
make these point to .GTUNM & .GTUN1, maybe /P maybe not).  Anyway, when
you GFD someplace the monitor puts the GFD username in these locations and
only "MAGIC" programs can somehow set these to 0.

Anyway, if no usrername is passed, I read these GETTAB entries.  It works
correctly on 930, even if it doesn't work elsewhere YET!  As soon as the
next monitor goes out, it will work everywhere, since that shouldn't take
too too long, 'cause it is needed everywhere for my new PERP to work...
/Carl

Also, VMFREE now takes a second argument, added so I can use VMFREE to
rename (delete) a file I've been writing.  The second argument is labeled
BITS and if -1 will delete a file that was open for writing/update/etc,
and any other non-zero value will be used as bits to the CLOSE uuo.  BUT,
the only useful bits are things to ignore access and such, 'cause just
closing the input or output side will have unfortunate effects since the
next uuo in sequence is a RELEASE!

Subject: concatenation & PUT.SAI 

    It seems that the remaining nulls were due to instances of the
    concatenation of your NULL into the resulting string.  My solution is
    to only append "Tmp" and "Brk" onto the result when they are nonzero;
    and this seems adequate to remove spurious nulls from the output.  Is
    something askew in SAIL?

    Exactly which parameters of my redundant printer is Type interested in?
    Some samples follow:

        ESC & "A1"        Direct the ensuing data traffic to the printer
        ESC & "A0"        Direct the ensuing data traffic to the terminal
        ESC & "Q"         Set 16.5 horizontal pitch
        ESC & "E"         Set 12.0 horizontal pitch
        ESC & "N"         Set 10.0 horizontal pitch
        ESC & "P"         Set "proportional" horizontal pitch

    Each time I embark on a new development project with the monolithic
    MFDSCN iterator routines, I ask myself "whatever happened to the
    'get-first/get-next' paradigm for iterating through wildcard specs?".
    This time I thought I'd ask you as well.  No doubt there was a very
    particular reason why you took the approach you did, but I find that as
    I increment the design of PUT to the next step (adding wildcard
    support), I must totally redesign my mainline code.  I know I'm
    probably being dense, but I'd like to know.

Sigh... is there really that much redesign?  Think of the calls that
you setup as "WHILE (ANY-FILES-MATCHING-SPEC) DO FILE-PROC" with the
UFD-PROC as an invisible filter...

By the way, I didn't design it the way it is... DWS did it and called it
FILSCN which Adele had me look at it and speed it up, which I did.  Anyway
the idea is sound... but the general case most people only want the two
procedures, UFDPROC, FILEPROC and for single directories, only FILEPROC
has any meaning.  I wish you could OMIT procedures... HMMMMMM... you can
have default arguments, I wonder if you can have default procedures, and
put the procedures it uses inside MFDSCN?   HMMMMM....

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 18 Nov 85 12:29:41 PST

Ken,
  I've located the lobotomized sources to TYPE and was interested in adding
your SCANSET printer.  I'd swear that you sent me something on paper, but I
was unable to find it the other day when I left the office.

  I located a SCANSET 410 & 415 manual and what it says conflicts with what
you sent me in the messafge I am replying to.  Also, I am unclear to your
meaning:  e.g.
            ESC & "A1"  direct the ensuing data traffic to the printer

is this:  ESC & A 1   or is it  ESC A 1  ???  I will assume it is the former.
                                              since ESC & x x certainly will
                                              cause a HP26xx terminal grief.

The manual I have says nothing of pitch, but says that...
  ESC ; 0     Close printer port
  ESC ; 1     Open printer port, no char display, trap commands
  ESC ; 2     Open printer port, dispaly characters
  ESC ; 3     PRINT SCREEN
  ESC ; 4     Open printer port, transparent display until ESC ; 0 seen

I'd like to add /DEVICE:SCANSET but I think I need more info.  I'll get
back to you as soon as you get back to me.

  Augment is taking five (5) F3s out of commission in the next 2 weeks.
Two are scheduled to be sent here in Fremont to be put into storage this
week, and the others will follow sometime next week or so.  I stopped by
and mentioned this to Bill Euske and Gazel Tan yesterday just in case
anyone over there was interested in obtaining TYMCOM-X processing power
for cheap for awhile.  (of course you'd need a monitor and microcode,
but that's about all).

  If you know of anyone, group, etc... let them know about the impending
availability.  There are ONLY 8 F3s left... the 5 aformentioned ones, a
spare for maintenance, system 930 and 897.  If it breaks, there are no
spares for the major CPU components, but lots of spare parts for both
disk and tape drives.

The line from node 3143 has been cut & strung... Dennis Ernst is going
to build us code as node 2770 (same as 2770 connected to 6657!) with
host number 118.  When TYMNET gets around to giving us a new node and
host and line from one of the engines, we will consider reconfiguring
everything.  (Dennis Coffey estimates 3 weeks on that, I'd say a month).

The 2770 code should have been finished friday afternoon.  Just before
I left for the evening, I plugged in the cable to the DxP-11 card in
the NETCON box and realized we needed a cross-over of some sort...  On
Monday (today) we can find the right cross-over, build a monitor, try
to load 2770 and if everything works, build a 2 or 3 pack system.

Subject: getlch and aux ckts 

    First, sorry for getting weird on the phone yesterday.  Please allow me
    to take this opportunity to get weird through the mail:

    My copy of the YAMM, corroborated by (sailib)uuosym.def, says that the
    line characteristics bit indicating auxckt-ness is "1b12".  I wrote a
    little test program which basically does

        seto    1, ;
        ttcall  6, 1;

    and prints the result.  I proceeded to run this program (TST on my
    directory on :930) both when logged in directly and when logged in via
    TAUX from an alien system.  The results were:

        [000040,,000000]        1b12
        [123321,,000014]        Direct login
        [101321,,000015]        TAUX   login

    Note that lc.axc (1b12) is unaffected.  I must be doing something
    wrong.  I know that LOADII kicks your butt if it sees you logged in
    under an auxckt. I wonder how it knows...

Subject: AUX CIRCUIT-ness 

GETLCH bits may or may not reflect reality.  I doubt that anyone has
looked at those in years.  The YAMM is also a bit out of date (no pun
[bit] intended) as under .GTLOG it is documented to use the 1000 bit
of the node number to determine if it's AUX or not... That was based
on the "fact" that all bases were node numbers less than 1000 and all
TYMSATs started at 1000.  When TYMNET-II came about with node numbers
starting at 2000, that story went out the window.  The "real" test of
aux-circuit-ness is to look at the TID byte of .GTLOG/UPTLOG and a 0
value means we have an aux circuit.  (One exception: If the entire
node field of .GTLOG is 0, we are on a PTY and all bets are off).

When I get time, I'll take a look at what sets lc.axc and we'll see if
we can mae it do someting reasonable... sigh.

PS: OK about weirdness... everything seems to be going that way of late.

    What you said is really true.  Thanks for you help.  It just seems that
    I remember you speaking about certain 12-bit node numbers which were
    soon going to become 14-bit node numbers.  Could the two 6-bit parts in
    the .gtlog word be what you were referring to?  As I recall, the whole

I think that "officially" our group is supporting PEAK.  Dennis doesn't

may have just been giving the "party"-line about what our group is still
responsible for supporting.  Your support of PEAK is sort of ERSATZ if you

I monkeyed around with things and although you cannot do a preload or
preset for an ITEM ARRAY, and although SAIL won't let you do something
like "datum(item-array)_ array" you can get by with a little start!code
[see ARGARR in module ARGPAR] which takes the array and stuffs it into
the datum.  Then everythng works as expected!!!  Yippeee!

ARGPAR gets error messages:
  UNTYPED ITEM OR ITEMVAR OUGHT TO BE TYPED.    and
  EXPRESSION NOT LEGAL AS INSTRUCTION ADDRESS
for
  movem '1,datum(dst);

Note: However, SAIL compiles the right code and does the right thing
      in this case, so just ignore the error messages when you compile
      ARGPAR.  The user only loads the .REL file so he never sees this
      problem...

I guess by requiring GOGTAB and some other things it is possible to put
in the right code directly, but I think it's better to let the compiler
do it;'s thing.   Sigh!

The version of PCOM on 70 is old and doesn't implement license

have redeclared MERLIN so you shouldn't need any license.  This

About uploading files from a Rainbow...I'm not a rainbow user,
but I use TYMCOMM which has built in file transfer.  If you just
want to send a text file, it is probably best to use the BIONIC
program on the 10.

	-r bionic
	*run
	INPUT FILE NAME: foo
	READY FOR INPUT
	(send file here, then wait 20 seconds)
	1 RECORDS INPUT
	EXIT
	-

The file won't be echoed, it will be recorded faithfully in the file
you specified.  There is no EOF character, it just waits for 20
seconds without data (so you can use all 128 characters).  It uses
block input and should be faster than anything else (including TUMS).

Still, there is yet a better way - KERMIT.  I don't know if there is
a KERMIT running on the 10 though.  [Carl: what do you use on your
Rainbow for file transfer?]

KERMIT can of course be used by having KERMIT record the output from the
10 into a file.  From the Rainbow, BIONIC sounds like a good idea.  We do
not yet have any KERMIT running on the 10s at the moment.  We don't do
much in the way of transferring back & forth from our rainbows.  Joe Smith
<JMS@C930.Tymnet> will probably eventually get around to making KERMIT for
the PDP-10 work, but not in the next few months.

This looks good.  How do you use ArgArr?
	string array itemvar FOO;
	spreload!with ...; string array FOOA[];
	ArgArr( FOO, location(FOOA) );
(just a guess)

Re: error messages...
Using access(datum...) in the start!code gets rid of one of the
error messages.  One can use 
	require "QA" error!modes;
to get rid of the other, or if you don't mind generating some
useless code,
	integer itemvar X;
	X := dst;
	start!code ...
should get rid of the other, but I didn't check it.

(WRS:930)X.SAI is an example of the routine with the error suppressed.

Subject: PEAK and detach-and-continue-running mode 

    Here's a curious phenomenon:  Several times Lois and I have observed
    detached frames running PEAK in RN state, and on those occasions we
    have wondered at what might be happening to cause said state to be
    induced, since PEAK blocks for input most of the time.  Also several
    times, my colleague Steve Schramm, through treachery on the high
    BUBBNET seas, has wound up with frames in just such a condition.

    Steve asked me today what to do with such a frame, and i advised him to
    attach-escape-continue-and-^L (the off-the-shelf remedy for this type
    of problem).  He said "Oh, but last time i did that I got a bunch of
    's's."  I said, "let me watch."

    We went through the Right Procedure, and lo-and-behold:  gobs and gobs
    of lowercase 's's!!!  It look as if PEAK doesn't know that the command
    port has gone away and somehow gets a continuous stream of characters
    from the port.

    I have the more reasonable "logout-after-timeout" option set, and i've
    never had any problem with crap in an edit that i continued. Any
    insights?

Actually, when the port got "zapped" it really was the node going out-to-lunch
and it seems that when the node does that we see lots of S's or s's sent to the
line.  I had this happen to me the other night... my job kept hanging...
well, the job wasn't hung... TYMNET sent tons of S's to my job, and of course
this keeps the redisplay busy enough that the terminal appeared to be hung.

Anyway, this phenomonon (sp?) has occurred a lot lately.  Also, there seems
to be a lot of times when the nodes seem to "stop" transmitting and merely
breaking the circuit and re-attaching is the only solution.  *sigh*

I don't think PEAK is at fault...  I've seen it happen too much lately, and
as you know, I only use PEAK for aux-circuits and editing my TUMS msgs.  It
happens to me using VUE...

Anyway, it appears the UUOs probably work fine in their present form.  So,
someplace after the data has been placed in the LMA chains and it get's
"pulled" into memory by FILIO or some other entity, a register must be
getting clobberred... maybe even while in the UUO and it's waiting for a
response back from the actual I/O stuff.  Anyway, I followed the UUO part
without finding anything where it "could" go wrong.

U is setup from DEVSUP which contains 0 (if a STR) or the UDB (if a unit).
I'm not clobbering U in the UUO.  STRPPU is used both as a divisor and as
a multiplier to find the right unit or check the highest page on the STR.
UNIPPU is checked if mapping a range of pages (which DSKCLN is not!).  I'm
calling it quits for tonight, will look for a register getting clobbered
in FILIO, PCBIO or SWAMP in the morning...

Things followed out, DSKCHR uuo works [FILUUO], CLOCK1 watchdog on disk

Bill,
  I periodically run SCREAM and ACSCAN to see if anybody has been hacking
around with my name or any other related names.  I tried it recently and
both programs gave me SAIL errors related to index errors in NODE.MAP.
I'm not sure to whom I should be mentionining this, but it does seem to
be a potential problem.

Bill,
  This was updated to handle node numbers > 7777 for SYSTAT and it's
obvious that some programs out there need to be fixed... i.e. SCREAM
and ACSCAN... but the problem probabluy is not in the fact that the
arrays for node numbers is smaller than NODES.MAP, but that there are
people logging in from nodes larger than 7777!

Sources are in MPL:62, STREAM.SAI has the arrays that need to be adjusted.
I didn't do it at the moment, 'cause I think it ought to be re-thought to
decide on using a static array, or fetching the data from a disk file when
needed (after searching a table? depends onthe format of NODES.MAP: If it
is comprehensive, random access is fastest to dsk, otherwise a search will
have to be made anyway, so keep a cache in core).

Someone will get to it... sooner or later, it's too valuable a tool to just
ignore it.  Sigh!

    Carl,

    I was loping through "The collected short works of CAB" this morning,
    when I came across a routine in CVFNAM.SAI which appears to scarf
    channels.  It is CvPPN.  It does an Open(getchan), per the usual lore,
    but it never releases the channel before returning.  I'm not sure, but
    I think this is an error.  At any rate it is at least unclean.  it may
    even account for the funny problems FDM has with file lists and
    successive READ commands.

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?


(Text 16633)------------------------------


[Actually the MAKE LOVE trap is in COMPIL and in the old days when tops20
 exec still had the compil interface in it, you could get the not war
 response on tops20 as well. Although this code has been conditionalled out
for some time it was only with tops20 version 5 that it went alltogether.
A sad day !! To the maintainers of PCL : If goto hell on the dec10 responds
with get stuffed can't we have something like that or better under tops20 ?

    Carl,

    My guess is that the appropriate program (ONTMTP?)  is not being run at
    all on C36, or that Bill has TUMS wired so that B39 is the only host
    doing collection.  The net effect is that I've had mail waiting in
    MDEMS.K/DAWSON since 10:00am 20-March-86 on the IN list, and it shows
    no sign of getting to me.  I aggree with you that it would be nice to
    not have to involve B39 in this transaction, but I prefer to get my
    mail delivered to me.

    Incidentally, one of the items in waiting is the test message I sent
    from Peak@X930, so whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone
    away.

Dennis,
  I tried to setup a SWITCH.INI which did /USERS:(usr1),(usr2)  and found
that SCAN sees the "(" and says aha! a list, strips off the"(" and tries
to process the line.  I mentioned a **caveat** in the .TXT file, just now
on system 62, so if you "took" a copy of the file, it is now changed...

The correct {sigh} way is:

  /USERS:((user1),(user2),...,(userN))         logical enough?
  /USERS:((user1))                             *gasp* but syntactically !

both are correct.  The following is ***WRONG***
  /USERS:(user1),(user2)

Please make a note of this!

Carl -
Strictly speaking, there is no document describing the COPYPC protocol.
It is a subset of the TYMFTP protocol.  There is a document for that.
I can ship that over to 62.  But, you must also send the TXT files, also.
Since they are the only documentation as to the differences between
the two versions.

Carl,

      I'm having trouble with the new LOGON on X62.  I can't get the /SELECT
feature to work for me, and an going to need some other details of the
documentation explained.  Some of the switches (like the TTY switches,
especially) don't have names that I can relate to the TTY commands in the YAMM
with certainty.  AND, the YAMM is not always clear (to me).

      Re. the /SELECT switch:  You might be able to debug my problem, in my
SWITCH.INI (its in DENCOFF:62).  That's also where I have my update of
LOGON.TXT, as LOGON.PUB or LOGON.DOC.  However, I haven't flagged my
questions, and would rather talk to you about it over a paper listing.

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

Carl,

      I took the port numbers out of my SWITCH.INI.  The /SEL switch still
doesn't appear to work.  I don't understand.  Please look.

      I have my SWITCH.INI set up with INFO:(ALL) and NOTIFY:(SET, WARN,
FATAL, ...), so the logged-in user can see what's happening.  I do not have
either AUX/NOAUX or CCL/NOCCL switches set, so you can see it easily through
an A/C, and by running from either an RPG command or an MEXEC command.

Subject: SWITCH.INI format 

Dennis,
  the format of SWITCH.INI in general is as follows:

<begin>
<option-line>
[<additional option-lines>]
<end>

<option-line> ::=  <program-name> <option-switches>       or
<option-line> ::=  <program-name>:<option-name> <option-switches>

<program-name> and <option-name> ::= any identifier, sixbit

<option-switches> ::= any switches or options acceptable by the given program.

Note:  Option switches are defined to fit on a single line... {sigh}.. this
       is sometimes not enough so a continuation scheme was invented to allow
       for lines to cross <crlf> boundaries.  A "-" as the last character of
       the line says to continue on the next line.  For readability, most
       people use "<space><dash>".  Spaces and tabs after the <dash> should
       be omitted (unless comments are provided, however it is unclear as how
       different programs allow comments: See Joe)...

So,  your SWITCH.INI was working ok, however you were getting "extra" switch
option complaints because you had extra spaces on the ends of your lines.
Normally, this is not a problem, but when I added the capability to read
multiple arguments then spaces became a problem.

I could remove the multi-argument capability, since it was there all along
as /set:(tty no crlf,tty defer,tty erase)  or /tty:(no crlf,defer,erase)
and I didn't realize it.  Then the spaces would NOT cause any problems.
However, on /select:xxx:node:...  lines, spaces would still be a problem...

The best solution is to caution SWITCH.INI users to strip spaces or tabs
from the ends of their lines.  Also, /TTY:xxx<tab>xxx fails while the
same switch /TTY:xxx<space>xxx works ok!  {sigh}.

It's a copy of DEFSYS.SAI (perp.sys systems list) made up to look at 3-word

Subject: LOGON. 

Carl,

      I'm beginning to get a handle on LOGON.  I even "know" most of the INFO
switch parameters.  I can't find your printed note.  This is what I believe to
be the parameters (I may not have the full name--if the full one is longer,
please fill in my missing part):

date and time					DAY
user's frame number				FRAME
current user's port number (host port)		PORT
user's terminal's node # and LOGICAL port #	NETWORK   *
monitor version #, date, serial #		--?--
processor type					CPU
pages memory machine has			MEMORY
maximum frames configured for			--?--
maximum ports configured for			--?--
machine's load, as percent maximum 		LOAD
network delay					RESPONSE
machine uptime					UPTIME
count of current users				USERS

* NOTE:  As with the SELECT switch, this NOTIFY parameter is not the user's
CONSAT physical port number, and display of this "port" number would probably
be misleading to users.  (I have assumed that the 3 digit number is the
Tymnet-II "Logical" port number -- I know that such a value is used by
Tymnet-II, and has no relation to physical port number.  I know that SOMEWHERE
the physical port number is available in the network, but I guess the new
E-BUSS Engine slot doesn't pass it to the host.)


      I have a suggestion for a change to the scanner which would make the
user's SWITCH.INI more consistent in format and easier to read:  allow the use
of a comma followed by blank(s) as delimeter between values in a one-line list
of values, in each of the following switches:  /NOTIFY:(<list>) -;
/INFO:(<list>) -; /USERS:(<list>) -; /SET:<list> -; /TTY:<list> -;
/SELECT:<label>:NODE:<list>).

Subject: Port Addressing 

{sigh} Yes, this is exactly what I've been talking about for our CONSAT to
put in each data center so that we may login to the KLINIK lines on our KLs.

JMS:DALLAS.27  or JMS:984.27  etc. ... it would be nice if they could be
username:KLINIK.27  or  :KLINIKC.33  :KLINIKF.28  :KLINIKD.25 ???

I've been calling this subhost addressing, similar to :TYMNET/930.4  where
the .4 probably doesn't work... Dennis can give us port numbers on a uNode
if we can give him a host number to assign to it...  eg. :118.4 to use on
a printer port or some such.

I prefer this to KLINIK57 as the usrname....

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 31 Mar 86 15:39:27 PST

We can't use :DALLAS since host numbers are numeric only.  If the CONSAT in
Dallas was host 1234, then we could define a username KLINIKD with a home of
1234.  To get to 25's CTY, we would have to use KLINIKD:.25;KLNIKD-PASSWORD
or JMS:1234.25;JMS-PASSWORD.

Addressable ports are not supported on solo TYMSATs like 3143 and 3146; they
need an ISIS CONSAT.  We could experiment with them by connecting the 2020 to
the micro Engine.  All we need is permission to use node 4605 and get another
host number assigned to it (it currently has kernel host 4079 and accounting
host 18927).  There is an option in the TYM file that will suppress node
generated text messages, such as "please log in:" and "see your rep...", the
documentation is not clear as to whether this affects messages like "error,
type password" and "host down".

It sounds like we should get Validations to assign us 5 more host numbers for
use at Liberty Street.

usernames  which originate   from anywhere,  but Group 0 usernames that
can GO anywhere.  All  my  reports    of    usernames   that  have benn
compromised  in the last  four months were common names. We look pretty
silly complaining   about   Germany's   lack  of  network  security but
continue  to recieve  reports  of monthly  SPUN misuse. I would like to
know if  you intend  to   institute   the  needed   privileged username
controls  or should I  request Don Murtaugh to take on this assignment?
 
   As you  can tell I  am  just a  LITTLE hot  under the collar! If you
think I'm mad  now wait  untill   next  month  when  Bundespost reports
additional  hacker  sessions with privileged usernames. Please respond.

Carl:  I'm not sure Wayne had gotten ahold of you yet on this.  It sounds
like this guy is trying to say they have noticed traffic originating in
Germany with the user name Carl.  [Wayne: is this really what he means?
I'd like to know the originating NODE and HOST numbers and the dates of
whatever he is refering to, and I'm sure Carl would like to as well.]  Have
you noticed any sessions that you don't recognize?  I suspect that this
is a case of "assumed" origination, like perhaps use of a gateway which
is normally used by German traffic, but only restricted by class and group.
Or maybe there are more than one node out there with the same accounting
host number (since they're not validated).  Please keep me informed.  -Bill

Subject: Memo from Jeff... 

Wayne,
  I am concerned about Jeff's memo in as much as it seems to say that
there has been traffic on the network originating in GERMANY using my
username (CARL).  I'd like some clarification...

  As an aside, it is possible that any host on the network that we have
considered "secure" by way of license checking, that we allow to build
circuits could originate traffic under any username, regardless of the
username originally used to access that host.  AUGMENT systems are a
flagrant example of this...  Anyone with AC license on the PDP-10s, etc...

  Bill mentioned that originating host/node numbers and such would be of
great interest, including dates & times.  Also, it might be worth checking
whether the accounting host numbers are duplicated between those here and
any in germany where these circuits seem to originate.

  Lastly, a lot of our traffic originates on our micronet, the node and
internal host numbers don't seem to be recognized by all of the network
software.  We've been re-configuring this over the past few months and
new numbers have popped up here and there...

Subject: TITO does not like P034/P24 

TITO checks to see if the DATUUO is implemented by zeroing the 3-word block
and asking for conversion from day 0 time 0 DEC format to DEC format.  If the
uuo does not skip, then TITO knows that it is running on P011.  Well, it does
not skip.

I am looking into it to see why it gives the error return whenever the date
is less than 372 (12*31 = 31-Dec-64).     /JMS

Subject: FIND version 23 does not put text of matches in output file. 

The command "FIND TARGET1 TARGET2 @MON.CMD/VIEW:10/ONLY" works, output to TTY.
The command "FIND TARGET1 TARGET2 LOG=@MON/VIEW:10/ONLY" does not.  It places
the names of matching files in LOG, in spite of my request for /VIEW, which
should have overridden the default of /SHORT.  It does not accept /LONG.
Therefore I have to resort to:
	FIND
	Target 1: TARGET1
	Target 2: TARGET2
	Target 3:
	Search in: .R LOG
	Search in: .V -10:10
	Search in: .L
	Search in: @MON

Subject: SAIL TSR 

The SAIL CHANIO runtime library procedures do not return the value
from the AC as CALLI and AUXIO do.  The result is no way to check
the error code.  The fix is trivial, just put a
	MOVE 0,3
before the return.  Below is a SAIL version of the routine that does
not bother with polling points, but then I don't think any of the
CHANIO's are interruptable, anyway.  Beware, if you load this as a
library, it won't work with (SYS)SAILOW if its scanned first!  -Bill

Subject: CHANIO garbage. 

Bill,
  I've known about the problem with CHANIOs CHNIOV/CHNIOR for quite
some time.  Your hack  (by the way) won't work.... close but no cigar.
You need to use R1, not R0.  anyway, my simple fix has been to use the
foillowing code:

     CHNIOR( ... )  or  CHNIOV( ... );
     Start!code MOVEM '3,Err End;		! or a macro defined as this ;
     If ( !skip! ) ...  

Err is an integer declared somewhere.... this works fine in any version
of the runtimes, (of course)...

R1 (ac1) is always the return ac!  (except when double/long).
As a fix to the runtimes will probably not be forthcoming for quite some
time, it probably would be best to do the MOVEM '3, ... trick.  It doesn't
really add much to the code.

PS: While on SAIL runtimes, remember that CVFIL works fine, but calls the
same internal routine to read the username "("...")" as for the filename
so "(xxx.yyy)" reads up to a "." and gives an error return 'cause "." is
NOT a ")" or some such error.  Anyway, it's a trivial fix ALSO.... sigh!
PPS: "-" works fine in a username...

Ooops - getting rusty, I guess.  I'll fix my fix.  Beware that if the
runtime gets fixed in the optimum manner, the result won't be in R3 anymore.
This could also happen if you load with some library that needs the fixed
chanio and happens to make it internal "to be nice".  (you can't win)

Host 5 is the 940 net kludge gateway.
There was a problem with the kludge
design (yes - it was designed) that
allowed certain X.25 calls to be built
without password verification.  I guess
this is related.  The problem, I am
told has been fixed.  If none of the
calls were to anything other than host
5 then there is probably no damage or
need for concern.  I will get the details
when I return next week.  -Bill

The problem with SCREAM is simple.  It reads NODES.MAP and puts it into an
array that has a smaller limit.  Easy enough to fix, but noone has had time to
get to it.  Lois did it on one system...  A quick way to get scream to work is
to rename NODES.MAP temporarily.

Subject: SWITCH.INI package 

Please see (SPL:930)SWITCH.REQ, .SAI, .REL for a "small" sail routine
which reads switch.ini in most [sic "all"] it's glory.  It handles
continuation lines ok, but I believe comments in SWITCH.INI may not
work they way DEC expects.

It takes 3 arguments... Name, Option, PPNFlag.  It looks for a line
which starts:
  NAME     or
  NAME:OPTION   (if option is non-null)

and returns the line (or lines) as a single string, continuation lines
concatenated together minus the " -" at the end of the line(s).

See (SPL)WHEN for an example of it's usage. PPNFlag is true if you want
to read from the GFD'd ppn, otherwise it reads from your AUN (I think,
read the code to be sure).  It's a well-behaved program as far as
channels and break-table variables go... sigh.

Subject: Re: Your comment about FILE vs FILE. 

I'd agree that defaults should be defaulted when not specified... but
there is some doubt about when it's specified and when it isn't.  There
is no clear-cut definition about that... i.e.  DIR X  vs  DIR X.*  for
example.  Should both be equivalent?  Sometimes I wish they were and
sometimes I'm glad they're not.  I opt for DIR X  and DIR X.* to mean the
same and if the person says DIR X. then s/he means "X" without a .EXT

When defaulting  to .CTL  or .FDM   what I do, just so people who don't
know any better feel that it's right... I look for X without an extension
and if found, that is used.  Otherwise, I look for X.CTL or X.FDM and if
that's found, I use that.  If it isn't found, I use that anyway... sigh!

If you say OPEN X.  then it should override the ".FDM", although at the
moment I don't know what it does.
