##C#CMD( Append, "      Inserts a file into the master file", C.Read, ["

            This command is used to read a TYMCOM-X file (or list of
            files and insert it (them) into the current FDM master
            file.  The following formats are accepted for this command:

                APPEND file-name
                APPEND file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which
            may contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?).

	    Note:  This is the same as the READ command and is
            included for compatibility with the old FDM program."] )

##C#CMD( Close, "       Closes the current master file", C.Close, ["
            This command closes the current FDM master file and reports
            the current size.  In order to use any of the normal file
            manipulation commands a new master file must be selected.
            The format of this command is:

                CLOSE

            Note:  The FDM master file must be closed using the CLOSE
            command if any DELETE commands are to take effect.  The
            EXIT and QUIT commands do not expunge deleted files."] )

##C#CMD( Delete, "      Deletes the specified file(s)", C.Delete, ["
            This will delete one file (or a list of files) from the
            current FDM master file and print the names of the deleted
            files on the user's terminal.  The files are not actually
            deleted immediately.  They are marked for deletion and are
            only actually deleted when the FDM master file is closed
            using the CLOSE command or automatically closed when a new
            FDM master file is selected with the OPEN command.  The
            acceptable formats for this command are:

                DELETE file-name
                DELETE file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Directory, "   List file attribute information", C.Directory, ["
            This will generate a list of the file attributes for each
            file (or list of files) from the current FDM master file
            and print the information on the user's terminal.  The
            following formats are acceptable for this command:

                DIRECTORY file-name
                DIRECTORY file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Exit, "        Exit from the program", C.Quit, ["
            This is the normal way to return to EXEC level.  If the
            current master file is open, EXIT or QUIT will perform
            the CLOSE function by expunging all deleted FDM files
            (if any) and re-writing the FDM master file to disk.  If
            no changes have been made, the access date will not be
            updated."], #C#Inv )

##C#CMD( Invent, "     Create new internal checksums", C.Invent, ["
            The INVENT command actually re-calculates the internal
            checksum for each specified FDM file entry.  The new
            value is then stored properly in the FDM master file.
            This command should ONLY be used on files created by
            older versions of the FDM program that did not properly
            store the internal checksums for each file."], #C#Inv )

##C#CMD( Quit, "        Exit from the program", C.Quit, ["
            This is the normal way to return to EXEC level.  If the
            current master file is open, EXIT or QUIT will perform
            the CLOSE function by expunging all deleted FDM files
            (if any) and re-writing the FDM master file to disk.  If
            no changes have been made, the access date will not be
            updated."] )

##C#CMD( Open, "        Selects a new master file", C.Open, ["
            This command closes any currently open FDM master file and
            selects a new FDM master file for reading or writing.  The
            OPEN command will also report the current size of each FDM
            master file as it is opened or closed.  The format for the
            command is as follows:

                OPEN master-file

            where master-file is the TYMCOM-X file name to use for
            the current FDM master file."] )

##C#CMD( Prompt, "      Sets the file-name prompting mode", C.Prompt, ["
            This command is used to set the file-name prompting mode
            for the WRITE command.  The command:

                PROMPT ON            (or)
                PROMPT

            will cause the WRITE command to ask for a new filename as
            each file is copied from the FDM master file.  The command:

                PROMPT OFF

            will cause the WRITE command to not ask for a new name as
            each file is copied from the FDM master file."] )

##C#CMD( Read, "        Inserts a file into the master file", C.Read, ["
            This command is used to read a TYMCOM-X file (or list of
            files and insert it (them) into the current FDM master
            file.  The following formats are accepted for this command:

                READ file-name
                READ file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Type, "        Lists a file on the terminal", C.Type, ["
            This command prints a listing of the specified file on
            the user's terminal.  The format of this command is:

                TYPE file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Undelete, "    Restores the specified file(s)", C.Undelete, ["
            This will restore one file (or a list of files) to the
            current FDM master file and print the names of the files
            restored on the user's terminal.  (This command un-marks
            files which have been marked for deletion previously, so
            that they will not be deleted when the FDM master file is
            closed.  The acceptable formats for this command are:

                UNDELETE file-name
                UNDELETE file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Verify, "      Verifies a file's internal checksum", C.Verify, ["
            The VERIFY command does a checksum on each specified file
            (or list of files), compares the result with the stored
            checksum for each file and reports any differences found.
            The acceptable formats for this command are:

                VERIFY file-name
                VERIFY file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )

##C#CMD( Write, "       Copies a file from the master file", C.Write, ["

            This command copies a file (or list of files) from the
            current FDM master file and writes it (them) to the
            specified TYMCOM-X file(s).  The normal mode is to keep
            the same file name as the files are written to disk.  To
            change the name of the files as they are copied, use the
            ""PROMPT ON"" command.  The acceptable formats for this
            command are:

                WRITE file-name
                WRITE file-name,file-name,...,file-name

            where file-name is a single TYMCOM-X file name which may
            contain the wildcard characters (*),(#) and (?)."] )
