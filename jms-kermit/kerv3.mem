The following reflects Kermit-10 version 3(123).

                     New features and changes in Kermit-10
                     -------------------------------------

There have been a number of new features which have been added to Kermit-10.

     1.  The "SET PROMPT xxx" command has been added.

     2.  When running as a user Kermit  (i.e.,  talking  to  a  server),  it  is
         possible  to  access  all  of  the  generic  command  functions (REMOTE
         commands) that were specified in edition 4 of the protocol manual.

     3.  When Kermit-10 is running as a remote Kermit (i.e., transferring over a
         terminal  other than the controlling terminal line), typing a control-A
         will give  a  single  status  line,  typing  a  control-D  will  toggle
         debugging  on or off, and typing a carriage return will force a timeout
         (usually causing a NAK or retransmission).

     4.  There is now a SET SERVER-TIMER command to set the period for  NAKs  to
         be  sent  when  the  server is idle.  If this value is set to zero, the
         server will only send out NAKs if it receives a bad message.   This  is
         useful when the Kermit on the other end cannot clear its buffers.

     5.  It is now possible to assign a terminal other than the jobs controlling
         terminal as the default device for file transfers.  If the logical name
         "KERMIT" is assigned to a terminal, that terminal will be  the  default
         device for all transfer operations (and for the CONNECT command).  This
         acts as if a "SET LINE KERMIT:" command was given upon startup.

     6.  Kermit-10 should now work correctly on non-network systems.

     7.  A few bugs in wild-card file specification processing have been  fixed.
         Kermit-10  should  now  handle  pathological  and  ersatz  device names
         correctly.

     8.  A TAKE command has been added.  Note that a file being  "TAKEn"  cannot
         contain TAKE commands, since OPRPAR does not handle more than one level
         of indirection.

     9.  A DEFINE commands has been added.  This allows macros to be defined for
         collections of setable parameters.  Any items which can be SET with the
         SET command can be used within a macro definition.  Commas are used  to
         separate  parameters.   The  SET  command  can  also  now take multiple
         parameters separated by commas.

    10.  The SET FILE-BYTE-SIZE and SET FILE-WARNING commands have been  changed
         to  SET  FILE BYTE-SIZE and SET FILE WARNING.  This is both to make the
         commands easier to type (SET F B instead of SET FILE-B), and  to  allow
         for  the  new  command  SET FILE NAMING.  The new command specifies how
         file names being sent and received are to  be  treated.   The  possible
         arguments are:

         1.  FULL-FILE-SPECIFICATION - include the device name and path  in  any
             file  name  being  sent.  When receiving a file name, do not do any
             special processing on the name before trying to use it  as  a  file
             name.

         2.  NORMAL-FORM - include only the file name and extension  (no  device
             or path) in any file name being sent.  Convert any non-alphanumeric
             characters to "X".  When receiving a  file  specification,  convert
             any non-alphanumeric characters to "X".

         3.  UNTRANSLATED - include  only  the  file  name  and  extension  when
             sending  a file name, do not change any characters in the file name
             or extension.  When receiving a file specification, do not  do  any
             special processing on the name before trying to use it.


    11.  The KL10 only instructions  (ADJBP's)  have  been  replaced  with  more
         acceptable  ones.   This  should  make  Kermit-10  run on KI10s without
         problems.

    12.  When running as a server Kermit, some of the generic command  functions
         are processed.  The following generic server commands (REMOTE commands)
         are supported in server mode (and as LOCAL commands):

         1.  CWD - Change working directory.  The default path for the job  will
             be  set to the path supplied as an argument.  Any password supplied
             is ignored.  If no arguments are supplied, the default path is  set
             to  that  which  was  in  effect  when  Kermit-10  was started (not
             necessarily the user's PPN).

         2.  DELETE/ERASE - Delete files.  The files specified by the  (possibly
             wildcard)  file  specification supplied as an argument are deleted.
             For each file that matches the file  specification  Kermit-10  will
             reply with the file specification and size of file (in blocks).

         3.  DIRECTORY -  List  directory.   The  files  which  match  the  file
             specification  supplied  as an argument are listed along with their
             size (in blocks) and their creation dates.

         4.  HELP - Give help message.  Kermit-10 will reply with a help message
             indicating  which  server  commands  are  supported,  and  what the
             arguments should be.  Any argument to the HELP command are ignored.

         5.  SPACE - Show disk space usage.  Kermit-10 will reply with a message
             indicating  the  amount  of  space in use and amount remaining with
             respect to logged in and logged out quotas, and  total  free  space
             remaining  on  the  structure.  If no argument is given, the values
             will be listed for all structures for the user's PPN.

         6.  STATUS - Status of Kermit-10.  Kermit-10 will reply with a  message
             that indicates the amount of data that has been sent or received.

         7.  TYPE - Type a file or files.  The file specification  supplied  may
             be wild-carded.


    13.  The LOG command has  been  added  to  support  log  files.   There  are
         currently  two types of log files implemented - SESSION and DEBUG.  The
         SESSION log is used in connection with the CONNECT command to  log  all
         characters which are being typed on the user's terminal.  The DEBUG log
         is used for debugging output (when  debugging  is  enabled).   The  LOG
         DEBUG  command is an alternative to the previous SET DEBUGGING-LOG, but
         does not enable debugging output.  With both types of  log  files,  the
         user  may specify whether the file should supersede an already existing
         file by the same name, or append to it.  Since Kermit-10 only opens the
         file  during  either  a  connect  session  (the  SESSION log) or a file
         transfer transaction (the DEBUG log), it will switch  to  appending  to
         the file after it has initially opened it.


                                 Kermit Sources
                                 ------ -------

The following describes the various source files which make up  Kermit-10.   The
names used are those which are normally used when Kermit-10 is distributed along
with other Kermits.  Before using these files, the "K10" prefix must be  changed
to "KER" (i.e., K10MSG.MAC ==> KERMSG.MAC).  Note that the .BLI files are common
to  Kermit-10,  VAX/VMS  Kermit-32,  and  Pro/Kermit.   In  certain  cases,  the
K10xxx.BLI  files  may  only contain a pointer to the actual file containing the
full source (for example, K10MSG.BLI may say "The complete source may  be  found
in VMSMSG.BLI.").

Common BLISS source modules:

     1.  K10TT.BLI - Common BLISS source for the terminal text  output  support.
         This module produces K10TT.MAC.

     2.  K10GLB.BLI - Common BLISS source for the global storage for K10MSG.BLI.
         This module produces K10GLB.MAC.

     3.  K10MSG.BLI - Common BLISS source  for  the  protocol  handling  module.
         This module produces K10MSG.MAC.

     4.  K10COM.REQ - Common BLISS require file  which  defines  various  common
         parameters.   This  is required by K10MSG.BLI.  This must be renamed to
         KERMSG.BLI.

The following files are specific to Kermit-10:

     1.  K10UNV.MAC -  Definitions  of  common  symbols.   Must  be  renamed  to
         KERUNV.MAC.

     2.  K10MIT.MAC - Command  parser,  basic  support  routines  for  file  and
         terminal I/O.

     3.  K10WLD.MAC - Wild-card file processor (derived from WILD).

     4.  K10SYS.MAC - System interface routines.  This contains system dependent
         routines for K10MSG for handling various server commands.

     5.  K10MSG.MAC - Protocol handling module.  This is  actually  produced  by
         BLISS-36 from K10MSG.BLI.

     6.  K10MSG.MAI - KI10 verison of K10MSG.MAC.  This contains  no  KL10  only
         instructions.

     7.  K10GLB.MAC - Global storage used by the message processing.

     8.  K10ERR.R36 - BLISS-36 require file needed by K10MSG.BLI to  define  the
         error  codes  passed  between  the  protocol  module  and  the  rest of
         Kermit-10.  This file must be renamed to KERERR.R36.

     9.  K10TT.MAC - Terminal text output  support  routines  for  the  protocol
         module.    This   are  used  for  debugging  output  as  well  as  file
         specification and packet number typeout.  This  file  is  generated  by
         BLISS-36 from K10TT.BLI.

    10.  K10TT.MAI - KI10 version of K10TT.MAC.

    11.  K10MIT.RNH - RUNOFF (DSR) source for Kermit-10 help file.

    12.  K10MIT.HLP - Help file for Kermit-10.  This is formatted for the OPRPAR
         help subroutine.

    13.  K10MIT.CCL - Command file for Link-10 to load Kermit-10.

The following files are included only if the distribution  path  supported  full
36-bit binary files.

     1.  K10MIT.EXE - Executable version of Kermit-10 for KL10 based systems.

     2.  K10KIT.EXE - Executable version of Kermit-10 for KI10 based systems.
