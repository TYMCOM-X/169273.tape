A command to LINK consists of a  list  of  file  names  with  associated
switches,  terminated  by  the /GO switch.  A command may take up one or
more lines.  LINK uses SCAN,  so  all  of  the  standard  SCAN  features
(indirect files, line continuation, /RUN, /PROTECT, etc.) are available.


Output files are requested by applying the appropriate switch to a  file
name,  either  before  or  after  the  file  name.   An  equals sign may
optionally be used to separate output file names from input file  names,
but does not by itself designate an output file.


The  following  examples  all  load  ONE.REL  and   TWO.REL,   producing
TWELVE.EXE and TWELVE.MAP:

        1.      *TWELVE/SSAVE/MAP=ONE,TWO/GO

        2.      *ONE,TWO
                *TWELVE/SSAVE
                *TWELVE/MAP
                */GO

        3.      */MAP TWELVE=ONE
                *TWO
                *TWELVE/SSAVE/GO


When using LINK's overlay facility, the command format is as follows:

                */OVERLAY
                *file,file,file,file/LINK:ROOT
                */NODE:ROOT file,file,file/LINK:name
                */NODE:name file,file,file/LINK:name
                 . . .
                */GO


The following list summarizes LINK's switches and what they do:

/CORE:decimal            Tells LINK to begin with the  specified  amount
                         of  memory.   This can speed loading by cutting
                         down LINK's memory management overhead.

                         SIMULA

/DEBUG:keyword           Loads a debugger and starts it executing.  This
                         switch  also  turns  on /LOCALS and /SYMSEG:LOW
                         for the remainder of the load.  Keywords:
                         COBDDT                  COBOL

                         SIMULA

/DEFAULT:keyword         Changes LINK's defaults for  missing  parts  of
                         file  specs, or sets file specific switches for
                         the remainder of the load.  Keywords:
                         INPUT                   OUTPUT

/DEFINE:name:decimal     Defines a global symbol.

/ENTRY                   Types all entry points loaded so far.

/ERRORLEVEL:decimal      Allows typeout of messages with  message  level
                         greater  than  or equal to the value specified.
                         Setting this parameter to  less  than  10  will
                         allow  you  to see some extra messages that are
                         normally suppressed.

/ESTIMATE:decimal        Reserves the specified number  of  disk  blocks
                         for the current output file.

/EXCLUDE:name            Prevents the named  module  from  being  loaded
                         from the input file.

/EXECUTE                 Tells LINK to start the program  after  loading
                         is completed.

/FRECOR:decimal          Maintains space between LINK's  internal  areas
                         to  cut  down  on the amount of shuffling done.
                         The default value is 1024.

/FOROTS                  Causes LINK to use the Fortran libraries if F40
                         code is loaded.

/FORSE                   Causes LINK to use the  F40  libraries  if  F40
                         code is loaded.

/GO                      Finish up at the end  of  the  current  command
                         line instead of prompting for another line.

/HASHSIZE:decimal        Sets the mimimum size of LINK's  global  symbol
                         hash  table,  to  cut  down  on  the  number of
                         rehashes needed.  The default value is 251.

/INCLUDE:name            Loads the named module from the  current  file,
                         and  tells  LINK to process the file in include
                         mode, so that no other modules get loaded  from
                         the  file  unless  they  are  needed to satisfy
                         undefined globals and the current file is being
                         loaded in library search mode.

/LINK:name               Closes off the current overlay link  and  gives
                         it the specified name.

/LOCALS                  Tells LINK to remember the local  symbols  from
                         all  of the modules in the current file.  These
                         are valuable if you want a map  or  a  runtiime
                         symbol table.

/LOG                     Requests an output file containing a log of the
                         loading process.

                         get put into the log.

/MAP:keyword             Requests a map of  the  program  being  loaded.
                         Keywords:
                         END                     NOW

/MAXCOR:decimal          Tells LINK not to expand its low segment larger
                         than the specified amount during the load.

/MISSING                 Types a list of modules requested by  a  global
                         /INCLUDE that have not yet been seen.

/MIXFOR                  Allows loading of both Fortran and F40 compiled
                         code.

/MTAPE:keyword           Performs a tape operation on the current  input
                         or output magtape.  Keywords:
                         MTBLK                   MTBSF
                         MTBSR                   MTDEC

/NEWPAGE:keyword         Rounds the specified segment  up  to  the  next
                         page boundary.  Keywords:
                         LOW                     HIGH

/NODE:linkid             Tells LINK that the overlay link you are  about
                         to start loading will be a new son of the named
                         link.  linkid may be either  the  name  or  the
                         number of the node.

/NOENTRY:name            Tells  LINK  that  the  named  entry  into  the
                         current  overlay  link  will  not be referenced
                         from other links, thus saving some table  space
                         at runtime.

/NOINCLUDE               Tells LINK not to process the current  file  in
                         include  mode.  This means that the entire file
                         will  be  loaded  unless  you  have   requested
                         library search mode.

/NOINITIAL               Prevents loading LINK's internal  copy  of  the
                         JOBDAT  symbols,  and requests a library search
                         of SYS:JOBDAT.REL at the end of loading if  any
                         undefined globals remain.

/NOLOCAL                 Prevent LINK from remembering any local symbols
                         from the current file.

/NOMIXFOR                Requires that all loaded code be either Fortran
                         or F40, but not both.

/NOREQUESTS:name         Tells  LINK  that  the  named  symbol  that  is
                         referenced  in  the  current  overlay  link but
                         defined  in  other(s)  will  not  actually   be
                         referenced  at runtime.  This saves table space
                         at runtime.

/NOSEARCH                Turns off library search mode for  the  current
                         file.

/NOSTART                 Tells LINK to ignore any start addresses in the
                         current file.

/NOSYMBOL                Tells LINK that you will  not  need  the  local
                         symbols  for  any  module  loaded.  If LINK has
                         already saved some, it throws them away.

/NOSYSLIBRARY:keyword    Prevents the normal search of the named  system
                         library at the end of loading.  Keywords:
                         ANY                     ALGOL
                         BASIC                   BCPL

/REQUEST                 Types a list of unsatisfied external subroutine
                         calls in the current overlay link.

/REQUIRE:name            Generates  a  global  request  for  the   named
                         symbol.

/RESET:linkid            Equivalent   to   /NODE:linkid.     /NODE    is
