     TAPE COMMAND LEVEL IS INDICATED BY SEQUENTIAL NUMBERS AND
THE COLON (:).  EACH TIME A PROMPT NUMBER AND COLON APPEAR, THE
USER MAY ENTER ANY TAPE COMMAND.  EACH TAPE COMMAND ENTRY MUST
BE TERMINATED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.

     ALL TAPE COMMANDS MAY BE SHORTENED TO AS FEW CHARACTERS AS
ARE NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE COMMAND UNIQUELY.  FOR EXAMPLE,
THE PUNCH COMMAND CAN BE SHORTENED TO NO FEWER THAN THE TWO
CHARACTERS PU, TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE PARITY COMMAND.  ALL
EDITING CONTROL CHARACTERS, SUCH AS CONTROL A,Q,W, AND Y, MAY
BE USED TO EDIT TAPE COMMANDS AS THEY ARE ENTERED.

     FOR A SUMMARY OF TAPE CAPABILITIES, TYPE CAPABILITIES

WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH, TYPE HELP AND A CARRIAGE
RETURN.  FOR JUST A LIST OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS, TYPE ? AND
A CARRIAGE RETURN.

     HELP AND ? MAY ALSO BE TYPED WITHIN A COMMAND.  TO OBTAIN
A DETAILED LIST OF VALID ARGUMENTS FOR A COMMAND, WITH DESCRIPTIONS,

*CAPABILITIES*



     TAPE IS A COMPLETE PAPER TAPE HANDLING PACKAGE PROVIDING
THE ABILITY TO READ AND PUNCH PAPER TAPE AND TO CONVERT CHARACTER
CODES BETWEEN INPUT AND OUTPUT.  PAPER TAPE MAY BE READ AND
PUNCHED IN THE USUAL SYMBOLIC FORM OR IN SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE
BINARY FORMS.

     TAPE CONTAINS MANY FEATURES WHICH EXTEND THE CONVENIENCE
AND FLEXIBILITY OF READING, PUNCHING, AND CONVERTING PAPER
TAPE.

 1.  THE USER MAY DEFINE HIS OWN EDITING CHARACTERS TO EDIT
     THE INCOMING DATA DURING SYMBOLIC PAPER TAPE READING.

 2.  A SIMPLE RECOVERY CAN BE MADE IF SYMBOLIC PAPER TAPE
     READING IS INTERRUPTED BY A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION OR OTHER
     EMERGENCY.

 3.  A TITLE OF READABLE TEXT MAY BE PUNCHED AT THE BEGINNING OF A
     PAPER TAPE TO ALLOW THE USER TO IDENTIFY HIS TAPE.

 4.  THE USER MAY SPECIFY THE LENGTH OF BLANK LEADER AND TRAILER
     TO BE PUNCHED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A PAPER TAPE.

 5.  PARITY CHECKING FOR EVEN OR ODD PARITY MAY BE PERFORMED.

 6.  THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND PROVIDES AN EASY, CONVENIENT METHOD
     OF SPECIFYING CODE CONVERSIONS TO BE PERFORMED DURING
     SYMBOLIC READING OR PUNCHING.

 7.  THE REPRESENTATION COMMAND ALLOWS THE USER TO CONVERT
     THE CHARACTERS ON A SYMBOLIC FILE OR PAPER TAPE TO EITHER
     THEIR OCTAL OR DECIMAL ASCII CODES, AND PUNCH THE
     CONVERTED CODES ON PAPER TAPE OR STORE THEM ON A SYMBOLIC
     FILE.  IT ALSO ALLOWS THE USER TO CONVERT A SYMBOLIC FILE OR
     PAPER TAPE CONTAINING OCTAL OR DECIMAL ASCII CODES TO
     A STANDARD SYMBOLIC TAPE OR FILE.

 8.  AN ENTIRE SEQUENCE OF TAPE COMMANDS MAY BE STORED ON A COMMAND
     FILE, WHICH CAN THEN BE EXECUTED USING ONLY ONE SIMPLE
     COMMAND.


     FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON ENTERING TAPE COMMANDS, TYPE
INSTRUCTIONS AND A CARRIAGE RETURN.  FOR A COMPLETE LIST
OF TAPE COMMANDS, WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH, TYPE HELP
AND A CARRIAGE RETURN.  FOR JUST A LIST OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS,
TYPE ? AND A CARRIAGE RETURN.

     HELP AND ? MAY ALSO BE TYPED WITHIN A COMMAND.  TO OBTAIN
A DETAILED LIST OF VALID ARGUMENTS FOR A COMMAND, WITH DESCRIPTIONS,
TYPE HELP AND A CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER THE NAME OF THE COMMAND. FOR
EXAMPLE,

1: TITLE HELP (CARRIAGE RETURN)

TO OBTAIN A LIST OF VALID ARGUMENTS FOR A COMMAND, TYPE ? AND A
CARRIAGE RETURN AFTER THE NAME OF THE COMMAND.  FOR EXAMPLE,

1: TITLE ? (CARRIAGE RETURN)
