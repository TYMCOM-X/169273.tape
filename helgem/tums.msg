         MDISG LISTS A THROUGH D

         INTERCOMPANY PRICING BOARD CHANGES



    Effective  immediately,  the  charter  and  composition  of the
    Intercompany Pricing Board are changed as follows.

    The charter of the Intercompany Pricing Board is to:

    o    Establish  operational  ground  rules  and  procedures  as
         necessary to ensure effective implementation of policy.

    o    Review   and  approve  proposed  changes  to  intercompany
         Pricings.

    o    Review  operation of intercompany pricing policy, Pricings
         and  supporting  systems  and  make recommendations to ISG
         Executive  Management  as  necessary  to  ensure effective
         operation of intercompany pricing policy.

    o    Resolve    issues   relating   to   intercompany   pricing
         including,  when  appropriate,  making  recommendations to
         and obtaining approval of Executive Management.

    o    Interpret  intercompany  pricing policy as required in the
         operational environment.

    o    Determine specific handling of exceptional situations.

    o    Ensure  that decisions reached by the Intercompany Pricing
         Board  are implemented in the organizations represented by
         members of the Board.

    With  the  undersigned  as  Chairman,  the Intercompany Pricing
    Board will include the following representatives:

         Craig, S. L.:                  Payment Systems Co.
        *Donovan, J. R.:                ISG  Marketing and Planning
                                        (ex officio)
         Elbert, J. B.:                 Network Systems Co.
         Freeman, F. R.:                Information      Processing
                                        Center
         Frey, D. J.:                   Manufacturing             &
                                        Engineering Systems Co.

         Johnson, R. W.:                Computer Systems Co.
         Kintsch, H. J.:                Field Service Co.
         Kos, J. J.:                    Health Systems Co.
        *Krone, L. H.:                  ISG     Marketing    Policy
                                        (Alternate Chairman)






             *LeCroy, E. P.:     ISG Finance
             *Mundloch, R. A.:   ISG Finance
              Schenk, R. W.:     Diversified Information Systems Co.
              Schneider, D. A:   Communications Industry Systems Co.
              Vickroy, W. R.:    Information Systems International
             *Wiedenmann, P. W.: ISG Finance (ex officio)

    Those  Pricing  Board  members  indicated  by * are also members of the
    Intercompany   Pricing  Board  Executive  Council.    This  Council  is
    established  to  provide  timely  and  efficient  resolution of pricing
    questions  at  such  times  when  business conditions do not permit the
    assembly  of  the  full  Intercompany  Pricing Board.  The Council will
    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

SUBJ:  Users to validate for LOADII. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following users need to be validated for use of LOADII.  All users
are members of the Tymcom-X Systems unit -- the organization which writes and
maintains the Operating System and utilities for the Tymcom-X hosts.  

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

To:      ISG LISTS LEVEL A-E

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

the position of Manager Contracts-ISG, reporting to me.

Dick's responsibilities in this new position will encompass both

As the final step in the division of responsibilities and personnel 
between the Diversified Controller's and ISG Group Controller's 
organizations, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jerry L. 
Welsh as head of Commercial Contracts Administration for the 
Diversified Controller.

With MDC since 1972, Jerry originally was involved with governmental 
contracting for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company and in 1976 
joined the McAuto Commercial Contracts group.  Subsequently he has 
held a series of positions of increasing responsibility within that 
organization and is well prepared to now assume a leadership role in 
the Diversified Controller's organization coordinating contractual 
activities in support of several Business Units - predominately 
Diversified Information Systems Company.

Jerry replaces Richard G. Hatz who, along with James G. McDaniel, 
will form the Contracts policy and coordination section of the ISG 
Group Controller's organization.

In addition to his existing contract development and negotiating 
team, Jerry will also have the Diversified contracts administrative 
groups in St. Louis and Vienna, Virginia reporting to him.

Please join me in wishing Jerry success in his new assignment.

    CvtDTM seems to return Dat-Times which are one second less than the
Dat-Times which it was passed.  Since my "DISPLAY" routine uses the last
Dat-Time returned by NexTim to be the base during the next trip through
the loop, and NexTim returns the very next occurance past the base date 
which it is supplied, Nextim keeps returning the same date.  

For example:
    If the next dat-time generated is 28-Mar-86 (monday) at 5:00:00 but is
returned as 28-Mar-86 at 4:59:59, this latter date will become the next
base.  When NexTim tries to find the next instance of "EVERY MOND AT 5",
it will again return 28-Mar-86 (monday) at 5:00:00, and so on, ad infinitum.

Conclusion:
     Either you must add the missing second in CvtDTM or I must add it
in "DISPLAY".

     I don't know what your trouble is with SUBMIT.  PARSER.SAI is just some
routines which I took out of SUBMIT and put into a separate file  so that when
I got hard-copy listings of SUBMIT, the listing would not include too much  
junk which never gets changed.  You may have to delete SUBMIT.REL before you
issue "LOAD @SUBMIT".  I could not compile SUBMIT on Tuesday evening because
of the changes you were making in one of the JQUEUE files or something.
     I hope this doesn't mean that I have lost SUBMIT.SAI as it was on
Tuesday evening.

     I successfully backed-up system 62 on 4/30/86 with TITO.  The allfiles
required 10 mag tapes.  The tapes are currently in a box back near the console.
The tapes are labeled and I have prepared a system 62 log, which is on top of
the box with the tapes.
