          TURNUP is a reminder program that can be set up to run when
     logging into a Tymcom-10 system.  A reminder program is like a calendar
     with a list of dates, each followed by message that tells what is
     significant about that day.  Depending on how far in advance your days
     ahead is set (the default is 10 days) the program will print out each
     date and message that falls within that range.  If the date equals
     today's date, the bell on the terminal rings and the reminder is
     printed with *** preceeding it.  It will read in the TURNUP.MSG file
     first, print the reminders and then read in PERM.MSG and print the
     reminders from it, if you set up TURNUP.MSG to do this.  How to do this
     is explained in the following paragraphs.  TURNUP is located on system
     930, in directory (spl).  To run TURNUP automatically when you login you
     need to modify your init file.
     
          TURNUP can be run to read in 2 files, a temporary (TURNUP.MSG) and
     a permanent (PERM.MSG).  Daily things, such as lunches and things to do
     should be stored in TURNUP.MSG.  Permanent items, like birthdays and
     holidays should be kept in PERM.MSG.
     
          To run TURNUP, first create the files TURNUP.MSG and PERM.MSG in
     your directory.  The format for both is the same - the date followed by
     a message where date is of the form "dd mmm".  If the date is only 1
     digit, then only type that digit (it doesn't need a zero before it).
     There is only one date and message allowed per line, i.e.  - 
                       4 NOV - Lunch with Tom Selleck
                       12 NOV - Section meeting 1:30 pm
     The first character has to be a digit, spaces after the date don't
     matter.  The dash is optional too.
     
          TURNUP will also accept 3 commands.  These are denoted by a ":",
     followed by a "d", "u" or "p".  "D" will change the range for how many
     days ahead to print out the messages.  The command line is of the form
     ":d=n", where n is the number of days ahead.  If days ahead wasn't
     specified, the default is 10 days.

          The ":u" command allows TURNUP.MSG to be updated.  Instead of
     editing it by hand, a default date for how many days back from today's
     date is set.  Days back is the same as days ahead.  If neither is speci-
     fied, the default is 10 days (both forward and backwards).  Anything
     occuring before this date is deleted from TURNUP.MSG in order to keep
     it current.  If it is a new year, nothing from the previous year is
     saved.  For example, if it is January 1, and there are dates from Dec-
     ember, all of the old December dates are removed from the file.  
     
         To use the updating feature, TURNUP.MSG should contain ":u".  It
     doesn't matter what line it is placed on.  Then, every time TURNUP
     is run, TURNUP.MSG is automatically updated.  If a date in that file
     is old (before today's date) but still in the range (later than days
     back) then it is saved.  The new file is stored in TURNUP.TMP and then
     renamed back to TURNUP.MSG.



     
          If you choose to use a permanent file, the last line in your
     TURNUP.MSG file should be the command ":  p".  This will read in
     PERM.MSG, which will print out the reminder list, just as it does for
     TURNUP.MSG.  The format for PERM.MSG is the same as for TURNUP.MSG.
     Commands with "d" are allowed, but NO COMMANDS WITH A "p" ARE!  You do
     not have to use ":p" - if you don't you will be returned to the exec
     level when TURNUP is finished.  When PERM.MSG has been read and the
     messages printed, TURNUP is done executing and control returns to the
     exec level.
