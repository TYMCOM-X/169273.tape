  A file system scanner package designed to allow a user to read
  through all or part of the TYMCOM-X disk file system UFD by UFD
  or file by file.  All channel selection and lookup operations
  are handled by the scanner package.
  
  Originally written by Dave W. Smith as FILSCN in September '82 at
  Tymshare, Inc.  This package is still available as (SAILIB)FILSCN.
  Rewritten for speed and clarity by Carl A. Baltrunas in December '82,
  updated in March '83 and August '85.

  This package requires  (SAILIB)MFDSCN  as a library.

  Procedure calls::

  procedure MFDset( integer FileMode ('17),
                            InputBuffers (0),
                            OutputBuffers (0),
                            CountVariable (512) );

  MFDset is used to initialize the file channel passed to the user
  supplied FileProc procedure to UFDscn and MFDscn.  If the user is
  content with the default parameters (File mode='17, no buffers are
  allocated for input and output), then no action need be taken.
  However, this routine is provided for such cases where the user
  needs to customize these parameters.

  procedure UFDscn( integer UFDaun, NameMask, ExtMask, BitMask;
                    boolean procedure WantFile;
                    procedure FileProc );

  UFDscn scans through a single UFD (User File Directory) for a list
  of filenames specified by NameMask, ExtMask and BitMask.  For each
  filename which matches the given masks, UFDscn will call the user
  supplied boolean procedure WantFile, passing it the filename and
  extension.  If WantFile returns true then UFDscn will call the user
  supplied procedure FileProc, passing it the channel on which it is
  openned, the count, break and end of file variables and the long
  lookup block for each file.  If WantFile returns false then UFDscn
  will continue scanning the UFD for additional files.

  procedure MFDscn( integer UFDMask, NameMask, ExtMask, BitMask;
                    boolean procedure WantUFD;
                    procedure UFDProc;
                    boolean procedure WantFile;
                    procedure FileProc );

  MFDscn scans the MFD (Master File Directory) for a list of UFDs
  specified by UFDMask.  For each UFD found MFDscn will call the user
  supplied boolean procedure WantUFD, passing it the AUN of the UFD.
  If WantUFD returns true then MFDscn will call the user supplied
  procedure UFDproc, passing it the channel on which it is openned,
  and the long lookup block for current UFD.  When UFDproc returns,
  MFDscn will optionally call UFDscn (if BitMask is non-zero), so that
  the user may scan the entire file system.  If WantUFD returns false
  then MFDscn will continue scanning the MFD for additional UFDs.

  Note:  The MFD may also contain files which are not UFDs.  If the
  user wishes to process these files, then UFDscn should be called
  using [1,1] for the value of UFDaun.

  UFDaun      is the AUN (Account User Number) of the user to scan.
              The AUN is often referred to as the user's logged-in
              PPN since initially these are always identical.

  NameMask    is the filename mask for the .CHUFD monitor call.  (See
              the YAMM: 8-3, CHANIO function '33).  If all files are
              to be selected then the user should specify a value of
              CVSIX("*") or CVSIX("######").  Sixbit "#" in any given
              character position will wildcard that character in the
              filename.

  ExtMask     is the extension mask for the .CHUFD monitor call.  If
              all files with "any" extension are to be selected then
              the user should specify a value of CVSIX("*") or
              CVSIX("###").  As in NameMask, sixbit "#" in any given
              position is a wildcard.

  BitMask     is a mask which specifies exactly what information will

              be passed to the user supplied procedures WantFile and
              FileProc.  If BitMask is non-zero, for every file which
              matches NameMask and ExtMask, WantFile will be called.
              If BitMask is -1 then the long lookup block and the SAIL
              channel, break and end of file variables will be passed 
              to FileProc when WantFile returns true.  If BitMask is
              not -1 (but is non-zero) then the value of BitMask will
              be interpreted as the "bits" field to the .CHUFD monitor
              call (Yamm: 8-3) and the information returned from that
              call will be passed as the contents of the lookup block.
              "Bits" for the .CHUFD monitor call are as follows:

                 0   suppress wildcarding for file selection
                 1   return the file size in blocks or '777777400000
                 2   return the file license word
                 3   return the file creation time,,date
                 4   return the file status bits (YAMM page 8-4)
                10   return the date and time in DEC format
                     converted to the users current time zone

  WantFile    boolean procedure ( reference integer FileName, FileExt )
              is supplied by the user and takes two parameters.  This
              procedure is used to determine whether a specific file
              should be processed.  If WantFile returns true then the
              user procedure FileProc is called.  Otherwise the scanner
              will continue scanning the current UFD.

  FileProc    procedure ( reference integer Channel, Count, Break, Eof;
                          integer array LookupBlock )
              is supplied by the user and takes five parameters.  This
              is the user's main processing procedure for each file.
              If BitMask is -1 then array LookupBlock contains the long
              lookup block for the file (See Yamm: Table 8-12) and the
              file is opened on Channel in update mode with both input
              and output buffers available to the user.  Count, Break
              and Eof are the SAIL variables from the OPEN statement.
              (See the SAIL manual, section 6.1, page 33, August 1976,
              AI memo AIM-289).  If BitMask not -1 (but is non-zero)
              then the array LookupBlock will contain the data returned
              from the .CHUFD monitor call "and" the file will NOT be
              open or available to the user.  Channel, BreakVar and
              EofVar will not contain any useful information.

  UFDMask     is the filename mask for the .CHUFD monitor call to be
              used by the MFDscn procedure to scan the MFD for each
              UFD.  It has the same format as NameMask.  If all UFDs
              are to be selected then the user should specify a value
              of CVSIX("*") or CVSIX("######").  A sixbit "#" used in
              any character position will wildcard two digits of the
              AUN for that position in the UFD filename.

  WantUFD     boolean procedure ( reference integer AUN )
              is supplied by the user and takes a single parameter.
              This procedure determines whether to process each of the
              UFDs found in the MFD.  If WantUFD returns true then the
              procedure UFDproc is called.  Otherwise MFDscn continues
              scanning the MFD for additional UFDs.

  UFDproc     procedure ( reference integer Channel
                          integer array LookupBlock )
              is supplied by the user and takes two parameters.  This
              procedure is used to perform any function which the user
              wishes using an open UFD channel and the full long lookup
              block for each UFD.  Useful information about usernames
              and disk usage may be found in the UFD lookup block, such
              that the user need not read every file in a UFD.  (See
              YAMM: Table 8-12 for more details).
