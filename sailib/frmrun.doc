FRMRUN Subroutine                                                 Page 1


    This document describes the FRMRUN subroutine which was  designed as
    a general  purpose interface to  allow non-privilaged  user programs
    and procedures  to run another  program without leaving  the current
    program context.   The document is  structured in three  parts:  the
    description  of  the  subroutine and  its  calling  parameters, some
    simple programming examples and an appendix describing  the possible
    returned status codes.

    Description:


        The  FRMRUN  subroutine  will  run  an  arbitrary  program  in a
        temporary frame.  It  is currently available from  user programs
        written  in various supported languages.

        This document describes the  SAIL  version.  For further details
	on other supported languages,  please  read the file distributed 
	with the FORTRAN-10 release of FRMRUN.



FRMRUN Subroutine                                                 Page 2

    SIMPLE INTEGER PROCEDURE
        STATUS := FRMRUN( PROGRAM, FLAGS, CODE, TNAME, TDATA )

    INTEGER STATUS      The status returned from the subroutine.
                        This will be 0 if there were no errors of
                        any kind.  If non-zero, then the error
                        code may be interpreted as described in
                        the appendix.

    STRING PROGRAM      The name of the program to be run.

    INTEGER FLAGS       The options which FRMRUN should use.
                        For the default options, use 0 as the
                        value, otherwise think of each flag as
                        single "bits" which are ORed together.

          CCL    =  1   Start the specified program at the
                        CCL entry point.
          NOPASS =  2   Do not PASS the connected terminal
                        to the other frame.
          NOWAIT =  4   Do not WAIT for the other frame to
                        complete the specified program.
          NOCRLF =  8   Do not add CRLF at the end of the
                        last line of data to be put in the
                        temporary file.
          NOLIC  = 16   Do not pass the user's current license
                        to the other frame.

    REFERENCE INTEGER CODE
                        The error code returned from the program
                        in monitors which support the FAIL EXIT
                        monitor call.
                        This value is only valid when the STATUS
                        returned equals 10402 (FAIL EXIT).

    STRING TNAME        The name to use for the temporary file.
                        This should be a three (3) character name
                        to be used to create the file "xxxNAM.TMP"
                        where "xxx" is the frame number used for
                        the temporary frame and "NAM" is the first
                        three characters of the string used for
                        TNAME.  (If TNAME is null, then a temporary
                        file will not be created).

    STRING TDATA        The data to be written into the temporary
                        file.  This is dependent upon the format
                        required by each individual program which
                        uses the CCL entry mechanism and temporary
                        files.  If TNAME is null, then this data is
                        ignored.

                                  SAIL


    The  SAIL version  of  FRMRUN is  an  INTEGER FUNCTION  which  has a
    slightly different parameter list than the FORTRAN  version.  Status
    is the return value of the function.  (See below).

    Note:  The use of a  defined constant, CCL, to document the  call to
    the PASSWORD program.

       Begin "Frame run example"

               Define !    = "COMMENT";
               Define CRLF = "'15&'12";      ! It's nice to have CR-LF ;
               Define CCL  = 1;              ! Flag to use CCL entry ;

                        else Print("Error status: ",Status,CRLF)
                    end "read error code"
               end "call password"

                               APPENDIX I
                          Status Code Summary




    When control returns  to the user  program after calling  the FRMRUN
    subroutine,  the  value  of  STATUS will  be  0  if  no  errors have
    occurred.  However when an error does occur, the user  can interpret
    the value  of STATUS  as a five  digit decimal  integer of  the form
    XCCTT containing three fields:  X, CC and TT.


    The individual fields are interpreted as follows:

        X     is the error status, ranging from 0 to 3.
        CC    is the halt class, ranging from 00 to 05.
        TT    is the halt type, or the UUO error code.
              The range varies for each error condition.


    For NO ERROR, all values are 0.  (i.e. STATUS is 0).

    For each error condition the following rules apply:

        X = 0 FRMRUN ERROR,     CC contains 0 but TT is as follows:

            TT = 01    Frame halted with no status (usually ^C)
            TT = 02    Could not get temporary file device (DSK)
            TT = 03    Could not create temporary file
            TT = 04    Could not write temporary file
            TT = 05    GETTAB UUO failed (possibly frame logged out)
            TT = 06    HIBER UUO failed
            TT = 07    Illegal file specification used for the name of
                       the program to run

        X = 1 MONITOR HALT,     CC is the class and TT is the type.
                                See page 2-26 of the TYMCOM-X YAMM.

        X = 2 FRMOP UUO ERROR,  CC is 0 and TT is the frmop error code.
                                See page 2-19 of the TYMCOM-X YAMM.

        X = 3 RETACH UUO ERROR, CC is 0 and TT is the retach error code.
                                See page 10-22 of the TYMCOM-X YAMM.



    If the value of STATUS  is 10402, (MONITOR HALT, Class:  Frame Exit,
    Type: Fail Exit),  then the value of  the program error  code (CODE)
    should be interpreted as documented by the individual program.
