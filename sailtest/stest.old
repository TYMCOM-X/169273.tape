BEGIN "TEST"

COMMENT This program is a comprehensive test of new features added to
	SAIL since February, 1972.

 The first section includes features added or modified as of 2-7-72;

COMMENT Item Consistency Check
Be sure that item numbers start at the same place, with or with
	declared items.  First try it with ITEM IT as a declaration, then
	without.  IT should have the value 11.  The NEW should be 11 if IT
	is not declared, else 12;

 END "ITEMVARS";
COMMENT Allocator Test, Comment in Funny Places Test.
Make sure that double-pp request and smaller-than-default
	String-pp request work ok.
  Also (5-12-72) make sure that Comments after declared names
don't foul up the declarations;

COMMENT Forward Procedure Checks
This test made entirely at compile time. The following procedures have
	errors:
  P2 -- FORWARD has too few formals
  P3 -- FORWARD has too many formals
  P4 -- FORWARD has too few formals
  P5 -- FORWARD has too many formals
  P6 -- FORWARD and actual have different names, but types match, OK.
  P7 -- Type mismatch
  P8 -- No FORWARD, no error -- all OK

Enable this test by Truifying the IFC;

COMMENT Binary Operation Tests
This test was designed specifically to test binary operations which
	have two STTEMPs as operands.  However, it is mildly useful
	to check other binary operations as well.  Just watch the
	flashing lights.
;
IF WANT("BINARY TEST") THEN BEGIN "BINARY OPS"

COMMENT Start!Code Opcode Test
All opcodes are now available in START!CODE.
	CALL is the first opcode, and has the value 40.
	INTUUO is the last, with value 723 (SUAI only).
	MOVE is in the middle, with value 200.
Correct compilation of these instructions does not guarantee
  correctness of all opcodes, but it does eliminate systematic error.
This code will not be executed -- just examine it;

 END "OPCODES";
COMMENT Inchwl Test.
INCHWL now stops on ANY activation character, returning that
	character in !SKIP!, not in the string.  It sucks up
	the LF after a CR, returning the CR.
	This test will tell you if it doesn't like you;

COMMENT String-Creation Test
This just runs CAT and friends through their paces. It was designed
	to test the new optimized CAT, CATCHR, CHRCAT, CHRCHR, and to
	make sure that the removal of TOPSTR didn't blow the other
	string-making routines. Sometimes help is requested from the TTY.
     A new test (5-12-72) assures that if SGLIGN(USER) is on, strings are
	aligned on full-word boundaries after concatenation, even if
	optimization must be removed. ;

  These should take very little time, and should always work.
It's just a way to assure that trivial bugs don't creep back in;

  INTEGER I,J, K;
 Comment be sure that NEGAT bug in Loop code is gone;

 Comment type the version number.  Load this with something whose
    Version number't exist, are the same, are not the same;
