                                                           June 20, 1985



	     INITIAL PACKAGING OF SETS OF UTILITY PROGRAMS

	The Utility and Monitor programs can be 'packaged' into sets to
allow easier access to related programs and greater control over
releases to new versions of programs.  The tool for doing so is the
updated FDM program, similar to the one that Software Distribution has
been using for archiving versions of these individual programs and their
related files, such as control files, command files, documentation
files, source code files, object code and compilation log files.

	The procedure for the initial combining of the related files
into packages is as follows:


1.)  The person doing the packaging obtains the names of the programs to
be assembled into a package.  He then determines which are the currently
installed versions of the programs in the package.  If the current
version differs for different hosts, different versions of the package
may need to be installed on the appropriate hosts.  To determine the
current version(s) installed, and if they differ for certain hosts, he
does the following for each component program:

    a.)  He gets the names of the component programs in the package he
is assembling from the file (SYSMAINT:26)PKGING.SET.

    b.)  He runs the (SYSMAINT)TALL program on host 26, to find all
files on all the PDP-10 Tymcom-X hosts with the filename for each of the
programs in the package.  This will allow him to determine the file name
and directory location for the executable binary object code file (.SAV
or .SHR file) in use on each "Tymshare" PDP-10 host, and the name and
location of any source code files and binary files for any recent
transmitted versions and any recent versions under development, for each
of the programs to be in the package.  Searching the other hosts is done
with (MPL)MHX.  (See the section of this manual on "NON-'TYMSHARE' AND
NON-PDP-10 HOSTS".)  (SYSMAINT)TALL is run with the following commands
(user input is in upper case):

	.R (SYSMAINT) TALL
	hosts:  10S
	commands (end with ctrl-D):
	O RF
	<OPER PROGRAM USERNAME>
	<OPER PROGRAM PASSWORD>
	R (SPL) FINDIT
	<FILENAME1>.*,<FILENAME2>.*, . . .,<FILENAMEn>.*
	<CARRIAGE-RETURN>
	<CTRL-D>
	record?  Y
	output file:  <FILESPEC OF FILE TO STORE DATA>
	detach?  Y	(or "N" if he wants to monitor this run)

    c.)  When TALL is finished, he then examines the output file in his
current (GFDed) directory.  He determines which directory on the hosts
contains the current version of the .SAV or .SHR file in use.  He also
determines the host location of all development source code files and
binary files for these programs.



    d.)  He runs (SYSMAINT)TALL (or (MPL)MHX for non-"Tymshare" hosts--
see the non-"Tymshare" section of this manual) to determine the version
number and the checksum for each copy of the program files in use.  this
is done with the following commands (user input is in upper case):


	.R (SYSMAINT) TALL
	hosts:  10S
	commands (end with ctrl-D):
	O RF WF
	<OPER PROGRAM USERNAME>
	<OPER PROGRAM PASSWORD>
	GET (<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE 1>
	VER
	GET (<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE 2>
	VER
	. . .
	GET (<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE n>
	VER
	R CKSUM
	(<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE 1>
	(<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE 2>
	. . .
	(<DIRECTORY>) <FILEID OF PROGRAM FILE n>
	<CARRIAGE RETURN>
	<CTRL-D>
	record?  Y
	output file:  <FILEID OF FILE TO STORE DATA>
	detach?  Y	(or "N" if packager wants to monitor this program run)

    e.)  When TALL is finished he examines the output file in his
current (GFDd) directory, determining the current version numbers of the
program files on the hosts, and that all these files for each program
have the same version number and checksum on all the hosts.  If the
version number is different, he contacts the programmer who wrote the
latest version(s) to determine if it is necessary to leave the older
version rather than the current version on hosts which have it.

    f.)  If the version number is the same but checksums do not match,
this could be because the program was loaded with LINKER rather than
LOADER, or because the program on the hosts with the different
checksum(s) was patched.

To determine the reason for the checksum differences, the packager
obtains the proper source and object code files for the program (see
step 2., below), then he compares the the correct object code file with
the one running on the host.  He TELECOPY's the correct object code to
the host with the .SAV file with the questionable checksum.  When a .SAV
or .SHR is TELECOPY'ed from one host to the other, the copy must be put
in a different directory than the one for the existing copy on that
host, or a different file-id must be used.  After the TELECOPY is
completed he runs the FILCOM program with the DIFFERENCES command.  The
new copy must be deleted when the comparison is finished.

The output of FILCOM is examined to ascertain the reason for the
different checksums.  If the .SAV or .SHR file has been patched, he
contacts the responsible programmer to determine why this change exists.
If this patched version is needed as a separate version on certain


hosts, he will not install it until correct source code has been written
and compiled to reflect the patch.  If an older or different version
must remain on certain hosts, he will create a different package for
archiving and installation on the hosts which require the difference.
Each version is to be installed ONLY on those hosts for which it is
fully correct.

2.)  The person doing the packaging obtains the latest archived files
for each program (sources, compile/load control, command, documentation,
compilation/loading log, object code, etc.  files), and determines
whether these are the correct files for the version of the program in
use on the hosts.  For sample of files needed, see Appendices 4 & 5.

    a.)  He examines the TRABAS data base for the latest transmitted
version of the software.  This is done by setting license and running
the (QASYS)TRABAS program on host 38 (see Appendix 1).  He obtains from
the program's data base:  the version number, the FDM filename, and the
transmittal number for the latest version.

He gets a copy of the most recent transmittal for the program from the
file cabinet of software information (currently the black file cabinet,
filed by program name).  He confirms that the version in this
transmittal corresponds with the latest version number in the TRABAS
data base.  The transmittal should list all the files needed for
creating the executable core image file, and any documentation files.
If all these files are not included in the transmittal he examines
previous transmittals for the program.  They should be filed in the
black file cabinet.  He examines them in reverse version number order,
as listed in TRABAS, for the name of the FDM files which contain the
missing files.

If any needed transmittals are not in the file cabinet, he requests
copies of them from the Software Distribution and Installation Unit,
identifying the transmittals by software name and version number.  An
alternative to getting several copies of transmittals from Software
Distribution (to locate documentation files, for example) is to obtain
the FDM filenames for several of the latest versions of the program, and
have a few of them restored, in the BATCH request to the operator (see
step 2. d., below).  This latter method is not recommended.

    b.)  He confers with members of the staff of the Tymcom-X Software
Support Section who have knowledge of the history of the Monitor and
operating system programs, determining whether the archived version, or
the system file version of the program found in the prior search, is the
latest version and that it is the appropriate version for all Tymcom-X
hosts.  If neither is the current version he determines from the staff
member what is current and where the sources for the current version
are.

    c.)  He examines the ARCHIV data base for the tape numbers of the
archive tapes containing the desired FDM files, and the FDM file
checksums.  This is done by setting license and running (QASYS)ARCHIV on
host 38.  All input must be in upper case.  The commands can be
abbreviated to the first three characters.  ARCHIV is run with the
following commands (user input is in upper case):
	.R (QASYS) ARCHIV
	* LOOKUP
	> FILENAME <FILEID OF FDM FILE1>, ... , <FILEID OF FDM FILEn>
	short form?'  N
	> Q					(to quit the program)



Of the information about the FDM file that the program returns, the
needed information is:  the filename, the transmittal number, the tape
number and the FDM file's checksum (found in the COMMENT line).  The
transmittal number is compared with the transmittal numbers found by the
TRABAS program, and the checksum is compared with that found by the VER
command in the second run of TALL, for double checking that the FDM file
listed by the ARCHIV program is the one desired.

    d.)  For all programs in the package that are current in archives,
he submits a BATCH request to the operator on host 26 or one of the
other PDP-10 hosts in Cupertino, requesting that the correct FDM files
for each program in the package be restored from ARCHIVE tapes to
username TSUCOOP on the Cupertino PDP-10 host.  The PDP-10 hosts in
Cupertino currently are:  22, 26, 29, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 55 and 57.
The BATCH request should include the filename, the archive tape number
and the FDM file's checksum for each file to be restored, and a request
that the operator confirm the checksum of the restored files.  (A sample
BATCH request is in Appendix 2.)  If the current version is not in
archives, he TELECOPYs a copy of the current version to TSUCOOP on the
Cupertino PDP-10 host.

    e.)  For files from archives he extracts the needed component files
from each program's FDM file.  (For running FDM, see Appendix 3.)  He
computes checksums for each component file, and confirms that they are
the same as those listed in the transmittals.  When all needed files are
obtained, he deletes the FDM files for the package from TSUCOOP on the
Cupertino PDP-10 host.

    f.)  He compiles, loads and saves the presumed 'current' version of
each program, in TSUCOOP on the Cupertino PDP-10 host.  This is done
using the .CTL file in the FDM file, if one to do this exists.  He
obtains the .SAV file's checksum, and the version number of the program
.SAV file he just created (by doing the .GET and VER commands on the
program, as in step 1. b., above).

He determines, by comparing the checksums and version numbers for the
executable binary files found in the second run of TALL with those of
the .SAV file just created, whether the binaries are the same.
Differences in the binaries can be caused by linking and loading with a
different loader.  This difference can be found by running the FILCOM
program (with the DIFFER command) on the binaries on the same host (see
step 1. f., above).  The program cannot be transmitted in a package
until these discrepancies are cleared up, and any differences are
corrected.

3.)  The person doing the packaging determines a version number for the
package, for inclusion in the package's documentation file and the
transmittal form.  The package version number will be 5 characters, and
should be in the following form:  "c.vvv".  "c" = the "class" of hosts:
"0" for all hosts, "1" for PDP-10's, "2" for all 2020's, "3" for F3's
only, "4" for domestic 2020's only, "5" for french 2020's, "6" for
PDP-10 KI's only, "7" for PDP-10 KL only, "9" for host 90 only.  "vvv" =
the evolutionary version number for the package for the "class" of
hosts, starting with "000".

	For transmittal purposes, the different classes of Tymcom-X
hosts to be defined to the Software Distribution and Installation
Section are:



	(1.)  Tymshare PDP-10's (currently hosts 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 65, 70,
72, 74 and 79);
	(2.)  CEGI-Tymshare 2020's (currently hosts 59, 60, 83, 92, 170,
184, 264, 301 and 443); and
	(3.)  domestic 2020's (customer hosts, currently hosts 169, 370,
and 1051.

This list does not include CEGI-Tymshare's host 90, which is a French
KL-10; TRW's host (not on Tymnet's public network, but host 33 on
private network TRWNET, requiring transmitting software by sending
tapes); and the two F-3's, hosts 930 and 897.  If the number of F-3's
increases, these hosts may become a class.  Some transmittals will
require listing of specific host numbers, or class names and specific
host numbers.

4.)  He writes an over-view documentation file for the package (for
sample, see Appendix 4).  This documentation file must include the
package name, the package version number, the hosts the version is for,
the package creation date, the names of the archival FDM master file and
the transmittal FDM master file, and the name of the programmer
assembling the package.  It must also list the name of each individual
file contained in the archival FDM master file, the second-level FDM
master file containing the individual file, and a comment about each
file's purpose.  It must also describe the function of each program.  If
any of the files in the second-level FDM files (especially program
documentation files) are not fully current, this documentation file
should say so.

5.)  He uses FDM to assemble two packages:  a package of the files to be
transmitted to the Tymcom-Xs, and a file with overview documentation and
FDM files for each program, for archiving.  (See attached sample,
Appendices 4 & 5).  A complete archive-type FDM file must contain:

	(1.)  the overview documentation file, and
	(2.)  a 'second-level' FDM master file for each included program.

Each program's second level FDM master file must contain each of the
following files that exist for creating the current version of the
program.  If any of the files are used but not updated for the current
version they must be gathered from previous version archives or
directories on the hosts.  The files to be included are:

	(a.)  a control file containing the commands to compile, load and
save the program and all subroutines used, to set licenses and to declare
protection on the '.SAV' file, to delete '.REL" files created, to check
the version number of the '.SAV' file created, and to record checksums
for all files to be included in the .FDM master for the program;
	(b.)  a command file listing all files to be compiled/loaded into
core (for saving as the executable binary file);
	(c.)  a command file listing all files to be included in the
program's .FDM file, for computing checksums;
	(d.)  a file of source code for the main program;
	(e.)  files of all subsidiary sources, including all subroutines,
SAIL declarations needed, etc.;
	(f.)  the executable binary object code file for the program (the
.SAV or .SHR file);
	(g.)  copies of source code files for any previous versions of



the main routine or any subroutines or definition files that have been
changed for this version;
	(h.)  a copy of the log file created by running the control file
used to build the executable binary object code file; 
	(i.)  a copy of the latest (hopefully current) documentation file
for the program--if the ".DOC" file is not completely current it should
start with mention of this fact; and
	(j.)  a copy of any 'inform' (".INF") file describing the changes
incorporated into each version of the program during its history.

Each of these files which exists must be included in the second-level
FDM file for each program included in the package.

(If the source code is in MACRO there are possibly no files for the
program beyond the .MAC source code file (usually one file) and the .SAV
type executable binary file.)

6.)  He creates and sends a Software Transmittal form to the Software
Distribution and Installation Group, requesting transmittal of the
systems package and archiving of the complete archival package (see
sample).  This Software Transmittal Form must be accompanied by a
listing of the directories of the main FDM directory, and the
directories of each contained, second-level FDM file (see Appendix 5),
and a printout of the package overview documentation file (see Appendix
4).

7.)  The naming of packages and their associated files will follow the
following convention:

	a.)  Package names will be comprised of 6 characters reflecting
the package name, followed by ".PKG".  The initial six characters of the
package name should, as much as possible, be mnemonic abbreviations of
the full name of the package, reflecting the general function of the
package's software.  these first six characters must be unique for each
package.  Because the first four characters of these names will be used
in the naming of the package's installation and archival FDM files,
attempt should be made to make these first four characters unique for
each package.

	b.)  The names of the archival and installation FDM files will
be in the following form:
	ppppct.vvv
	where:	ppp = the first four characters of the package name;
		c = the "class" of hosts on which this package of
		software is to run, same as in the package's version number;
		t = the type of FDM file: "A" for archival, "T" for
		transmitting to/installing on the "production" hosts;
		vvv = the evolutionary version number of the package, for
		the particular class of hosts.

	c.)  Package names chosen for the operating system software are:
OPRSYS.PKG - monitor
MONPRC.PKG - monitor invoked procedures
LDCPLX.PKG - load complex
STARTU.PKG - startup package
SESSIO.PKG - session package
ACCTNG.PKG - accounting package
ACCESS.PKG - access package



LICENS.PKG - license package
MSTLIC.PKG - master license package
DSKTAP.PKG - disk/tape transfer package
OPRTLS.PKG - operator tools package
INFORM.PKG - system usage/performance infoon package
COMMAN.PKG - commands package
FILOPS.PKG - file operations package


8.)  The Transmittal Form will be filled in with the following information:

	(line headings:)
Software name:  package name, per convention
OnTyme ID:	OnTytme ID of programmer building package
Version:	package's version number
Language:	language(s) of included software source(s)

9.)  The Transmittal Form must have the following attachments:  (1.)  a
printout of the package's overview documentation file, which is part of
the archival FDM file (see Appendix 5.); and (2.)  a printout of the
output of the FDM Directory command, listing the "second-level" (each
program's) FDM "master" files contained in the archival FDM "master"
file, and the individual files contained in each of these "second-level"
FDM "master" files.



 SEARCHING THE NON-PDP-10 AND NON-"TYMSHARE" HOSTS FOR SYSTEM SOFTWARE.


	The person doing the packaging determines the appropriateness of
transmitting the programs to non-Tymshare-PDP-10 Tymcom-X hosts.  To do
this he does as described for the Tymshare PDP-10 Tymcom-X's, with the
following exceptions:

	When looking for the executable binary files on the various
hosts, he logs in to username SYSMAINT (password:  "CEGI SYS")--instead
of his usual username--on host 26.  SYSMAINT is a valid login username
and OPER username on all the non-Tymshare-PDP-10 hosts.  On these hosts
the EXEC mode is set to PDP10, logout on disconnect is set, no project
name is required, and no INIT file is used.  The line-delete character
is ^U, the character-delete character is ^A without backspace-erase of
deleted characters, and the interrupt character is ^C.  The time
displayed by the host is the host's local time.

	He runs (MPL)MHX, instead of (SYSMAINT)TALL.  In response to the
prompt:  "hosts:", he responds:  "@ALL20S.LST".  This will allow access
to all non-PDP-10 Tymcom-X hosts except host 930, which is included in
the PDP-10 host list accessable with the "10s" command in (SYSMAINT)
TALL.  The hosts in the file (SYSMAINT:26)ALL10S.LST currently are:  
59, 60, 83, 92, 170, 184, 264, 301, 443, 169, 370, 1051, 897 & 90.

	In the commands, to set status, he uses the OPER program with
username "SYSMAINT" and password "CEGI SYS".

	FNDFIL and (SPL)FINDIT do not exist on many of these hosts, so
to get information about the existence of the software on these hosts,
it is necessary to examine likely directories on the hosts.  He gives
the following command set to (MPL)MHX, to be run on each non-PDP-10 host
being examined:

O RF
<OPER username>
<OPER password>   
DIR (directory1) filename1.*, filename2.*,  . . ., filenameN.*<cr>
DIR (directory2) filename1.*, filename2.*,  . . ., filenameN.*<cr>
. . .
DIR (directoryN) filename1.*, filename2.*,  . . ., filenameN.*<cr>
^D

(where each directory is one which is a likely location for the program,
including:  the same directory as the program's "primary" location on
the PDP-10's, SYS, MPL, SPL, etc.; and each filename is the filename of
a program being searched for.)

	If any of the programs are not found, he repeats the search in
other possible directories, to determine for certain whether the
programs are on the non-PDP-10 hosts.  If they are found, he does as
described for the PDP-10's to get the checksums and version numbers for
the programs, except he uses SYSMAINT:26 as the login username, the
(MPL)MHX program, and the "@ALL20S.LST" command to provide (MPL)MHX the
list of hosts.



	He now should know if these hosts currently have the software of
interest, and the programs' version numbers and whether they have been
patched.

	When he has obtained the correct version(s) for these hosts, he
notifies the "Tymshare" customer support people responsible for
supporting the owners/users of these various hosts of the intended
changes.  This is to have the customers' notified of the upgrades
planned and to get their agreement to these upgrades.  The list of
customers, hosts, and appropriate support people is in Appendix 6.
Notification of support people can best be done via Ontyme.  A sample of
a good notification Ontyme message body can be found in Appendix 7.


	The person doing the packaging will do the following to save
unnecessary redundancy when transmitting software to the domestic,
customer 2020's.  He checks the current copy of the executable binary
file of the program on the "production location hosts" (as they are
called on the transmittal form) to determine if they are identical with
the executable binary file created by our reconstruction of the file
from the archived source files.  This checking is done in this way:

	1.)  He determines the size of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts, in memory words (not just in
memory pages).  This is done with the "DIR" command, using the "/WORDS"
switch.

	2.)  He determines the version number of the file built from the
sources and of the files on the production hosts.  This is done with the
two commands: "GET <program name>, and "VER".

	3.)  He determines the checksum of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts.  This is done with the "CKSUM"
command.

	If the size (in memory words), the version number and the
checksum are all identical, it can be assumed that the files are
identical.  If the executable binary file from the production host is
identical to the executable binary file built from sources, transmittal
of the executable binary file to the customer host (such as a domestic
2020) should not be done.



Appendix 1:  (SYSMAINT:26) TRABAS.DOC
----------------------------------------------------------------



			   (QASYS:38) TRABAS

      (A program which lists FDM files for transmitted software.)


	TRABAS is a program in the QASYS directory on host 38.  It
operates on a set of 1022 data base files which contain information
about software distributed to the hosts with the Software transmittal
mechanism.  For the use of the Tymcom-X Support Section the only use of
the program is to examine the data base for the names of FDM files with
the various versions of monitor and utility programs.

	The program is used to examine the data base in this way:

  1.)  Log in to host 38.  Set Read File license.  Type "R (QASYS)
TRABAS".  

  2.)  At TRABAS's asterisk prompt, type "LOOKUP" (all input to the
program must be in upper case.)

  3.)  TRABAS's prompt presented here is a right-arrow (">").  In
response type "RUN".

  4.)  TRABAS responds with a prompt requesting computer type.  Type
"10".

  5.)  TRABAS presents a prompt requesting "SOFTWARE NAME:".  Type the
six character name of the program to be restored from archives.

  6.)  TRABAS prompts for "TRANSMITTAL NO:", "DATE STORED:",
"PROGRAMMER:", and "FDM NAME:".  Respond to each of these with a
carriage return, unless you know the specific transmittal you want.

  7.)  TRABAS provides a list of information about the various versions
of the program which are archived.  This list includes--for each
version--the original host number, the name of the software, the version
number, the transmittal number, the programmer's name, the date of
creation of the FDM file, and the FDM filename.  When this is completed
TRABAS gives the right-arrow prompt.  Respond with "RUN" to look for
additional software information, or "QUIT" to leave the program.

Appendix 3:  (SYSMAINT:26) FDM.DOC
----------------------------------------------------------------



				  FDM

(A program to combine files into one file or extract individual files
from this 'master' file.)


FDM is run on host 26 or the chosen Cupertino PDP-10 host by the command
"R (SYSMAINT) FDM".  The program's prompt is "FDM>".  All commands may
be in either upper or lower case, and may be abbreviated to the first
character.


ACCESSING FDM MASTER FILES:

Any work with/on a FDM master file requires opening the master file.
While in FDM the user can close an opened master file and open another,
but only one file may be open at any one time.

The commands to open and close the master FDM files are, respectively:
"OPEN filename.ext" and "CLOSE".  The file requested in the 'OPEN'
command must reside in the directory in which the programmer is
currently operating, the program cannot accept a directory as part of
the file-id.  


WORKING WITH THE OPENED FDM MASTER FILE:

After a file is opened the normal use of the program is to:
1.)  load files into the FDM master file;
2.)  write the contents of the master file to individual files with
their original names; or
3.)  list a directory of the individual files contained in the master
file.

1.)  Loading a master file:  

The command to write the contents of a discrete file on the system to
the FDM file is "READ file-id" or "APPEND file-id".  The system file
named in 'file-id' is appended to the opened FDM file.


2.)  Writing the contents of the master file to individual system files:

    a.)  The command to extract one file from the FDM master file and
write a copy of that individual file on the host with its original
file-id is "WRITE <fileid>", where <fileid> is the name of the
individual file within the FDM master file.  The program writes the file
to the user's currently GFD'd directory with this (its original)
file-id.  If a file with the same name exists in that directory, it will
be over-written.



    b.)  The command to write all the contents of the FDM master file to
discrete files on the host with their original file-ids is "WRITE" or
"WRITE *.*".  If files with the same file-id as any of the files being
restored from the FDM file exist in the current directory they are
over-written.


3.)  Listing a directory of files contained in the FDM master file is
done with the "DIRECTORY" command.



OTHER COMMANDS OF USE:


1.)  "HELP" prints a list of the program's commands.  "HELP" followed by
the individual command name gives further information about the command
named.

2.)  "QUIT" exits the program and returns user to the EXEC.

SUBJ:	Master License & Disk/Tape Packages

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     In order to provide better support of the operating system,
languages and utilities for systems running Tymcom-XX, we are currently
organizing our software into groups of related programs called
"packages".  These packages are designed to integrate the most current
versions of each of their component programs, so that the installation
of the package will insure each host is kept up to date with new
software releases.

     On 5-Jun-85 the current release of the Master License package
(version 001) and the Disk/Tape package (version 001) will be
distributed to all Tymcom-XX systems.  These packages include the
following programs:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Name:  SETOP.SAV
Old Version:  14
New Version:  20

Comments: 
New version provides greater security.
This version has been on at least one host for 18 months.
This upgrade is only for host 90.
Note that passwords created with this program must conform to new standards.  

The running of SETOP to establish a user's access to the license setting
program, or to change the various licenses he can use, will have one
visible change.  This program will require that any password for the
OPER program thus initialized must conform to a stricter password
standard:  the password will be required to contain at least one
imbedded non-alphabetic character.

Programmer's notes:  changes between versions:
Version 20:
Enforces the new TYMNET password standard of an embedded non-alphabetic
character.  The new Validations psuedo-license is added.
Version 17:
Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.
Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.

Old Version:  3
New Version:  4

Comments:
This version on at least one host for 2 years.  
New password standard enforced.  
This will be installed only on host 90.

The running of OPPS by a user to change his password for the OPER
program will have one visible change:  the new password must conform to
the stricter standard of the imbedded non-alphabetic character.

Program Name:  TITO.SAV
Old Version:  15.13
New Version:  16.3

Comments:
New error messages are provided.
This version on hosts for 2 years.
No changes affect MAGNUM, and larger files can now be stored.
(This version is already on 90 and 184.)

The operator's use of TITO to create back-up tapes of disk files will be
changed slightly:  he will be able to save larger disk files to tape,
and he will receive informational 'error' messages not previously
provided.  These 'error' messages will include notification of the fact
that certain files are:  "FILE NOT DUMPED ....  MARKED DO NOT DUMP."
Certain accounting data files reflecting system use have never been
dumped, because restoral from tape of an older version of these data
files would delete later, valuable accounting data.  The only change is
operator notification of this fact.

Programmer's notes:  changes between versions:
Version 16.2:
This version again changes the code associated with setting the file
"dumped" bit to check the monitor version against P034/K16 to determine
whether to use CLOSE FIL,DMP or to continue using the code installed
in versions 15.14 & 16.1.  [Introduced module GETVER.MAC]

Version 16.1:
This version changes the code associated with setting the file dumped
bit.  The "Exclusive ENTER" was a "no-no".  It cloberred license on
files with more license than most operators have.  Fix was to comment
out the "ENTER".

Version 16.0:
This version fixes the problem TITO had with counting blocks from
zero "0" instead of one "1" for very large files when they had to
extend across three or more tapes.  



Version 15.14:
This version implements the following reliability enhancements:
  o Permit files greater than <1 reel> + 65,536 pages to be stored.
  o Ignore UFDs with GANs greater than 377777.
  o Compare lookup blocks before and after on a STORE ALL CHANGED to
    only set the DUMPED bit if they match, thus preventing truncation.
  o Let OPER know if NSF or BDA set on a file and which one it is.

New error messages:
  o NEW FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.
  o MISSING FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.
  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED DO NOT DUMP.
  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED BAD ON DISK.
