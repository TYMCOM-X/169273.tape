DISK
----

	THE SYSTEM DISK WILL CONTAIN A RESERVED (CONTIGUOUS) FE-FILE
AREA FOR THE 8080 CONSOLE PROCESSOR'S USE.

  TOPS-10 -- [6,2020]KS10FE.BIN

	THIS FE-FILE AREA WILL CONTAIN THE KS-10 MICROCODE, THE SYSTEM
AND DIAGNOSTIC PRE-BOOTS AND BOOTSTRAPS, THE BOOTCHECK 1 MICROCODE,
THE BOOTCHECK 2 DIAGNOSTIC CODE, AND 247 [0-366(8)] FRONT-END
INDIRECT 8080 COMMAND FILES.
 
	THIS AREA WILL BE POINTER TO BY WORDS IN THE HOME BLOCK.  THERE
WILL BE THREE WORDS USED IN THE HOME BLOCK.  WORD 1 PROVIDES THE DISK
ADDRESS OF THE FE-FILE AREA.  WORD 2 PROVIDES THE LENGTH OF THE FE-FILE
AREA.  WORD 3 PROVIDES THE 8080 FORMAT TRACK/CYLINDER/SECTOR ADDRESS.

	THE FIRST PAGE IN THE FE-FILE AREA WILL BE USED AS AN 8080
DIRECTORY TO CONTAIN PHYSICAL DISK ADDRESSES AND LENGTHS FOR THE
ASSOCIATED FILES CONTAINED WITHIN THE REMAINDER OF THE FE-FILE AREA.

	THE POINTER WORDS WILL BE IN THE 8080 TRACK/CYL/SECTOR FORMAT

	THE OUTPUT COMMAND WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS:

	A.	BC1 "FILE".RAM

	B.	CRAM "FILE".RAM

	C.	RAM "FILE".RAM

	D.	MTBOOT "INPUT".EXE AS "MTBOOT".RDI
SMFILE - DECSYSTEM 2020 DIAGNOSTICS FE-FILE PROGRAM

	AN EXAMPLE SET OF COMMANDS NECESSARY TO CREAT THE FRONT-END
FILE SYSTEM ON DISK FOR THE DECSYSTEM 2020:

	@RUN SMFILE
	DECSYSTEM-2020 FE-FILE PROGRAM
	VERSION #.#
	[FOR HELP TYPE "HELP"]
	SMFILE>WRITE SETUP DEV:
	SMFILE>WRITE RESET
	SMFILE>READ KS10.ULD

	DECSYSTEM-2020 FE-FILE PROGRAM
	VERSION #.#
	[FOR HELP TYPE "HELP"
	SMFILE>READ KS10.ULD

	THE FRONT-END INDIRECT FILES CONTAIN FRONT-END MICRO-PROCESSOR
COMMANDS THAT ARE USED AS IF THE USER HAD TYPED THEM DIRECTLY.  SEVERAL

A COMMAND LINE MAY BE UP TO 80 CHARACTERS LONG.  THE INDIRECT FILE MAY
CONTAIN MANY LINES OF COMMANDS WITH THE FILE BEING LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM
OF 2047(10) CHARACTERS.  THE INPUT FILE USED TO CREATE THE FRONT-END
INDIRECT FILE WILL CONTAIN CR/LF PAIRS TO END LINES BUT THESE WILL BE
STRIPPED TO CR ONLY IN THE INDIRECT FILE.

	THE BYTES OF THE INDIRECT FILE WILL BE ARRANGED INTO THE
FOLLOWING FORMAT TO FACILIATE THEIR USE BY THE FRONT-END MICRO-
PROCESSOR:

	   0-3      4-11    12-19    20-27    28-35
	---------------------------------------------
