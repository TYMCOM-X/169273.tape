ABSTRACT for the CSM PLOTTING PACKAGE		       10-Apr-84

    The CSM Plotting Package replaces subroutines PLOT,  SYMBOL,
and  SETABL  in  FORLIB  version  6 or 7.  Output can be sent to
TEKTRONIX terminals, ReGIS devices, or to a compressed plot file
on disk.  The compressed plot file is smaller than DEC's spooled
file by a factor of over 20 to 1.  The plot file can  be  viewed
on  a  graphics  terminal before being sent to the system queue.
SYMBOL.DAT includes 13  fonts,  including  the  Greek  alphabet.
Modifications  to  SPROUT allow it to drive both an XY10 plotter
or  a  Houston  Instruments  plotter  with  a  PTC-6  or  CPS-15
interface.

BACKGROUND HISTORY:

    The CSM Plotting Package was invented out of necessity.  CSM
makes daily  plots of system statistics, showing number of jobs,
core used, idle and overhead time, etc.   Back  when CSM  had  a
KA-10,  all  the  disks  were RP02s and RP03s, and running DEC's
subroutine PLOT to a spooled disk file would  fill  up  an  RP02
rather  quickly.   Therefore Rex Shadrick developed a compressed
plot file, in which delta-X and delta-Y were encoded in  one  or
two  halfwords.  Moves requiring 4400 6-bit bytes are reduced to
a single 36-bit word.  Also included in the  compressed plot are
op-codes  to  control a plotter with 3 pens.  The PLTSPL program
was modified to read the compressed plot  file  and  expand  the
movements to single-increment bytes, which were then sent to the
XY10 plotter interface on the  I/O  bus.   Later  routines  were
added  to  drive  the  TEKTRONIX  4012  graphics terminal, and a
program was written to read a compressed plot file  and  display
it on the TEKTRONIX terminal.

    Another  of  Rex's  improvements  was  to replace subroutine
SYMBOL.  DEC's table of characters had limited  resolution,  and
had to be in core at all times.  A file named SYS:SYMBOL.DAT was
built, and subroutine ISETAB read it into core.  Included in the
file are fonts for italics, olde English, and script writing.

    Rex Shadrick has left CSM; the  package  was  maintained  by
Paul  Treece and Wayne Wall, and is now the responsiblity of Joe
Smith at the CSM Computing Center.

    Major rewrites occurred in December 1981 and August 1982 for
FORTRAN-10  version  6 with TOPS-10 7.01.  Another major rewrite
was done in August  1983  to  handle  character  variables  from
FORTRAN-77  (FORTRAN-10  version 7).  The current version of the
plotting package does not work under TOPS-20, although  the  old
one worked with  FORTRAN-10  version  5  by invoking the TOPS-20
compatibility package.
HARDWARE SUPPORTED:

    Subroutine PLOT can talk directly to a graphics terminal, or
it  can  write  to  a disk file.  The TEK program can be used to
view this disk file, even  on  systems  with  no  plotter.   The
graphics terminals currently supported are:

   TEKTRONIX 4006, 4010, 4014, 4025, and compatible terminals
   VT125, VK100/GIGI, VT240, and PRO-350 ReGIS terminals
   Houston Instruments DMP-4R and DMP-7R ReGIS plotters

The SPROUT program currently supports the following plotters:

   All CALCOMP models connected to an XY10 controller
   Any Houston Instruments plotter on a PTC-6 controller TTY
   Houston Instruments CPS-15 plotter connected to a TTY line

    Subroutine PLOT translates  "CALL  PLOT(X,Y,IC)"  to  18-bit
halfwords  in  the  disk  file.  Subroutine TOLP ("PLOT" spelled
backwards) interprets the disk file, translating  it  back  into
"CALL  PLOT(X,Y,IC)".  For consistency, both the TEK program and
the SPROUT program use the same version of TOLP for reading  the
plot  file.   The TEK program uses these commands to display the
plot on a Tektronix or GIGI terminal, SPROUT uses them to  drive
the plotter controller.



MODULE DESCRIPTIONS:

    The plotting package consists of three  REL  files,  PLTUNV,
SYMBOL,  and  PLOT.   These are combined and placed in FORLIB so
that they are loaded automatically by any  program  needing  the
plot routines.

1.  PLTUNV.REL

    PLTUNV  has  the  universal  definitions  for  the  plotting
package, and it contains the entry points to  all  the  plotting
subroutines.   The  entry  points  consist  of short routines to
check the argument count and types, then jump to alternate entry
points  in the PLOT module.  These short routines allow the user
to replace selected subroutines with dummy routines, and to  use
subroutine  ARGTST  to enable the testing of argument types.  If
enabled, ARGTST will output a message to the user if  a  routine
was  called  with  an INTEGER variable and the routine expects a
REAL variable.  Eventually the routines  in  PLTUNV  will  allow
plots  to  be  made  by  programs  written in ALGOL, PASCAL, and
SITGO.
2.  SYMBOL.REL

    SYMBOL contains  the  routines  to  draw  text  and  special
symbols  on  the plot using a stroke table.  It takes as input a
string of characters (or  a  code  for  a  special  symbol)  and
translates it to CALL PLOT(X,Y,2) and CALL PLOT(X,Y,3).  Because
it uses only the standard calls to PLOT, subroutine  SYMBOL  can
be  used  with  other  plotting  packages  (such  as PLOT-10 and
VERSATEC).

    One of the alternate entry points to  SYMBOL  is  subroutine
SETSYM.    It   reloads   the   stroke   table   from  the  file
SYS:SYSBOL.DAT.  The file currently has 13 tables: 11 fonts  for
the  English  alphabet and 2 fonts for the Greek alphabet.  Each
table has 128 pointers for up  to  32  special  symbols  and  96
printing  ASCII  characters.   The  data consists of delta-X and
delta-Y pairs, with a special value of delta-X  signifying  that
the pen should be up for the next move.

3.  PLOT.REL

    PLOT.REL is divided into seven sections:

A) Entry points that are referred to by PLTUNV.  Routines such
   as SETWIN and FACTOR simply modify the parameters used by
   subroutine PLOT.

B) Subroutine PLOT itself, which handles absolute and relative
   movements, and does all clipping.

C) Subroutine PLOTS, which is responsible for selecting and
   activating one of the device drivers.  Currently there are
   three device drivers, but more may be added in the future.

D) PLTDSK - device driver for creating the compressed disk file
   for the spooler.  The file is used by TEK and/or SPROUT.

E) PLTTEK - device driver for Tektronix terminals.

F) PLTRGS - device driver for devices using the ReGIS protocol.

G) PLTIOD has all the low-level I/O routines and all the system
   dependent calls to the Monitor for TOPS-10.  PLTIOD will
   eventually be able to run under the TOPS-20 as well.
ALGORITHMS:

    The following is a description of  the  algorithms  used  by
subroutine PLOT.

1.  COORDINATES

    Since  this  package  is  derived  from  the  PLOT  routines
supplied  by  DEC and is compatible with PLOT-10 from Tektronix,
it does not use world coordinates and does  not  use  normalized
device  coordinates.   Instead,  it  uses  absolute coordinates,
measured in inches.  That is, CALL PLOT(4.0,3.0,2) says to  move
the  pen to a position 4.0 inches away from the origin in the +X
direction and 3.0 inches from the origin  in  the +Y  direction.
This  is  well  defined on the plotter (which has 400 increments
per inch) and on  the  Tektronix  4012  screen  (which  has  100
addressable  coordinates  per inch).  Unfortunately, there is no
fixed  size  for  the  screen  on  a  GIGI,  therefore  it  uses
semi-normalized  device coordinates, so that the entire vertical
distance corresponds roughly to 11 inches on the plotter.   This
lack of world coordinates causes some confusion when subroutines
FACTOR and ROTATE interact with the plot origin.

    Some   plotting   functions   use   angles.    The    normal
trigonometric  convention  is used, where a zero angle is a line
along the positive X axis and the positive direction for  angles
is  counterclockwise.   Most  routines expect the angle to be in
degrees, the few that expect radians are documented as such.

    The pen plotter's device coordinates are:
X-MIN = 0.0 inches from where plot starts
Y-MIN = 0.0 inches from the bottom perforations on the paper
X-MAX = 11.0 inches for normal paper, 35.0 inches for wide
Y-MAX = no limit - up to length of the paper roll

    The compressed plot file on disk limits are:
X-MIN = 0 increments from start of plot
Y-MIN = 0 increments from start of plot
X-MAX = 32 * 1024 increments (81.92 inches at 400/inch)
Y-MAX = 127 * 1024 increments (327.68 inches at 400/inch)

    The Tektronix 4010 series terminals have 100 coordinates per
inch and an addressable range of 0 to 1023 in both X and Y.  The
physical dimensions of the screen limit  the  viewable  area  to
7.80  by  10.24  inches.  Note that CALL FACTOR(0.7) will reduce
the size of an 11.0 inch tall plot to 7.70 inches to fit on  the
screen.   The 4014 series terminals have a larger screen and can
have a resolution 4 times better than the 4010.

    The GIGI, VT125, VT240, and  other  ReGIS  terminals  use  a
coordinate system of 768 horizontal by 480 vertical.
2.  PLOT FUNCTION CODES

    Subroutine PLOT takes three  arguments;  an  X  value,  a  Y
value,  and  an integer function code.  Function codes 0 and 999
cause special processing, the other function codes translate the
X and Y values to X and Y coordinates and move the pen there.

 0 = Move to (X,Y) and pause the plotter (rarely used).
 1 = Move to (X,Y) with pen up or down (not recommended).
 2 = Move from current position to (X,Y) with pen down.
 3 = Move to (X,Y) with pen up.
 4 = Alter origin so current position is (X,Y).
 5-7  = Same as 1-3 except that X and Y are relative distances.
 8-10 = Polar coordinates, X is radius, Y is angle in degrees.
11-13 = Polar coordinates, X is radius, Y is angle in radians.
 999  = Terminate the plot.
Negative = Do the corresponding positive function, then
     alter the origin so that the current position is (0,0).

3.  ROTATION, TRANSLATION, AND SCALING:

    The following variables are used in transforming the  user's
call to device coordinates:

Xcall,Ycall       = X and Y supplied by the caller
Xnew,Ynew         = X and Y after possible polar conversion
Xprev,Yprev       = Previous values of Xnew, Ynew
Xorigin,Yorigin   = Origin set by CALL PLOT(XORG,YORG,-3)
Xfactor,Yfactor   = Scaling factor set by CALL FACTOR(XFAC,YFAC)
Xrot,Yrot,SIN,COS = Rotation from CALL ROTATE(-1,XROT,YROT,ANG)
Xdev,Ydev         = Coordinates sent to the device driver

Functions 1-3   => Xnew = Xcall
                   Ynew = Ycall

Functions 5-7   => Xnew = Xprev + Xcall
                   Ynew = Yprev + Ycall

Functions 8-10  => Xnew = Xcall * COSD(Ycall)
                   Xcall * SIND(Ycall)

Functions 11-13 => Xnew = Xcall * COS(Ycall)
                   Ynew = Xcall * SIN(Ycall)

After Xnew and Ynew are determined, Xdev and Ydev are calculated

           X1 = (Xnew + Xorigin) * Xfactor
           Y1 = (Ynew + Yorigin) * Yfactor
           X2 = X1*COS(Angle) - Y1*SIN(Angle) + Xrot
           Y2 = Y1*COS(Angle) + X1*SIN(Angle) + Yrot
         Xdev = CLIPX(X2)
         Ydev = CLIPY(Y2)
        Xprev = Xnew      (subroutine WHERE returns Xprev,Yprev)
        Yprev = Ynew
    CLIPX  and  CLIPY  do window clipping based on limits set by
SETWIN, by SUBWIN, or by the hardware limitations,  whichever is
most  restrictive.   Xdev  and  Ydev are then sent to the device
driver.

    Window checking (clipping) is done after scaling,  rotation,
and  translation.   That  is, the  window  boundaries are always
vertical and horizontal, and in absolute inches.

    This algorithm does not use a 3 by 2 transformation  matrix.
Note  that translation is done before scaling, and that there is
an additional translation  done  in  device  coordinates.   This
additional  translation is not affected by the parameters set by
FACTOR and CALL PLOT(Xorigin,Yorigin,-3), so that  it  would  be
possible  to  have the plot package output to two device drivers
simultaneously.   This  latter   feature   is   only   partially
implemented.


4.  CLIPPING

    Subroutine SETWIN(XMAX,YMAX) sets the size  of  the  window.
The  lower left corner of the window is always at the lower left
corner of the paper on the plotter, or the lower left corner  of
the screen on graphics terminals.  The upper right corner of the
window is specified by (XMAX,YMAX).  The actual window  used  by
the   clipping   routines   may   be  smaller  due  to  hardware
or software restrictions.

The variables used by the CHECK routine are:
    OLD.UP        = TRUE if the old position was pen up
    OLD.X,OLD.Y   = Last requested pen position
    OLD.BD        = Flags for boundary status of old position
    NEW.X,NEW.Y   = Requested new pen position
    NEW.BD        = Flags for boundary status of new position
    WMIN.X,WMIN.Y = Left edge and lower edge of window
    WMAX.X,WMAX.Y = Right edge and upper edge of window
    M,B           = Slope and Y-intercept (for Y=M*X+B)

    Once  it  has  been determined that the line segment crosses
the window, the equation for the  line  is  calculated in  slope
intercept  form.   Lines  that  are  nearly  vertical  or nearly
horizontal receive special handling.

    The next step is to calculate a value of X given the closest
Y boundary,  and then calculate a value of Y given the closest X
boundary.  If only one trial coordinates is on  the  window,  it
is used.   If both coordinates  are outside the window, then the
line does not appear anywhere inside the window (this can happen
when it barely misses a corner).  The only time that both  trial
coordinates  can be on the  window is when  the  line intersects
at a corner.  In that case,  the coordinate  closest to  the new
position is used.
    The  algorithms  are  presented  in  a  pseudo-language  for
purposes  of illustration only.  The actual routines are written
in MACRO-10, the assembly language for the DECsystem-10.

            from the old position to that point with pen down.
OUT.IN    = Calculate where the line enters the window, move to
            that point, and draw with pen down to (NEW.X,NEW.Y).

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

    The following is a partial list of suggestions for improving
the CSM plotting package:

    Use  a  3 by 2 transformation matrix, and implement routines
to read and set the matrix.

    Define additional options to subroutine ROTATE  so  that  it
respects  the changes caused by FACTOR and resetting the origin.

    Implement  subroutines  WINDOW  and VUPORT for setting world
coordinates  and  normalized  device  coordinates  for  graphics
terminals.   Subroutine SETWIN will still define the size of the
plotting area on paper.

    Rewrite   the   clipping   algorithm   to   make   it   more
understandable  and  more accurate.  Put the X and Y coordinates
in  the  "Plot  Window   Exceeded"   message   to   conform   to
documentation.

    Fix the bug where FOROTS quits talking to the terminal after
plotting.  This will require a  rewrite  of  the  low-level  I/O
routines.

    Fix the intermittent bug in subroutine XHAIRS.

    If  a  program  does  CALL PLOTS(IERR,IPLT,FILNAM) twice and
changes FILNAM between calls, only  the  first  value  is  used.
This needs to be fixed.

    Finish implementing subroutine TITLE for plotters capable of
drawing text.

    Modify AXIS, AXES, LOGAX, and  LOGAXS  to  accept  character
variables.

    Come  up  with  something  better than subroutine SCALE.  It
currently has problems when both positive  and  negative  values
are used.
