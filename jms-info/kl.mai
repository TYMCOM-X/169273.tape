re .1: WPI had system 215, not 212.  Is your memory dropping bits?  ;-)  I 
personally spent many a night there (I worked at WACCC for 3 years).  System
215 was a 1050 (KA10/KT10) MD10, MF10, 2 DF10, RP10C, 3 RP03, RD10, RM10B, 
TD10, 2 TU56, DK10, BA10, LP10C, TM10A, 2 TU30. 

KA10s started at 1.  KI10s started at 513.  KLs started at 1025 (P0, in the lab
I work in, is KL1025). KS10s started at 4096.  

re .2 There is no such thing as a KL20.  And the serial number is (usually) a
clue to the fact that it is a tall blue cabinet rather than a short blue or
orange cabinet (but not always: KL1031 and KL1030 started out life as KL10Cs). 
Briefly, the KL10 series: 

Variant	Description

KL10A	Model A (KL10-PA backplane), tall cabinet, 1 DTE20, no RH20s.
KL10B	Model A CPU, tall cabinet, up to 4 DTE20, up to 8 RH20.
KL10C	Model A CPU, short cabinet, up 4 DTE20, up to 8 RH20, core memory.
KL10D	Model B CPU (KL10-PV backplane), tall, 4 DTE, 8 RH.
KL10E	Model B CPU, KL10-PV, short, 4 DTE, 8 RH, core or MOS memory
	KL10EA Core/orange/60Hz
	KL10EB Core/orange/50Hz
	KL10EC Core/blue/60Hz (I don't think this was actually produced) 
	KL10ED Core/blue/50Hz (I don't think this was actually produced)
	KL10EE MOS/orange/60Hz (MOS models include KW20 clock)
	KL10EF MOS/orange/50Hz
	KL10EH MOS/blue/60Hz
	KL10EJ MOS/blue/50HZ
KL10R	Model B CPU, "radiation" model (FCC equipped), MOS memory
	-RA orange/60hz  (KL10E 50Hz still made for Europe (no FCC))
	-RC blue/60Hz
	I don't remember the varients with the MCA25 cache/pager

System	Description
1080	KL10A, external channels, DL10/DN87 for communications
1090	KL10B/D, internal channels, DN87S (or DL10/DN87) for communications
1091	KL10E or KL10R blue cabinet
1095	blue KL10E with MCA25 or blue KL10R cabinet with MCA25
1099	(actually two KL10B or two KL10D)

2040	KL10C with no MCA20 cache
2040S	KL10E with no MCA20 cache
2050	KL10C with cache
2060	KL10E
2065	KL10E or KL10R with MCA25


Serial numbers 1025-~1899? were generally 1080s/1090s
Serial numbers 2101-3099 were generally 2040/2050/2060/1091s
Serial numbers 3100-~3190? were 1090s
Serial numbers 3500-? are KL10Rs (2065/1095)

Most KL10Bs and KL10Cs have been upgraded to KL10D/Es by replacing the "model
A" KL10-PA backplanes with "model B" KL10-PV backplanes.  Many KL10C/Es also
removed their 128K MA20 or 256K MB20 core memory and added a KW20 MOS master
oscillator and MF20 or MG20 MOS memory.  For example P4 (KL1030) in the CPS
lab started out as a KL10C and now has KL10-PV, MG20 memory, CI20, NIA20, MCA25.

BTW, about 3-4 KL10Rs a month are still being produced in MR1 along with those
hundreds of 8600s.

OK, do you feel a sense of history now?  :-)

Yes, my 2020 is KS #4664.  PANDA PROGRAMMING is what I call my consulting
business; it's a sole proprietorship not a corporation so essentially it's
an alias for for business purposes.  PANDA doesn't even have a checking
account (although that may change soon).

Alas, 4664 hasn't been installed yet.  It was delivered on 12 July, but
after some amazing bullshit it turns out that it will be impossible for
me to have it installed at the condo complex I presently live at.  The
condo association is to blame, lying bastards (and bitches) that they are.
I am in the process of buying a house and will install 4664 there as soon
as possible.  I am hoping to close the first week of October and when that
happens 4664 will be located in:
	PANDA PROGRAMMING
	1802 Hackett Ave., Rainbow Suite
	Mountain View, CA  94043 (not sure about the zip code)
The Rainbow Suite (that is, the computer room) is presently occupied by
the current owner's 12-year-old daughter, who had a large rainbow painted
on the wall.  It's the most noticable feature of the room.  We soon started
calling it the "Rainbow Room", and since that's where the computer is going
the name "Rainbow Suite" became obvious...

According to the information on my contract, 4664 is refurbished, as is all
the other hardware.  My VT100 still has its answerback message programmed
as "log Sander"!  I was under the impression that well over 1000 KS10's were
made and sold and that it was nearly 2000 systems.  4664 would be only the
568th system; I'm sure that more than that are out there.

In any case, it should be noted that 4664 is in Mountain View (a small city
of 62,000 or so) and not at Stanford, which is about 9 miles away.

PS: What do you think about the name "Hackett"????  Almost looks intentional!

My first address up here was 9 Fuyat St, which the locals pronounced
Foy-at, but we all pronounced Foo-yat.  My second (present address)
is 36 Green St, which is both the correct number of bits, and the
correct language color (look at the cover color of Ada Letters).

     Dawn has pointed out that the 1020 and 1030 were single user KA systems
that ran an operating system something like RT-11 or OS-8.
