FORTH BY ALL PERSONNEL ON THIS MACHINE INVENTORY. I KNOW WHAT A EFFORT
IT WAS TO COUNT THE 'NETWORK' IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.

BUT WE HAVE A SMALL PROBLEM, WE HAVE NOT QUITE BUT THIS MONSTER TO BED

WHAT IS ON THE BOOKS. THEREFORE THEY HAVE ASKED US TO DO AND 'GIVE'
A LITTLE MORE.

PLEASE COUNT AND RECORD THE SERIAL NUMBERS OF ALL ENGINES THAT FALL
INTO THESE CLASSES; SPARES (WE ONLY HAVE MICROS AS SPARES)

JUST SUPPLY THE ENGINE TYPE, THE LOCATION (ADDRESS), AND THE MOST
IMPORTANT ITEM THE SERIAL #.

THIS COUNT 'MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED BY WEDNESDAY OCT.30,1985. ALL THE MACHINES

To:       ISG Lists A-E; MDC Plant Lists A-C

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

ISG-85-162

    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162

Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

    $ 25,000                 $ .23             $ .34
    $ 50,000                 $ .45             $ .68
    $ 75,000                 $ .68             $1.02
    $100,000                 $ .90             $1.36
    $125,000                 $1.13             $1.70
    $150,000                 $1.35             $2.04
    $175,000                 $1.58             $2.38
    $200,000                 $1.80             $2.72
    $225,000                 $2.03             $3.06
    $250,000                 $2.25             $3.40



ISG-85-163

If you elect family coverage, consult your Group Insurance 
Summary Plan Description for the definition of an eligible 
child.  The benefit payable depends on your family makeup:

     SPOUSE ONLY       SPOUSE & CHILDREN       CHILDREN ONLY

         60%             Spouse - 50%               20%
                          Child - 10%

Enrollment cards can be obtained from your local Human Resources 
Office serving your area.  Completed cards must be dated during 
the month of November 1985, and forwarded to your Human Resource 
Office no later than November 29, 1985.

Good news!  The FSC account is being moved to a new OnTyme host.
This should give us better response time and easier accessibility.
 
The move will take place the weekend of November 15th.  There are
a few things that each of you need to know:
 
     1.   Only the usernames and the files will be moved.
          The IN, IN OLD, OUT, and OUT OLD messages will
          be left behind.
 
     2.   If you have any messages you want to save, put
          them in a file.*  (see * below)
 
     3.   ALL MESSAGES MUST BE SENT AND/OR READ by 12:00
          noon, PST on Friday November 15th.    4.   You have until 4:00 pm, PST on November 15th 
          to save any messages.
 
     5.   The FSC account will be UNAVAILABLE from 5:00 pm,
          PST, November 15th until 3:00 pm, PST, November
          16th.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THE ACCOUNT DURING
          THIS TIME.
 
     6.   A new letter will appear in front of messages on
          the new host.  Instead of a J, you will see a P.
                                                                Page  2

 
All internal accounts have been notified of this move.  They have
been asked to hold all their messages for FSC until the move is
completed.  Thanks for your help and understanding.
 
 
* - Here are two procedures for saving your messages as files:
 
     1.  There is an EXEC available between the hours of
         3:00 pm and 6:00 am PST, called ** FSC.FILEMSGS.
         Decide which messages you want to save and write
         down the complete message numbers.  Type in 
         :EXEC ** FSC.FILEMSGS and answer the prompts.
 
     2.  Determine which messages you want to save and
         write down the full message numbers.  For each
         message to be saved, issue the following commands:
          :ERASE
          :GET message#
          :FILE * filename

It has been brought to my attention that some of you may not be aware
of the fact that our OnTyme account was switched to a new host last
weekend.  (Have you noticed the improved response time?)

Because of the move, any incoming messages that you did not read by
4:00 pm, November 15th have been left behind.  If you are concerned

A DATE SHIPPED COLUM, THIS SHOWS THE DATE THE EQUIPMENT WAS SHIPPED   
FROM MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE SOME REMARKABLE MACHINES LISTED THERE   
223 OF THEM WERE SHIPPED IN 1985 AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM, THEN THERE   
192 THAT WERE SHIPPED IN 1984 THAT WE CAN'T FIND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO  
BELIEVE THAT MACHINES THAT WERE SHIPPED FROM 1 TO 22 MONTHS CAN'T
BE ACCOUNTED FOR.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


We have received many phone calls inquiring about missing optional 
life insurance deductions.  Due to insufficient data received from 
PPS II, this deduction was omitted from your paycheck.

If you enrolled in the optional life insurance, you will notice on 
your paycheck for week ending January 19, 1986 a total deduction
for four (4) weeks.  Thereafter, your deduction will be calculated
on a weekly basis.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  If you
have any questions concerning this situation, please contact
Johann Stone at (714) 250-1000 x2183.

============================================================
 
An Ontyme interface is now available on the M7000.
If you are located at 2351 MCGAW, instructions for it's use
will follow. If you are located elsewhere and have access to
an M7000, I will be glad to send the software if you send
the request to me, along with a blank tape.
 
This interface allows printing of Ontyme messages and Ontyme
workspace.  Printing can take place on any of the Production
System printers, of which there are three.  "LPTR", "LAB",
and "GE".
 
Messages and workspace may also be captured in a disk file.
 
Disk files may be transfered to Ontyme workspace.  This
allows the user to use the M7000's superior editor or the
TEXTPRO wordprocessor to create and edit messages before
transferring to Ontyme.
 
This interface is menu driven and rather easy to use.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW 5.9 VERSION OPERATING SOFTWARE FOR
THE MARS+ HONEYWELL 6/23 SYSTEM , A NUMBER OF TROUBLES HAVE APPEARED.
SYSTEMS HAVE 4-2 AND LARGER CONFIGURATIONS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING
VARIOUS CRT TROUBLES.

EXAMPLES:  ERRONEOUS RESPONSES
           UNSOLICITED RESPONSES
           FROZEN CURSORS

IF YOU ARE SERVICING A SYSTEM THAT HAS REPORTED THESE PROBLEMS OR
ONES THAT ARE SIMILAR , BE SURE TO ASK THEM WHEN THE TROUBLES STARTED
AND WHEN THEY MADE THE SWITCH TO THE 5.9 SOFTWARE. IF AGENCY STILL HAS
IT'S OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE YOU CAN USE IT TO REINIT SYSTEM AND CHECK
WHETHER CRT TROUBLES ARE STILL OCCURING. IF THEY STOP , THEN YOU HAVE
TWO OPTIONS. YOU CAN ADVISE AGENCY THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE
USING THE OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE. OR YOU CAN RESET THE BAUD RATE FOR
THE LAST CRT <LAST ADDRESS IN SYSTEM> FOR 4800 BAUD INSTEAD OF NORMAL
OPERATING BAUD RATE OF 9600 BAUD. THEN YOU CAN BRING SYSTEM BACK UP
ON NEW 5.9 SOFTWARE AND CRT PROBLEMS SHOULD DISAPPEAR. BUT IT IS
                                                                Page  2

VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FIRST EXPLAIN THESE OPTIONS WITH THE AGENCY
AND ALLOW THEM TO MAKE DECISION. IF AGENCY DECIDES TO HAVE ONE CRT
RESET TO 4800 BAUD , MAKE CHANGE TO CRT THAT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT
OF TRAFFIC.

THIS IS ONLY A QUICK-FIX SOLUTION TILL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CORRECTS
PROBLEMS WITH SYSTEM <DATA CENTER'S 6/53'S> OPERATING SOFTWARE.

DATA LEAVES AGENCY'S 6/23 AND GOES TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 COMPUTER
VIA TYMNET. DATA IS THEN TRANSLATED BY 6/53 TO THE AIRLINES'
COMPUTER'S LANGUAGE AND SENT TO AIRLINES FOR ANSWER. ANSWER <DATA>
IS THEN RETURNED TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 TO BE TRANSLATED BACK TO
OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. AFTER TRANSLATION DATA IS SENT TO THE
AGENCY'S 6/23 AND APPEARS ON ONE OF IT'S CRT'S DISPLAY.

THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN DATA CENTER'S 6/53 IS TRANSLATING DATA < ANSWER>
FROM AIRLINES COMPUTER TO OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. IN SOME CASES
WE LOSE THE "END OF MEESAGE TAG". THIS WILL CREATE A MULTITUDE
OF PROBELMS FOR THE 6/23 WHICH IS SLAVED TO THE 6/53.



************************************************************************


ADDED NOTE:

IF YOU HAVE AGENCY'S THAT ARE REPORTING THAT THEIR CRTS ARE 
GENERATING TICKET COMMANDS ON THEIR OWN , BE SURE TO ASK THEM
WHETHER THEY WERE BUILDING A RECORD WHEN TICKET COMMAND WAS
GENERATED. THIS IS BECAUSE WHILE THEY ARE BUILDING A RECORD THEY
USE THE "0/SEGMENT" KEY. IF THEY ACCIDENTLY HIT THE "0/SEGMENT"
KEY AND THE "F7" KEY TOGETHER < THE "F7 KEY IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE
"0/SEGMENT" KEY" > THE SYSTEM WILL SEE THIS AS A TICKET COMMAND.
WE CALL THIS THE "FAT FINGER SYNDROME". TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN YOU CAN ASK THE AGENT TO BE MORE CAREFUL OR REMOVE THE 
"F7" KEY'S TOP. YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE KEY AND BREAK OFF IT'S
PINS AND THEN PLACE IT BACK INTO KEYBOARD. THIS WAY YOU CAN LEAVE
THE KEY'S TOP ON.

I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO EVERYONES ATTENTION TWO ITEMS OF INTEREST
IN WORKING ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 SYSTEM. THEY ARE:


1. NOW THAT WE HAVE NEW OPERATING SOFTWARE THERE IS A TROUBLE SYMPTOM
   CHANGE. WITH THE OLD SOFTWARE WHEN THE TRANSMIT KEY EXPERIENCED
   ELECTRICAL BOUNCES YOU WOULD SEE THE CURSOR DROP SEVERAL LINES
   INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL ONE LINE DROP. WITH THE NEW 5.0 - 5.9
   SOFTWARE THE CURSOR WILL ONLY DROP ONE LINE. INSTEAD THE SYSTEM WILL SEE
   EACH TRANSMIT AS A SEPERATE COMMAND. YOU WILL SEE YOUR REPLY
   TO YOUR REQUEST PLUS YOU WILL SEE SEVERAL ERROR MESSAGES SUCH AS
   "INVALID FORMAT" APPEARING ON FOLLOWING LINES. YOU MAY JUST HAVE
   A COLD SOLDER JOINT BUT IT IS ADVISABLE TO REPLACE THE KEY. WHEN-
   EVER YOU OPEN THE KEYBOARD IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE YOUR SOLDERING
   IRON AND GO OVER ALL OF THE KEYS SOLDER JOINTS. IF YOU FIND A COLD 
   SOLDER JOINT IT WILL COLLAPSE WHEN SOLDERING IRON IS PLACED
   ON IT. THIS EXTRA STEP MAY SAVE YOU TROUBLE IN THE FUTURE AND TAKES
   ONLY A FEW EXTRA MINUTES.

2. WHEN PERFORMING PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 IT IS
                                                                Page  2

   VERY IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE CONTROLLER BOARD'S CONTACTS. THIS CAN BE
   DONE WITH A PENCIL ERACER. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE POWER
   SUPPLIES AND TAKE APART THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY TO CLEAN IT.
   THERE ARE TWO VENTS IN THE BACK OF THE CARD CAGE WHERE AIR IS DRAWN
   THROUGH BY THE BUS POWER SUPPLY FANS TO COOL THE CONTROLLER
   BOARDS. THESE VENTS NEED TO BE CLEANED ALSO.

ADDED NOTE: WHEN YOU HAVE A HONEYWELL <PRU1001> PRINTER THAT IS SHUTTING
            ITSELF <KICKING IT'S OWN CIRCUIT BREAKER> OFF YOU SHOULD
            FIRST CHECK THE BRIDGE DIODE CR01. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE
            THE CAUSE OF PROBLEM IN ABOUT 98% OF OUR PRINTER PROBLEMS
            DESCRIBED ABOVE.

1. VIP7200 CRT'S RASTER IS TOO BRITE BUT THE DISPLAY IS ADJUSTABLE;


       CHECK THE 7800 UFD CAP ON THE VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOAD.


2. VIP7200 IS MISSING IT'S VIDEO <DISPLAY> , OR IT'S HORIZONTAL SYNC;


      CHECK THE LOCATION B14 <SN74LSI161AN> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


3. VIP7200'S CURSOR WON'T MOVE WILL WILL TYPE CHARACTORS;


      CHECK THE LOCATION M06 OR M07 <SN74LS08N> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


4. VIP7200'S RASTER OKAY BUT DISPLAY <BRITENESS> CAN'T BE ADJSTED;
                                                                Page  2



      CHECK THE CAP C431 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD.


5. VIP7200 HAS A VERY ERACTIC DISPLAY , SCREEN JUMPS AROUND;


      THERE IS RIPPLE ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD-REPLACE.


6. VIP7200'S TOP LINE OF DISPLAY IS CURVED OR BENT;


      CHECK R29 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD FOR OPEN OR LOSS OF RESISTANCE.


7. VIP7200 DISPLAYS ONLY EVERY OTHER LINE;


      CHECK LOCATION E05 <SN74LS193> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


8. VIP7200 DISPLAYS RANDOM CHARACTORS;


      CHECK FOR 15V ON 5V PIN ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD. IF
      IT IS PRESENT THEN Q03 IS OPEN BETWEEN B-C. REPLACE.
      ALSO CHECK VIP7200'S KCM BOARD CONTACTS AND CLEAN THEM. THE
      DIRTY CONTACTS CAN CAUSE ABOVE PROBLEM AND ALSO FROZEN CURSORS.



ADDED NOTE: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CLEAN THE CONTACTS ON THE KCM BOARDS
            EVEN IF YOU ARE WORKING ON A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
            IF YOU CHECK +5 VOLTS ON THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY
            AND IT SHOWS +2.5 OR LESS VOLTAGE THEN CHECK THE
            REGULATOR LM323K.

Subject: "April 8, 1986 A message from Bob"... 







                                                 April 8, 1986


A message from Bob Fischer to all ISG employees. . .


     Over the past month or so, we have been taking dramatic new 
measures to ensure that ISG meets its 1986 earnings objective.  In 
this message I hope to give you a better idea of what we're doing 
and why.

     Before I go any further, though, I need to make one thing 
clear: By now you probably know that the actions we're taking 
include reductions in ISG's workforce.  I'm not at all happy about 
that, but, for reasons I'll explain in a moment, we've had to cut 
our costs significantly.  Because such a large percentage of our 
total cost is people, force reductions were something we simply 
could not avoid.  I know there is nothing I can say that will be of 
much help to the people affected by these reductions, but I assure 
you we're doing everything we can to help those people find new 
positions elsewhere in MDC or with other companies.

     With that said, let me try to clear up some of the 
misunderstanding caused by the sweeping actions being taken to cut 
costs within ISG.  These actions, most of which are being carried 
out on an individual business unit basis, are designed to give ISG 
a reasonable chance to achieve its earnings objectives in the first 
two quarters as well as for the year.

     Behind these actions is the fact that MDC's top management is 
understandably concerned about ISG's 1985 results.  Rather than 
spend time discussing this here, I want to refer you to the 
newly-published MDC Annual Report.  (A copy will soon be delivered 
to your home if it hasn't been already.)  The ISG section of the 
report, together with Sandy and John McDonnell's discussion of ISG 
in their introductory message to shareholders, does a good job of 
putting our 1985 results into perspective.

     What you need to know here is that MDC is watching our first- 
and second-quarter performance very closely for evidence that we 
have turned things around.  When the ISG Management Committee met 
in February, those first two quarters looked pretty shaky.  (The 
members of this committee, in addition to myself, are: Mike Becker, 
Staff Vice President-Human Resources; Otis Brinkley, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company; Rich Calvert, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
Company; Jerry Causley, President-McDonnell Douglas Information 
Systems International; John Clancy, President-McDonnell Douglas 
Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company; Jim Donovan, 

Page 2



Vice President-Marketing and Planning; Leo Mirowitz, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company; Warren Prince, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company; and 
Paul Wiedenmann, Corporate Vice President-Finance.)  Based on the 
business unit forecasts available at the time, we recognized that 
ISG was not on track to meet its operating plan objectives in the 
first two quarters.  Our performance in January and February has 
shown that our concern was justified.  For the first two months of 
1986, our sales and performance earnings were both behind plan.

     While the Management Committee agreed that a permanent 
solution to our problems will only come from selling more and 
getting higher margins, we decided that the need to stay on plan in 
the short term demanded that we take bold steps to get our 
performance on track.  We realized there is a limit to how many 
times we can do major costs cuts. We concluded, therefore, that we 
needed to cut enough costs out of the business now to give us a 
high probability of making our first-half and annual plans, even if 
revenue grows at the moderate rate experienced in January and 
February as compared to the more aggressive plan rate.

     Here's how we proceeded: Each business unit identified the 
amount of cost reduction it would need in order to be confident of 
making its own operating plan.  As a group, we then examined every 
alternative we could think of, not only for business unit cuts, but 
also for ISG-wide actions, Group-level cuts, reorganizations, and 
elimination of activities.  From that list, we collectively decided 
on how to achieve the level of savings we need.

     That's a brief look at why we're involved in this round of 
cost cuts and at how we determined where and how much to cut.  Now 
I want to describe some of the actions we're in the process of 
implementing.

     There are four ISG-wide actions.  First, we have suspended all 
merit increases within ISG until the Group is on a much firmer 
financial footing.  The increases will be reinstated only after ISG 
is virtually assured of making its 1986 earnings objective, and 
also after I'm satisfied all business units have taken the 
necessary steps to ensure they are on target to make their 
individual 1986 plans.  At that time, we'll develop a merit program 
that takes into account the fact that some employees have been 
disadvantaged more than others by the timing of this suspension.

     Second, we have suspended Management and Professional 
Development classes for ISG managers.  We have, however, kept the 
organization intact and we're continuing to conduct MDAIS training 
sessions, for which we are reimbursed.  We'll reinstate ISG classes 
as soon as possible.

     Third, we are rethinking the ISG Employee Savings Plan. We're 
looking for ways to tie company matching contributions to ISG 
business performance.  No action has been taken at this time, but 
we'll keep you informed.

Page 3



     Our fourth ISG-wide action is a reduction of about 10 percent 
in the number of ISG senior managers.  Past force reductions at all 
levels and the reorganization of the former McAuto, Microdata and 
Tymshare left us with a management team that was just too big for 
our present size.  We had to reduce the number of managers to get 
our organizations into somewhat better balance.  Middle managers 
have also been affected by force reductions, though these have been 
carried out at the individual business unit level.

     We've also taken action to reduce the size of our group staff, 
both management and professional, by more than 25 percent.  These 
cuts include the elimination of many worthwhile activities that we 
may restore at some point.  For now, though, we just couldn't 
afford to keep them.

     We've also moved to narrow our range of business activities 
and consolidate organizations for more efficient operation.  For 
example, you may have read in the ISG Spirit or elsewhere about the 
dissolution of McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company and 
the restructuring of McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

     All other actions -- about two-thirds of the total -- are 
being taken within individual business units.  These actions vary 
based on what the business units felt they needed to do to achieve 
their objectives.  Along with making their own decisions about 
where to cut costs, the business units are implementing the cuts in 
their own ways and on their own schedules.

     As a result of this decentralized approach, it's hard to see 
the whole picture right now.  Also, the actions being taken aren't 
over with as quickly as if everything were done at once.  But it 
was the Management Committee's feeling that these actions can be 
more intelligently implemented in this way than by taking the 
all-at-once approach we used in the third quarter of last year.

     I can't give you a detailed rundown of all the business units' 
activities, since many of them are still in progress.  But I am 
putting the word out to your business unit management to 
overcommunicate with your organization when the steps being taken 
within your business unit have been completed.

     I know it's been difficult to function in the uncertain 
climate that has resulted from our recent actions.  And I'm afraid 
that in some organizations that uncertainty will last a while 
longer.  But again, I expect your business unit management to 
report to you on what's been done as soon as all actions are 
complete.  As soon as possible, we need for people to be able to 
stop looking over their shoulders and concentrate fully on the 
business of serving our customers.

     I hope I've cleared up at least some of your questions.  I'll 
answer more specific questions in the April 11 issue of the ISG 
Spirit.  In fact, I'm changing my monthly column to a question and 
answer format so that I can stay in closer touch with the issues 
that concern you the most.  I'll also periodically use messages 
like this one to give you my perspective on the state of ISG.

     That's about it for now.  I know we're going through tough 
times.  But let me tell you something: I believe that our business 
reached its low point on September 30, 1985.  As painful as things 
are now, I believe that on June 30, 1986 -- and for that matter, on 
December 31, 1986 -- we'll look back and see that we've done what 
needed to be done to get ourselves on track.  In the meantime, I'll 
keep you posted.

Sincerely,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Whenever TYMCOM-10 Software Support installs a NEW MONITOR or PATCH
on these systems, they place it in (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on the respective
system, and then send mail to OPER and DANIELSR.  If you should receive
a phone call on this, please tell them to send mail to the user ID's
mentioned above before it can be done.

Software Group should update the (SYS)DSKMAP.DAT file with comments
as to what the NEW MONITOR or PATCH is to do.

Once I am aware of this, I will send mail stating that the next
time the HOST is recycled it is to come up on (SYS)NEWMON.SAV.  If
there is no problem bringing the HOST up on this monitor, and after
a few days, it seems to be running okay, I will then perform the next
step.  If the system will not come up on (SYS)NEWMON.SAV, after a few
tries, then it should be brought up on it's current running monitor.
Mail should be sent to "XCONSULT" and "DANIELSR" on system 38, stating
what occurred and what monitor the system did come up on.  

If, after a few days, there are no problems with the NEW MONITOR or PATCH,
                                                                Page  2

I will copy (SYS)BACKUP.SAV to (SYS)OLDMON.SAV; (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV to
(SYS)BACKUP.SAV; and, (SYS)NEWMON.SAV to (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV.

Once this is done, the program (QASYS)MAPUPD will be run to update
the DSKMAP.  After doing this, mail will be sent to OPER to make
new (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV and (SYS)BACKUP.SAV monitor tapes and to post a 
NEW DSKMAP on the mainframe.

WARNING!!!!!!!!  NO OPERATOR IS TO PERFORM THE ABOVE STEPS WITHOUT
EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM MYSELF.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
