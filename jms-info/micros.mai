The ACS Seminar is proving to be an effective way to guarantee ACS
leads.  St. Louis Diversified Sales representatives put together an
extensive prospect list with the assistance of ISM, mailed 300
invitations, did phone follow up on the majority of prospects,
confirmed 38 attendees, and identified seven solid leads, two of which
could close and bill by year-end.
 
"The credit really goes to Hank Spencer and his fellow sales reps,"
says Nancy Browning.
 
According to Hank, representatives from 18 different St. Louis
companies attended the seminar.  "The seminar solidified relationships
with two current prospects, both of which will be proceeding with
pilot programs."  Five other opportunities were "uncovered."
 
Hank thanks the "ACS organization, and especially St. Louis consultant
Carol Burkett and Houston consultant D'Juanna Beer, who did an
outstanding job in their presentations and demonstrations of ACS
products."
 
San Francisco just completed its seminar with similar results.
 
Says Nancy, "If you commit yourself and follow up, you'll get a
handsome payoff."  At press time, the schedule for future seminars is

making meetings shorter and more productive.  The show then goes on to
explain all of ISSCO's products, with some fantastic examples of the
things you can do with graphics!

 . . . . . . . . . . NEWS FROM ACS FEDERAL PROGRAMS . . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Federal Programs expanded OnTyme and installed a local area
network (LAN) communications interface for the Army Corps of
Engineers.  "The number of Army Corps of Engineers staff using OnTyme
will increase from 2,000 to 10,000 in the next two months as a result
of a new contract," reports Russ Service, Manager of ACS Federal
Programs.
 
The Federal Programs organization markets ACS systems to the U. S.
Government here and abroad, and provides a 22-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
hotline service to federal users.  In addition, the organization
provides pre- and post-sales technical support to commercial ACS
accounts in the Washington, DC area.
 
OnTyme training is one of the organization's strengths.  Using their
own hands-on training program, the Federal Programs staff has trained
1200 federal users of OnTyme worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 4
 
Federal Programs also provides ongoing support for Army Corps of
Engineers applications installed on the Tymcomm 370.  These
applications are accessed by users in the U. S., Europe, Korea, Japan,
Philippines, Panama, and other international locations.
 
Currently Russ's organization is installing micro engines at Army
Corps of Engineers sites in Washington, DC and Germany to interface
LANs with TYMNET.
 
If you have questions about federal contract procedures or want to
exchange information about LAN communications interfaces, contact Russ
Service at ACS.GOVMAIL.
 
 
 . . . . SEPTEMBER PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES, PART II . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon.  These units are responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers) and marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets,
  and various other sales aids)
* Sales and training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Building administration in VG-3
 
Last month's Newsflash profiled Marketing Publications, Production
Services, and Marketing Promotions.  This month, we focus on Training
Services, Building Administration, and Course Development.  These
three units are responsible for
 
* sales and professional development training and course development
* building administration in ACS headquarters
 
TRAINING SERVICES . . . .
 
At first, Training Services might sound quite a bit like Course
Development -- until you look at the primary purposes of the two.
Course Development develops; Training Services administers.  Carlota
Santa Cruz, Manager of Training Services, sees the function of the
department more as the developer of a career training path rather than
particular technical courses.  Training Services programs include
 
- ACS Product School
- AC Exchange Week
- Presentation Skills
- Selling ACS Workshop
 
The courses that happen to lie along this path can come from a variety
of sources - Deltak, Xerox, internal development, or other sources.
 
To develop career training paths, Carlota evaluates all the available
courses and arranges them into a logical sequence.  When holes appear
in this sequence either she or Course Developer Sarah Chamlee Kinkel
develop the needed material.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 5
 
Valerie Minder, Training Support Specialist, has just begun to
facilitate the FOCUS Data Base Management class.  Additionally, she
checks for proper registration forms and tracks each student along the
proper training paths.
 
Training Services usually doesn't deal with technological concepts.
Training Services emphasizes the "how to sell" aspect of education;
for example, the "How to Sell ACS Products" Seminar deals primarily
with the consultative sale rather than the product sale.
 
The future should see more regional training schedules, including
workshops, facilitated by Carlota and Valerie or by ACS employees
trained in course facilitation by Carlota and Valerie.  For the
present, the training schedule is available on *** ACS.TRAININGSCHED.
Descriptions of the available courses are referenced from that file.
 
COURSE DEVELOPMENT . . . .
 
Course Development, in the words of Course Developer Sarah Chamlee
Kinkel, is responsible for developing courses not already covered by
Training Services or other packaged sources.
 
Course Development projects come from various sources:  ACS
consultants, product managers, or the training group itself.  Two
current projects originated with Terry Fujimoto and Shirley Macemon -
a Data Communications course called Bisynchronous Connections to the
Network, section one of four that will be delivered under the title
ACS Technologies Solutions Training.
 
Sarah manages the development projects from inception to completion.
This includes developing objectives, mustering resources to provide
technical input, writing handout and support materials, training
initial facilitators, and distributing packaged materials.
 
BUILDING ADMINISTRATION . . . .
 
A pleasant environment to do your work in is mandatory if you expect
to do good work.  Lighting has to be adequate, heating/air
conditioning has to work properly, telephones have to ring when
they're supposed to, and hardwires need to connect to the correct
equipment.  Even the colors need to soothe.  All of these working
condition concerns are in the care of Diane Gordon.
 
Her position as Building Administrator put her in the critical role of
supporting ACS while it supports you:  with security services,
maintenance, telecommunications, space planning, and construction.
Primarily, in her words, her job is to make sure ACS "gets its needed
services easily and quickly."

1.  MDC Standards, Ref (a), provides a list of preferred 
    hardware and software standards for office automation.  For 
    ISG use, we are continuing with only the IBM Personal 
    Computer and IBM Personal Computer XT devices for automated 
    office systems.  Encl (1) provides the current standard 
    configurations for these systems.

2.  IBM Displaywriter has been removed from the standard.  The 
    IBM PC and IBM PC/XT with MultiMate are the standard systems 
    for word processing.  User Support Centers will provide 
    support for all installed Wang and Displaywriter systems, 
    but expansion of these systems, which require procurement of 
    hardware or software, is not authorized.

3.  Configurations in Encl (1) were modified to add Lotus 1-2-3 
    productivity aids, high speed hard disk backup capability 
    and graphics software.

4.  The User Support Centers are available to provide 
    information and assistance for configurations and ordering.

          (b) Management  Directive  107:  ISG  Internal  Systems
              Standards

Encl:     (1) Supported   Hardware   and  Software  Products  for
              Automated Office Systems


1.  MDC  Standards,  Reference  (a),  provide a list of preferred
    hardware  and  software standards for office automation.  For
    ISG  use,  Reference (b), we are continuing with only the IBM
    Personal  Computer  (PC) and IBM Personal Computer XT (PC/XT)
    devices   for   automated  office  systems.    Enclosure  (1)
    provides   the  current  standard  configurations  for  these
    systems.

2.  Configurations  in Enclosure (1) have been updated to reflect
    new  software versions for Multimate (Advantage Version 3.6),
    Lotus  1-2-3  (Version  2),  and  DOS  (Version  3.1).    All
    existing  PC  and  PC/XT users will receive software upgrades
    for  these products in December 1985.  Update procedures will
    be announced by separate Administrative Bulletin.

3.  Lotus  Version 2 will not require use of the system diskette,
    provides    accelerated    calculations    using   the   math
    coprocessor,  and  provides  file  password capability. Lotus
    1-2-3  Aids  in  Enclosure  (1)  have  been  removed from the
    Preferred  Options  due  to these features now being provided
    by Lotus.

4.  The   User   Support   Centers   are   available  to  provide
    information  and assistance for the above changes and for new
    system order configurations. USC phone numbers are:
