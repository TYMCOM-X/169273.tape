***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
    DATE:  AUGUST 16, 1985                                           
 
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  NEW COURSE OFFERING --- "COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS"
          
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
The Wilson Learning "Counselor Selling Skills" program, used 
extensively by the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, is now 
available to all ISG employees. 
                                                                         
Counselor Selling is a CUSTOMER focused program, rather than being 
product-focused like the Xerox-based programs.  It teaches how to 
build relationships with potential customers and how to achieve a 
MUTUALLY AGREED UPON UNDERSTANDING of their situation PRIOR to 
discussing the features and benefits of one's product(s).  It focuses 
on creating a "win-win" environment where the prospect WANTS TO BUY, 
rather than trying to "sell" the prospect.  Participants receive pre- 
and post-course feedback from potential and actual customers of their 
choice.
 
The seminar will be conducted by Randy Lipson, trainer for Bob 
Donoghue, Inc.  Randy has 23 years of sales experience and is former 
PSS-II & III trainer.  Employees' cost centers will be charged $710 
for their participation in this four day seminar.  This seminar is 
scheduled for the following dates: 
 
                 Oct. 21-24                  San Jose

MEMO
 
T-RJF-009
 
TO:       The World
 
FROM:     Asset Control
 
SUBJECT:  Physical Inventory of Fixed Assets
 
As  announced previously via Ontyme,  McDonnell Douglas  Business 
and  Network  Systems will be conducting a physical inventory  of 
fixed  assets on October 1,  1985.   This inventory will  involve 
only  those  locations  whose assets are  tracked  in  Cupertino, 
California.   These  locations have cost center  numbers  between 
2000  and 6000;  those cost centers falling outside this range or 
which have alpha-numeric designations such as L475, etc. will not 
be included in this inventory.     
 
The purpose of this inventory is to insure that all fixed  assets 
are   recorded  at  their  proper  locations,   and  to  allocate 
depreciation expense correctly.   We must rely upon the personnel 
at  each  location  to  give us  the  most  accurate  information 
possible.
 
Inventory  packets  will  be sent to contact  personnel  at  each 
location  by  September 20,  1985.   These packets  will  include 
complete inventory instructions,  as well as a Physical Inventory 
Report listing all assets which the Cupertino Fixed Asset  System 
shows as being held at your location.  Additional asset tags have 
already been sent to those who have requested them.
 
You  will  be asked to (a) verify whether you do or do  not  have 
each  item on the Physical Inventory Report;  (b) tag and  record 
those assets which have not already been tagged;  (c) give us any 
information you can for those assets shown which you do not have; 
and  (d)  tag  and record any assets you may have which  are  not 
shown  on  the report.   Completed inventory packets  are  to  be 
returned the day following the inventory to:
 
McDonnell Douglas ISG
Asset Control Department
VG1-B12
20705 Valley Green Drive
Cupertino, California  95014
 
Only MDC-owned assets are to be included in the inventory; do not 
tag  items  which are on lease or loan from outside the  company.  
Also, all company-owned equipment located at employees homes must 
be brought in to your office location for tagging and recording.
 
 
 
 
 
Items to be inventoried and tagged are as follows:
 
A.   All  computer  equipment - CPU's,   memory,  disk  and  tape 
     drives,  controllers,  processors,  line and laser printers,      
     etc.
 
B.   All personal computers (main units and printers).
 
C.   All terminal equipment.
 
D.   Modems (except those associated with engines, which will be 
     inventoried separately with the engines).
 
E.   Specific  office  equipment  - copy  machines,  tyewriters, 
     bursters, collators, microfiche printers, etc.
 
F.   Specific  test  equipment  - oscilloscopes,  volt  meters, 
     off-line testers, etc.
 
G.   Specific  furniture  - microwave   ovens,   refrigerators, 
     conference  tables,  etc.  (do not tag desks,  chairs,  file 
     cabinets, adding machines or other low-cost items).
 
Complete  lists of items to be or not to be tagged,  as  well  as 
instructions on tagging and recording assets, will be included in 
the instructions you will receive in your inventory packets.
 
If  you  do not receive your inventory packets by  September  20, 
1985,  or  if  you  have any questions regarding  the  inventory, 
please  contact  either Bob Forgione at (408) 446-6516  or  Peggy 
Bollinger at (408) 446-7760.   Also, if you have not already done 
so,   please  send  the  following  information  via  Ontyme   to 
FIN.FIXEDASSETS immediately:
 
(1)  Name and Ontyme I.D.  of person responsible for controlling 
     inventory procedures at your location;
(2)  Contact phone number;
(3)  Organization/Division name and cost center(s);
(4)  Full   address   for   shipment  of   tags   and   inventory 
     instructions;
(5)  Mailing  address  for  shipment  of  tags  and   inventory 
     instructions;

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Subject:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION NATIONAL CAR RENTAL 
          CORPORATE-WIDE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

To:       McDonnell Douglas Corporation Plant Lists A-H; Post 
          Bulletin Boards



1.  McDonnell Douglas Corporation has again signed an exclusive 
    supplier agreement with National Car Rental system, Inc. 
    beginning 01 October 1985 through 30 September 1986.  This 
    agreement replaces the previous National contract which 
    expires on 30 September 1985.  National Car Rental is to be 
    used by all reservation functions and by any individual MDC 
    traveler on company business with or without advance 
    reservations.  All car rentals should be made through 
    National, even for the few locations which have no National 
    services (since National will reimburse the rate 
    differences).  MCAIR Travel Services in St. Louis has been 
    assigned responsibility by MDC Corporate Office to 
    administer this agreement for all MDC locations.

2.  With the new agreement, unlimited mileage daily rates for 
    compact size vehicles ("B" size) returned to the same rental 
    location range for $26.00/day in St. Louis, Los Angeles, 
    Phoenix and Long Beach to $27.00/day throughout the 
    remainder of the United States.  Domestic weekly rates are 
    five times the daily rate and monthly rates are three times 
    the weekly rate.  The agreement also provides for Canadian 
    and international discounts.  One-way rentals are charged a 
    reduced time and mileage rate.  National should be notified 
    of the one-way rental at the time of reservation booking to 
    prevent a drop charge.

3.  The same Corporate rates have again been extended to MDC 
    employees for personal travel.  To obtain the Corporate rate 
    for personal rentals, employees should identify themselves 
    as MDC employees when they call National Car Rental at 
    1-800-328-4567 for their reservation.  The Human Resources 
    Office and Recreation Department have National Car 
    Identification cards which should be used with the 
    employees' MDC badges to obtain the MDC rate for personal 
    travel.

4.  All Corporate and personal domestic rentals include full 
    insurance coverage [Collision Damage Waiver, (CDW)].  
    International rates do not include insurance and must be 
    obtained at the time of rental.  On personal rentals, for 
    insurance coverage beyond the free CDW, any necessary 
    personal credit reference and driver's license requirements 
    remain the responsibility of the employee.



5.  If National Car Rental fails to provide a vehicle that has 
    been confirmed within 45 minutes after the traveler arrives 
    at their counter, a written notice along with a copy of the 
    car rental agreement should be sent to MCAIR Travel 
    Services, Dept. 028, Bldg. 275, in St. Louis.  The delay 
    will result in a $25.00 credit rental certificate.  If 
    National fails to comply with the preceding within one (1) 
    hour of the employees' arrival at the rental counter, 
    National will be responsible for a $100.00 penalty.  All 
    penalty certificates are payable to MDC, and will be used to 
    reduce the applicable component's monthly car rental cost.

6.  Where possible, the MDC Huntington Beach, Long Beach or 
    St. Louis Travel Departments should be utilized for making 
    business trip car rental reservations.  MDC receives a 
    commission on any car reservations made through these 
    departments which will help to hold down the Corporation's 
    ever-increasing travel expenditures.

7.  Please route this AB to all personnel in your organization 
    to notify travelers or reservation functions prior to 
    01 October 1985.  Any questions on this agreement should be 
    referred to Travel Services at 314/234-6666 in St. Louis; 
    714/896-2872 in Huntington Beach and 213/593-7565 in Long 
    Beach.

Subject:  FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ELECTRONIC MESSAGING 
          SYSTEMS COMPANY



I am pleased to announce the formation of the McDonnell Douglas 
Electronic Messaging Systems Company.  MDEMS combines two 
existing businesses, FTCC and OnTyme, to aggressively pursue a 
larger share of the Electronic Messaging Market.  Combined 
revenue of FTCC and OnTyme in 1985 is $30 Million and the 
planned 1986 revenue goal for MDEMS is $40 Million.  This new 
unit will be a product organization and will rely on other ISG 
business units for the distribution of its products.

One key element of the 1986 MDEMS sales plan is to encourage all 
ISG business units to sell these messaging products.  At the 
present time, the bulk of the messaging revenue originates from 
the Diversified Systems Company and FTC Communications.  These 
organizations will continue to aggressively sell these products, 
but MDEMS will begin working with the other business units to 
adapt the products to their markets.

During the remainder of 1985, the MDEMS organization structure, 
business plan and 1986 financial operating plan will be 
developed to enable us to implement our messaging business 
strategy.

MDEMS will be managed by Terry Donaher, Vice President of 
Network Applications for the business and Network Systems 
Company and will report to Warren Prince, President of McDonnell 
Douglas Business and Network Systems Company.

Subject:  RESIGNATION OF GARY E. LIEBL



I sincerely regret to announce the resignation of Gary E. Liebl, 
currently the Group Operating Officer of the Information Systems 
Group, effective Thursday, October 17, 1985.

Gary has accepted an appointment as President, Chief Operating 
Officer and member of the Board of Cipher Data Products, Inc., 
of San Diego, California, a leading supplier of magnetic tape 
peripherals and controllers.

During the time we worked together as ISG executive board 
members and, since June, as the team leading the ISG, I have 
developed great respect for his capabilities and for him as a 
person.  He will be greatly missed, and I am sure we all wish 
him much success in the future.

Prior to his present ISG position, Gary was President of 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company and President of 
Microdata Corporation.  Gary was also appointed a Corporate Vice 
President of MDC in July 1983.

Gary's departure makes necessary some alterations in the senior 
management structure of ISG; those changes will be announced in 
a few days.

SUBJECT>   HEALTH PLAN INFORMATION


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the past few weeks, many of you have had questions about 
your new health benefits.  The most frequently asked questions 
are answered here to help everyone understand these new plans.  
Other questions may be referred to your Human Resources 
Department:
 
     Southern California             (714) 250-1000
                                      Ext. 2184 or 2239
     Northern California             (408) 446-7792
     St. Louis                       (314) 232-9181
 
 
GENERAL AMERICAN PLAN
 
 
WHEN ARE MY ISG BENEFITS EFFECTIVE?
 
If you were an ISG employee prior to 9/30/85, your benefits 
become effective 9/30/85.  If you were disabled or on a leave of 
absence on that date, your coverage will be delayed until you 
return to work.
 
 
I HAVE A DEPENDENT WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED ON 9/30/85.  IS MY 
DEPENDENT COVERED UNDER THE OLD PLAN OR THE NEW PLAN?
 
                                                                Page  2

If a dependent was confined in a hospital or convalescent nursing 
home prior to 9/30/85, he/she will be covered under the old plan 
until discharged.  The day after discharge, the dependent will be 
covered under the new plan.
 
 
DO I HAVE TO SATISFY AN ADDITIONAL 1985 ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE WITH 
GENERAL AMERICAN BEFORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE?
 
Deductible expenses incurred between 1/1/85 and 9/29/85 under 
your previous health plan apply toward General American's 1985 
deductible.  If the deductible on your previous plan was less 
than General American's, you will need to satisfy the difference.  
This information was sent by the previous carrier to General 
American on 9/30/85.
 
NOTE:  Under the General American Plan, deductible expenses 
incurred during October, November or December apply toward the 
following year's deductible.
 
 
WHAT DO I DO WITH BILLS INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85 THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN SUBMITTED?
 
All claims must be submitted to your previous carrier as soon as 
possible.  Send claims to:
 
     Former Tymshare/Tymnet employees:
 
          New Systems Inc.
          P.O. Box 11290
          San Francisco, CA.  94101
 
     Former Microdata employees:
 
          Northwestern National Life Insurance Company
          Regional Claims Center
          730 Fairmont Avenue - Suite 202
          Glendale, CA  91203
 
 
HOW WILL GENERAL AMERICAN KNOW ABOUT DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES I 
SUBMITTED AFTER 9/30/85 FOR EXPENSES INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85?
 
Keep your copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form which 
accompanies all claim payments.  Attach this form to claims you 
submit to General American so that you are credited with the 
proper deductible amount.
 
 
WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PCS CARD?
 
Your PCS card(s) will be mailed by the end of October.  Until you 
receive your card, you must pay for the drug.  Keep the receipt 
which itemizes patient's name, doctor's name, prescription 
number, date, quantity dispensed and amount charged.  You will be 
reimbursed the charge for the drug, less the appropriate 
deductible ($1.50 or $3.00) by attaching the receipt to the PCS 
                                                                Page  3

claim form.  Claim forms are available from the Human Resources 
office.  This form requires information found only on your PCS 
card, so wait until you receive your card before submitting the 
form for reimbursement.  This procedure applies for drugs 
purchased for dependent children over age 19 or from non-
participating pharmacies.
 
 
HOW DO I FILL A PRESCRIPTION THROUGH THE MAIL ORDER OPTION?
 
You will receive a mail order form for the America's Pharmacy 
with your PCS card.  You may order by mail the amount prescribed 
by your doctor, up to a 6 month supply, by paying only one 
deductible.
 
 
WHO DOES MY DOCTOR/HOSPITAL CALL FOR VERIFICATION OF MY 
INSURANCE?
 
Call the MDC Group Insurance Office in St. Louis at
(314) 232-9181.
 
 
WHAT IF MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDS HOSPITALIZATION?

or General American will not pay the hospital bill.  Ask the 
doctor to call Monday through Friday:
 
     St. Louis Area          1-314-367-8401
     Minnesota               1-800-642-4456
     Other Areas             1-800-328-9903
 
 
WHAT ABOUT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS?
 
Your doctor must call for certification within one working day 
after admission to the hospital.
 
 
WHEN MUST I OBTAIN A SECOND SURGICAL OPINION?
 
Unless you obtain a second opinion for some non-emergency 
surgical procedures, General American will pay half the amount it 
would normally pay for the surgeon's fees.  These procedures are 
listed on page 13 of Your Group Insurance summary plan 
description.
 
 
WHAT IF A NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY?
 
Second opinions are not required in emergency situations.
 
 
ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL CLAIM PROCEDURES?
 
Yes.  When you get a second opinion, get a special sticker for 
your claim form from the Group Insurance Office or your Human 
                                                                Page  4

Resources Office.  The doctor giving the second opinion must 
complete and sign the sticker for the second opinion to be paid 
at 100%.  Separate bills for tests related to the second opinion, 
require a similar sticker for reimbursement.
 
 
WILL I RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PRE-ADMISSION 
CERTIFICATION AND THE SECOND SURGICAL OPINION FEATURES?
 
A mailing was sent to all ISG employees which included brochures 
on Second Surgical Opinions, Pre-Admission Certification and 
General American Plan information card(s).  If you did not 
receive this information, please contact Human Resources.
 
 
WHAT IF I STILL HAVE QUESTIONS OR NEED ADDITIONAL WALLET CARDS?
 
Call the MDC Group Insurance Office at (314) 232-9181.

may contact your Human Resources Office. Claim forms for General 
American are color coded:  Medical - White; Dental - Grey; Vision 
- Pink; PCS - Blue.
 
 
WHO DO I CALL TO FIND OUT IF THE CLAIM FORM I SUBMITTED HAS BEEN 
PROCESSED?
 
Claims are processed through St. Louis rather than locally.  
Please allow more time for your claim to be processed.  For 
inquiries, call the St. Louis Group Insurance Office, (314)

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

Subject:  RESTRUCTURING OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS 
          COMPANY AND DISSOLUTION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
          DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS COMPANY


We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

    MCDONNELL DOUGLAS
INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

1.  As of today Jerry Causley is promoted to the position of 
    Information Systems Group Executive Officer, reporting to me.  
    The ISG Organization structure will otherwise remain as it is, 
    except that Jerry Causley will also retain his position as 
    President, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
    International.

2.  Bob Fischer will become the Chairman of the Information 
    Systems Group, reporting to me.  In that role Bob will 
    continue to develop ISG's strategies and will be the focal 
    point for corporate issues affecting ISG, including continuing 
    as a member of the HQ Council.  Also, he will provide 
    leadership in top level sales and marketing activities, and he 
    will continue on the boards of directors of Sanus Health 
    Corporation and the National Electronic Information 
    Corporation.

3.  Jerry Causley has been the head of MDISI since January 1985.  
    He joined CMC in England in January 1970 as a district sales 
    manager.  CMC was acquired by Microdata in 1977.  After a 
    series of pomotions Jerry was named Managing Director of 
    Microdata Information Systems Limited in 1980, responsible for 
    all Microdata sales and service activities in the U.K., Middle 
    East, and Africa.  Early in 1984 he became Senior Vice 
    President of Microdata Corporation with responsibility for all 
    of Europe.  In his positions of increasing responsibility, 
    Jerry has built strong teams and achieved outstanding results.

4.  I believe Jerry will be able to provide strong leadership to 
    turn ISG's strategic vision into reality.  Please give him 
    your full cooperation.

I am very pleased to announce the appointment of John Thornber as 
Executive Vice President, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
International.  John will be responsbile for the day-to-day 
operational control of MDISI.  He will report to me as I will 
continue to act as President of MDISI, as well as Group Executive 
Officer of ISG.

During the first six months of 1986, MDISI has continued to grow 
in revenue and profits but still has a major task during the 
second half of this year to achieve plan.

The Sales and Marketing direction of MDISI is well under control, 
thanks to the strengths of the Regional Managers and the Business 
Planning Groups.  I therefore have every confidence that the 
strong management team reporting to John will ensure that MDISI 
has yet another year of outstanding performance.

I know you will all join me in supporting John and wishing him 
every success in his new role.

     ========================================================================
     The Monthly Newsletter of the APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY
     from
     ACS MARKETING PUBLICATIONS, Cupertino, CA . . . July 22, 1986
     ========================================================================


       . . . Tym/COMM 4.0 RELEASED AUGUST 6:  MORE FOR THE SAME PRICE . . .

     Tym/COMM 4.0 now offers more, but at a price that keeps this product
     competitive with CrossTalk and SmartModem.

     New features include...

     X.PC, an advanced async communications protocol that enables users to
     connect to up to 15 different hosts or network services
     TYMGEN, a simple menu-driven means to set parameters (a breeze for
     novice users)
     SNAPSHOT, a feature that "takes a picture" of scrolling data
     REPLAY, the feature that displays that picture

     Enhancements for the novice and the experienced Tym/COMM user:  improved
     menus, monitor color control, and 20 new procedure statements

     Tym/COMM's excellent support continues through the Customer Service
     Center 800 number and with a revised user's guide that documents the new
     features.

     All this for the competitive price of $295.  However, the other guys
     don't offer site licensing.  (Yet!)  According to product manager Rose
     Hayden, corporations want good discounts, and site licenses are an
     effective way to offer discounts.

     New data sheets accompanied the July NEWSFLASH.  Demo diskettes are
     available.  To learn more about the new features or to obtain a demo
     diskette, contact Rose Hayden at ACS.R/HAYDEN.


              . . . ONTYME VERSION 22:  JUST AROUND THE CORNER . . .

     The release of OnTyme Version 22 is scheduled for mid-August, 1986.  The
     new features are highlighted below:

     Pathway--enables users to access any computer on the TYMNET network
     XMODEM Protocol--provides error-free file transfer
     X.ONTYME--increases throughput, efficiency, and saves money
     The Reply command--sends the contents of the workspace to the original
     recipients of the message
     Subject line--the text supplied by the sender appears in the message
     header and all the message lists (in, out, old, long, short, etc.)

     For a more detailed description of Pathway, XMODEM, and X.ONTYME, please
     see the enclosed data sheet.













                              . . . HOT SALES . . .

     The Newsflash congratulates the following marketing reps, who have
     closed, renewed, or enhanced significant new business.  New business is
     indicated by an asterisk.

       . . . NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL PILOT CLOSES--BIG ONTYME ACCOUNT . . .

     ACS Sales Specialist Diane Biegel and Sales Rep Claire Pribula closed an
     OnTyme application with the National Cotton Council of America for a
     pilot to run 9/86 through 1/87.

     The OnTyme pilot will enable the National Cotton Council, located in
     Memphis, Tennessee, to save time and money and to communicate between

     - farmers and the USDA
     - its staff members
     - dealers and customers of the cotton industry

     GTE Telemail came in with a figure 30% lower than ACS.  But ACS got the
     close due to our superior consulting services, our ability to address
     the National Cotton Council's long-term needs, and the fact that
     Telemail has inferior error checking.

     Pribula first called on the National Cotton Council in September '85.
     In May '86, she got the RFP.  She contacted Diane Biegel, and, with the
     help of Nancy Browning, Bill Price, Nancy Shelton, Nick Corsano, and the
     Customer Service Center, made the close in July '86.

     According to Nancy Browning, ACS Manager of Business Development, this
     foot in the door has great potential for big future business!


                  . . . HOW TO PREPARE A WINNING PROPOSAL . . .

               by Patt Christie, Sr. Section Mgr., Marketing Media

     How well you prepare proposals may determine the success of your
     organization.  Here are some suggested mechanics from a just-announced
     book written to help you market your services:

     * Begin each new section at the top of the page
     * Be sure that no section is more than three times the number of pages
       of any other section
     * Place the table of contents and a list of exhibits and appendixes in
       the front of the proposal
     * Try to limit lists to six items; make nine the maximum
     * Include exhibits in the text adjacent to where the exhibit is noted








     * Avoid acronyms, abbreviations, and colloquialisms.  Write for an
       uninformed audience that has moderate interest
     * Limit sentence length.  Sentences that run more than 30 words and
       contain more than two ideas are difficult to follow
     * Include a "you will receive" benefit statement for each "we will do"
       statement

                  . . . PUBS SYSTEM STILL SEMI-OPERATIONAL . . .

     All publications printed before May 1986 are still available through the
     Pubs system.  All new publications--and ACS has printed quite a few
     since then--are available by sending an OnTyme to ACS.B/RAYMOND or by
     writing to Bob Raymond at 20705 Valley Green Drive, Cupertino, CA
     95014.  Check the "New in Pubs" column to see what is new--a new
     OrderXchange brochure, a Tym/COMM 4.0 data sheet, a new OnTyme price
     schedule, several issues of "What's Selling?"  All are packaged by 25.

     ACS publishes many collateral pieces to assist your sales efforts.
     Check them out.


                      . . . FROM THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR . . .

     LEGENDS...

     How many basketball players can shoot, pass, and rebound?  How many
     football players can run, pass, and defend?  How many baseball players
     can run, hit, and pitch?

     How many ISG Sales Reps are maintaining existing business relationships,
     selling the big ticket items, and building a growing base of business?
     It's a lot to ask, but all three of these are critical to our long-term
     success.

     The pressure is on to close big opportunities before the end of the
     year.  It's business as usual -- right?  Come 1/1/87, you'll be asked
     "what have you done for me lately" by you-know-who!

     In between selling those "big ones," why not sell two or three pieces of
     ACS business?  Come January, you might have an "extra" $15,000/mo.  By
     June, with our nurturing, you've got $30,000/mo.  By year end, the
     combined ongoing revenue from these closes could be worth half a million
     dollars a year!


                  . . . XCHANGE CALENDARS STILL AVAILABLE . . .

     ACS still has some Xchange calendars available.  They cover from July 86
     to July 87, and they are available in lots of 10 from ACS.B/RAYMOND.

To:           All ISG Employees

Subject:      STATUS OF ISG MERIT REVIEW PROGRAM AND EMPLOYEE
              SAVINGS PLAN




In the past few months, there has been considerable discussion
over two ISG-wide issues:

    o    When will merit increases be reinstated?

    o    What changes, if any, will be made in the ISG Employee
         Savings Plan?

The purpose of this memo is to let you know where things stand
regarding these issues.

We plan to resume ISG's merit review program in January 1987.
While I cannot provide details just yet, I can assure you that
whatever process we use will address the fact that some
individuals have gone longer than others without a merit review.
I realize that the suspension of such review has been, at best, a
major inconvenience for all of us.  However, it really has
bettered our chances of achieving ISG's earnings objective.  I'm
counting on your continued patience until we've finished the job
we set out to do this year.

As for the ISG Employee Savings Plan, you received word several
months ago that we were considering changes in the way matching
contributions are handled.  After careful study, however, we have
decided to make no changes in the plan at this time.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Tym/COMM 4.0 is now available!  Tym/COMM 4.0 provides multiple channel
     X.PC support, which enables users to connect to 15 different hosts or
     network services simultaneously.  Tym/COMM 4.0 also contains TYMGEN ,
     a menu-driven program that makes it easy to set operating parameters,
     even for novice users.

     Other enhancements include approximately 20 new procedure statements,
     variable support, and expanded appendices in the user's manual.
