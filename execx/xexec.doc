INTRODUCTION


  1.0  INTRODUCTION

  1.1  Overview

  The TYMCOM-X Job Processing  System  replaces  the  TYMCOM-IX  and  TYMCOM-X
  products PERP, DEFER, PCOM and COM.  The purpose is to provide a system that
  will process command files both instantaneously and periodically on and  for
  a  single  PDP-10  host  computer.   Like  it's  predecessor,  PERP, the Job
  Processor allows scheduling of a job for execution on a periodic basis.  The
  period may be specified in months, weeks, days, hours or minutes starting at
  the date-time of submission or from a specified date-time.

  The system is also capable of directly running programs that do not  require
  interactive  terminal input on their command port.  The terminal output of a
  command file job can be written to a log file.



  1.2  Notational Conventions And Definitions

  A.  Square brackets "[" and "]" are used to enclose  optional  items  or  an
      optional  syntax.  The brackets are not part of the actual Job Processor
      syntax.

  B.  Angle brackets "<" and ">" are used to enclose the names  of  conceptual
      ideas and entities.  These names are given in the examples to illustrate
      the class of information entered.  These brackets are not  part  of  the
      Job Processor syntax.

  C.  <cr> means "carriage return".  This is not a conceptual idea or  entity,
      as other words in angle brackets are.

  D.  In the examples used in this document, lines preceeded immediately by  a
      period  (.)  are  usually commands typed to the monitor.  These commands
      work both in PDP10 mode and in XEXEC mode.  PDP10 mode is used  in  this
      document.

  E.  In the examples below, lines preceeded by an asterisk  (*)  are  usually
      data  lines  to  be  read  by the program being run.  See the section on
      prefix characters for more detailed information.

  F.  In the examples in this document, computer output is shown in upper case
      and user input is shown in lower case, as much as possible.

THE COMMAND FILE


  2.0  THE COMMAND FILE

  2.1  Getting Started

  To run a job as though it were being run from  a  terminal,  the  user  must
  first create a command file.  This is a file which contains all the input to
  the job stream that the user would normally enter from a terminal.  The file
  is  a normal text file which may be created using any text editor available,
  (EDITOR, PEAK, VUE, etc.), or by any program which writes normal  text  (for
  example, output from a Tymshare-BASIC or FORTRAN program).  The command file
  may contain monitor commands, input to programs, and various commands to the
  Job Processor itself.

  An example follows.  If the terminal session includes:

      .run progrm
      REPORTING PERIOD: daily
      SEPARATE DIVISIONS: yes
      SELECTION CRITERIA: collect all
      OUTPUT FILE NAME: report.lst

  then the following would be included in the Job Processor command file:

      .run progrm
      *daily
      *yes
      *collect all
      *report.lst


  A line of the command file is never read or acted upon until the job  stream
  being  controlled  by  the  file  is  ready  to  accept  input  from the Job
  Processor.  This resembles a user not entering the line of input  until  the
  terminal displays a prompt for input.

  To instruct the system to execute the commands in an existing command  file,
  the user would enter the SUBMIT command at the monitor prompt.  (See below.)
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                 Page 3
THE COMMAND FILE


  2.2  Command File Format

  A.  Line Prefix Characters

      The PERP and PCOM systems have allowed the user to define a line of  the
      command  file  as  a command to the controlling system by use of a colon
      (:) as the command line prefix character (the  first  character  of  the
      line).   The TYMCOM-X Job Processor System provides an extension to that
      convention.  When  any  of  the  characters  which  can  act  as  prefix
      characters appears as the first character in a line of the command file,
      the Job Processor removes the prefix character and  presents  all  other
      characters  in  that line only to a pre-defined process, as specified by
      the prefix character.

      The ability to control where the line goes can prevent problems, such as
      job  crashes.   For  example, a command line (such as "EXIT"), meant for
      the user's program, could crash the job  if  sent  to  the  monitor.   A
      program could have need for this line only under selected conditions and
      could be finished execution under other conditions.  The times when  the
      program  is  already finished, the prefix character can prevent the line
      from being sent to the monitor and crashing the job.

      The prefix characters are not sent to the job stream.  They are stripped
      from  the line before the line is sent.  These characters are never used
      in commands to the monitor, but  such  a  character  may  be  the  first
      character to a user's program.  If a prefix character is to be sent to a
      program, it must be preceded by another prefix  character  (such  as  an
      asterisk).

      The individual line prefix characters and the processes  to  which  they
      exclusively send communication are as follows:

      1.  Colon (:) - to the TYMCOM-X Job Processor only.
          All lines  beginning  with  a  colon  are  interpreted  by  the  Job
          Processor.   These  commands  are  never sent to the monitor or to a
          user program.

      2.  Period (.) - to the Job Processor or to the monitor.
          Lines beginning with a period  may  be  Job  Processor  commands  or
          monitor  commands.   If  the  line is not a valid command to the Job
          Processor, it is sent to the job stream.  If  a  user's  program  is
          running,  the  Job  Processor  waits  until  the program will accept
          input.  It then interrupts the program, forcing the  job  stream  to
          monitor  level (with an implied :ESCAPE command), and sends the line
          to the monitor.

          Job processor commands take precedence over other commands  even  if
          they    are   identical.    For   example,   the   monitor   command
          ".COMPILE FOO.MAC", which runs the MACRO assembler on file  FOO.MAC,
          must  be  spelled  out to avoid confusion with Job Processor command
          ":COM FOO", which calls a nested command file.

THE COMMAND FILE


      3.  Asterisk (*) - to a user's program only.
          Lines beginning with an asterisk are only sent  to  the  job  stream
          when the user's program is waiting for input.  If the line cannot be
          sent to the job stream (because it is in monitor mode) the  line  is
          discarded and the next line of the command file is processed.

      4.  Equal sign (=) - to a user's program only.
          Lines beginning with an equal sign are treated  as  lines  beginning
          with  an  asterisk  with  one  exception.   The carriage-return line
          terminator sequence is not sent to the job stream.  This can be very
          valuable for running programs which require input without the ending
          carriage return.

      5.  No prefix character.
          If no prefix character is specified, the line will be  sent  to  the
          job stream as soon as the stream is waiting for input, whether it is
          in user program mode or monitor mode.

      6.  Prefix characters as data to a user program.
          To send a line to a user program,  an  asterisk  or  equal  sign  is
          normally  used.  If the first character to be sent to a user program
          is one of the special prefix characters, it must simply be  prefixed
          by an asterisk or equal sign.

          Example:

              *=FOO                 (The data sent to the program is "=FOO")


      Summary
          The following is generally true and can be  helpful  in  remembering
          when these prefixes are used:  A colon prefix is used where it would
          be used in a TYMCOM-IX PERP command file.  A period prefix would  be
          used  where  a period prompt should appear in the log file (in PDP10
          mode).  An asterisk prefix would be  used  where  a  normal  program
          prompt  should appear (which, in some programs is an asterisk).  The
          equal sign is used to precede any program input which  must  exactly
          resemble  what  appears  only on that line of the command file (thus
          excluding the "invisible" carriage-return characters at the  end  of
          the line).



  B.  Commands

      Commands to the Job Processor which  are  imbedded  in  the  command  or
      control file employ the colon (:) line prefix character.  These commands
      are generally similar to those available in the  TYMCOM-IX  PERP  system
      and  have the same format.  For compatibility with other DEC-10/20 batch
      control systems, these commands may also use the period (.) line  prefix
      character.

THE COMMAND FILE


      1.  :ESCAPE
          Interrupt the currently executing program when it is next ready  for
          input,  forcing the job stream to monitor level.  This is similar to
          the user entering a user interrupt while the program is waiting  for
          input.   (A "user interrupt" is a control-C when in PDP10 mode or an
          <ESC> when in XEXEC mode.)

      2.  :QUIT
          Cause normal termination of the running job.

      3.  :REMARK
          This line is a comment to the TYMCOM-X Job Processor.  It causes  no
          action  to  be taken.  However, it is printed in the log file if one
          is created.  (Not currently written to the log!  05-Nov-86)

      4.  :STOP
          Causes abnormal termination of the running job.  If the  Option  LOG
          ERROR is specified (see below), then :STOP will cause the logfile to
          be saved.

      5.  :COM <file>
          Begin taking commands from the named command file.  The called  file
          is  a  standard  Job  Processor  command file.  Command files may be
          nested approximately 5 deep with this command.  An  optional  syntax
          includes  specifying  file  parameters  on  the  same line after the
          filename.  
          For example, 
              :COM <file> <parameter>,<parameter>,...


      6.  :SEND <key arg>
          Transmits unformatted text to the processing frame.  Normally,  PCOM
          removes line-feeds and other end of line characters from the command
          file.  In some  instances,  the  user  will  need  to  send  special
          characters directly.

      7.  :SEND CHARACTER <nnn>
          Transmits the character represented by the octal number <nnn>.

      8.  :SEND STRING "<text>"
          Transmits the literal string "<text>".  The string of text  must  be
          surrounded by double quote marks.

      9.  :SEND FILE <file>
          Transmits the contents of <file>.  Line-feed characters  immediately
          following  a  carriage-return  are  removed.  However, no other data
          interpretation occurs.

     10.  :<par1>=<val1> [,<par2>=<val2> [, ... <parN>=<valN>]]
          Assigns value <val> to parameter <par>.

     11.  :DEFINE <par1>=<val1> [,<par2>=<val2> [, ... <parN>=<valN>]]
          Assigns value <val> to parameter-variable <par>.   This  command  is
          identical  to,  :<par>=<val>  above and is included to be compatible

THE COMMAND FILE


          with TYMCOM-IX PERP.
          NOTE:  both forms of this command allow multiple assignments.

     12.  :TIME <n>
          Changes the job's run time limit to <n> minutes.  The  default  time
          limit for job execution is 60 minutes.

     13.  :GOTO <label>
          Jump forward to <label>, in processing of command file.   The  label
          must  be  in the command file, after the occurrence of this command,
          and in the proper format, for this jump to  occur.   Otherwise  this
          command is ignored.

     14.  :BACKTO <label>
          Jump back to <label>, in processing of command file.  The label must
          be  in  the command file, before the occurrence of this command, and
          in the proper format, for this jump to occur.  If not, this  command
          is ignored.

     15.  <label>::
          Defines a label in the command file.   The  label  is  used  as  the
          object  of  a  command file :GOTO statement, the object of a command
          file :BACKTO statement, or the location in the file for the  job  to
          restart.   The  last  applies  if  the  RESTART LABEL option and the
          LABEL <label> option are specified while the job is  being  INSERTed
          into the Job Processor's queue (See below).

          NOTE:  Alternative formats for defining the label follow.   This  is
          to allow consistency with the Tymshare PERP and PCOM formats:

              ::<label> <cr>
              <label>:

  3.1  Job Submission

  A job is submitted to the Job Processor while in monitor mode,  by  entering
  the  command SUBMIT.  In response to the SUBMIT prompt, commands can then be
  entered to do the following:

  A.  Enter  date  and  time  information  and  job  specifications  into  the
      processing queue.

  B.  Print job status information at the user's terminal.

  C.  Modify date and job information for jobs in the processing queue.

  D.  Otherwise aid the user of the TYMCOM-X Job Processor System.



  Example of the SUBMIT command:

      SUBMIT <cr>
      TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR  <version number>  <date>  <time>

      SUBMIT>

  A job can be entered for immediate execution  or  for  scheduled  execution.
  The  scheduled  execution can be a single execution or periodically repeated
  execution.  All jobs  are  entered  with  the  INSERT  command.   Specifying
  execution  date and time for a scheduled job is done with the DATES command.
  An alternative way of entering execution date and time information is as  an
  option  specified  in  response  to the OPTIONS prompt, which is part of the
  INSERT command (see below).  



  3.2  Specifying Execution Dates And Times - The DATES Command


  The DATES command tells the Job  Processor  to  accept  the  date  and  time
  specification  for  a  job.   These  specifications  can  be as simple or as
  complex as the user needs for defining the scheduling  of  the  user's  job.
  The  DATES  command can be entered with its date-time specification included
  on the same line as the DATES command, or the DATES command can  be  entered
  on  one  line  and  the  user  will  be  prompted  to  enter  the  date-time
  specification on another line.

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                 Page 8
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  Formats:

      SUBMIT> dates <date-time specification> <cr>

                  or

      SUBMIT> dates <cr> 

      ENTER YOUR Date-time SENTENCE:
      <date-time specification> <cr>


  The date-time specification is, in its  simplest  form,  "<date> AT <time>".
  The time specification must meet the following criteria:

  A.  The time is the user's  time,  as  the  host  system  would  display  in
      response to the DAYTIME command.

  B.  The time must be specified in a 24-hour day format.

  C.  If the time specified is before 10:00, the number  specifying  the  hour
      may be written as one or two digits, with or without the preceding zero.

  D.  If the time is after midnight and before 1:00 the hour must be specified
      as  0  or  00.  If the zero hour is not specified, the number of minutes
      will be interpreted as the number of hours.




  Examples of time specifications:

      Daytime              Enter
      --------             -----
       8:00 AM             08:00
       9:15 AM              9:15
      11:00 AM                11
      12:15 AM              0:15
       3:00 PM   (15:00)     :15
      11:45 PM             23:45


  For completeness, the user can include the words OF,  AT,  and  THE  in  the
  date-time  specifications, however, the Job Processor does not require these
  words.  Any words or punctuation which the Job Processor does not understand
  will be ignored.

  The date-time expression ends with a carriage return.  The user can continue
  the  expression  on  more than one line by continuing to type past the right
  edge of the display and allowing the display  to  wrap  to  the  next  line.
  (This  wrapping  of  the line of input is done by either the terminal or the
  TYMCOM-X host, depending upon  terminal  capabilities,  characteristics  and
  settings,  and  upon  the  TTY  WIDTH value thr has set in the TYMCOM-X
  host.  This wrapping affects the user's display only, and does  not  send  a
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                 Page 9
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  carriage return to the SUBMIT program.)

  Each time a job is run, after the execution is completed the next  execution
  date and time is computed.  If no more executions are to occur, nothing more
  is done.  If there is to be another run of the job, the job is entered  into
  the queue for execution at the new date and time.

  If, when the job is entered into the Job Processor,  the  current  date  and
  time  meet  the  criteria  for  execution  the  job  is run immediately.  If
  execution date and time is not specified the job is run immediately.  

  NOTE:  The user should always use the the TEST, or the EXPRESS  and  DISPLAY
  commands  to  assure that his date and time specification produces the exact
  execution dates and times he requires.  (See below.)

  If an expression specifies a number of months, with no  modifiers,  the  job
  runs on the first day of that month.  If an expression specifies a date, but
  no time, the job runs at midnight (00:00 hours) at the start  of  that  day.
  The names of months and days of the week can be shortened to the first three
  characters.

  When a number is used, it must be typed as digits, not spelled out.  This is
  true  of  cardinal  numbers and ordinal numbers of more than one digit.  For
  example, "5" and "13TH" are acceptable but "FIVE" and "THIRTEENTH" are  not.
  All  ordinal  numbers may include the ending which indicates that the number
  is ordinal (such as the "TH" ending in "25TH").  Ordinal numbers of only one
  digit  may  be spelled out (such as "FIRST", "THIRD" and "NINTH") or written
  as a digit plus the two-character ending (such as "1ST", "3RD" AND "9th").



  3.3  Date And Time Expressions


  The most basic expression specifies date and time, with  date  specified  as
  one  date,  a  day  of  the  week,  or  a  day of the month.  The format is:
  "<date> AT <time>".

  A.  Specific single date

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 10
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      The date may be specified in any of three formats:

      Format:                                 Example:
          mmm dd, yyyy AT <time>                  July 4, 1986 AT 5:30
                                                  Sep 30, 1986 AT 23:00
                                                  June 19, 86 AT 9

          mm/dd/yyyy At <time>                    10/23/1986 AT 23:15
                                                  7/4/86 AT 5:00
                                                  09/05/86 AT 13

          dd-mmm-yyyy AT <time>                   10-JAN-1986 AT 12:30
                                                  5-Jun-86 AT 3
                                                  07-dec-1986 AT 9:00

      In the format notation "dd" means the day of the month.  "mmm" means the
      month  name  spelled  out, with a minimum abbreviation of three letters.
      "mm" means the number of the month.  "yyyy" means the  year  number,  as
      either the full four digits or the last two digits of the year.

      The second format, with all numbers, is American  style:   month  first,
      then day, then year.

  B.  Day of the week

      The date can be specified as a day of the week.  The name of the day  of
      the week may be abbreviated to as few as three letters.  

      Format:

          <day of week> AT <time>.

      Example:

          Wednesday AT 12
          Thu AT 5:30


  C.  Repetition interval

      The periodically  repeated  job  can  be  scheduled  by  specifying  the
      interval  between the job's start times.  This interval can be specified
      as a number of months, a number of days, a number of hours or  a  number
      of  minutes.   The  periodically  repeated jobs are specified to the Job
      Processor by the word EVERY (see below), followed  by  specification  of
      the interval.

      1.  Interval as number of months

          The interval can be specified in months, up to 12 months.  A special
          capability  of specifying a number of months interval is the ability
          to specify the day of the month for execution.  If the  day  of  the
          month  is not specified, the job is executed on the first day of the
          month.

          Format:

              [<n>TH DAY] EVERY <m> MONTHS AT <time>


          Examples:  (The following examples include a job to be  executed  on
          the  first  of every month, a job to be executed on the first of the
          month every six months, and a quarterly job to be  executed  on  the
          7th of the month.)

              1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12
              EVERY 6 MONTHS AT 23:00
              7TH DAY EVERY 3 MONTHS AT 7:00


      2.  Interval as number of days

          The interval can be specified as any number of days, up to 365 days.

          Format:

              EVERY <n> DAYS AT <time>

          Examples:

              EVERY 14 DAYS AT 5:00
              EVERY DAY AT 12:00


      3.  Interval as number of hours

          The interval may be specified as any  number  of  hours,  up  to  24
          hours.  Time of day is not specified in this format.

          Format:

              EVERY <n> HOURS

          Example:

              EVERY 4 HOURS


      4.  Interval as number of minutes

          The interval may be specified as any number of minutes, up  to  1440
          minutes  (1440  minutes  equals  24  hours).   Time  of  day  is not
          specified in this format.

          Format:  

              EVERY <n> MINUTES

          Example:

              EVERY 45 MINUTES




  D.  Qualifiers for Date Specifications:

      Simple date expressions can be modified or combined, through the use  of
      the words EVERY, AND, AFTER, BEFORE and EXCEPT.  Use of these qualifiers
      can provide much greater flexibility  in  specifying  desired  execution
      dates  and  times.   These  qualifiers  allow  specification of repeated
      processing, and multiple criteria for execution including:  execution on
      date-time[1]  and  on  date-time[2],  or execution only after a date and
      time, or execution only before a date and time, or execution every  time
      except a specified date and time.

      1.  Date expression modifier - EVERY

          Preceding a date expression with this modifier  specifies  that  the
          job  will  be  executed  repeatedly, every time the specification is
          satisified.  This is used with simple date expressions, to make them
          repeating   or   periodic  date  specifications.   (See  "Repetition
          Interval", above.) Periodic expressions are  formed  in  periods  of
          months,  days, hours and minutes.  A period of weeks is specified in
          days.  

          Format:

              EVERY <date expression> AT <time>

                        or

              EVERY <time period>

          Examples:

              EVERY FRIDAY AT 12:00
              EVERY 3 MONTHS
              EVERY 21 DAYS
              EVERY 8 HOURS
              EVERY 45 MINUTES


      2.  Date-time expression conjunction - AND

          Simple or basic date-time expressions can be combined with the  word
          AND  to  form  a  multi-part  expression.   Such  an expression will
          specify the execution of the job whenever  either  specification  is
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 13
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


          satisified.    Each   individual   date-time  expression  may  be  a
          Repetition  Interval  type,  with  its  own  EVERY  modifier.   Each
          date-time  expression  must have its own time specified, or its time
          defaults to midnight (00:00 hours).  

          Format:

              <date-time expression> AND <date-time expression>

          Examples:

              EVERY MONDAY AT 12:00 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 12:00
              1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 00 AND 15TH DAY EVERY MONTH AT 00
              EVERY DAY AT 5:00 AND EVERY 8 HOURS


      3.  Date expression modifier - AFTER

          Repetition Interval type  jobs  may  be  specified  to  start  their
          regularly  scheduled  execution  at  a specific date and time in the
          future.  This start date and time is  the  point  of  reference  for
          scheduling  future  executions of the job.  This start date and time
          is specified with the AFTER modifier, with  a  date-time  expression
          which  specifies  when  (the  date and time after which) the job may
          start.  The AFTER modifier expression consists  of  the  word  AFTER
          followed  by  the  limiting date and time.  This modifier expression
          must follow the basic expression it applies to, and it affects  only
          that  expression.   Each  simple  expression in an AND type multiple
          expression must have its own AFTER expression if one is desired.

          Format:

              <basic date and time expression> AFTER <limiting date and time>

          Examples:

              EVERY SUNDAY AT 00 AFTER 1 JULY 1986 AT 00
              EVERY 8 HOURS AFTER FRIDAY AT 08:00
              EVERY MONDAY AT 12 AFTER 6/30/86 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 12 AFTER
              6/30/86
              1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AFTER 1/1/87 AND 15TH DAY EVERY MONTH AFTER
              1/1/87


      4.  Date expression modifier - BEFORE

          Repetition Interval type jobs can have an ending date and  time  set
          by  using  the BEFORE modifier, followed by a specific date and time
          which specify when the job can no longer be  executed.   The  BEFORE
          modifier  expression  may  appear only once in an expression, and it
          must follow all other date-time specifications  in  the  expression.
          It  ends any execution of the job to which it applies.  Execution of
          the job can not start on or after the date and time specified in the
          BEFORE modifier expression.
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 14
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


          Format:

              <date and time expression> BEFORE <limiting date and time>

          Examples:

              1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12:00 BEFORE 1 OCT 1987 AT 00:00
              EVERY MONDAY AT 19:00 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 19:00 BEFORE 1/1/87 AT
              00:00


      5.  Date expression modifier - EXCEPT

          Repetition Interval type job scheduling can be  modified,  to  allow
          exceptions to the job's regularly scheduled execution.  This is done
          with the modifier EXCEPT, followed by a date-time expression.   This
          expression   may   be   complex,   using   the  AND  and  the  EVERY
          constructions.  For the EXCEPT expression to  prevent  an  otherwise
          scheduled  job  execution  from  occuring,  the  date  and  time  it
          specifies must exactly match the execution date and  time  specified
          in the preceding, execution part of the total date-time expression.

          NOTE:   The  exception  date-time  specification  must   match   the
          execution date-time specification to the minute!

          Format:

              <execution date-time expression> EXCEPT <exception date-time
              expression>

          Examples:

              FIRST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12:00 EXCEPT 1-JANUARY-1987 AT 12:00
              EVERY DAY AT 9 EXCEPT EVERY FRIDAY AT 9 AND EVERY SATURDAY AT 9




  E.  Special Expression - The STARTUP Specification

      Execution of a job which must start whenever the host system is  started
      (such  as  a  job  which  must run continually) is done with the STARTUP
      date-time specification.  When this date-time specification is given  in
      the DATES command or option to the INSERT command, the job it applies to
      will be started every time the Job Processor is started.  This  includes
      any  time  the host or the Job Processor starts up after it has not been
      running.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  3.4  Commands Which List Date-Time Information


  Information about the dates and times which the Job Processor translates the
  last  previously  entered  date-time  expression  into  is  available.  This
  information is available in the form of a list of the next  scheduled  dates
  and  times  for  the  job's  execution,  or  a  restatement of the date-time
  expression by the Job Processor in its own wording, or both.  

  A.  Listing Scheduled Dates And Times - DISPLAY

      The DISPLAY command gives a list of the dates  which  the  last  entered
      DATES  expression  specifies.  The user can use this list to verify that
      he has specified the dates he wants.

      The dates are printed chronologically, showing the  month,  date,  year,
      day of the week, and run time in user's local time.

      The DISPLAY command gives the  date  command  in  groups  of  10  dates.
      Typing  a  carriage  return  terminates the display command.  Typing any
      character other than <cr>  displays  the  next  10  scheduled  execution
      date-times.

      The example below illustrates  the  DISPLAY  command  with  simple  date
      expressions.  All following examples were run on June 2, 1986.

      Example:


          SUBMIT> dates the fifth day of every month at 12 <cr>

          SUBMIT> display <cr>
          05-Jun-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Jul-86 SATURDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Aug-86 TUESDAY    AT 12:00:00
          05-Sep-86 FRIDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Oct-86 SUNDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Nov-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:00:00
          05-Dec-86 FRIDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Jan-86 MONDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Feb-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Mar-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00 
          - <CR> ENDS LIST, OTHER CHAR FOR MORE:<cr>


  B.  Printing The Date-time Specification - EXPRESS

      The EXPRESS command gives a rewording  of  the  date-time  specification
      entered in the last DATES command.  An expression printed by the EXPRESS
      command contains only the key words that  the  SUBMIT  program  used  to
      select the actual dates for job execution.  

      Example:
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 16
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


          SUBMIT> dates every monday at 12:00 <cr>

          SUBMIT> express <cr>
          EVERY MONDAY AT 12:00:00


  C.  Combining EXPRESS and DISPLAY Functions - TEST

      The TEST command is equivalent to the EXPRESS command  followed  by  the
      DISPLAY command.  TEST gives the date-time specification, then a list of
      the dates and times corresponding to the specification.  

      Example:


          SUBMIT> dates every other wednesday at 12:30 <cr>

          SUBMIT> test <cr>
          EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY AT 12:30:00
          04-Jun-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          18-Jun-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          02-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          16-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          30-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          13-Aug-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          27-Aug-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          10-Sep-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          24-Sep-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          08-Oct-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00 
          - <CR> ENDS LIST, OTHER CHAR FOR MORE:<cr>






  3.5  Entering A Job Into The Job Processing Queue - INSERT


  The INSERT command enters a job into the job processing queue and allows the
  users  to adjust values for options which affect the processing of job.  The
  start of  the  job's  execution  is  controlled  by  the  current  date-time
  specification.   This  is the date-time specification last entered, prior to
  completion of the current submission and not  previously  used  to  schedule
  another  job.   If the date and time are not specified, the job is scheduled
  to run immediately.

  The INSERT command may include specification of  the  name  of  the  command
  file,  and  the  name  of  the  log  file.   (If the job is the running of a
  non-interactive program, the user should enter the  name  of  the  program's
  executable file instead of command file name.) 

  The command file (or executable file) can reside in any directory  to  which
  the  user has access.  When a directory is not specified with the file name,
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 17
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  the Job Processor, by default, uses the  user's  logged-in  directory.   The
  first  six  characters  of the command file name, without the directory name
  and file extension (if any), becomes the JOB NAME in the Job  Processor  and
  in the output of the SYSTAT program.

  The user's log file can be written in any directory to which  the  user  has
  write  access.  In the event that a directory name is not furnished with the
  log file name, the Job Processor writes the log file to the user's currently
  active  ("GFD"ed)  directory,  by  default.   If  desired,  a job may be run
  without a log file being written.  

  The brief format for entering the names of the command and log files  is  to
  include  the  file names in the INSERT command line.  This is not necessary,
  however:  the user may enter each item of information separately,  and  wait
  for a prompt for the next item of information.

  The formats for entering the INSERT command and the  names  of  the  command
  file  (or  the  executable  program  file)  and the log file are as follows:
  .sk.tp 8 Brief format:

      SUBMIT> insert <log file> = <command file> <cr>

              or

      SUBMIT> insert <command file>, <log file> <cr>

  Long, interactive format:

      SUBMIT> insert <cr>

      NAME OF COMMAND FILE: <command file> <cr>
      NAME OF LOG FILE: <log file> <cr>


  If only the word INSERT is entered at the SUBMIT prompt, the  Job  Processor
  will  prompt  for the command file name.  If only a carriage return is typed
  at the "NAME OF COMMAND FILE:" prompt, then the insert will be aborted.

  The brief way to enter a job to run without creating a log file is  to  give
  only  the word INSERT and the name of the command file at the SUBMIT prompt.
  The Job Processor will then prompt for the name of the log file.

  If only a carriage return is typed at the log  file  prompt,  then  the  Job
  Processor will assume that the user does not want a log file.  This applies,
  whether the command file name is provided on the INSERT command line, or  in
  response to the command file prompt.

  3.6  Setting The Job's OPTIONs (part Of The INSERT Operation)


  During the INSERT operation, after the  INSERT  command  is  given  and  the
  command  (or  program) file and the log file names are given, options may be
  set.  This is indicated by the OPTIONS prompt:

      OPTIONS[Insert]:


  The user responds to the OPTIONS prompt with the name of  an  option  and  a
  value  for  that  option.   He  repeats the entry of option names and values
  until he has entered all the desired adjustments.  The user  terminates  the
  INSERT  operation  by typing a carriage return (only) at the OPTIONS prompt.
  He may cancel the current INSERT operation by typing ABORT  and  a  carriage
  return.  This will abort the insertion of the job and return the user to the
  SUBMIT prompt.

      (NOTE:  At any time that the OPTIONS prompt is displayed,  the  user
      may  type  HELP  in  order to view a listing of the possible options
      which he may specify, and the possible values which he can  set  for
      each option.  The current settings are enclosed in brackets.)


  The following list has the names of the options in one column, followed by a
  second  column  with  the  possible  values  for  that  option.  Words which
  literally specify possible values are in  upper  case.   Lower  case  words,
  surrounded  by  angle  brackets, name the type of value to be used.  Default
  values are within square brackets.


      Options          Values
      -------          ------
      LOG              [NONE], APPEND, SUPERSEDE
      DISPOSE          [KEEP], DELETE, ERROR
      MAIL             NONE, SUCCESS, ERROR, [ALWAYS]
      RESTART          [NONE], START, CHKPNT, LABEL, CONTINUE, REPEAT
      UNIQUE           NONE, USER, DIR, PATH, [JOB]
      PRIORITY         [0]

      DETACH           [NO], YES
      CCL              [NO], YES
      TMPNAME          [<none>] <temp file name>

      PARAMETERS       [none]
      DATES            <date and time specification>


  A detailed definition of each option statement follows.  The value to be set
  for  the  option  must  be  listed in the line that names the option, unless
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 19
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  stated otherwise in the option definition.

  A.  LOG 
      Specifies what logging action to take, especially when  a  file  already
      exists  with the same name, in the same directory, where the desired log
      file is to be written.

      Values:

          NONE            No log file will be written.
          APPEND          Append any new log information to the existing file.
          SUPERSEDE       Over-write the existing file, deleting prior file.
                          (Default, if a log file name is specified.)


  B.  DISPOSE
      Specifies how the Job Processor  is  to  dispose  of  the  log  file  it
      creates, after the job is complete.

      Values:

          KEEP            Keeps the log file under all conditions.
                          (Default, if a log file name is specified.)
          DELETE          Deletes the log file when the job is completed.  
                          If the job aborts prior to completion the file is 
                          saved.   
          ERROR           Keeps the log file if the job ends with an error
                          exit.  


  C.  MAIL
      Specifies  under  what  conditions  of  the  job's  completion  the  Job
      Processor is to send mail to the user who entered the job.

      Values:

          NONE            Never send mail.
          SUCCESS         Send mail only on successful completion of job.
          ERROR           Send mail only on error completion.
          ALWAYS          Send mail on every completion.  (Default)


  D.  RESTART
      Specifies where in the command file to restart the job when  the  system
      is restarted, or if the job is not to be restarted.

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 20
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:

          NONE            Do not restart.  (Default)
          START           Restart at the start of the command file, like a
                          normal start.  
          CHKPNT          Restart at the label specified with the :CHKPNT or
                          the :CHECKPOINT command.
          LABEL           Restart at the specified label in the command file.
                          The label must be specified in an OPTIONS entry.
          CONTINUE        Restart at the next line of the command file,
                          following the line being executed when the system
                          stopped.  
          REPEAT          Restart at the line that was being executed when the
                          system stoppped, repeating execution of that line.  


  E.  UNIQUE Specifies the job's attribute which must be unique for the job to
      run.  The user defines the attribute.  The Job Processor checks all jobs
      it is running at the time that is scheduled to start the user's job.  If
      another  job  is running with the same value for the specified attribute
      as the user's job, the user's job is not started.

      Values:

          NONE            No restrictions.  This job will run, regardless of 
                          other active jobs in the queue.
          USER            Do not run if any job is running which was entered
                          by a user logged in to the same user name as this
                          job.  
          DIR             Do not run if any job is running which was entered
                          by a user with the same connected (GFDed) directory
                          as the user entering this job.  
          PATH            Do not run if any job is running which was entered
                          by someone with the same USER and the same DIR as
                          this one.  
          JOB             Do not run if any job is running with the same job 
                          name, entered by someone with the same USER and and
                          the same DIR as this one.  (Default)


  F.  PRIORITY
      Specifies the job's priority in the Job Processor's queue.  If the  host
      system's  load is so heavy that not all jobs can be started on time, the
      priority level determines which jobs will be started first.  The  higher
      priority  levels  can  be  set  only  by people responsible for the host
      computer systems.  

      Values:

          <0 to 9>        Possible priority values.  (The default is 0.)
          <10 to 15>      For host system-critical programs only. 
                          (Requires special license.)

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 21
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  G.  LICENSE
      Specifies the license that will be set for the job every time the job is
      executed.   If a job requires license to run, the job must be given that
      license when it entered.

      The license must be specified on the same line as the word  LICENSE,  in
      response  to  the  OPTIONS  prompt.   This  line will be followed by the
      prompt "Oper name:" which asks for a name  valid  in  the  OPER  license
      setting  program.   After  a  name is supplied the user will be prompted
      with "Password:".  When a valid password is supplied the license is  set
      for the job.

      Values:

          <licenses>      The possible values are all the licenses any user
                          may have access to.  Multiple licenses may be 
                          specified by listing their two character codes,
                          separated by commas.  (The default is no license.)


  H.  CTYLOG
      Specifies that the job's log file output also be  logged  to  operator's
      console  terminal.  This is only for jobs necessary for the operation of
      the host computer system and special license is  required  to  set  this
      option.

      Values:

          NO              Do not log to operator's console.  (Default)
          YES             Log job's terminal-type output to operator's
                          console.  


  I.  RUN
      Specifies that the job is a program to be run without  a  command  file.
      This  can  be  used only with programs that require no terminal input on
      their command port.  Thus, this mode of running jobs is most useful  for
      programs like system programs, that run unattended.

      Values:

          NO              Job is run by a command file.  (Default)
          YES             Job is a non-interactive program without a command
                          file.  


  J.  DETACH
      Specifies that the job run type is DETACHED, that is, the job is to  run
      without  a  command  port.   This option cannot be used if a log file is
      specified.

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 22
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:

          NO              Do not run detached.  (Default)
          YES             Run the specified program in a detached frame.


  K.  CCL
      Specifies that the job type will run the specified program  at  the  CCL
      entry  point.   This  Concise  Command  Language (CCL) way of starting a
      program is used when the program is started by another program, such  as
      RPG.   This  is  generally  only  available with system utilities in the
      (SYS)  directory  (those  programs  called  with  the  "<program  name>"
      command).   If  a  job  is  started from the CCL entry point and accepts
      input, it must be passed parameters or given the name  of  a  temp  file
      containing the program inputs.

      Values:

          NO              Do not start from the program CCL entry point.
          YES             Start program from the CCL entry point.


  L.  TMPNAME
      Specifies to the Job Processor the name  of  the  temporary  file  which
      contains  the  parameters  to  the  RUN-type  program.   Since this only
      pertains to RUN-type jobs with the CCL entry point, setting this  option
      automatically sets the RUN and the CCL parameters.

      Values:

          <name>          The name of the three character temporary file the
                          program is expected to read at the CCL run address. 
                          (The default is none.)


  M.  LABEL
      Specifies the name of the label in the command file where the  job  will
      start.  This is also used if the RESTART option is turned on and the job
      is restarted.  The :CHKPNT and the :CHECKPOINT commands will set  a  new
      label  to  be  used on restart.  All label values are alpha-numeric from
      one to six characters in length.

      Values:

          <label>         One label, marking the location in the command file 
                          where the job will start (or restart).  
                          (The default is no label.)


  N.  TIMELIMIT
      Specifies the time, in minutes, that the job may run.   If  the  job  is
      still running when the time runs out the job will be aborted.  

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 23
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:

          <nnn>           Time in minutes.  (For no limit nnn = 0.)
                          (The default is 60.)


  O.  LOGLIMIT
      Specifies the maximum size in pages for the specified log  file.   (This
      feature  is  not  currently  implemented.)  This will be used to prevent
      run-away or neglected jobs from writing wasteful, over-sized log files.

      Values:

          <nn>            Log file size, in pages.  (for no limit nn = 0.)
                          (The default is 0.)  


  P.  TRULIMIT
      Specifies the maximum number of TRUs the job can  accumulate.   Any  job
      reaching  the maximum will abort.  This can be used to prevent jobs from
      running away and unnecessarily using up TRUs.  

      Values:

          <nnn>           TRUs.  (For no limit nnn = 0.)  (The default is 0.)


  Q.  PARAMETERS
      Specifies the parameters that are to be passed to the command  file,  or
      (if  the  the  job  is  a RUN-type job) to the program being run.  Note:
      specification of parameters for a RUN-type job  automatically  turns  on
      the  CCL option, so if the program is not written with a definition of a
      CCL entry point, parameters should not be defined for  a  RUN-type  job.
      The individual parameters among the values of this option statement must
      be separated by blanks, only.

      Values:

          <par1> [<par2> [... <parN>]]
                          The parameters to be passed to the job (or the
                          RUN-type program, if that is the job).  
                          (The default is none.)


  R.  DATES
      Specifies the date and time the job is to be run.  Used for entering (if
      the DATES command was not entered before entering the INSERT command) or
      modifying the date and time specification.  The command and  its  values
      are  entered  in  exactly  the  same  format as the DATES command at the
      SUBMIT prompt (see above).  the date-time specification may  be  entered
      on  the  same  line as the word DATES, or on another line, after the Job
      Processor prompts for the specification.

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 24
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:

          <date-time expression>        Any valid date-time specification.



                                     NOTE

          Each of the preceding options can be declared or  changed  while
          performing  the  INSERT  command.   Any  of  the  options can be
          changed after the job has been inserted into the queue, by using
          the MODIFY function (see below).






  3.7  Commands To Get Information About A Job Request

  A.  Querying about current jobs - STATUS

      The STATUS command produces a listing of information about all jobs  the
      user  has access to.  This list contains job identification, information
      about processing status of each job, and the date and time of the  job's
      next scheduled run.

      The ordinary user  is  provided  information  about  the  jobs  for  his
      username.  An account supervisor is provided information about all users
      in his or her account (GAN).

      Example:


          SUBMIT> status <cr>

          JOB    REQ    USER         CLASS      STATE     NEXT RUN(13:07)
          ====== ===    ==========   ========== ========= ===============
          TEST     3    HELGEM       Queued     Wait      02-Jun-86 12:00
          JOBS     4    HELGEM       Queued     Wait      06-Jun-86 12:00
          MIDNIT   5    HELGEM       Queued     Wait      08-Jun-86 00:00

      The values for processing status that users might see are listed  below.
      They  are  listed  in  four groups:  (1.) the normal, most common values
      found in jobs which are running or can run, (2.) the  values  for  those
      jobs  which  can  be  returned  to  normal  processing with the CONTINUE
      command, (3.) the values for those jobs which can be re-entered into the
      queue  (for immediate processing or regularly scheduled processing) with
      the RERUN command or the REQUE command, or (4.)  the  values  for  those
      jobs which cannot be recovered, but must be entirely re-entered into the
      queue by hand.

            Done-End      Done processing.
          Cancel-None     Cancelled with CANCEL command.


  B.  Listing current jobs - LIST

      The LIST command lists information about all jobs in the Job Processor's
      queue  that  the  user has access to.  What is listed can range from one
      item  of  information  to  all  information,  depending  on  the  user's
      selection.   The  default listing is job identification and the date and
      time of the next run.

TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 26
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Example of default list:

          SUBMIT> list <cr>

           jobname Request Timelimit  Username     Next Run(09:00)
           ------- ------- ---------  --------     ---------------
           TEST    3       01:00      HELGEM       02-Jun-86 12:00

           MIDNIT  5       0l:00      HELGEM       08-Jun-86 12:00



      Other job information may be obtained by supplying one or  more  of  the
      following values (option names) with the LIST command:

          Request         Timelimit       Username        PPN
          AUN             Privilege       Next Run        License

  3.8  Housekeeping Commands

  The Job Processor system offers several commands to keep things 'cleaned up'
  in the system.  These include commands to change a job's option settings, to
  cancel a scheduled job or to recover a cancelled job, to pause or to stop  a
  job  while  it's  processing,  to restart a job, and to reenter a job in the
  processing queue.

  These command all include the job name and request  number  on  the  command
  line.,  or  prompted for.  This job identification may be obtained by typing
  the LIST command at the SUBMIT prompt.

  A.  Changing option settings - MODIFY

      The user can make any desired changes to the options of a job, after the
      job  has  been  entered in the queue, with the MODIFY command to the Job
      Processor.  Such changes may even be made after a job has completed some
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 27
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      of its scheduled executions.

      The MODIFY command is executed when the user enters the word MODIFY  and
      the job name and request number.

      The information may be entered on one line, or it  can  be  entered  one
      item  per  line, with prompting for the job identification.  If only the
      word MODIFY is entered in response to the SUBMIT prompt, the "JOB NAME:"
      prompt  may  sometimes  be skipped, by answering it with just a carriage
      return.  The job may sometimes be defined by the request  number  alone.
      However,  it  is  possible  that  another  job may have the same request
      number, so it is best to specify both job name and request numbers.

      Examples:

          SUBMIT> modify jobs 4 <cr>

              or

          SUBMIT> modify jobs <cr>
          REQUEST NUMBER: 4 <cr>

              or

          SUBMIT> modify <cr>
          JOB NAME: jobs <cr>
          REQUEST NUMBER: 4 <cr>

              or

          SUBMIT> modify <cr>
          JOB NAME:  <cr>
          REQUEST NUMBER: 4 <cr>

      When the MODIFY command has been entered, including  the  identification
      of  the  job  to  be  modified,  the  Job  Processor  then  displays the
      information it currently has about the options of that job.  The limits,
      options and scheduling information may be changed at the OPTIONS prompt,
      which immediately follows this job information listing.

  Example:

          JOB: JOBS  Req  4 DSK:(HELGEM)JOBS.CMD
          Username: HELGEM   Node:3456-16 TID=Aux
          Limits:   Time:01:00:00  TRU:no limit  Pri:0
          Options:  Log:None Mail:Always Restart:None Unique:Job
          Period:   04-Jun-86 AT 23:00:00.
          Run date: 04-Jun-86 23:00:00          Queued-Wait     
          Last run: 04-Jun-86 08:31:21


      To update an option, enter the option name and the desired, new value(s)
      for  the  option.   Type just a carriage return to end the modifying and
      replace the request with the updated version.  When modification of  the
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 28
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      job  is  complete  the  Job  Processor  prints a line verifying that the
      modification has been inserted into the queue.  

      Example:

          OPTIONS[Insert]: dispose delete
          OPTIONS[Insert]: unique none
          OPTIONS[Insert]: 

          REPLACING REQUEST = 4...MODIFIED JOB "JOBS" INSERTED.  Req  4


      Typing carriage return (only) at any appearance of  the  OPTIONS  prompt
      will replace the job without any further changes.

      If the user wishes to change his command  file  or  log  file,  he  must
      delete this job and re-insert it into the queue as a new entry.

  B.  Removing a job from the queue - DELETE

      The DELETE command removes a specified  job  from  the  Job  Processor's
      queue  so  it  will  no  longer  be executed at the previously specified
      time(s).  The user can then enter it into the queue again with the DATES
      and  INSERT  commands.   Another  word for DELETE which works in the Job
      Processor is CANCEL.  Either command will prevent any future  executions
      of the job.  

      The DELETE command includes the job name  and  request  number,  on  the
      command line or prompted for.

      After typing DELETE, furnishing a job name and  typing  carriage  return
      (only)  will  result in the deletion of every job by that name, for that
      user, from the queue.  Furnishing only the request  number  or  the  job
      name  and  request  number will delete only that one job from the queue.
      The command file itself is not deleted.

      When the job has been deleted, the system prints "JOB DELETED".   If  no
      such job is found, the system prints "ERROR - (Cannot find record)".

  C.  Re-running an aborted job - RERUN

      An  aborted  job  can  be  re-entered  into  the  queue  for  processing
      immediately.   After execution, if the job is a periodic job, it will be
      requeued for execution.  If the job has no future executions  scheduled,
      such  as a job originally scheduled for one-time or immediate execution,
      RERUN will entirely  remove  it  from  the  queue.   The  RERUN  command
      includes the job name and request number.

  D.  Re-entering an aborted job - REQUEUE

      An  aborted  job  can  be  re-entered  into  the  processing  queue  for
      processing  on  its  regular  schedule,  starting  at its next regularly
      scheduled execution.  If the job has  no  future  executions  scheduled,
      such  as a job originally scheduled for one-time or immediate execution,
TYMCOM-X Periodic Job Processing System                                Page 29
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      this command will entirely remove it from the queue.  

      This command includes the job name and request  number,  either  on  the
      same line as the command name, or prompted for.





  3.9  Manipulating A Running Job


  Execution of currently  running  jobs  can  be  interrupted  temporarily  or
  completely, from the SUBMIT program, with the PAUSE, STOP and KILL commands.
  These commands all include the job name and request number,  either  on  the
  same line as the command name or prompted for on following lines.

  A.  Preventing further processing of a command file - PAUSE

      Giving the PAUSE command for  a  running  job  will  allow  the  job  to
      complete  the  task  of the last command received from the command file,
      but the job will not be sent any later commands from the  command  file.
      The  effect of this command is temporary.  It can be overridden with the
      CONTINUE command (see below).  

      Format:

          SUBMIT> pause <job name> <request number>


  B.  Immediately stopping execution of a running job - STOP

      When a job is given the STOP command it immediately stops processing, as
      though it received a pair of user interrupts (control-C or <Escape).  As
      when a PAUSE is sent, the job will not receive or  process  any  further
      commands  from  the  command file.  This command has a temporary effect.
      The CONTINUE command (see below) can reverse the effect.  

      Format:

          SUBMIT> stop <job name> <request number>


  C.  Terminate a running job - KILL

      The KILL command kills the job and removes the current  entry  from  the
      queue.   The  system considers the job as having completed successfully.
      It is reinserted into the queue for execution at its next scheduled time
      (if  there is to be another time).  The effect of this command cannot be
      reversed by another command.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Format:

          SUBMIT> kill <job name> <request number>


  D.  Resume sending commands - CONTINUE

      The CONTINUE command restarts the processing of a  job  which  has  been
      stopped from processing any commands from the command file by a PAUSE or
      a STOP command, and which is no longer  being  sent  commands  from  its
      command  file.   The  job  resumes  with the next command after the last
      command processed.  The command must include the  job's  identification,
      its  job  name  and request number, and the user must have access to the
      job.

      Format:

          SUBMIT> continue <job name> <request number>






  3.10  Utility Commands - HELP And QUIT


  The Job Processor includes two utility  commands:   HELP  and  QUIT.   These
  commands can be entered at the SUBMIT prompt.  

  A.  HELP gives a list of user commands and their descriptions.  Typing  HELP
      and  the  name of a user command gives a description of that command, in
      greater detail.  At the OPTIONS prompt, typing  HELP  gives  a  list  of
      options the user may specify, the values he may set for each option, and
      the current settings of each option.

  B.  QUIT returns control to the EXEC.  It would be used after the  user  has
      completed  entering  a  job into the system, modifying a job, deleting a
      job, or obtaining information about the status  of  job(s)  in  the  job
      queue.

BUG REPORTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  5.0  BUG REPORTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM

  Problems with or questions about the TYMCOM-X Job Processor system  or  this
  documentation  can  be  directed to the system's maintainers.  The system to
  send any such messages is the  SENDMAIL  program,  which  is  run  with  the
  command  "R SENDMAIL  <cr>".   When  the program prompts with "To:", respond
  with "SUBMIT <cr>".  The body of the letter is ended with control-D (^D).

  Please provide the program version, a description of the problem, your  name
  and  telephone  number  so  that we may contact you for further information.
  Your username and the name of your command file will also be useful.

  Example:

      .r sendmail
      To: submit
      Type letter:

  You may receive an answer on a mail system that is somewhat  different  from
  the  older  system mail.  This newer mail system can be recognized by a MAIL
  WAITING prompt that is slightly different  from  the  older  one.   this  is
  important, because the manner in which you read this mail is different.

  The message that you have mail waiting is printed in lower case letters  and
  is  contained  in  square  brackets.   You  read  this  mail with the RDMAIL
  program.  There are other, more complex ways to read this mail, but  if  you
  are not familiar with them, running RDMAIL is the easiest and the best.

  Example:

      .[mail waiting]
      .R RDMAIL <cr>

      <message displayed>
