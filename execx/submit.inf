!  %1 (204)	22-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Fix problem with cancelled records marking the end of the

!		possible record if any.
!
!  %1 (203)	22-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Fix INSERT command to not lose previous dates calculation
!		and schedule the job for the current time.
!
!  %1 (202)	18-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Modify SHOW command to force a close of the file to
!		insure proper information on active records.
!
!  %1 (201)	17-Dec-86 /Carl

!  %1 (200)	15-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Revamp list options with multiple arrays defined by macros
!		with option name, display width, access code, etc to shrink
!		the processing code.
!
!  %1 (177)	15-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Make new LIST command utilize the data setup by SELECT.
!
!  %1 (176)	15-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Implement a global flag for defaulted Job-Req information
!		to be used to verify records for all dangerous commands.
!		Finish revamp of commands using MyLoop.  Rename LIST to
!		SELECT and STATUS to LIST making the appropriate changes.
!
!  %1 (175)	13-Dec-86 /Carl
!		More of edit 174.  Make MyLoop call alternative GetRec
!		routines to allow for the various types of loops.
!		Fix help message for LogLimit from minutes to pages.
!
!  %1 (174)	13-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Replace routines which looped individually through the
!		queue with one routine to do the looping and separate
!		tiny routines to do the work for each record.  The effect
!		is a standard interface for like commands.
!
!  %1 (173)	12-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Modify routine which want a JOBNAME REQUEST to use the
!		standard set of routines where possible.  Add code to
!		Prepare to do everything to setup a record for GetRec.
!
!  %1 (172)	11-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Moved a few pages of code out of SUBMIT into module SUBPAR
!		which now contains the parser and date expression routines.
!		Added array Current to various calls to effect the change.
!
!  %1 (171)	09-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Fixed bug in FNDKEY which reported ambiguous when 2 partial
!		matches were found before the exact match was found.

!		more unused or duplicate-effort routines in SUBMSC.
!
!  %1 (167)	04-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Removal of TRIM and VAIL with code cleanup of other
!		similar functions in module SUBMSC.
!		Clear GS!ERR for each command.
!
!  %1 (166)	03-Dec-86 /Carl
!		Some code cleanup while checking for problems in the
!		status listing routine.  Now ignores cancelled jobs.
!		Also, forced a queue close in the hope of getting the
!		right information.
!
!  %1 (165)	15-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Add privileged commands USEM and USEG to set the proper
!		AUN/Username and GFD directory as if one had done a
!		masquerade.  Needed for USE command setup.
!
!  %1 (164)	15-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Added the privileged USE command which allows a user that
!		has QM license and is GFD'd to (SUBMIT) to specify another
!		queue file in directory (SUBMIT).
!
!  %1 (163)	14-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Changed the status command display to combine the CLASS
!		and PROCESS fields back into Status-Type.  Centered the
!		status in the display.
!
!  %1 (162)	14-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Change TMPNAME option to CCL and re-use the CCL flag
!		bit for the LOGOUT (ok for job to logout) flag.

comment
!
!  %1 (160)	10-Nov-86 /Carl

!		Queued$Crash and Hold$Restart states.  This fixes the
!		problem of not having a way of restarting a job that
!		tried to restart.
!
!  %1 (157)	10-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Fixed the DATES command bug which would not allow a
!		specific date-time to be entered.  Replaced the one
!		use of a routine to return MM DD YYYY which calculated
!		the wrong date.
!
!  %1 (156)	09-Nov-86 /Carl
!		Added array YesNo which is the opposite of NoYes and
!		changed the HALT routine to use the new array.

!		documentation.  Changed many HELP messages.
!
!  %1 (154)	04-Nov-86 /Carl

!		bits for privileged and optional options.
!
!  %1 (153)	18-Oct-86 /Carl

!		oper password file scanning for a match.  Fixed bug in code
!		which broke LICENSE option at runtime.
!
!  %1 (152)	15-Oct-86 /Carl
!		Store oper password hash into a dummy variable instead of the
!		queue entry record.  The password will only be checked on
!		insertion/modification and license will be checked at runtime.
!
!  %1 (151)	27-Sep-86 /Carl
!		Added LC!!QM which checks frame license QM.  Changed
!		places which checked QM in SUBMIT to use this.

!		Start keeping backup versions of SUBMIT so that we do not
!		run into the problems we had trying to figure out which
!		version of U.SAI was the current version.  Make it required
!		to rename the current version to xxxxxx.ver for each major
!		code change, so that even if code is lost or broken we can
!		recreate it or redevelop it later.
!
!  --------	All prior history virtually unknown.
!		Some sources are archived in U.FDM and HELGEM.26 to be
!		found on one of the test systems or in (CARL:26).  These
!		sources are mostly prior to the end of 1985 when it was
!		apparent that Helge might be leaving the company as early
!		as January 1, 1986.  Helge stayed on until July 3, 1986.
