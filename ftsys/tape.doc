TAPE Program Time-out Fix                                February 3 1981




                      User Level Interface Changes


The following two commands and their variations have been  introduced to
allow control  of the  time-out mode  and terminator  character.  PROMPT
will not handle  these options.  However,  the LIST command  will report
their states.

1.  The TIMOUT command  sets or clears  the time-out mode.   The default
    state is "ON", which is the way TAPE works now.

            TIMOUT ON               Enables time-outs.
            TIMOUT OFF              No time-outs.  Look for terminator.
            TIMOUT NO               No time-outs.  Look for terminator.
            NO TIMOUT               No time-outs.  Look for terminator.

2.  The  EOFCHARACTER  command changes  the  terminator  character.  Its
    default setting is CTRL-D.

            EOFCHARACTER <termchar>

    The parameter  <termchar> is a  single character which  is specified
    according to the rules for substitution characters.



                       Operating Characteristics


At this time, the no-timout  mode applies only to block mode  I/O.  This
is  what  is  normally  used.  Ordinary  buffered  mode  I/O  (used with
CONTINUOUS option or when receiving input from the reader on the PDP-10)
works the  same as previously  except that the  wait time for  the first
input character has been increased.

The terminator character is discarded  when read and will not  appear in
the disk file.

An  additional  fix  has  been  implemented  to  allocate   storage  for
substitution tables dynamically.  This should prevent a  possible source
of memory reference problems in TAPE.
