     PURPOSE:  This is the  debugging  dump  module.  It  contains  a
        collection  of  procedures  to  dump  portions  of the symbol
        table, intermediate form code, etc., to a .DMP file.
     
     ENTRY POINTS:
     
        dump_name_table
                    prints out all the names  in  the  compiler  name
                    table,   in  alphabetical  order.  Each  name  is
                    printed with the address of its name table  node.
                    Statistics about the name table are also printed.
     
        dmpsymbol   produces a formatted dump of a single symbol node
                    (a  SYM  node).  This  dump  includes  the   node
                    address  and  the  symbol  name,  type, and kind;
                    where the symbol was declared; the identification
                    of the containing block; and information specific
                    to this particular kind of symbol.
     
        dmpstable   invokes  dmpsymbol  to  dump  all   the   symbols
                    declared  in  the current block.  The symbols are
                    dumped in alphabetical order.
     
        dmptype     produces a formatted dump of a single  type  node
                    (a   TYP  node).  This  dump  includes  the  node
                    address;  the  type  name  and  kind;  its  size,
                    alignment,    packed,   flexible,   and   generic
                    attributes;  and  information  specific  to  this
                    particular kind of type.
     
        dmpconst    produces  a  formatted  dump of a single constant
                    node (a VAL node).  The dump indicates  the  kind
                    of constant, and the constant value itself.
     
        dmpblock    produces  a formatted dump of a single block node
                    (a BLK node).  The dump identifies the block  and
                    includes all the pointers and miscellaneous items
                    of information that are included in scope block.
     
        dmp_ptree   produces a formatted dump of a  parse  tree.  The
                    dump  contains one line for each parse tree node,
                    with tree structure indicated by indentation  and
                    vertical lines.
     
        dmp_close   will close the dump file, if it is open, and will
                    reset its status flag.
