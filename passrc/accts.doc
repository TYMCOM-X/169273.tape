The accounts used by the TYM-Pascal compiler project are:

PASBLD -- work area
PASSRC -- current sources and executables
PASOLD -- previous version (copy of 'PASSRC')
PASNEW -- current version (executables and user documentation only)

Each account has an 'ACCESS.MSG' and '.DOC' file which contains
current notes and information about the account.

Users should be directed to 'PASNEW' only.  It is reasonable to
place the intermediate program 'TYMPAS' in other accounts to
make user access more reasonable.  'TYMPAS' simply runs the
compiler entry program '(PASNEW)PASCAL'.

The general flow of code is as follows:

1) Changes are made on copies of sources in 'PASBLD'.

2) Once the changes are working fairly well, the changed code is
installed back into 'PASSRC'.  Certain users may be given special
'TYMPAS' programs which access the version in 'PASSRC'.

3) When the new version in 'PASSRC' is ready to release, it is
then installed into 'PASNEW'.

4) When a MAJOR change is made, the previous version is placed
in 'PASOLD' and any users who need that old version may be given
a special 'TYMPAS'.

Note that four versions of 'TYMPAS' exist in 'PASSRC' as:

BLDPAS -- access version in 'PASBLD'
SRCPAS -- access version in 'PASSRC'
NEWPAS -- access version in 'PASNEW'
OLDPAS -- access version in 'PASOLD'

These programs have the corresponding account names built
into them, and thus can be placed in any account.  Only the
programs and documentation in 'PASNEW' are defined to always
allow public access.  The others may or may not, depending
on what maintenance is being done at the time.
