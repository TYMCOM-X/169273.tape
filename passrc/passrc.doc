.CHAPTER TYM-Pascal Sources Account

.SECTION 1, The Current Version

The current version of the compiler no longer has the
MIN/MAX optimized code generation bug.

A new bug has surfaced within the intermediate code optimizer.

The SOURCE program is not yet operational.

The PASUTL user library is not yet operational.

The documentation files are not prepared yet.

The general account organization is not enforced yet.

The source files have not been formatted yet.

The hardcopy books have not been prepared yet.

A preliminary user documentation manual is available in
PASNEW in the file "PASCAL.MAN".  This must be spooled at
66 lines per page, TTY forms.

.SECTION 2, The PASSRC Account
The PASSRC account contains copies of ALL files which are related
to the TYM-Pascal compiler and its utilities.  The major sub-systems
are:

.NOFILL
1) The Compiler
2) The Overlay Manager
3) The Code Generators
4) The Runtime Libraries
5) The Debugger
6) The Source Database
7) The Compiler Tests
8) The User Library
9) The Utility Programs
.FILL

Each sub-system consists of source code, documentation and
executable code.  The organization of all the files in the
sources account is stored in the
.INDEX Source Database
Source Database.
The 
.INDEX SOURCE
SOURCE program is used to access the database to produce
command files which compile/assemble/link related files 
whenever changes are made to the sources.  SOURCE can also
retrieve one line descriptions of every file in the sources
account.
