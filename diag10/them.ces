	THEM CE'S

HOW ABOUT THEM CE'S,
	AIN'T THEY FOXES?
GOT THEY HEADS
	INSIDE THEM BOXES.

MAKIN' FLAKEY FIXES,
	HOOKIN' UP PLUGS,
A-GITTIN' THEM GLITCHES,
	A-GITTIN' THEM BUGS.

LOOK AT THEM CE'S,
	AIN'T THEY A CASE?
GOT EXTRA PINS
	IN THEY INTERFACE.

THEM WIRE WIZARD'S WONDER
	NEVER CEASES,
GOT THEM MAINFRAME
	TORE TO PIECES.

HOW TO BE A CE?
	GO ON AND DO IT.
GRABBA HUNKA HARDWARE
	AND SOCK IT TO IT.
