XEXEC's job queue has been mangled.  It says user MAID running ONTEMP and
JMS running MIDFIT (should be MAIL, ONTMTP, and MIDNIT).  In all cases,
the difference between SIXBIT/good/ and SIXBIT/bad/ is 100000; bit 15 got
lost.  I have copied files from (CARL:62) and (SYS:62) for those listed
in RECOV.SYS, but there's not telling what other data files got mutilated.

  McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company has recently purchased 
  diagnostics from TRW for use on VAX 780 and 785 processors.  Although 
  these diagnostics will work for other processors (750 and 730), the 
  purchase is justified only by the need presented by VAX 780 and 785's.

  These diagnostics are not licensed by machine serial number; therefore, 
  these diagnostics can be moved from site to site or machine to machine.  
  This will greatly alleviate the need to have excessive numbers of 
  diagnostic copies in the field.

  These diagnostics must not be copied for any reason whatsoever.  We 
  have signed an agreement with TRW which does not allow us to copy these 
  diagnostics.

  Allocation of the TRW diagnostics will be according to need, based on 
  the following criteria:

      1.  Only VAX 780's and 785's taken under contract after January 1, 
          1987 will qualify a district for this diagnostic package.

      2.  One set of TRW diagnostics will be allocated per district with 
          one to five VAX 780's or 785's under service.

      3.  Two sets of TRW diagnostics will be allocated to a district 
          with six or more VAX 780's or 785's under service contracts.

      4.  Other sets of TRW diagnostics will be available from product 
          support on an emergency basis and must be returned at the 
          completion of the current emergency.  This emergency status 
          will be reviewed by product support for proper allocation.

  Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.  If you have any 
  questions regarding the allocation or use of these diagnostics, please 
  do not hesitate to call Russ Rawlins at (714) 250-1000 Ext. 7752.

           -----------------------------------------------------------
  
  
                       CODE MANAGEMENT AND BACKUP PROCEDURE
  
  
                ALL CODE CREATED OR MODIFIED BY FIELD TECHNICAL
          SUPPORT PERSONNEL WILL BE PLACED IN THE "NETLOAD"
          DIRECTORY UNTIL IT IS BACKED UP (RENAMED) INTO THE "TYMNET"
          OR "TYM5" DIRECTORY.  THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE WITH
          REGIONAL 'HOLDING' DIRECTORIES.  THE CODE IN THESE
          DIRECTORIES CAN SIMPLY BE RENAMED INTO "NETLOAD" AND THE
          OLD REGIONAL DIRECTORIES DELETED WHEN THIS PROCEDURE IS PUT
          INTO EFFECT.
  
                WHEN A NODE LOAD IS REQUIRED THE .BND FILE SHOULD BE
          LOADED FROM "TYMNET" OR "TYM5".  AFTER THE LOAD IS COMPLETE
          ANY SLOT CODE IN THE "NETLOAD" DIRECTORY SHOULD BE LOADED.
  
                WHEN A SLOT LOAD IS REQUIRED THE 'LOADER' SHOULD CHECK
          THE "NETLOAD" DIRECTORY FIRST.  THE "LOADER" REFERS TO ANYONE
          LOADING CODE.  SUCH AS NETCOSTOMER SERVICES, FIELD
          ENGINEERS, COMMUNICATION CONSULTANTS AND NSSC.  IF A SLOT NIB
          FILE IS FOUND IT SHOULD BE LOADED.  IF NONE IS FOUND, THE SLOT
          NIB FILE IN "TYMNET"  OR  "TYM5" SHOULD BE LOADED.
  
                COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING
          SURE ANY CODE RUNNING IN A CUSTOMER INTERFACE IS EITHER
          ALREADY BACKED UP IN "TYMNET" OR "TYM5" OR IS IN "NETLOAD"
          PENDING BACKUP.
  
                THIS WILL ASSURE THAT THE LATEST MOST COMPATIBLE CODE
          IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN EITHER "TYMNET","TYM5" OR "NETLOAD".
  
  
          NOTE: ONCE A MONTH THE "NETLOAD" DIRECTORY SHOULD BE SCANNED
                AND ANY CODE THAT IS OVER A MONTH OLD SHOULD BE
                REMOVED.  THE COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANTS SHOULD
                CHECK EACH BACKUP REQUEST FOR COMPLETION AND RE-SUBMIT
                A REQ IF NEEDED.  THIS SHOULD INSURE THAT THERE IS
                NEVER ANY CODE IN "NETLOAD" THAT IS OVER A MONTH OLD.

      RE:  FSC INSTALLATION GUIDELINES
      
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      
      
      BECAUSE FIRST IMPRESSSIONS ARE LASTING, TYMNET'S INSTALLATION
      PERIODS ARE CRITICAL TO THE CUSTOMER'S PERCEPTION OF THE QUALITY OF
      SERVICE.  LACK OF INSTALLATION AND COORDINATION PROCEDURES BETWEEN
      FSC AND TYMNET HAVE CREATED THE POTENTIAL FOR LESS THAN PERFECT
      INSTALLATIONS.  BELOW ARE PROPOSED GUIDELINES TO ADDRESS THIS AREA
      OF EXPOSURE:
      
      
      FSC RESPONSIBILITIES
      ====================
      
      THE FSC INSTALL PROCESS FOR THE ISIS PRODUCT IS AS FOLLOWS:
      
      1.  THE FSC PROJECT COORDINATOR COMMUNICATES THE ACTUAL DATE OF INSTALL
          PER THE MASTER SCHEDULE TO THE LOCAL FSC DM. AT THIS TIME THE PROJECT
          COORDINATOR WILL INFORM THE DM OF THE CC ASSIGNED FROM THE ORDER
          INCLUDING TELEPHONE CONTACT INFORMATION.
      
      2.  THE DM WILL INFORM THE PROJECT COORDINATOR OF THE FE ASSIGNED TO
          THE INSTALL AND  THE PC WILL ENTER THIS INTO THE ORDER.
      
      3.  THE DM WILL INFORM THE ASSIGNED FE AND INSTRUCT THE FE TO MAKE
          CONTACT WITH THE CC TO ESTABLISH A TIME WINDOW FOR THE INSTALL.
          THIS TIME WINDOW WILL BE THE ACTUAL PERIOD WHEN THE CC AND FE
          WILL WORK TOGETHER TO INSTALL THE SLOT.
      
      4.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONTACT BETWEEN THE FE AND CC IS THE
          RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH CC AND FE.
      
      5.  IF NO CONTACT HAS OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FE AND CC WITHIN 48 HRS.
          OF THE SCHEDULED WINDOW THE CC WILL CONTACT THE LOCAL DM TO
          FACILITATE CONTACT WITH THE ASSIGNED FE.
      
      6.  THE FE WILL BE REQUIRED TO REMAIN ON SITE WORKING WITH THE CC
          UNTIL THEY ARE SATISFIED THE HARDWARE IS FUNCTIONAL.
      














      
      TYMNET RESPONSIBILITIES
      ======================
      
      1.  A COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT IS CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO AN ORDER
          WITHIN ONE WEEK OF ENTERING A CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUEST.  THE
          NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF THE CC SHOULD BE ENTERED ON THE ORDER.
      
      2.  CODE WILL BE COMPLETED THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE INSTALLATION DATE
          AND PLACED IN THE "NETLOAD" DIRECTORY.  THE "NETLOAD" DIRECTORY
          CAN BE FOUND ON ALL CODE SYSTEMS (25,33,54,70).
      
      3.  THE ASSIGNED CC WILL BE AVAILABLE DURING THE PREARRANGED TIME
          PERIOD TO WORK WITH THE FE, LOAD CODE AND TEST THE INTERFACE FOR
          OPERABILITY.

     The printer in building C does not have a serial number or identification

Subject: Central Dispatch Usage 

Troops;

Just a few reminders on some house rules when useing central dispatch!!

1.  When a call is placed on "W" status we want the part number in the
    comment field!!!!!
    If you have a call currently waiting parts get on the phone and have
    central dispatch place the part number in the comments.

2.  If you are the second field engineer on site you must open an assist
    incident with central dispatch.  You also need to close this incident
    with a n F.S.R. through central dispatch.  Customer signature not
    nessacary but nice.

3.  If you are dispatched on an incident you should be either in route
    to the site or on site.  
    Close the incident from site or change cal status before departing.

4.  Any time an incident is placed on shotgun status inform either myself
    or Paul.  We expect daily updates on all shotgunned incidents.

5.  Do not make yourself unavailable or available.  This is to be done thru
    the office; so that we have a realistic pcture of our manpower.

If you have questions, coments, or complaints feel free to voice them
with myself or Paul.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO YOUR FIELD
ENGINEERS ASAP.

THE ATTACHED TECH TIP DEALS WITH THE PROBLEM OF CROSSED PAIRS
BETWEEN THE MODEM AND TELCO DEMARK ON FOUR WIRE CIRCUITS.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LEAD TO THIS ARE;

1. ON INSTALLATION EACH END APPEARS TO TEST GOOD BUT WHEN ALL
LOOPS ARE REMOVED THE CIRCUIT WONT COME UP.

2. AFTER A SITE RECONFIGURATION OR MOVE AN EXISTING CUSTOMER
WONT COME UP.

THE EXAMPLE GIVEN HAPPENS TO BE AN ADP CIRCUIT, HOWEVER THIS
PROBLEM CAN OCCUR ON ANY FOUR WIRE CIRCUIT!!
IF THE FOLLOWING TESTING RESULTS IN NO PROBLEMS FOUND AND THE
CIRCUIT OR CUSTOMER WILL NOT COME UP LOOK AT THE WIRING!!

THIS CAN BE AT EITHER THE TYMNET SITE OR THE CUSTOMER PREMISES;
1. WITH THE MODEM IN LOCAL ANALOG LOOPBACK THE BERT TEST
(RED BOX) RUNS CLEAN.
2. WITH THE MODEM IN LOCAL ANALOG LOOPBACK A LOAD CAN BE RUN
THROUGH THE MODEM WITH NO LOST RECORDS.
3. WITH THE REMOTE CHANNEL INTERFACE IN LOOPBACK TESTS 1 AND 2
ABOVE STILL RUN CLEAN WITH THE LOCAL MODEM IN NORMAL MODE.
                                                                Page  2


4. WITH ALL INTERFACES AND MODEMS IN A NORMAL MODE THE USER
IS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH NO ERRORS.

TO TEST FOR CROSSED PAIRS IT IS NECESSARY TO PLACE THE REMOTE
CHANNEL INTERFACE INTO LOOPBACK.
1. WITH THE REMOTE CHANNEL INTERFACE IN LOOPBACK PUT THE
IMPAIRMENT MEASUREMENT SET INTO THE 900 OHM BRIDGED MODE.
CONNECT A TEST LEAD TO THE RCV INPUT ON THE TEST SET.
PLUG THE TEST LEAD INTO THE MONITOR SIDE OF THE CHANNEL INTERFACE
RCV SECTION. LOG YOUR RESULTS.
NOW PLUG THE SAME TEST LEAD INTO THE MONITOR SIDE OF THE TRANSMIT
PORTION OF THE CHANNEL INTERFACE, LEAVE THE TEST LEAD AS IT WAS
IN YOUR PRIOR MEASUREMENT, LOG YOUR RESULTS.

COMPARE THE RESULTS OF THE TRX AND RCX MEASUREMENTS, IF THESE
SIGNAL LEVELS ARE WITHIN 3 TO 5 DB OF EACH OTHER THERE IS
AN EXCELLENT CHANCE OF CROSSED PAIRS.
CROSSED PAIRS MEANS ONE OF THE TRANSMIT PAIRS AND ONE OF THE
RECIEVE PAIRS HAVE BEEN REVERSED RESULTING IN ONE OF EACH
ON THE TRANSMIT SIDE AND RECIEVE SIDE.

ANOTHER CHECK FOR THIS PROBLEM IS TO CHECK THE OUTPUT LEVEL
SELECTED ON THE MODEM TO INSURE 0DBM IS OPTIONED.
IF THIS STRAPPING IS CORRECT BUT YOU MEASURE SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS AT THE MONITOR JACK OF THE CHANNEL INTERFACE A WIRING
ERROR IS PROBABLE.

ANOTHER CHECK WOULD BE IF MODEMS WHERE ON EACH END WITH NO
LOOPBACKS IN THE CIRCUIT, POWER OFF THE REMOTE MODEM AND
PERFORM THE SAME SIGNAL MEASUREMENT AT THE MONITOR PLUG AS
ABOVE. YOU SHOULD SEE AN OPEN CIRCUIT OR LESS THAN -40DBM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
A  bug has  been found  in the DMAC diagnostic that results in an error  in
test 5 when running  on multi-meg  machines.   This bogus  error will  only
occur  when the  DMAC diagnostic is  used on a multi-meg machine, 1 meg  or
less  will run  without any problems.  In order to circumvent this problem,
version 5.0 of the  MAC diagnostic  has been restored to all of the ENGDIAG
systems and should be  used.  The file name  for version 5.0 is DMAC05.NIB.
The problem will be corrected in version 7.0  of DMAC, but is not scheduled
for  release until  March 31, 1987.   Until that time,  use DMAC05.NIB  for
multi-meg and DMAC.NIB for all other machines.

			MULTIMEG MACHINE TROUBLSHOOTING TIPS

   This doc file has been created for the express purpose of helping the FE
troubleshoot machines running multi-megabytes of memory in the public/private
networks. If any of you who read and use this file come up with anything else
not covered in this doc, let me know via ONTYME. User name is FSC.S/ECKEL.

02/13/87							SAE/RTS

Documentation needed;
---------------------
CFB#s 56, 96, and 139 for starters.
All FCO/ECOs from 84-129-132 to date.
A hardcopy of the diagnostics them selves.

   It is of the utmost importance that the machine to be either upgraded or
repaired be up to the LATEST FCOs. You'll have more problems than you bargain-
ed for if the machine in question is down rev. Also,... for some of you old 
guys from the network side of this horror show,..Tech Support technically does
NOT have to support a down rev machine. So,.....be advised.

INSTALLATION TIPS:
------------------
1.	Power the node down and completely check the entire machine for the
	latest/greates FCO/ECOs. This is especially important on the backplane
	and ALL the terminator PCBs. A down rev backplane and/or terminators
	WILL contribute to diagnostic faillure and cause immense problems when
	application code is loaded. Especially memory access and DMA.

2.	Once the node has been completely checked and upgraded if need be, re-
	install the PCBs, terminators, etc. and load the following diagnostics.
	Please note the pass numbers. They have to be adheared to. 

	DIAGNOSTIC:	DEFAULT PASS#:		RECOMMENDED PASS#:

	  DCPU		     4				8
	  DMAC		     1				2
	(ADD test#5 to the DMAC default. Then set the loop count to 2)
	  DMEM		     1				2
	(This is assumeing that the memory is KNOWN good. If there is ANY)
	(doubt,...ADD tests 2,3,7,8,9,12, and 13 to the default, set the loop)
	(count to 1 if you've changed the default, and run the diagnostic.)
	  DREL		     8				16

	  DSIO\
	  DSYN \
	  DSYA  }  RUN IF IN DOUBT. DEFAULT CAN REMAIN THE SAME.
	  DTAP /
	  DMSC/

	   I know some of you do not have much use for the diagnostics because
	of they're historical unreliability. This has been corrected and cont-
	inues to be upgraded. They're not 100% effective. But NO diagnostic is
	gang. They WILL take awhile to run. ESPECIALLY the DMEM. The rule of
	thumb is; the more the memory you have, the longer it will take the
	tests to run. Have patience. A little patience now will save you anot-
	her dispatch. To say nothing of the wrath of you're DM and RTS if esc-
	allation occures because you did'nt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


   I made a mistake in the multi-meg memo I sent you the other day. In the
diagnostic section, you should run DMAC05 instead of DMAC. This is due to a
bug in the latest release of the stand-alone MAC diagnostic. Until it is co-
rrected, we will have to use the previous release which is DMAC05.NIB. Please
make not of this on the memo. I can resend the memo for those of you who req-
uest it. Let me know at FSC.S/ECKEL ok?

MICROFICHE DOCUMENTATION FOR DEC PRODUCTS
-----------------------------------------
 
Near the close of 1986 we sent out the last sets of microfiche updates from 
Fremont to the field.  In the future we will have to obtain the information 
found  in the microfiche libraries by contacting someone who has a  current 
library or by a direct subscription from Digital Equipment Corp.
 
Three  people in Product Support have current microfiche libraries and  are 
available to answer questions at the following numbers:

    THE SUPPLY MOTOR HAS A RESISTANCE OF 1.3 OHMS IT SHOULD BE 1.2.  I WILL BE
BACK AS SOON AS I CAN TO REPLACE THE SUPPLY MOTOR.  
    ALSO, COULD YOU FIND OUT WHY THE SQUIGLE WON'T WORK ON 930 IN TUMS.  I S
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET TO PEAK LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

If you use "SENDMA JMS" instead of "TUMS JMS", you will find that the SENDMA
program does not respond to ~ in column 1.  Is this the problem?

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE TYMNET LOCAL ACCESS BUSINESS IT IS NECESSARY
FOR OUR FIELD ENGINEERS TO PERFORM SERVICE ON LEVEL THREE OUTAGES
ON WEEKENDS. THIS DOESNT MEAN DISPATCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
BUT DURING THE DAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.
THE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH CURT MILLER AND HE CONCURS WITH THIS
REQUIREMENT.
PLEASE INFORM YOUR PERSONNEL OF THIS REQUIREMENT AND THE IMPLIMENTATION

BEGINING MARCH 2, 1987 TYMNET WILL BE OPENING TROUBLE TICKETS ON
INSTALLATIONS THAT ARE MORE THAN 24PAST DUE FOR OUR SIGNOFF.
THESE WILL BE LEVEL THREE OUTAGE CATAGORY.
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN A VERY FEW IF ALL PARTIES DO THE
COMMUNICATING NECESSARY.
THE REQUIREMENT IS FOR THE FIELD ENGINEERS TO EXECUTE THE ** NETSTAT
PROGRAM NO LATER THAN NOON ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE SCHEDULED PROJECT
DATE.
IN ORDER TO KEEP OUR COLLECTIVE REPORT CARD CLEAN IT IS ESSENTIAL
THESE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.
CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT GETTING THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION NECESSARY
TO PREVENT THIS ADDITIONAL NOTICE.
OUR AVERAGE IS THREE DAYS AFTER THE PROJECT THE FE'S ACTUALLY
NOTIFY THE PROJECT COORDINATORS OF COMPLETION.
PLEASE INFORM YOUR FIELD ENGINEERS OF THIS REQUIREMENT AND THE NEED
FOR THEM TO COMPLY.

SUBJECT>   CLEARIFICATION OF EARLIER ONTYMES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I WOULD LIKE TO CLEARIFY TWO ONTYMES I SENT EARLIER THIS WEEK.
THE MESSAGE NUMBERS WHERE 95431 CONCERNING PAST DUE INSTALL STATUS
AND 95427 CONCERNING LEVEL THREE OUTAGE DISPATCHING.

CHUCK PHEMISTER POSED SOME INTERESTING CONCERNS AND I AGREE WITH
THEM COMPLETELY.
THE FIRST CONCERN IS RELATIVE TO MESSAGE #95431 AND SPECIFICALLY
CHUCK ASKED IF DISPATCHES ON WEEKENDS AND AFTERHOURS WOULD RESULT
FROM THE INSTALL STATUS. THE ANSWER HERE IS NO WEEKEND OR AFTER
HOURS ACTIVITY WILL RESULT.
THE ONLY TIME A TICKET WILL BE OPENED IN THIS AREA IS IF YOUR FE'S
FAIL TO PROVIDE STATUS TO THE TELECOM SUPPORT PROJECT COORDINATORS
WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES IN OUR PROCEDURE.
ANY STATUS ENTERED BY THE PROJECT COORDINATORS, TELCO INCOMPLETE,
CUSTOMER NOT READY, WHATEVER IS ADEQUATE. THE PROBLEM HERE IS
OUR FE'S ARE NOT PROVIDING THIS INFO IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THAT
RESULTS IN TYMNET NOT KNOWING IF THE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETE.
THE PROBLEM THIS CAUSES IS SIMPLE, TYMNET BEGINS BILLING THE
CUSTOMERS BASED ON OUR SIGNOFF OR STATUS.
THE SECOND AREA OF CONCERN IS THE DISPATCHING OF FE'S ON LEVEL 3
LOCAL ACCESS OUTAGES MESSAGE # 95427.
THE REASON FOR THIS CHANGE IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS;
37% OF ALL TICKETS ARE FOR LEVEL 3 ACCESS OUTAGES. IT TAKES US
AN AVERAGE OF 3.3 DAYS TO FIX THESE AND OF THIS 37% APPROX. 80%
GO OVER THE WEEKEND WITH NO SERVICE ACTIVITY.
CLEARLY IF WE WORK ON THESE OVER THE WEEKEND THE AVERAGE FIX TIME
                                                                Page  2

WILL DECREASE. CHUCKS CONCERN WAS OVER THE SERVICE NEEDS ON THOSE
NODES REQUIRING HOURS OF TRAVEL TIME TO REACH, POINT WELL MADE HERE!
WE WILL ONLY DISPATCH ON THOSE NODES IN THE ZONES (DISTANCE FROM
A MANNED SITE NOT TIME ZONE) ONE AND TWO AS DEFINED BY CHAD AND INPUT
BY THE FIELD MANAGERS.
I WILL BE RECIEVING A REPORT FROM CHAD EVERY TWO WEEKS LISTING NODES
AND ZONES SO WE CAN DO THIS CORRECTLY.
WE WILL ALSO RUN THE ROTARY TESTER PRIOR TO DISPATCH SO WE CAN INFORM
THE FE OF THE SITUATION.

COPIES:

FROM:         J. LAU

SUBJECT:      Training Policies and Procedures

REFERENCE:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this memo is to reiterate certain policies and 
procedures related to training.  These policies and procedures 
will be published and incorporated into the Operating Guide.  
However in the interim please consider this memo as policy 
guidance as it relates to training.

1.  TRAVEL ADVANCES.  Recently we have had requests for Travel 
Advances returned to us disapproved because the field engineer 
(FE) still had outstanding expense report(s).  My memo 8606-101 
dated June 6, 1986 and revised January 15, 1987 was mailed to all 
Field Operations management personnel to provide guidance on 
completing expense reports.  In that memo it states that expense 
reports should be submitted at least once every two weeks and 
that the final one should be submitted within five working days 
of completion of training.  Your cooperation in this matter is 
requested.  Our Finance Department will not issue an advance to 
anyone with an expense report that has not been cleared.

2.  GAS FOR RENTAL CARS.  Rental car receipts are showing 
refueling charges.  Curt Miller's guidance published in October 
1985 explicitly states that gas expenses will be covered by the 
per diem.  Effective immediately no gas charges are authorized as 
part of the car rental.  

3.  CANCELLATIONS AT SAN JOSE.  Although it has happened only 
infrequently addressees should be aware that Field Service 
Training pays $45 per student day at TYMNET Training.  When we 
cancel a student within four weeks of the class we are charged 
50% of the tuition fee; if there is a no show we are charged the 
full fee.  Hereafter if the Training Department is charged for 



class cancellation or no show that expense will be charged back 
to the department cancelling the class.

4.  CLASS CLOSING DATES.  Recently there has been a rash of last 
minute cancellations (defined as cancellation within one week of 
the class start) which we have been trying to accommodate.  This 
is negatively impacting our training administration.  Effective 
immediately all class registrations will close at the end of 
business hours on the sixth working day preceding the class start 
date.  For example if a class is scheduled to start on 23 March 
1987 then OnTYME enrollment requests not received by 1700 
(5:00pm) 13 March 1987 will not be accepted.

5.  TRAVEL.  Some of you have pointed out (correctly) that we do 
not always take advantage of the lowest fares.  We have not taken 
advantage of the flights which incurred penalties for changes or 
cancellations because of our own changes in plans, personnel, 
etc.  Addressees are reminded to ensure that the enrollment 
OnTYMEs include the most accurate information from the FE.  Too 
often we get calls from the FE stating that he(she) did not want 
what appeared on the OnTYME.  We are going to make travel 
arrangements based on what is on the OnTYME; changes only 
complicate the process.  On the subject of travel I have not 
placed any restrictions on how far an FE may drive to school.  
Addressees are requested to use their good judgment in 
authorizing an FE to drive to school.  Recently an FE drove over 
1600 miles one way to attend class; that is excessive!  Contrary 
to previous policy expenses in excess of one day will be 
reimbursed; however all FEs should be reminded that all expenses 
must be substantiated by receipts and that the Runzheimer Guide 
be used for guidance.  The total travel expenses may not exceed 
the round trip air fare as quoted by the Training Registrar.  
Spouses are not encouraged to travel with FEs attending training 
but if you so authorize that, the enrollment OnTYME must clearly 
state that in order that the appropriate arrangements may be 
made.

6.  NEW APARTMENTS.  The Training Department has leased apart-
ments at a different complex which is considerably closer to our 
facility in Irvine.  FEs attending classes in Irvine commencing 
the week of 9 March will be staying at the new apartments.

The following is March's preventitive maintenance schedule for the    
South Bay district.  If you have two p.m.'s scheduled the same day    
and can not make one let me know as soon as possible.  If you are the 
second engineer log an assist call.  If you have nothing to do and want    
to go out on a scheduled p.m. coordinate with the assigned engineer and    
log an assist call; please no more than three to any call.

NOTE:  THE ABOVE 3 FCO'S MUST BE INCORPORATED TOGETHER!  THE ONLY EXCEPTION
       IS THAT THE CONN 0 TERMINATOR FCO CAN BE LEFT IN AN ENGINE WITHOUT  
       HAVING THE MODIFIED ROM I/O AND CPU.  ALSO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF 
       ROM I/O'S AND CPU'S HAVE HAD ONLY THE "PART A" DONE ON THE FCO'S    
       THAT REDUCES SYSTEM CLEAR NOISE.  THE "PART B" THAT MAKES THE  
       BOARD COMPATIBLE WITH MAC III WAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED.  POLICY HAS
       NOW CHANGED SUCH THAT ALL ADDITIONS OF THESE FCO'S MUST BE DONE
       COMPLETELY (I.E. PARTS A & B).   
     
86-074A:  MAC III.  REDUCES LENGTH OF LOADI1 SIGNAL.  THIS APPLIES ONLY    
          THE B1 ETCH OF MAC III.

Copies:      Sales Managers, Service Support Managers

From:        Dave Corbett - Product Support
_________________________________________________________________
In response to recent field office inquiry on Fuji Supereagle M-
2361 disk failures, product support findings are as follows:

     According to Fujitsu
     --------------------
     All disk drives with S/N below 3412 (inclusive); 
     Head Disk Assembly (HDA) revision below D0 (inclusive);
     Servo Module revision below E (inclusive);
     
     May display unreasonable amount of disk errors and even-
     tually requires physical replacement of HDA or the entire 
     disk drive.
     
        
It is recommended that all precautions be taken prior to service 
acceptance.  
1.  Alert Sales Representatives on potential problem. 
2.  Pre-site preparation (inventory); verify S/N & Rev. Levels.   

In the event that device in question is already on maintenance, 
the recommendation follows:
1.  Verify S/N & Rev. Levels. 
2.  If problems occur, reference C.E. Manual (P/N B03P-4825-

    0002A...02, Ch. 6-30 and perform Dynamic Servo Timing Adjust-
    ments.
    
    
3.  If Servo module or HDA are replaced, perform Dynamic Servo 

    Adjustments

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THERE IS A WEEKLY CONFERENCE CALL BETWEEN THE TYMNET TECHNICAL MANAGERS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIELD COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALISTS, VARIOUS TYMNET
HEADQUARTERS GROUPS AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM FSC.
ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT CONTINUES TO SURFACE IS OUR FIELD ENGINEERS
APPEAR TO NOT BE FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURES IDENTIFIED IN THE ** ISIS
DOCUMENTS.
I HAVE NOT RECIEVED SPECIFIC INCIDENT INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THIS
PERCEPTION HOWEVER I FEEL THIS CONCERN IS VALID DUE TO THE FACT THAT
EACH FIELD AREA HAD SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.
 
I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD INSURE ALL OF YOUR FIELD PERSONNEL
ARE AWARE OF THIS PROCEDURE, WHICH BY THE WAY IS GOING INTO THE
OPERATING GUIDE, AND THEY ADHERE TO IT.
THE CUSTOMER BENEFITS FROM THIS COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN FSC AND
NSC AS DO THE TWO COMPONENT COMPANIES.
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PROCESS PLEASE CONTACT YOUR
TELECOM SUPPORT PROJECT COORDINATOR OR OPERATIONS MANAGER OR OF
COURSE MYSELF.
THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND COOPERATION.
