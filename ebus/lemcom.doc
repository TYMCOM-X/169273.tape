        A) DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM CORRECTIONS: (INCLUDE SAR NUMBERS)


        Version 1.04 Changes
        ------- ---- -------

        1.   A break code received from ISIS will now be passed to the host.

        2.   Terminal characteristics codes 0  thru 13 (hex) can now  be probed
             or   set.    A  probe   all   command  (TC=63)   will   probe  all
             characteristics from 0 thru 13 (hex).

        3.   A bug which  caused a host cost  messaage to be sent  every minute
             even if the cost had not changed has been fixed.

        4.   The  host  cost and  the  host cost  timer  is now  reset  when an
             Interface-Reset message is received from the host.



        Version 1.03 Changes
        ------- ---- -------

        1.   The host cost generation has been fixed so that it does not always
             send a cost of 31 (SAR LB1.02-A1095).

        PRODUCT ID   :  LEM
        ==================================================================

        Version 1.02 Changes
        ------- ---- -------

        1.   The  host set-host-number  message may  now change  the  number of
             ports.  Previously it could  not change the number after  the host
             had been up once.

        2.   Error code 0 for the ISIS messages "Logon failure" and  "Unable to
             provide pseudo-needle" is now changed to 7 when it is sent  to the
             host via the message "Sup  response".  Thus error code 7  in base-
             to-host message 17  can now mean  "access not permitted"  or "ISIS
             unable to complete request".

        3.   The host key is  now zeroed after it is  sent and it is  no longer
             sent with every host status report.

        4.   The table  for faking the  response to a  "Query input  baud rate"
             request is now initialized from the TID instead of always being 0.
             The input baud rates for  2741's and ASCII terminals at  1200 baud
             and  slower  are  initialized  the same  as  on  the  Varian base;
             auxiliary  circuits,  2780's,  3270's  and  unassigned  TID's  are
             initialized to 1200 baud;  and ASCII terminals at 2400,  4800, and
             9600  baud  use  the  new  baud rate  codes  of  10,  11,  and 12,
             respectively.

        5.   Host  cost  is  now  generated by  the  base  code.   The  cost is
             calculated every minute and is based on the total number  of bytes
             sent through the base in  the last minute (CPM) and the  number of
             ports currently logged in (NPORTS), using the formula  (CPM/8192 +
             NPORTS/16).  The  cost is never  allowed to go  above 31.   If the
             host sends a cost to the base, then the value sent by the  host is
             used  and the  base no  longer generates  a cost  (until  the next
             reset).

        6.   The base now sends a  Reset interface message when it  crashes for
             some reason.

        7.   The maximum  message sizes to  and from the  host are  now equates
             (IMSZ and OMSZ) and the  maximum input size has been  increased to
             2044 bytes.  This has increased memory  requirements substantially
             (from about 17K to about  27K).  The maximum output size  is still
             406 bytes.

        8.   The environmental data  message sent with a  Reset acknowledgement
             has been changed.  It is identified as version 1 and  contains the
             following information:
                 38 (env data msg nmbr)          1 byte
                 0C (msg length)                 1 byte
                 01 (version nmbr)               1 byte
                 reason code (same as before)    1 byte
                 slot code version nmbr          2 bytes
                 slot number of interface        2 bytes
                 ISIS code version nmbr          2 bytes
                 node number                     2 bytes
                 kernal host number              2 bytes

        9.   The foreground  code used  for debugging in  loopback mode  is now
             assembled only if the equate DEBUG is 1.

        Version 1.01 Changes
        ------- ---- -------
        1.   The input and  output ISIS ring sizes  have been increased  to 400
             (hex) bytes each to help decrease stuttering on aux circuits.

        2.   When  a  bad  checksum  is  received  from  the  host  (either SIO
             generated or inside the message), a NAK message is now sent  and a
             retransmission  of  the  bad  message  is  expected.   This allows
             recovery from  soft hardware  flakes, but the  host will  kill the
             interface if this happens  too often.  Previously, the  code would
             crash when it received a bad checksum.

        3.   The  ISIS  input ring  is  now  flushed when  a  Reset  message is
             received from the host.  The  input ring is also kept  empty while
             the interface is dead (after a timeout, error, etc. and before the
             next  Reset).  In  flushing  the ring,  zappers are  sent  for all
             incoming needles,  since the zap-all-ports  routine does  not know
             about them  yet.  Previously, the  input ring was  untouched while
             the  interface was  dead and  could accumulate  a large  amount of
             useless messages.

        4.   The host set-host-number message  may now change the  host number.
             Previously it could not change the number after the host  had been
             up once.

        5.   The ISIS host-not-accepted message no longer crashes the code.  It
             is currently ignored.

        6.   When a  slot starts up,  the environmental data  sent to  the host
             with the next  Reset Ack message  is now 7  instead of 0,  so that
             env.  data 0 now has  only one meaning (request by host)  and env.
             data 7 means the slot was reloaded.








        Version 1.00 Initial Release
        ------- ---- ------- -------

        1.   The initial release of the ISIS LEMCOM 370 Base interface has only
             one TYM file parameter; the symbol  TII should be set to 0  if the
             code  is to  be loaded  into a  Tymnet-I machine  or set  to  1 if
             Tymnet-II.  The ISIS Base follows the "Tymnet Reference  Guide" by
             Charles  Landau very  closely, and  this can  be used  as detailed
             documentation of the operation of the ISIS Base.
