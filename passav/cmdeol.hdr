     PURPOSE:  This routine determines whether  there  are  any  more
        non-blank  characters in a text line, advancing the cursor at
        the same time.
     
     USAGE:
     
        EXTERNAL FUNCTION CMD_EOL
              ( LINE: PACKED ARRAY [1..*] OF CHAR;
                VAR CURSOR: INTEGER ): BOOLEAN;
     
     INPUT:
     
        LINE        is any text string.
     
        CURSOR      is the index of a character in the text string.
     
     OUTPUT:
     
        <return value>
                    is TRUE  if  there  are  no  remaining  non-blank
                    characters  in LINE, starting from CURSOR.  It is
                    FALSE otherwise.
     
        CURSOR      is advanced to the next  non-blank  character  in
                    LINE,    if    CMD_EOL    is    FALSE,    or   to
                    "LENGTH(LINE) + 1" if it is TRUE.  (This  is  the
                    same as the action of CMD_SKIP_BLANKS.)
     
     REQUIREMENTS:  CURSOR must be greater than zero.
     
     NOTES:   If  CURSOR  points  to a non-blank character initially,
        then CMD_EOL will return FALSE, and CURSOR will be unchanged.
