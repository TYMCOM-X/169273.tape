          1.  Introduction              ____________


          This document specifies the image file format for the ANC Eclipse
          Vehicle.  This  specification  is  in terms of a stream of 16-bit
          words, which are stored  in  sequential  file  locations  on  the
          Eclipse;  on the DEC-10 they are stored two per 32-bit integer in
          successive words of the file, with the first 16-bit  quantity  in
          the high-order half of the integer.

          An image file is created by the AEV linker program, which runs on
          the host DEC-10, from a set of object files produced by  the  AEV
          code generator and under the control of user command input.  This
          file will then be transferred to the target Eclipse system  by  a
          file transfer utility to be executed under the control of the AEV
          runtime system.




          2.  Basic Elements of an Image File              _____ ________ __ __ _____ ____


          A byte is an 8-bit integer quantity, which may be interpreted  as            ____
          an  unsigned  value in the range 0..255, or as a two's complement
          signed value in the range -128..127.

          A word consists of two contiguous bytes, which may be interpreted            ____
          as  an  unsigned  value  in  the  range  0..65535,  or as a two's
          complement signed value in the  range  -32768..32767.  Where  the
          two   bytes  of  a  word  hold  separate  information  (e.g.  two
          characters), the high-order byte is considered to  be  the  first
          one.  The bits of a word are numbered 0 to 15, left to right.

          The image file is an ordered sequence of words, each of which has
          a file address; the words' addresses  are  consecutive  integers,            ____ _______
          starting with 0.

          A  longword  consists  of  two  contiguous  words,  which  may be             ________
          considered as an unsigned value in the range 0..4294967295, or as
          a    two's    complement    signed    value    in    the    range
          -2147483648..2147483647.  The first word (with  the  lowest  file
          address) holds the most significant part of the longword.

          A  block  of  the  image  file  consists of 256 contiguous words,             _____
          starting at a block boundary, which  is  a  file  address  evenly                        _____ ________
          divisible  by  256.  Image  file blocks are numbered sequentially
          beginning with zero.

          3.  General Structure of an Image File              _______ _________ __ __ _____ ____


          An AEV image file contains:

          o image identification, control and directory information
          o data structures describing the program's overlay structure
          o the initial contents of virtual and direct static storage
          o the contents of each overlay
          o any traceback and line number tables that may  be  produced  by
            the linker

          These  items  appear in the above order, with each item occupying
          one or more whole blocks  of  the  image  file.  The  first  item
          comprises  a fixed-length structure called the image header.  The
          second item consists of three tables:  the memory area list,  the
          disk  record  list  and the overlay list.  The next two items are
          images  of  the  initial  memory  contents  for  data  and   code
          respectively.  The last item is used only by the AEV runtime code
          in  converting   between   code   addresses   and   routine   and
          module-file-page-line specifications.




          4.  Image Header              _____ ______


          The image header contains the following fields:

          offset  size    contents          ______  ____    ________
          0       1       image file format version number
          1       5       image name (10 characters)
          6       1       linker version number
          7       9       link time (dd-mmm-yy hh:mm:ss)
          16      1       code base page number
          17      1       overlay number of program entry point
          18      1       address of program entry point
          19      1       program flags
          20      1       file block number of memory management tables
          21      1       offset of memory area list
          22      1       offset of disk record table
          23      1       offset of overlay table
          24      1       file block number of static initializations
          25      2       size, offset of direct static initialization
          27      2       size, offset of virtual static initialization
          29      1       file block number of code (in disk records)
          30      1       file block number of traceback/line number tables

          The image header occupies the first block of the image file, with
          its field at offsets and sizes as given above, in words.

          August 7, 1981


          The image file format version number field is provided  to  allow
          non-upward  compatible  format changes in the future.  The number
          for the version documented herein is 0.

          The code base page number field specifies the page of the address
          space in which code is to start.  Legal values are 1 to 26.

          Bit  0 of the program flags field is set when floating underflows
          are to be considered exceptional conditions.  Bit 1 is  set  when
          user masking of attention signals is to be enabled.




          5.  Overlay Tables              _______ ______


          The  memory  area  list,  disk record table and overlay table are
          stored contiguously in the memory management tables area  of  the
          image  file;  their  offsets from the start of the area appear in
          the image header.  Each table  begins  with  a  word  giving  the
          number of entries it contains.

          The  memory  area list has a one-word entry for each memory area.
          The entry contains the number of  pages  the  corresponding  area
          occupies.

          The  disk record and overlay tables have entries of lengths 3 and
          2  words  respectively.  Their  format  is  described   in   "ANC
          MicroEclipse Vehicle Runtime Specification."




          6.  Initial Data              _______ ____


          The  static initialization section of the image file contains the
          exact images of the initial contents of  program  virtual  static
          and  direct  static.  These images are stored contiguously in the
          static initializations area of the  image  fille,  block-aligned.
          Their  lengths  and offsets from the start of the area are stored
          in the image header.  The direct static initialization length  is
          in terms of words; the virtual static initialization length is in
          terms of pages.

          7.  Initial Code              _______ ____


          The disk records are stored in this area of the image file.  Each
          disk  record  begins  on  a  block  boundary  and  is a series of
          overlays, page-aligned within the record.  (Note  that  one  page
          equals  4  disk  blocks; page-alignment within a disk record does
          not imply page-alignment within the image file as a whole,  since
          the  disk records are only block-aligned.) Each overlay is stored
          as the exact memory image of the code to be executed.




          8.  Traceback and Line Number Tables              _________ ___ ____ ______ ______


          The format of these tables  is  described  in  "ANC  MicroEclipse
          Vehicle Runtime Specification."
