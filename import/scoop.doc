1.0  INTRODUCTION     ____________

     The purpose of SCOOP is  to  provide  users  with  news
about  the  DEC-10 system.  In this role, it complements the
functions of other information distribution methods such  as
the  newsletter,  the MAIL system, and the HLP files.  SCOOP
specializes in handling items of short-term importance, such
as  operation  schedules,  as  opposed  to  information of a
semi-permanent or standing nature.  Items  can,  of  course,
also  serve  to  announce  other  types  of  information  by
directing users to the appropriate source.

     The motivation for SCOOP's development arose  from  the
inadequacies of the NOTICE.TXT system.  NOTICE.TXT could not
be allowed to grow too large,  since  users  would  get  the
habit of suppressing its type-out.  SCOOP solves the problem
by placing all the information into a file called  SCOOP.TXT
and allowing access to individual items, rather than forcing
the user to look at the entire file whenever he needed  only
a portion of it.  The NOTICE.TXT file can then be restricted
to a single line which simply tells the user what the latest
SCOOP item is.  If an item is deemed important enough, there
are facilities for displaying it in the NOTICE.TXT file, but
this should happen only in rare cases.

2.0  USAGE     _____

2.1  General     _______

     SCOOP has  two  modes  of  operation:   User  Mode  and
Operator  Mode.   When  SCOOP  is  run by a normal user, its
function is to  display  the  information  SCOOP.TXT.   When
SCOOP  is  run  by  an operator, its function is to maintain
SCOOP.TXT by allowing insertions, deletions, etc.



2.2  User Mode      ____ ____

2.2.1  Normal Run - To perform a normal SCOOP run, the  user       ______ ___
must type:

                .SCOOP <cr>

This will cause the all the items in SCOOP.TXT to  be  typed
out  in  reverse chronological order.  As each item appears,
the user may:

     1.  Type a ^O to skip to the start of the next item.

     2.  Type two ^C's to abort the run  when  he  has  seen
         enough.




2.2.2  Quick Index Run - The user may obtain the title lines       _____ _____ ___
of all current SCOOP items by typing:

                .SCOOP Q <cr>

Each title line contains the item number, creation date-time
and the title.



2.2.3  Individual Item Run - To see a particular  item,  the       __________ ____ ___
user may type:

                .SCOOP n <cr>

where n is the item's unique number.
SCOOP                                                 Page 3


2.2.4  Display Of NOTICE.TXT - A user may easily examine the       _______ __ __________
current NOTICE.TXT by typing:

                .SCOOP N <cr>



2.3  Operator Mode     ________ ____

     To run SCOOP, the operator must be  logged  into  [1,2]
and should type:

                .SCOOP <cr>

SCOOP will then respond with an asterisk (*).   Any  of  the
following commands can be typed:

     1.  <cr> -  Type all current items.

     2.  Q    -  Quick index.

     3.  n    -  Type item # n, where n is between 1 and 99.

     4.  I    -  Insert an item.

     5.  D    -  Delete an item.

     6.  P    -  Purge an item.

     7.  C    -  Clean up the SCOOP file.

     8.  N    -  Type NOTICE.TXT.

     9.  E    -  Exit.

    10.  H    -  Help message.


     Commands 1-3 are equivalent  to  the  three  user  mode
commands  (see  2.2.1 - 2.2.3).  The only difference is that
SCOOP will supply  the  operator  with  one  extra  line  of
information  per  item  consisting  of  the operator ID, the
expiration date, and flash status information if  any.   The
rest of the operator commands are described below.



2.3.1  Item Insertion - Typing  an  I  will   initiate   the       ____ _________
insertion dialogue.  The following parts of the item will be
asked for:

     1.  TITLE - This should be short but  descriptive;   it
         is  the  line  which will appear in the quick index
         type-out, as well as  in  NOTICE.TXT  to  initially
         announce  the  item.   The  title  is limited to 40
SCOOP                                                 Page 4


         characters.

     2.  EXPIRATION DATE - This will specify  how  long  the
         item  is  to remain in SCOOP.TXT as an active item.
         On expiration, it will be deleted  and  transferred
         to SCOOP.OLD.  The default lifetime of an item is 2
         weeks which may be specified  by  replying  with  a
         <cr>.  Otherwise, the date should be entered in the
         form DD-MMM-YY.  Note, however, that it is  usually
         not  necessary to specify the entire date.  If, for
         example, today's date is 19-OCT-75,  the  following
         table shows some possible inputs and their results.

                         19             19-OCT-75
                         28             28-OCT-75
                         9               9-NOV-75
                         23-DEC         23-DEC-75
                         18-OCT         18-OCT-76
                         <cr>            2-NOV-75

         In  general,  the  next  possible  date  which   is
         consistent  with  the  information typed in will be
         used.  If this date is  more  than  a  month  away,
         however,  confirmation  will  be asked for.  If the
         operator  types  in  a  non-existent   date   (e.g.
         31-NOV) or uses an illegal format, an error message
         will appear, and the date must be retyped.

     3.  EXPIRATION TIME - The  default  is  23:59  of   the
         specified  date,  and  this  may  be specified by a
         <cr>.  Otherwise, the format is HH:MM.

     4.  OPERATOR IDENTIFICATION - This will usually consist
         of  the  initials of the person inserting the item.
         The length is limited to 5 characters.

     5.  FLASH STATUS - The operator should reply with  a  Y
         if the item is to be granted flash status, and with
         an N if it is not.  When an item is  granted  flash
         status,  it  means that the entire text of the item
         will appear  in  NOTICE.TXT.   In  the  affirmative
         case,  SCOOP will ask for the flash activation date
         and time.  The default case is for flash status  to
         begin  immediately.   Flash  status  will expire 24
         hours from the time it is activated,  or  when  the
         item  itself  expires,  whichever  comes first.  If
         flash status is not desired immediately, it can  be
         set  to  activate  anytime  during  the life of the
         item, but in no case can it last for more  than  24
         hours.  (There is also no way to get it to last for
         less than 24 hours, except to have the entire  item         ____
         expire.)  Furthermore,  there can only be one flash
         item active at a time.  The way this  works  is  as
         follows:  Suppose that item 5 has flash status from
         9:00 on Thursday until 9:00 on Friday.  If  item  6
SCOOP                                                 Page 5


         is  inserted  at  10:00 on Thursday and given flash
         status, then 6 will  "bump"  5  out  of  NOTICE.TXT
         since  it  is  a more recent item.  Now assume that
         item 6 expires at 18:00 on Thursday.  Item  5  will
         automatically regain its flash status at this time,
         and keep it until 9:00 Friday,  unless  of  course,
         another  flash item comes along to bump it out.  To
         summarize, then, several items can be  given  flash
         status  during  the  same period, but only the most
         recent item will prevail.

     6.  PERMANENT ITEM - SCOOP will next ask  whether  this
         item  is  to  be considered permanent.  A permanent
         item will be put into SCOOP.OLD  when  it  expires.
         Non-permanent items will be thrown away entirely.

     7.  ITEM TEXT - Finally, SCOOP will ask for the  actual
         text  of  the  item.   At  this  time, SCOOP enters
         limited editor mode.  The following characters  can
         be used during text input:

         1.  RUBOUT - Deletes the last character  typed  in.
             The  deleted  character will be echoed (without
             back slashes).

         2.    ^U   - Deletes the current line, back to  the
             last line feed.

         3.    ^R   - Retypes the  current  line,  from  the
             last line feed.

         4.    ^G   - Retypes  the  entire  text,  from  the
             beginning.

         5.    ^H   - Deletes the last character typed in by
             backspacing  over  it and blanking it out.  USE
             ONLY FROM  A  CRT,  or  things  will  get  very
             confusing.

         Note that text  can  be  rubbed  out  back  to  the
         beginning,    if    necessary.     Remember    that
         carriage-return and  line-feed  are  characters  in
         their  own  right,  and can be rubbed out to get to
         the  previous  line.   Liberal   use   of   ^R   is
         recommended,  especially  to  clean  up lines after
         several deletions.  The  situation  gets  confusing
         when  ^H is used to back up to a previous line, and
         so an automatic ^R is  always  typed  to  show  the
         previous  line.  Also note that the only characters
         not allowed in the item text  besides  those  above
         are  ^A,  ^B,  and  ^E.  If typed, these characters
         behave the same as ^R.  When the  entire  text  has
         been typed in, including the final carriage return,
         an altmode (escape) should be typed to  signal  the
         end of the text.
SCOOP                                                 Page 6


         The insertion of a file of text is possible by
            <ctrl F>file.ext<return>
         Indirect file  access  may  be  used  as  often  as
         needed,  mixed  with regular type in, and may occur
         in mid-sentence as well as at the first of a line.


     After the SCOOP item has been completely  specified  as
described  above,  SCOOP  will  then  type  the  entire item
exactly as it will appear and ask the operator  for  an  OK.
Note  that  the unique number assigned to the item is shown.
If the operator replies with a Y, the item will be  inserted
into  the SCOOP file at this time.  Also, NOTICE.TXT will be
rewritten to include the title line of the new item.



2.3.2  Item Deletion - The D command should be used when  an       ____ ________
item  needs to be deleted before its expiration date.  SCOOP
will simply ask for the number of the doomed item.  It  will
then  delete  the  item  from SCOOP.TXT and, if the item was
specified as permanent, transfer it to SCOOP.OLD.  Also,  if
the  item enjoyed flash status, NOTICE.TXT will be rewritten
to remove the flash.  If the item deleted happens to be  the
most  recent  item  in  the  SCOOP  file, then the next most
recent item will now be the one announced in NOTICE.TXT.



2.3.3  Purging An Item - The P command behaves exactly  like       _______ __ ____
the  D  command,  except  that  the  doomed item will not be
written into SCOOP.OLD, even if it is considered a permanent
item.   This  command is useful whenever an item needs to be
deleted  and  rewritten  due  to  a   typographical   error,
inaccurate information, etc.



2.3.4  Clean Up - The  C  command   is   used   to   perform       _____ __
maintenance  on  the SCOOP.TXT file.  The file will be read,
expired items will be deleted, flashes will be activated  or
deactivated,  etc.   Finally,  NOTICE.TXT will be written to
reflect the current SCOOP file.  



2.3.5  Type NOTICE.TXT - The  N  command  can  be  used   to       ____ __________
examine NOTICE.TXT at any time.  This is a convenient way to
see what the most recent item is,  as  well  as  any  active
flash item.  
SCOOP                                                 Page 7


2.3.6  Exit - The E command is used to exit from SCOOP.   IT       ____
SHOULD  ALWAYS  BE USED IN PREFERENCE TO 2 CONTROL-C'S.  The
reason is this:  While SCOOP does its thing, it keeps  track
of the next time something is due to happen, such as an item
expiration, a flash activation, etc.  When the E command  is
typed,  SCOOP will figure out whether this time comes before
the next regular clean up  run.   (These  regular  runs  are
currently  performed  by OPSER when the SHIFT auto files are
processed.) If SCOOP needs to do a clean up before  an  auto
file  is due, then it will submit a batch job to perform the
clean up when needed.  At the same time, SCOOP will kill all
previous requests in the batch queue.  If there were no such
requests, QUEUE will print a warning message:

% Cant find request IN:SCOOP[1,2] in queue manager

This should be ignored.  If a batch  request  is  submitted,
SCOOP will type "NEXT SCOOP CLEAN UP DUE AT HH:MM".



2.3.7  Help Message - The H command will provide a  list  of       ____ _______
possible operator commands and their purpose.



2.4  Hints For The Operator     _____ ___ ___ ________

     1.  When inserting an item, remember to be  as  concise
         as  possible.   Above all, NEVER use any "attention
         getting" techniques such as lines of asterisks,  or
         something like:
                 NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE
         This only serves to irritate  the  user,  since  he
         must  sit  there while it types out.  This practice
         was fine with the 6600, since the notice went on  a
         printout  and  it was necessary to catch the users'                           ___
         attention.  At 110 baud, it can be a pain.

     2.  SCOOP  will  automatically  insert  a  blank   line
         between  items,  so try not to leave blank lines in
         the  text  of  the  item.   This  way,  a   uniform
         appearance will be maintained.

     3.  CHECK THE ITEM when SCOOP asks for the OK!  Look at
         the  expiration  date;   is  it what you want?  Are
         there any typographical errors?  This will save you
         from  having  to  purge the item later and reinsert
         it.

     4.  This hint applies to items about system down  time.
         Let's  say  that  the system is due to be down from
         14:00 to  18:00.   Rather  than  letting  the  item
         expire  at  18:00,  give  it an expiration time of,
         say, 14:30.  This way, if  the  system  happens  to
SCOOP                                                 Page 8


         come  up  before  18:00,  the item will be deleted,
         since SCOOP clean up always runs  when  the  system
         comes up.  Also, be informative in the title of the
         item:  "System Down Time- 14:00 to  18:00  on  Oct.
         20" is much better than "System Down Time".

     5.  If you do discover  a  typo  in  an  item  that  is
         already  inserted,  you may wish to consider fixing
         it with TECO.  Refer to section 3.0  to  learn  the
         format  of  the SCOOP file.  In general, any change
         can be made to the text portion of the item, but BE
         CAREFUL  if you change either the title line or the
         operator  information  line.   Their  format   must
         remain  intact,  down to the last space!  After the
         TECO session, always run a SCOOP clean up.   If  an
         item  got  messed up, you'll find out quickly.  The
         alternative to all of this, of course, is to  purge
         the bad item and reinsert it.

     6.  SCOOP was designed to  be  reasonably  intelligent.
         That  is,  it will try to guess what you are trying
         to do before  you  even  finish  typing  the  line.
         Don't type a carriage return too fast!  Maybe SCOOP
         will do it for you!

     7.  Remember that flashes should be used  VERY  rarely.
         The  whole  idea behind SCOOP is to keep NOTICE.TXT
         short!

     8.  A note on SCOOP clean ups:  In the ideal situation,
         BATCON  would be running all the time, and would be
         able to process the clean up runs at the exact time
         desired.   Since  BATCON is currently not up during
         the day, this means that  items  may  still  appear
         after  they  were  due  to  expire.   There are two
         solutions to this problem.  First, arrange to  have
         items  expire  at  the  usual  23:59, since a SCOOP
         clean up is always run at midnight.  Second, if you
         see  a message of the form "NEXT SCOOP CLEAN UP DUE
         AT ..." and  you  know  that  BATCON  will  not  be
         running  at  that  time,  then  you must do a SCOOP
         clean up on your own when it's due.

     9.  Don't run SCOOP from OPSER  unless  you  know  what
         you're  doing!   The output will be very confusing.
         NEVER try to insert an item from OPSER--that's  the
         most confusing of all.

3.0  FILE FORMATS     ____ _______

3.1  SCOOP.TXT

SCOOP.TXT is the  file  which  contains  all  current  SCOOP
items.  The first line of this file is always of the form:

                         LATEST ITEM:  n

where n is the last unique number assigned to an item.  When
a  new  item  is created, this number will be incremented to
obtain the item's unique number.  The SCOOP items  begin  on
the second line of the file, and each one is made up of four
parts:

     1.  The TITLE line, of the form:

              ^A[nn] dd-mmm-yy/hh:mm <TITLE> <cr> <lf>

         This line always starts with a  control-A.   nn  is
         the  unique  item  number.   The date and time tell
         when the item was created.   <TITLE>  is  a  short,
         descriptive tit most 40 characters long.  This
         line ends with a carriage return-line feed.

     2.  The OPERATOR INFORMATION line, of the form:

              ^B <ID> EXP: [dd-mmm-yy/hh:mm] <cr> <lf>

         or, if the item has been given flash status, of the
         form:

^B <ID> EXP: [<exp>] FLASH: [<activate>]-[<deactivate>] <cr> <lf>

         This line always starts  with  a  control-B.   <ID>
         identifies  the  operator  who  inserted  the item.
         This is followed by the expiration date  and  time.
         If  the item is considered permanent, there will be
         an astersik in place of the blank after "EXP:".  If
         the  item  has  been  given flash status, the flash
         activation  and  deactivation  date-times  will  be
         shown.  <exp>, <activate>, and <deactivate> are all
         of the form:   "dd-mmm-yy/hh:mm".   The  line  ends
         with  a carriage return-line feed.  SCOOP will show
         this line only to operators.

     3.  The  TEXT,  which  starts  immediately  after   the
         <cr>-<lf>  of the operator information line.  It is
         limited to 1500 characters.

     4.  The END-OF-ITEM line, of the form:

                            ^E <cr> <lf>

         This line always signals the end of an  item.   The
SCOOP                                                Page 10


         following  line  will be the title line of the next
         item, if any.




3.2  SCOOP.OLD

     Whereas   SCOOP.TXT   contains   items    in    reverse
chronological  order,  SCOOP.OLD  contains items in order of
deletion, which will turn out to be  roughly  chronological.
When  an item is transfered to SCOOP.OLD, the item number is
removed, as well as the operator information line.  The only
other  difference  in  the  file  format is that there is no
"LATEST ITEM:  n" line at the beginning of the file.



3.3  NOTICE.TXT

     The NOTICE.TXT file will always contain a line  of  the
form:

   LATEST SCOOP: <TITLE line of first item in SCOOP.TXT>

If there is a flash active, the above line will be  preceded
by:

          FLASH...  
          <TEXT of flash item>
