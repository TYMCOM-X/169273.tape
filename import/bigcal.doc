                                Abstract

               BIGCAL  is  a  program  to  produce  large
               appointment  style calendars for a year, a
               month, or any span  of  months  requested.
               The   calendars   appear   one  month  per
               line-printer   page    with    appropriate
               headings  for  the  year  and  month.   An
               additional  feature  was  added  late   in
               version  1 for reading an appointment file
               containing events  to  occur  on  specific
               dates.   Up  to  seven lines of events may
               specified for a particular day.  Version 2
               supports multiple appointment files with a
               complete refresh of  date  information  at
               the beginning of each year.  This way date
               information can be different for the  same
               month  in  two  separate years.  Version 3
               supports appointment formats for  cyclical
               events and many small bug fixes.

INTRODUCTION


1.0  INTRODUCTION

     BIGCAL was written to produce full year calendars which would leave
space  for the user to write small notes, or keep important appointments
listed for easy reference.  An entire month of appointments can be  seen
at  a  time.   User  suggestions  and  desires  soon led to allowing the
appointments to be kept in a disk file for easy  reproduction  of  event
calendars.   A  calendar  for just a single month was then requested, as
well as for a span of months, such as  June  through  September.   These
requests were saved and version 2 was created.



2.0  USAGE

     The simplest use for the BIGCAL  program  is  to  produce  a  blank
appointment or events calendar for an entire year.  This is performed by
running the BIGCAL program and specifying the year for  which  you  want
the  calendar.   BIGCAL  will prompt for the "Calendar Year".  Next, the
program will type out information about the year  to  be  produced,  and
will  ask  for a "Date file".  At this point you should reply "NONE" and
the program will produce an output file named "DSK:BIGCAL.DAT" which you
should  then send to the line-printer using the monitor "PRINT" command.
The terminal dialogue will look similar to the example below  where  the
underlined text is typed by the user:

        .R PUB:BIGCAL         _ __________
        Calendar Year?  1979                        ____
        Current Year:  1979
        What date file?  NONE                         ____
        No holidays will be marked on this calendar
        END OF EXECUTION
        CPU TIME:  m.ss ELAPSED TIME:  mm.ss
        EXIT
        .

     If you prefer to use the system's list of holidays,  which  by  the
way are arbitrarily determined by your systems' administrator, you would
type a carriage-return instead of "NONE" when the program asks for "What
date file?".  This is accomplished by pushing the key marked "RETURN" or
"CR" located on the lower right side of your terminal.

     On the other hand, if you prefer to use your own appointment  file,
you  should  type  the  name  of  your file at this point.  The computer
understands  full  SFD  supported  file  names,   thus   a   name   like
"FOO.FOO[204,1616,FOO]" will be completely understood.  The program will
ask a second time for the date file, "What date file?"  and  you  should
enter  the  name of a second file, or a carriage-return to indicate that
you do not want any more additional appointment files to  be  used.   An
alternate  command  is  to  type "DONE" to say you are finished entering
file names.  This ensures that you are finished,  and  makes  explaining
how  to  use  BIGCAL  a  little easier to the novice.  Experienced users
should note that the DONE command does not substitute elsewhere.

USAGE


     Another feature is the single month calendar.  This is obtained  by
telling  the  program  the  month and year that you wish the calendar to
begin when it asks for "Calendar Year?".  The current year is assumed if
you type just the name of the month, i.e.  "August" means "August 1979".
An example showing both  multiple  date/appointment  files  and  just  a
specific month follows:

        .R PUB:BIGCAL         _ __________
        Calendar Year?  February 1979                        ________ ____
        Calendar Year?          ;  type a carriage return here
        Current Year:  1979
        What date file?  PUB:BIGCAL.INF                         ______________
        What date file?  DSK:FEE.FIE[204,1616,FOE,FUM]                         _____________________________
        What date file?  DONE                         ____
        END OF EXECUTION
        CPU TIME:  m.ss ELAPSED TIME:  mm.ss
        EXIT
        .

     The most complicated type of calendar you may ask for would include
asking for a span of months, and asking that this list of months go into
the next or succeeding years.  For  instance,  requesting  the  span  of
months  from  "January 1979" to "July 1980".  This calendar would differ
from a calendar which began in "March 1979" and end in "September  1979"
in  two ways.  First March-September is only a span of seven months, and
would be much shorter than the span from January to  July  of  the  next
year,  by an entire year.  The second difference is, of course, that the
first twelve months is in one year and the last seven  months  occur  in
another.   Because some dates are dependant upon the day of the week, or
are not always the same date, BIGCAL will request that the  user  supply
the  program  with  a  different set of appointment files for the second
year.  This set of files may be exactly the same as the first  set,  but
to  insure that users can specify different dates for holidays, etc. for
the next year, this small  inconvenience  is  acceptable.   Besides,  it
makes it much easier to keep your appointment files in order.

     The following two examples show how to obtain  a  span  of  months,
both  using  appointment  files,  and  the  second one spanning multiple
years.  A brief explanation follows:

USAGE


        .R PUB:BIGCAL         _ __________
        Calendar Year?  March 1979                        _____ ____
        Calendar Year?  September 1979                        _________ ____
        Current Year:  1979
        What date file?  PUB:BIGCAL.INF                         ______________
        What date file?  DSK:FEE.FIE[204,1616,FOE,FUM]                         _____________________________
        What date file?  DONE                         ____
        END OF EXECUTION
        CPU TIME:  m.ss ELAPSED TIME:  mm.ss
        EXIT
        .

     Please notice the "Starting:" and "Ending:" parts of  the  terminal
dialogue.   These  were  provided to emphasize that the calendar program
was going to create a calendar which began  at  a  specified  month  and
continued  until  the  second  specified month was completed.  Since the
span of months was within a single  year,  there  was  no  need  for  an
special  handling.   The next example, however, spans more than a single
year, and thus requires additional input.  In this example, notice  that
the last seven months, i.e.  all of 1980, will not have any appointments
listed.  This method  allows  the  user  to  add  his  own  hand-written
appointments for the future.

        .R PUB:BIGCAL         _ __________
        Calendar Year?  January 1979                        _______ ____
        Calendar Year?  July 1980                        ____ ____
        Current Year:  1979
        What date file?  PUB:BIGCAL.INF                         ______________

        What date file?  DONE                         ____
        Current Year:  1980
        What date file?  NONE                         ____
        No holidays will be marked on this calendar
        END OF EXECUTION
        CPU TIME:  m.ss ELAPSED TIME:  mm.ss
        EXIT
        .

     These examples hopefully covered all the bases and  showed  how  to
create any kind of calendar file desired.  Not all possible combinations
were demonstrated, but with a little ingenuity, users should be able  to
generate any or all possible permutations of the above examples.

APPOINTMENT FILES


3.0  APPOINTMENT FILES

3.1  Basic Format

     Appointment files, sometimes referred to as "date files" or  "event
files"  are simple lists of dates which a user wishes to have printed on
her otherwize "blank" appointment calendars.  The basic format of  these
files is straight forward and easy to comprehend.

        Day Month Year Line Message-event


     1.  DAY is the numeric day of the month, 00-31, depending upon  the
         month.

     2.  MONTH is the three character abbreviation used by the  computer
         for  the  month.  (JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP,
         OCT, NOV, DEC)

     3.  YEAR is the year in which the event occurred.  If  this  number
         is  positive, the event will only appear in a calendar for that
         year.  If this number is negative, the event will appear  in  a
         calendar  for  that  year  as well as any succeeding years.  If
         this number is ZERO (0),  then  the  event  will  appear  in  a
         calendar for every year.

     4.  LINE is a number designating which line you would like to  have
         the  holiday  listed.   Acceptable values are 0 which means any
         line, and 1 through 7 to specify that this should appear  on  a
         specific  line.  If two or more names are to appear on the same
         line, the second and succeeding occurances  are  translated  to
         zeroes  and may appear on any line.  Of important note, you may
         not have any more than seven listings for  any  specific  date.
         In  version  3,  the option was added to CENTER your message on
         the line.  This is accomplished by specifying the NEGATIVE line
         number  for your message.  For messages to be centered on 'ANY'
         line, any negative number larger in magnitude than minus  seven
         (-7) will be considered as minus zero (-0).

     5.  NAME-OF-DAY is the title which you would like to see printed on
         the   calendar.    NAME-OF-DAY  may  be  from  one  to  fifteen
         characters, with the exception of line-1.  Line-1 has a maximum
         length of twelve, because it is used to show the numeric DAY of
         the month.


     An example date file follows, showing most of the basics:

1       JAN     0       0       New Year's Day
14      FEB     0       1       Valentines
17      MAR     0       1       St. Patrick
21      MAR     0       0       Spring Begins
1       APR     0       0       April Fools
30      MAY     -1776   7       Memorial Day

21      JUN     0       3       Summer Begins

25      DEC     0       2       Christmas Day
31      DEC     0       7       New Year's Eve

APPOINTMENT FILES


3.2  Appointment File Extensions

     Two special option formats were implemented to add cyclic events to
the appointment files.  The same basic fields are utilized for data, but
the context is changed to mean something different.  The first of  these
options  allows  a  user  to specify an event for 'EVERY' ocurrance of a
specific day of the week.  The format is as follows:

        Number   Weekday   Month   Line   Message-event


     1.  Number - The Nth occurrance of the specific weekday.  This  can
         range  from minus five (-5) to five (5).  Positive numbers mean
         the Nth occurrance during the  course  of  a  month.   Negative
         numbers  indicate  the Nth occurance from the end of the month,
         where -1 means the last.  A zero (0) value means to mark  every
         occurrance.

     2.  Weekday - The three character mnemonic code for the day of  the
         week, (eg.  SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI and SAT).

     3.  Month - The month marker.  If this number ranges from 1 to  12,
         then  the  specified  event  will  only appear in that specific
         numeric month.  If this number is greater than 12 or less  than
         1, then the specified event will appear in every month.

     4.  Line - The line marker.  This item has the same meaning as LINE
         in the basic format.

     5.  Message-event - The  message  text.   This  is  the  12  or  15
         character  message  which  you  wish  to  have displayed in the
         appointment box.


     This format is most helpful for things which occur on a  weekly  of
monthly basis.  Some examples with explanations appear below:

     1.  0   MON    0    0    Monday Message - Print the message "Monday
         Message" every monday of every month on any available line.

     2.  2   FRI    0    2    Meeting Night    -   Print   the   message
         "Meeting Night" on the second friday of every month on line two
         (2).

     3.  4   SUN    3    1    Final Exam     - Print the message  "Final
         Exam" on the fourth sunday in March on line one (1).

     4.  -1  THU   11    7    Thanksgiving     -   Print   the   message
         "Thanksgiving"  on the last thursday in November on line number
         seven (7).

     5.  -3  SAT    0   -4    Centered         -   Print   the   message
         "Centered"  on  the  second  to  last  (or  third  if you count
         backwards) saturday of every month.  This message  will  appear
BIGCAL %3(14) -- Big Calendar Program                             Page 8
APPOINTMENT FILES


         on line four (4) and will be centered on the line.


     The second special option format attempts to continue  to  use  the
same basic data format with one major exception.  Instead of one line of
data, each appointment entry consists of three lines.   The  first  line
contains  the  number  of  days  between  occurrances,  the cyclic event
descriptor 'DAY', the line number and the appointment message:

        Days    Descriptor Zero Line Message-event


     1.  Days - is the positive number of days between events.

     2.  Descriptor - is the  actual  text  string  'DAY'  (without  the
         quotes).

     3.  Zero - is a blank argument, but is required for consistancy.

     4.  Line - has the connotation of LINE as above.

     5.  Message-event - has the connotation as Message-event above.


     Lines two and three again follow the same typical format, but  only
contain  valid  information  in  the  first  three  fields.  These lines
specify the start and stop dates for the cyclic event.
