MAKLIB.DOC -- Changes from V2(14) to V2A(63)
July 1978



1.0  SUMMARY

Version 2A is a maintenance release of MAKLIB and contains  bug  fixes
and minor enhancements.

MAKLIB should be  compiled  with  MACRO  V50  or  later.   The  latest
distributed  copies of MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, SCNMAC.UNV, HELPER.REL,
SCAN.REL, and WILD.REL should be used.  In addition, to correctly load
programs  containing  MAKLIB binary fixes, a version of LINK with edit
454 must be used.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

None.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The following restriction should be noted when creating FIX files  for
use  with  the  FIX command switch:  Unconditional branch instructions
(JRST, JUMPA) should not be used as the reference line (code to match)
of  a  .INSERT pseudo-op with KEYWORD:AFTER.  Attempts to do this will
result in patches which are unreachable.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Installation instructions follow in section 4  of  MKL2.DOC  which  is
appended.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

None.

MAKLIB.DOC -- Changes from V1(6) to V2(14)
JANUARY 1976



1.0  SUMMARY

The main reason for the release of MAKLIB V.2 is the addition  of  the
Binary  Patching Tool.  (BPT) The BPT was included to allow some level
of support for  products  distributed  in  relocatable  binary  format
rather than source level.

MAKLIB should be  compiled  with  MACRO  V50  or  later.   The  latest
distributed  copies  of MACTEN.UNV, UUOSYM.UNV, SCNMAC.UNV, HELPER.REL
and WILD.REL should be used.  (See MAKLIB.CTL).  The version  of  SCAN
that  MAKLIB  uses is SCN7A, although any SCAN V7 is usable as long as
the appropriate changes are made to the MAKLIB source.  In addition to
this,  to  correctly  load  programs containing MAKLIB binary fixes, a
version of LINK with edit 454 must be used.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

No existing commands or actions were changed.  For  a  description  of
the  use  of  the BPT, refer to MAKLIB.HLP or MAKLIB.MAN.  A more full
implementation of system-standard error messages is also part of  this
release.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

The main use of the BPT will  be  for  installation  of  DEC  supplied
patches  to products for which the sources are not available.  The BPT
will work with REL files produced by MACRO V50 and BLISS10.   The  BPT
may  not work with any code produced by a compiler using polish fixups
or internal fixups.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The feature test switch FTBPT has been added.   All  of  the  code  to
facilitate  binary  patching  is  under  this  conditional,  which  is
distributed as "on" (non-zero) in the field-image version.  Since  the
code  for  the  BPT comprises about 80% of MAKLIB, turning this switch
off if the BPT is not needed can save some memory space.

Manual loading of SCAN, WILD and HELPER is no longer necessary as  the
.REQUEST  and  .REQUIRE  pseudo-ops  have  been  added  to  facilitate
automatic requests for these routines.

5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

Much addition and re-organization of the program was  done  to  enable
the  addition  of the BPT.  The register allocation and much of the IO
has been re-written.  In addition, a small loader and  a  large  MACRO
assembler  have  been  added to allow binary patching.  Also, a module
has been added to allow  MAKLIB  to  do  internal  tests  of  its  own
routines.   This  is  a  debugging  feature, and is not present in the
field-image version.

MAKLIB.DOC -- V1(6)
July 1975



1.0  SUMMARY

MAKLIB is intended as an eventual replacement for FUDGE2.  

This version has been tested under 5.07  and  6.01  as  well  as  6.02
monitors.  It uses SCAN Version 7 and WILD Version 7.

MAKLIB.HLP  describes  the  various  commands  to  MAKLIB  and   their
functions.   See  FUDGE2 documentation in the Software Notebooks for a
description of indexing.  MAKLIB is described in the  SYSTEM  COMMANDS
section  of the Software Notebooks.  See the SCAN documentation in the
Software Notebooks for information about command scanning.



2.0  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1  Differences from FUDGE2-2D

MAKLIB does not delete local symbols when indexing the library.

Command strings are ended by carriage return line feed.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Must be loaded with SCAN and WILD.   See  MAKLIB.CTL  for  details  on
installation.



5.0  INTERNAL CHANGES

MAKLIB has been updated to recognize LINK block types 1000 to 1777 and
to handle ASCII text blocks.

Edit #

01     All switches except INDEX and INSERT are  recognizable  as  one
       letter abbreviations.

02     Issue correct error message for protection violation.

03     Issue error messages for switches on output and for  more  than
       one switch given with a stand-alone switch(INDEX,NOLOCAL).

04     Do not replace  specified  extension  with  .LST  on  LIST  and
       POINTS, but do fill it in as default.

05     Error messages for modules out of order made more specific.

06     Version number fixed.



6.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
