          SECTION 1.0 OVERVIEW          ____________________

          The Tymnet  Monitoring and Control  System (TMCS) is  an interactive
          system which  provides multiple users  with selective access  to the
          status of a  TYMNET network.  This access  may be limited to  a spe-
          cific subset  of the network,  and a  subset of the  network events.
          Both the current status, as well as  the status at a particular time
          in the past,  may be displayed.  TMCS also provides  access to PROBE
          for controlling  the network, subject  to the user's  access profile
          and license.   In addition,  the system maintains  a list  of nodes,
          hosts, and lines not in the normal state, known as an exception dis-
          play.

          TMCS  runs  on a  TYMNET  Engine  and  does not  require  Supervisor
          resources as PROBE  does.  Only two circuits exist  between TMCS and
          an active Supervisor  (PROBE and ERLOG), so that  many users logging
          in to TMCS will not compete with the Supervisor for resources.  TMCS
          automatically  tracks  the  active Supervisor  during  a  Supervisor
          change, so that the  user does not have  to log in to  a newly acti-
          vated Supervisor again.

          TMCS may be used to monitor three aspects  of the status of the net-
          work.  First, the  user may log directly into PROBE  through TMCS to
          monitor the current status of the network (see Section 3.1.3).  Sec-
          ond, the user may get a  comprehensive listing of all Supervisor log
          messages to  trace the recent history  of the status of  the network
          (see Section 3.1.2).  Lastly, the user  may get a display of current
          network exceptions such as the nodes, hosts, or lines that are down,
          shut, or missing (see Section 3.1.1).


          SECTION 1.1 Login Sequence          __________________________

          The following is a typical login  sequence for accessing TMCS.  Sys-
          tem prompts  appear in upper case.   User responses appear  in lower
          case and should be followed by depressing the Return key.

               PLEASE LOG IN: tmcs
               >>> TMCS <<<

               NAME: username
               PASSWORD:


               *

          Note: The password  is not echoed at the terminal.   The system will
          respond to  a successful login by  displaying an asterisk  in column
          one.  The  asterisk is  the system  prompt indicating  that TMCS  is
          ready to accept a command.

          TMCS User's Guide                                      July 23, 1982



          SECTION 1.2 Format and Syntax          _____________________________

          This section describes the format and syntax of the TMCS commands.


          1.2.1 Format                ______

          The TMCS commands are documented using the following format.

                              command parameter-list

          command             The command must follow a prompt in Columns 1 or
                              2:  an asterisk  (*) for basic TMCS  commands, a
                              ">>" for  modify mode commands,  or a  colon (:)
                              for PROBE commands.  One or more spaces may pre-
                              cede the command.

          parameter list      Command parameters are  separated from  the com-
                              mand  by  one  or more  spaces.   The  parameter
                              options for  each command are described  in each
                              command section.  They may be separated from one
                              another by  one or  more spaces,  or by  another
                              punctuation mark where indicated.


          1.2.2 Syntax                ______

          The following notation is used to describe the command syntax.

          UPPERCASE      Minimum required  segment of  a command  or parameter
                         that must be entered as it appears.

          lowercase      Optional segment of command word or parameter.

              { }        Braces enclose a list of items,  one of which must be
                         chosen.  Braces are never entered.

              [ ]        Brackets enclose an  optional item or list  of items,
                         one of which may be chosen.  The default will be cho-
                         sen  unless  specifically overridden.   Brackets  are
                         never entered.

               |         Represents an "or" choice  between optional parameter
                         values.  It is never entered.

          SECTION 1.3 Special Characters          ______________________________

          This section describes the special characters used in TMCS.


          1.3.1 Break or Escape                _______________

          The Break key or the Escape key acts as a system interrupt to termi-
          nate command activity and return the user to the system prompt.  The
          system will respond  with "<BREAK>", a carriage  return, a linefeed,
          and a  command prompt (*, >>,  or :).  When terminating  the Display
          command using  the Break or  the Escape key  on a CRT  terminal, the
          system will clear the screen before  generating a carriage return, a
          linefeed, and  an asterisk.   When terminating  the Display  command
          using the Break or the Escape key on  a hard copy terminal, the sys-
          tem will respond with  a carriage return, a linefeed,  and an aster-
          isk.


          1.3.2 Carriage Return                _______________

          A carriage return following a command causes the command to be exec-
          uted.


          1.3.3 Control H                _________

          A Control H (or backspace) may be used to delete one or more charac-
          ters.  The system will respond by  replacing the first deleted char-
          acter with a circumflex.


          1.3.4 Control W                _________

          A Control W  may be used to  delete one or more  command words.  The
          system will respond with a backslash for each deleted word.


          1.3.5 Control Q                _________

          A Control Q  may be used to  delete an entire line  of command text.
          The system will respond with a carriage return and a linefeed.

          SECTION 2.0 USER PROFILE          ________________________

          The user  profile determines  the access a  user has  to information
          regarding the network.  They are the  initial settings when the user
          logs  in.  It  includes the  user's password,  the default  terminal
          type, and the default time zone.  These settings can then be changed
          with Terminal and Zone commands (see Sections 3.5.8 and 3.5.11).  It
          includes the license to use certain commands.  It includes the color
          settings for the Log command (see  Section 3.1.2).  It also includes
          the user's access to information regarding certain nodes, hosts, and
          log events.  Access  may be altered permanently by  using the Modify
          command and the  Add or Remove commands (see  Sections 3.3.4, 3.4.2,
          and 3.4.6).  Access may  also be altered for the duration  of a TMCS
          session by using the  Select, Ignore, or Restore  commands (see Sec-
          tions 3.1.8, 3.1.4, and 3.1.7).  Note that the nodes or hosts speci-
          fied in the  user's profile are used to determine  the user's access
          to certain log, display, and  PROBE information (see Sections 3.1.1,
          3.1.2, and 5.0).

          The Create command is used to initiate  the creation of a new user's
          profile (see Section 3.3.3).  The Modify command is used to initiate
          the modification of an existing  user's profile (see Section 3.3.4).
          Both commands  permit access  to the  profile modification  commands
          (see Section 3.4).   The parameters in  a user's profile  are summa-
          rized below.


          Password  - specifies the  user's password,  which may  be up  to 32
                      characters in length.

          Terminal  - specifies the type of  terminal being used for  the dis-
                      play of network exceptions, either  an ADM1 CRT, an ADM3
                      CRT (Tymshare  430), an  HP2621 CRT  (Tymshare 444),  an
                      ISC8900 CRT, or a hard copy terminal.

          Time Zone - specifies the number  of minutes added to  or subtracted
                      from Greenwich Mean Time to equal the user's local time.

          License   - specifies one or more license options, which control the
                      user's  access  to certain  commands.   License  options
                      include HANG,  INACT, SETN,  SETP, UPD,  WHO, P00,  P01,
                      P02, P10, and P20.

          Nodes     - specifies the nodes the user can reference with the Dis-
                      play, Log, or Probe commands.   Node numbers are entered
                      in octal, ranging from 1 - 3777.

          Hosts     - specifies the hosts the user can reference with the Dis-
                      play, Log, or Probe commands.   Host numbers are entered
                      in decimal, ranging from 1 - 2047.

          Events    - specifies the  log events that  will be  displayed using
                      the Log command.   Each log event is  assigned a decimal
                      number,  ranging from  1 -  255.  log messages  are
                      listed in alphabetical order in  Section 4.0.  The event
                      numbers used for  referencing certain types of  log mes-
                      sages are listed in numerical order in Section 6.0.

          Log Color - specifies how Log command messages  will be be displayed
                      on the ISC8900 terminal.  The  message for any event can
                      be displayed in  a specified  color, flashing,  or sepa-
                      rated from surrounding messages.

          SECTION 3.0 COMMANDS          ____________________

          This section describes the TMCS commands.  Included are network mon-
          itoring commands,   message commands, profile  maintenance commands,
          profile modification commands, utility commands, and program mainte-
          nance commands.


          SECTION 3.1 Network Monitoring Commands          _______________________________________

          This section describes the commands required for monitoring the net-
          work using TMCS.


          3.1.1 Display Command                _______________

          Syntax: DISplay [NODEs|LINEs|HOSTs]
          License: None
          Default: Lists all exceptions in the order nodes, lines, and hosts.

          Description: The Display command causes  the output of the specified
               network exceptions.  The order in  which the options are listed
               in the command determines the order in which the exceptions are
               output.  Any number of the options may  be included in the com-
               mand.

               The Display command may be used  on any terminal type which can
               be set in the profile (see Section 3.4.7).  On a hard copy ter-
               minal, the  specified network  information  is output  periodi-
               cally.  On a CRT terminal, the  screen is cleared and reformat-
               ted to display the specified information.  The display informa-
               tion is updated periodically  as the state of  the objects dis-
               played changes.

               The screen  is divided  into two areas.   The first  four lines
               contain header information, followed by a blank line.  The next
               19 lines contain two  columns of 40 characters  each which con-
               tain  the  network  information   specified  with  the  command
               options.   Each of  the  display options  causes  two or  three
               exception  groups to  be listed  if there  is any  data in  the
               group.

               The header display appears as  follows.  Note that fixed header
               information appears in uppercase letters, while variable header
               information appears in lowercase letters.  For those items fol-
               lowed by  "(NA)" below, the value  for the information  will be
               listed as "NA" if it is not available.

               Note:  The test criteria  used to determine the  output of dis-
               play  information  for  specific nodes,  hosts,  and  lines  is
               described in Section 5.0.  In the  output generated by the Dis-
               play command, node and host  numbers appear in brackets.  These
               brackets are system generated, and are  not to be confused with
               the brackets in the command syntax above.


                                                            COMMANDS    Page 6

                      of the display.

               out = the number of "lines out" displayed in the second area of
                     the display.

               acc = the number of accounting blocks left. (NA)

               error = the  most recent  Supervisor disk  error.   It will  be
                       reported only if a disk error occurred.

               alu = the current average length of a circuit, in links. (NA)

               outnodes = the number  of "nodes not  reporting" in  the second
                          area of the display.

               Note that  entries for  "LINKS SHUT",  "LINES OUT",  and "NODES
               OUT" will only be listed if there are any items to be reported,
               respectively.

               Each option causes  two or three exception groups  to be listed
               if there is any data in the group.  Each group will be preceded
               by a title.

               If the NODE  option is specified, the two  groups displayed are
               NODES NOT  REPORTING", and  "NODES REPORTING  UP AGAIN".   Each
               group is displayed using the following notation.

                   nodename[nodenumber] mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss

               where:

               nodename = the node name specified using the Set Node Name com-
                          mand (see Section 3.6.10).

               nodenumber = the node number.

               date and time = when the node went out, or reported up again.

               The nodes are  listed in reverse chronological  order (the most
               recent node  reporting up  will be first  on the  list).  Nodes
               will only be listed if they have  been named using the Set Node
               Name command (see Section 3.6.10).  A node that has been up for
               more than 30  minutes will not be listed.  Also,  only the last
               five nodes  reporting up will  be listed.  The  report criteria
               used for the NODE option is the node test (see Section 5.0).

               If the  HOSTS option is  specified, the three  groups displayed
               are  "HOSTS DOWN",  "HOSTS SHUT",  and  "HOSTS MISSING".   Each
               group is displayed using the following notation.

                    hostname[hostnumber] nodename[nodenumber] position

               where:

               hostname = the host name specified using the Set Host Name com-
                          mand (see Section 3.6.9).

               hostnumber = the host number.

               nodename = the node name specified using the Set Node Name com-
                          mand (see Section 3.6.10).

               nodenumber = the node number.

               position = the position of the host in the specified node, or 0
                          if TYMNET II.

               Note:   "HOSTS DOWN"  are all  hosts in  the network  currently
               reporting a  status of  "Down".  No  users may  log in  to that
               host.  "HOSTS SHUT"  are all hosts that are in  the network but
               not accepting  logins, except  from users  with "shut  override
               status".  "HOSTS MISSING" are all hosts that have not reported,

               or have  reported gone, and which  have been set using  the Set
               Host  Location command  (see  Section  3.6.8).  Hosts  will  be
               listed only  if they have  been named  using the Set  Host Name
               command (see Section 3.6.9).  The  report criteria used for the
               HOST option is the Node/Host test (see Section 5.0).

               If the LINES  option is  specified, the two  groups to  be dis-
               played are "LINES OUT" and "LINKS SHUT".  The "LINES OUT" group
               is displayed using the following notation.

                    fromname[fromnode]:fromline1s---toname[tonode]:tolines

               The "LINKS SHUT" group  is displayed using the  following nota-
               tion.

                    fromname[fromnode]-S-toname[tonode]

               where:

               fromname = the  name  of  the  originating  node  (see  Section
                          3.6.10).

               fromnode = the originating node number.

               fromlines = the originating port numbers.  Note  that an aster-
                           isk will  appear if "fromnode" was  configured with
                           "tonode" as a neighbor, and  a line to "tonode" has
                           not come up since "fromnode" was loaded.

               toname = the name of the destination node (see Section 3.6.10).

               tonode = the destination node number.

               tolines = the destination port numbers.   Note that an asterisk
                         will appear if  "tonode" was  configured with  "from-
                         node" as a neighbor, and a line to "fromnode" has not
                         come up since "tonode" was loaded.

               Note that lower numbered  nodes will be listed  first as "from-
               node"; higher numbered nodes will be listed second as "tonode".
               The variables "fromlines"  and "tolines"  are lists  of decimal
               numbers separated by commas.

               The report criteria for "LINKS SHUT" is the Link test (see Sec-
               tion 5.0).   The report  criteria for "LINES  OUT" is  the Line
               test (see Section 5.0).

          License: None
          Default: Starts output beginning with current time.

          Description:  The Log  command causes  the output  of log  messages.
               Both a start time and a stop  time may be specified; neither is
               required.  The  time may be  specified as "nnn"  minutes offset
               from  the  current  time,  or  as  a  specific  date  and  time
               "mm/dd[/yy] hh:mm[:ss]".  If  the offset  is specified  in min-
               utes, the "start" and "stop" times  are the specified number of
               minutes before or after the current time.

               A negative  "start" time causes the  output of log  messages to
               begin the specified number  of minutes in the  future.  A nega-
               tive "stop" time  causes the output of log messages  to end the
               specified number of minutes in the past.  Overlapping start and
               stop times will generate an error message.

               If a date is specified and "yy" is omitted, the current year is
               assumed.

               A description of the log messages  is contained in Section 4.0.
               A listing  of the event numbers  controlling the output  of the
               log messages  is contained  in Section 6.0.   Note that  if the
               current terminal type  in the profile is  ISC8900, the messages
               will be displayed using the color options specified in the pro-
               file (see Section 3.4.3).

               Note: The listing  of log messages is controlled  by the nodes,
               hosts, and events parameters in the user's profile (see Section
               2.0).  The  test criteria used to  determine the output  of log
               information for specific  nodes, hosts, and lines  is described
               in Section  5.0.  In the output  generated by the  Log command,
               node and host  numbers appear in brackets.   These brackets are
               system generated, and are not to  be confused with the brackets
               in the command syntax above.

          Example:

               *log 1

          3.1.3 Probe Command                _____________

          Syntax: PRObe [nnnn]
          License: None - to enter PROBE in the active Supervisor.
                   INACT - to enter PROBE in an inactive Supervisor.
          Default: Active Supervisor.

          Description: The  Probe command permits the  user to enter  PROBE in
               the specified Supervisor  "nnnn".  While in PROBE,  the command
               prompt is a colon.  To exit from PROBE, type "exi".

               There  are certain  restrictions  using  the Probe  command  to
               access PROBE from  TMCS.  First, TMCS log  messages rather than
               PROBE log  messages will be output  when using the  PROBE "LOG"
               command.  Second,  the user has access  to all of  the commands
               listed in  the PROBE  User's Guide  except CSTAT,  HELP, LRATE,                              ___________________
               RLOG, RNODE,  and TWAKE.  Third, the  user must specify  a node
               contained in his  TMCS profile when using one  of the following
               PROBE commands or an error message  will be generated (see Sec-
               tion 2.0).

                    BORI       CT          PSTAT
                    CHAN       DLOA        RETAKE
                    CL         DOWN        SYNPRT
                    CLEAR      N           TRACE
                    COST       NEIGHBOR    TREE
                    CP         NODE        T2BORI
                    CSTREQ     NSHUT       UP

               Similarly, one of the two nodes  specified when using the PROBE
               "ESHUT" or "RSHUT" commands must be in the user's TMCS profile,
               or an error message will be generated.  The user must specify a
               host contained in his TMCS profile  when using the PROBE "HOST"
               command, or an error message will be generated.

               When using  the PROBE "AD", "AN"  and "AU" commands  from TMCS,
               only nodes which pass the node test will be output (see Section
               5.0).   When using  the PROBE  "HOST" command  from TMCS,  only
               hosts which pass the host test  will be output.  When using the
               PROBE  "LSHUT", "OV"  or "EXC"  commands from  TMCS, only  data
               which passes the link test will be output.

               Example:

               *probe 123

          3.1.4 Ignore Command                ______________

          Syntax:
             IGNore [{NODEs|HOSTs|LINKs|LINEs|EVENTs} [nnnn|nnnn-nnnn]...]
          License: None
          Default: Ignore all nodes, hosts, links, lines, or events.

          Description: The Ignore  command causes TMCS to  suppress the output
               of Log, PROBE, or Display  information for the specified nodes,
               hosts, links, lines, or log events during the current TMCS ses-
               sion.  The test criteria  used to determine the  output of dis-
               play  information  for  specific nodes,  hosts,  and  lines  is
               described in Section 5.0.  The items entered in the Ignore com-
               mand  are added  to  those  currently ignored.   The  currently
               ignored items  may be displayed  using the List  Ignore command
               (see Section 3.1.5).   Ignored items may be  restored using the
               Select  or  Restore  command (see  Sections  3.1.4  or  3.1.7).
               Several nodes, hosts, links, lines, or log event numbers may be
               entered simultaneously by entering a space between each one.  A
               range may be  specified for nodes, hosts, or  log event numbers
               by using  a hyphen to separate  the numbers.  Node  numbers are
               octal.  Host and  event numbers are decimal.   Links consist of
               two node numbers separated by a colon.  Lines consist of a node
               number and  a port number separated  by a colon.   Port numbers
               are octal in the range 0 -  377.  Note that a maximum of thirty
               lines and thirty links may be ignored or selected at any time.

               An Ignore command with no  parameters indicates that all nodes,
               hosts,  links, lines,  and log  events should  be ignored.   An
               Ignore command with just an  item type specified indicates that
               all items of that type should  be ignored, e.g., "ignore nodes"
               means ignore all nodes.

          Example:

               *ignore event 14 17-20

               *ignore link 2031:1734 263:1344

               *ignore line 2031:6 145:0

          Syntax: LISt IGNore [NODEs|HOST|LINKs|LINEs|EVENTs]
          License: None
          Default: List nodes, hosts, links, lines, and events ignored.

          Description: The List Ignore command causes  a display of the nodes,
               hosts, links, lines, or log events based on what was suppressed
               by the  Select, Ignore, or  Restore command during  the current
               TMCS session (see Section 3.1.8, 3.1.4, and 3.1.7).

          Example:

               *lis ign event
               events: 14 17-20

               *list ignore

          Syntax: LISt SELect [NODEs|HOST|LINKs|LINEs|EVENTs]
          License: None
          Default: List nodes, hosts, links, lines, and events selected.

          Description: The List Select command causes  a display of the nodes,
               hosts, links,  lines, or  log events based  on what  was chosen
               using the Select, Ignore or Restore commands during the current
               TMCS session (see Section 3.1.8, 3.1.4, and 3.1.7).

          License: None
          Default: Restore all nodes, hosts, links, lines, and events.

          Description: The Restore command causes  the specified nodes, hosts,
               links, lines, or log event numbers  suppressed by the Ignore or
               Select command  to be restored for  output with Log,  PROBE, or
               Display information during  the current TMCS session  (see Sec-
               tions  3.1.1, 3.1.2,  and 3.1.3).   The test  criteria used  to
               determine the output of information  for specific nodes, hosts,
               and lines is  described in Section 5.0.   Several nodes, hosts,
               links, lines, or log event numbers  may be specified simultane-
               ously by  entering a space  between each  one.  A range  may be
               specified for  nodes, hosts,  or log event  numbers by  using a
               hyphen to separate the numbers.   Node numbers are octal.  Host
               and event numbers are decimal.  Links  consist of two node num-
               bers separated by a colon.  Lines  consist of a node number and
               a port number separated by a  colon.  Port numbers are octal in
               the range  0 - 377.   Note that a  maximum of thirty  lines and
               thirty links may be ignored or selected at any time.

               A Restore command with no  parameters indicates that all nodes,
               hosts, links, lines and log  events currently ignored should be
               restored.  A Restore  command with just an  item type specified
               indicates that all items of that type should be restored, e.g.,
               "restore nodes" means restore all currently ignored nodes.

          Example:

               *restore event 14 17-20

               *restore link 2031:1734 263:1344

               *restore line 2031:6 145:0

          Syntax: SELect {NODEs|HOSTs|LINKs|LINEs|EVENTs} {nnnn|nnnn-nnnn}...
          License: None
          Default: None

          Description: The Select command causes TMCS to output only the spec-
               ified nodes,  hosts, links,  lines, or log  events in  the Log,
               PROBE, or Display information, during  the current TMCS session
               (see Sections 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3).  The test criteria used
               to  determine the  output of  information  for specific  nodes,
               hosts, and lines is described in  Section 5.0.  The Select com-

               mand overrides any previous Select,  Ignore, or Restore command
               for the specified  type (see Sections 3.1.4 and  3.1.7).  It is
               equivalent to an "ignore" of all  items followed by a "restore"
               of the  selected items of the  specified type.  For  example, a
               user may  select a series  of nodes, a  series of hosts,  and a
               series of links, by entering the  Select command for each type.
               If additional nodes need to be  selected, the user must restore
               the additional  nodes using  the Restore  command.  Nodes  that
               have  been selected  may  be  ignored without  affecting  other
               selected nodes.

               Several nodes, hosts, links, lines, or log event numbers may be
               entered simultaneously by entering a space between each one.  A
               range may be specified for nodes,  hosts, or log event numbers,
               by using  a hyphen to separate  the numbers.  Node  numbers are
               octal.  Host and  event numbers are decimal.   Links consist of
               two node numbers separated by a colon.  Lines consist of a node
               number and  a port number separated  by a colon.   Port numbers
               are octal  in the  range 0 -  377.  Note there  can be  at most
               thirty lines and thirty links ignored or selected at any time.

          Example:

               *select event 14 17-20

               *select link 2031:1734 263:1344

          SECTION 3.2 Remote Greeting Message Commands          ____________________________________________

          This section describes the commands required  to set or clear remote
          greeting messages using  the TMCS system.  Remote  greeting messages
          are output by a TYMSAT at an  end user's terminal after he types his
          TID at login.


          3.2.1 Set Greeting Message Command                ____________________________

          Syntax: SET GREETing MESSage
                               [TO mm/dd[/yy] hh:mm[:ss]] {node[:slot]}...
          License:  GRT
          Default:  None

          Description:  The Set  Greeting Message command enables  a TMCS user
               to set  remote greeting messages  for the specified  node(s) or
               slot(s).

               The user may specify  one or more nodes, or a  specific slot in
               an ISIS node.   If the specified node  is a TYMNET I  node, the
               remote greeting  message will be set  for the entire  node.  If
               the specified  node is  a TYMNET II  node, the  remote greeting
               message will be set for the specified slot, or for all slots in
               that node if  no slot is specified.  Note that  the slot number
               must be in the range 0 - 31.

               The system  will prompt  the user  with "ENTER  MESSAGE:".  The
               maximum allowable length  of the message is  254 characters.  A
               linefeed  may be  used to  continue text  on a  new line.   The
               entire  message must  be terminated  using  a carriage  return.
               Note that the carriage return and linefeed count as two charac-
               ters in  each line.  The  Set Greeting Message  command process
               will be terminated  if the message exceeds  254 characters, and
               an error message will be generated.

               For each  TYMNET II  node specified,  the Kernel  host will  be
               requested with the prompt:

                    FOR NODE <node#>
                    ENTER KERNEL HOST:

               TMCS will  then attempt  to set  the message  in the  node.  If
               unsuccessful, an error message will be displayed.

               The user may specify  the date and time that the  message is to
               be automatically cleared.  The specified  date and time must be
               in the  future.  If no time  is specified, the  remote greeting
               message will be  output until a Clear  Greeting message command
               is entered, or  until the message is cleared  another way, such
               as reloading the node (see Section 3.2.2).

               TMCS maintains a  file of entries for each node  or slot remote
               greeting message  that has been  successfully set.   Each entry
               includes the node the message has been set for, the slot it has
               been set  for (if specified), the  Kernel host (if a  TYMNET II
               host), when  the message  was set,  and the  time it  is to  be
               cleared (if specified).  The List Greeting Entry command may be
               used to retrieve this information (see Section 3.2.5).

          Example:

               *set greeting message to 9/4 12:30 2043:4
               ENTER MESSAGE:
               This message prints out at an end user's terminal during the
               login sequence.  When setting the message, each line must be
               terminated with a linefeed.  The entire message must be
               terminated with a carriage return.

               FOR NODE 2043
               ENTER KERNEL HOST: 542

               *


          3.2.2 Clear Greeting Message Command                ______________________________

          Syntax:  CLEAR GREETing MESSage {node[:slot]}...
          License:  GRT
          Default:  None

          Description:   The Clear  Greeting Message  command may  be used  to
               clear a remote  greeting message from the  specified node(s) or
               slot(s).  The nodes for which this  message was cleared will be
               removed from the list of remote greeting entries.

               For each TYMNET  II node specified, the system  will prompt the
               user for the Kernel host number with:

                    FOR NODE <node#>
                    ENTER KERNEL HOST:

          Example:

               *clear greeting message 2112:14
               FOR NODE 2112
               ENTER KERNEL HOST: 525

          License:  DWN
          Default:  None

          Description:  The Set  Greeting Entry command may be used  to set or
               change an entry  in the TMCS file of  remote greeting messages.
               The command may  be used to change  the clear time of  a remote
               greeting message on  the specified node(s) or slot(s)  to a new
               time.  The command may also be used to set the clear time for a
               remote greeting  message that  was set  another way  (a message
               that was built in, for example).  Note that if no time is spec-
               ified, the message  will be output permanently, or  until a new
               time is specified using this command.

               For each  TYMNET II  node specified,  the Kernel  host will  be
               requested with the prompt:

                    FOR NODE <node#>
                    ENTER KERNEL HOST:

          Example:

               *set greeting entry to 8/12/82 12:00 2424:7 2235
               FOR NODE 2424
               ENTER KERNEL HOST: 519
               FOR NODE 2235

          3.2.4 Clear Greeting Entry Command                ____________________________

          Syntax:  CLEAR GREETing ENTRY {node[:slot]}...
          License:  GRT
          Default:  None

          Description:  The Clear Greeting Entry command removes an entry from
               the remote greeting file.  For example, if  a node with a  mes-
               sage is reloaded, that greeting message  is deleted.  This com-
               mand may be  used to remove the clear request  for that message
               from the remote  file.

          Example:

               *clear greeting entry 2116:14

               *

          3.2.5 List Greeting Entry Command                ___________________________

          Syntax:  LIST GREETing ENTRY [node[:slot]]...
          License:  GRT
          Default:  All entries.

          Description:  The  List Greeting Entry  command causes a  listing of
               the entries for the specified nodes.  The node number, the slot
               number, the Kernel host number (for  TYMNET II nodes), the time
               the message was set, and the  time the message will be cleared,
               will be listed for each entry specified.

               Note that a listing with no slot number indicates that the node
               is a stand-alone TYMSAT, or an  ISIS machine with a message set
               for all slots prepared to use it.  A listing with a slot number
               indicates an  ISIS machine  with a message  set for  that slot.
               The output will indicate "NEVER" if  no clear time has been set
               for a remote greeting message.

          Example:

               *list greeting entry
               1234         7/7/82 23:01:15   7/12/82 12:00:00

          3.3.3 Create Command                ______________

          Syntax: CREate {username} [AS username]
          License: UPD
          Default: None

          Description: The  Create command  allows for the  creation of  a new
               username.  The new username is  assigned a profile identical to
               that of  the creator of  the username,  or the same  profile as
               that of the user specified in the optional "as username" param-
               eter.  Note that the newly created  profile may not contain any
               nodes, hosts, events, or license  not contained in the creating
               user's profile.  When the Create command is entered, the system
               will prompt the user twice for a password and then respond with
               ">>", the system  prompt for the profile  modification commands
               (see Section 3.4).  The new profile  may then be modified using
               the profile  modification commands.  The  new username  will be
               added to the TMCS system if  the Update command is entered (see
               Section 3.4.8).  It  will be cancelled if the  Abort command is
               entered (see Section 3.4.1).

          Description: The Modify command enables a  user to modify his own or
               another user's profile  by using the profile  modification com-
               mands (see Section 3.4).  When the  user enters the Modify com-
               mand, the system will respond with  ">>", the system prompt for
               the profile modification commands.   The modifications will not
               take effect  until the Update  command is entered  (see Section
               3.4.8).  They will be cancelled if the Abort command is entered
               (see Section 3.4.1).

               Note:  The  user cannot add to  that profile any  nodes, hosts,
               events, or license not contained in his own profile.

          Example:

               *mod user4

          SECTION 3.4 Profile Modification Commands          _________________________________________

          This section contains  the commands required for  modifying a user's
          profile.  They may only be accessed  after a  user enters the Create
          or the  Modify command (see Sections  3.3.3 and 3.3.4).   The system
          will prompt for the profile modification commands with ">>".  Enter-
          ing the Abort command will terminate the use of profile modification
          commands and return the user to the asterisk system prompt (see Sec-
          tion 3.4.1).  Entering  the Update command will  cause the specified
          modifications to take effect, and will return the user to the aster-
          isk system prompt (see Section 3.4.8).

          Note: A user with  UPD license may modify his own  or another user's
          profile.  Modifications  of another user's  profile may  include any
          license, node, host, or event number contained in the profile of the
          user modifying  the specified profile.   A user without  UPD license
          may only modify his own profile.  Those modifications are limited to
          deleting nodes,  hosts, or  event numbers from  his own  profile.  A
          user may also change his terminal type, his password, his time zone,
          and his color settings.


          3.4.1 Abort Command                _____________

          Syntax: ABORT
          License: None
          Default: None

          Description: The Abort  command causes the sequence  for creating or
               modifying a user's profile to  be terminated without saving the
               new or modified user's profile.   It also terminates the user's
               access to  the profile  modification commands  and returns  the
               user to the asterisk system prompt (see Section 3.4).

          Example:

               >>abort

               *


          3.4.2 Add Command                ___________

          Syntax: ADD {LICense aaaa...[ aaaa]}
                      {{NODEs|HOSTs|EVENTs} {nnnn|nnnn-nnnn}...
          License: None - to add options to user's own profile.
                   UPD - to add options to the profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description: The Add  command permits the user to  add the specified
               license, node, host  or log event number to the  profile of the
               username specified in  the Create or  Modify command  (see Sec-
               tions 3.3.3 and 3.3.4).  The license,  node, host, or log event

               number being added to the specified user's profile must be con-
               tained in the  profile of the user adding to  or modifying that
               profile.   The specified  license  "aaaa" may  be  one or  more
               options  separated by  a space  (see Section  2.0).  The  node,
               host, or log event numbers may be one or more numbers separated
               by a  space.  A range  of node, host,  or event numbers  may be
               specified using two numbers separated by a hyphen.

               Changes  made to  a user's  profile will  not become  effective
               until the user  enters the Update command  (see Section 3.4.8).
               A  user may  use the  Add command  to  add to  his profile  any
               license, node,  host, or  event just  removed using  the Remove
               command, if the Update command has  not been entered. (see Sec-
               tions 3.4.6 and 3.4.8).

               Note:  Node numbers  are octal.  Host or log  event numbers are
               decimal.

                              [FLASHING] [SEPARATE]
          License: None
          Default: Set event to white, not flashing and not separate.

          Description: The  Color Event  command specifies  that all  messages
               displayed in the Log command for  the log event numbers listed,
               will be  displayed as indicated in  the command on  the ISC8900
               terminal.   The  command  specifies   both  color  and  display
               instructions.  The  first parameters  are a  list of  log event
               numbers or  log event number  ranges separated by  spaces.  The
               second parameter specifies the color  of the displayed message.
               If no color is specified, the  message displayed will be white.
               The "flashing"  parameter specifies  whether  the message  dis-
               played will  flash.  If the  parameter is missing,  the message
               will not flash.  The "separate" parameter specifies whether the
               message will be separated by blank lines from the two surround-
               ing  messages when  displayed.  To  clear the  setting for  log
               event numbers, the  command must be entered with  the log event
               numbers only.  To list the current  settings, use the List Pro-
               file or  the List Color command  (see Section 3.3.1  or Section
               3.4.4).

               Note:  This command only  affects output on the  ISC8900 termi-
               nal; hence ISC8900  must be the current terminal  type.  If log
               messages are  not being displayed in  color, check to  see that
               the terminal type is correctly set.

          Example:

               >>color event 1 red

               >>color event 45 3-6 flashing magenta

               >>color event 47 67 57 blue flashing

                   UPD - to modify password in profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description: The Password command enables a user to change the pass-
               word of  the username being  modified.  The system  will prompt
               the  user twice  for the  password.   If the  passwords do  not
               match, the  system will begin  the prompt sequence  again.  The
               password will not be echoed at the terminal.  The password will
               not be changed  until the Update command has  been entered (see
               Section 3.4.8).

                         {{NODEs|HOSTs|EVENTs} {nnnn|nnnn-nnnn}...
          License: None - to remove option from user's own profile.
                   UPD - to remove option from profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description: The Remove command causes  the specified license, node,
               host, or log event number to be removed from the profile of the
               username being modified.   The specified license "aaaa"  may be
               one or  more options  separated by a  space (see  Section 2.0).
               The node, host, or log event numbers may be one or more numbers
               separated by a space.  A range  of node, host, or event numbers
               may be specified using two numbers separated by a hyphen.

               Changes  made to  a user's  profile will  not become  effective
               until the Update command has  been entered (see Section 3.4.8).
               A  user may  use the  Add command  to  add to  his profile  any
               license, node, host or event  removed using the Remove command,
               if the Update command has not been entered (see Section 3.4.2).

               Note:  Node numbers  are octal.  Host or log  event numbers are
               decimal.

          Example:

                   UPD - to specify terminal in profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description: The Terminal command may be used to specify the default
               terminal type.  The terminal type  determines the format of the
               output for the Display and Log commands (see Sections 3.1.1 and
               3.1.2).  Note that the Tymshare model  420 terminal is an ADM1;
               the Tymshare  model 430 terminal is  an ADM3; and  the Tymshare
               model 444 terminal is an HP2621.

               Changes  made to  a user's  profile will  not become  effective
               until the Update command has  been entered (see Section 3.4.8).
               If the user is currently logged  in, this command will not take
               effect until  the user logs off  and logs in again.   To change
               the setting for the current session only, use the Terminal com-
               mand described in Section 3.5.8.

          Example:


                                                           COMMANDS    Page 28

                   UPD - to update or add profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description: The Update command may be used to add a new or modified
               user's  profile to  the  system.  It  will  also terminate  the
               user's access to profile modification  commands, and return the
               user to the asterisk system prompt.

          Example:

               >>upd

          3.4.9 Zone Command                ____________

          Syntax: ZONE {nnnn}
          License: None - to change zone in user's own profile.
                   UPD - to change zone in profile of another user.
          Default: None

          Description:  The Zone  command is  used to  specify the  difference
               between Greenwich  Mean Time and  the user's local  time, where
               "nnn" is the  difference in minutes.  It sets  the default time
               zone to be used when a user  logs in.  Changes made to a user's
               profile will not become effective  until the Update command has
               been entered (see Section 3.4.8).  This command does not affect
               the time  zone setting if  a user is  logged in.  It  will take
               effect when the user logs off and logs in again.  To change the
               setting for the current session, use the Zone command described
               in Section 3.5.11.

               Note that the range of "nnn" is  from -720 to 720, where "-nnn"
               designates a time  differential for a location that  is East of
               Greenwich,  and "nnn"   designates a  time  differential for  a
               location that is West of Greenwich.

          Example:

               >>zone -480

               >>

          3.5.7 Send Command                ____________

          Syntax: SEND {ALL|nnn}
          License: Who
          Default: None

          Description: The  Send command  allows a  user to  send messages  to
               other users  that are logged  in.  A message  can be sent  to a
               single user or to all users  that are logged in.  The parameter
               "nnn" indicates to  which user the message is to  be sent.  The
               user  number is  obtained  from the  Who  command (see  Section
               3.5.10).  The parameter "all" indicates that the message should
               be sent to all users logged in.

               The user  is prompted for the  message after entering  the Send
               command.  The maximum length of the  message is 256 characters.
               Message text may  be continued on a  new line by using  a line-
               feed.  The entire  message must be terminated  using a carriage
               return.  Note  that each line  requires two characters  for the
               carriage return and linefeed.  The Send command process will be
               terminated if the message exceeds  256 characters, and an error
               message will be generated.

               Note that  a recipient  can have up  to four  pending messages.
               The message "USER BUSY" will be  displayed if the recipient has
               four pending  messages.  The  recipient will  receive the  sent
               message just  before the next command  prompt.  He will  not be
               interrupted while sending a command, or waiting for a response.

          Example:

               *send 8
               ENTER MESSAGE:
               All but the last line of a message is terminated
               with a line feed.
               The last line is always terminated with a carriage return.

               Sections 3.1.1  and 3.1.2).  When the  user logs in  again, the
               terminal type will be the default specified in the profile.  To
               change the default terminal type in the profile, use the Termi-
               nal command  with the Modify  command (see Section  3.4.7).  To
               list the current terminal type, use the List Profile command or
               the List Terminal command (see Section 3.3.1 or 3.5.4).

               Note that the Tymshare model 420 terminal  is an ADM1; the Tym-
               share model 430 terminal is an ADM3; and the Tymshare model 444
               terminal is an HP2621.

          Default: None

          Description: The Who command causes a listing of all TMCS users cur-
               rently logged  in.  The  output includes  a user  number and  a
               username.  The user number is assigned as users log in to TMCS,
               and may be  used to identify which user to  disconnect with the
               Hang command  (see Section 3.5.2).   An asterisk  indicates the
               user entering the command.

          3.5.11 Zone Command                 ____________

          Syntax: ZONE {nnnn}
          License: None
          Default: None

          Description:  The Zone  command is  used to  specify the  difference
               between Greenwich  Mean Time and  the user's local  time during
               the current session, where "nnn"  is the difference in minutes.
               When the user logs  in again, the time zone will  be taken from
               the profile.  To list the current  time zone, use the List Zone
               command (see Section 3.5.5).

               Note that the range of "nnn" is  from -720 to 720, where "-nnn"
               designates a time  differential for a location that  is East of
               Greenwich, and "nnn" designates a time differential for a loca-
               tion that  is West  of Greenwich.  To  change the  default time
               zone in the profile, use the Zone  command with the Modify com-
               mand (see Section 3.4.9).

          Syntax: CLEar PROBE [ssss]
          License: SETP
          Default: Clear the circuits for all Supervisors

          Description: The Clear Probe command zaps  the Probe circuit for the
               specified Supervisor.  The  Probe circuit is built  by TMCS and
               used for the  Probe command (see Section  3.1.3).  Users logged
               into PROBE at the time will be  dropped to the "*" prompt imme-
               diately, and the  message "PROBE CIRCUIT LOST"  will be output.
               After the circuit is zapped, TMCS will try to rebuild it in one
               minute.

          Description: The List Node Names command  causes the display of node
               names for the  specified node(s) "nnnn".  The  display includes
               the node number and  the node name.  The node  names are speci-
               fied  using the  Set Node  Name command  (see Section  3.6.10).
               Note that  only the names  of the  nodes in the  user's profile
               will be listed.

          Example:

               *list node name 25-30

          3.6.8 Set Host Location Command                _________________________

          Syntax: SET HOSTs LOCAtion hhhh nnnn [position]
          License: SETH
          Default: Set position to zero

          Description: The  Set Host Location command  is used to  assign host
               locations for use in the host missing  list in the Display com-
               mand  (see Section  3.1.1), where  "hhhh" is  the host  number,
               "nnnn" is the node number, and  "position" is the position num-
               ber.  This command describes  an expected network configuration
               which TMCS  will check to determine  if any hosts  are missing.
               Note that  leaving the  network is  different from  being down,
               which is reported as host down  in the Display command.  A host
               can be  located on more  than one node but  can be on  only one
               position on a node.  Hence, two  Set Host Location commands can
               refer to the  same host on different nodes,  with two different
               host locations.  Node numbers  are octal, while host  and posi-
               tion numbers are  decimal.  If the position  number is omitted,
               it is set to zero.  Note that a position number is not meaning-
               ful in  TYMNET II, except by  convention such as the  ISIS slot
               number for the host.

          Example:

               *set host loca 58 735 2

               *

          3.6.9 Set Host Name Command                _____________________

          Syntax: SET HOSTs NAME hhhh name
          License: SETH
          Default: None

          Description: The Set Host  Name command is used to assign  a name to
               host "hhhh" as a means of  tracking that host more easily.  The
               host name "name"  may be up to nine characters  in length.  The
               first character must be alphabetic, while the remaining charac-
               ters may  be alphabetic, numeric,  or an underscore.   To clear
               the host  name, use  the Clear Host  Name command  (see Section
               3.6.2).

          SECTION 4.0 LOG MESSAGES          ________________________

          This section  contains the  log messages output  using the  TMCS Log
          command or the Log command in  PROBE (see Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3).
          Each log message is followed by an  event number and a PROBE message
          number (in parentheses), a report criteria, and a description of the
          log message.   Event numbers are used  in the "events"  parameter of
          the user's  profile to control the  output of specific  log messages
          (see Section  2.0).  A listing of  the log event numbers  appears in
          Section 6.0.   The log  messages that are  displayed may  be changed
          permanently using  the Modify, and the  Add or Remove  commands (see
          Sections 3.3.4, 3.4.2,  and 3.4.6).  The Select,  Ignore and Restore
          commands  may also  be used  to control  the log  messages that  are
          printed during the  current TMCS session (see  Sections 3.1.8, 3.1.4
          and 3.1.7).  The report criteria indicates the test(s) a log message
          must satisfy  to be printed.  A  description of the  report criteria
          appears in Section 5.0.

          Log messages beginning with a node number are listed first, subfiled
          by the first character string in  the message.  Log messages that do
          not begin with a node number follow, listed in alphabetic order.

          The message output that will appear at the user's terminal is illus-
          trated in  uppercase letters, variable  portions of the  message are
          illustrated in lowercase letters.  A variable numeric output will be
          indicated by a "#" sign.  Words  enclosed in angle brackets (<>) are
          comments and will not appear in  the actual message.  Words enclosed
          in braces ({})  contain a list of  items, one of which  will appear.
          Words enclosed in  brackets ([]) are optional  descriptors which may
          not always appear.

          Any message TMCS does not recognize will appear in hexadecimal.  All
          host numbers are in  decimal.  Node numbers and  Universal User Num-
          bers (UUNs)  are in octal.   Supervisor addresses and  block numbers
          are in hexadecimal.

          Most of the messages in this  section are oriented to the operations
          environment.  However,  some messages will indicate  system problems
          and should be referred to your account representative.  These system
          problem messages are  noted as they occur  in the text of  this sec-
          tion.

          Note that where  the variable name "node#"  appears in the  log mes-
          sages, it represents the node name (if  specified) and the node num-
          ber (see Section  3.6.10).  Where the variable  name "host#" appears
          in the log messages, it represents  the host name (if specified) and
          the host number  (see Section 3.6.9).  Host and  node numbers appear
          in brackets where they appear in log messages.

               16 - an incoming call was rejected.
               17 - a call  was reset because of  the unavailability of  a PAD
                    parameter block,  a storage structure which  the interface
                    uses for Level 1 packets.
               18 - a buffer zap occurred.
               19 - a packet was ignored because of a bad GFI.
               1A - a packet was ignored because it was too short.
               1B - a clear  request was  sent on  a channel  that was  out of
                    range.   This may  happen if  an incoming  call packet  is
                    received on a channel which is out of range.
               1C - a packet other than a clear confirmation was received on a
                    channel that was out of range.
               1D - a clear indication was received on  a channel in DCE wait-
                    ing state.
               1E - a clear indication was received on  a channel in DCE clear

               20 - an unacceptable packet was received,  and was ignored.  It
                    could be a diagnostic packet.  It  could also be an incom-
                    ing call packet if  a call request is about to  be, or was
                    recently, sent.
               21 - an incorrect level one data packet was received.
               22 - a reference or value in a level one packet was in error.
               23 - an unknown PAD parameter error message was received.

                    with its own address.
                    FML  protocol: while  acting  as  a primary  station,  the
                    interface received  a reset or  an information  frame with
                    its own address.
                    It indicates that the line is looping back.
               83 - HDLC with LAP,  LAPB, and SLP protocols: an  idle line was
                    detected in accordance with the IDLELINE system generation
                    option.  A reset has been sent.
                    HDLC with FML protocol: a series  of more than 15 contigu-
                    ous ones were detected on a line.
               84 - a  frame was  ignored  because  there was  not  sufficient
                    buffer space available to store it.
               85 - a  reset frame  was transmitted,  and the  line went  into

                    not followed by a DLE character.
               8C - BSC protocol: the initial DLE character in a frame was not
                    followed by an STX character.
               8D - All but BSC protocols: a frame was received by the second-
                    ary station which was not  an information frame, but which
                    had an information field.
                    BSC protocol:  a (non-initial) DLE character  was followed
                    by a character other than another  DLE, an EOT, or an ETX.
                    This character sequence was treated as an abort.

                    mand  or  frame reject  with  an  invalid byte  count  was
                    received by the interface  while acting as a  primary sta-
                    tion.
                    FML protocol:  while acting  as a  secondary station,  the
                    interface received an  information frame while in  a state
                    which did not permit frames to be received.
               93 - the maximum frame byte count was exceeded.
               94 - a frame reject or command reject was sent.
               95 - a reject frame was sent because of a sequence error.
               96 - a reject frame was sent because of discarded frames.
               97 - a reject frame was received in information transfer state.
               98 - the T1  timer expired  for an  information frame  that was
                    previously transmitted.  As  a result  the last  unacknow-
                    ledged information  frame was retransmitted, and  the line
                    entered a time recovery state.
               99 - an  information frame  with  an  invalid send  or  receive
                    sequence was encountered, and a reset was transmitted.
               9A - the interface  acting as a  secondary station  received an
                    invalid command  or control field  prior to or  during the

                    information frame while in a disconnect state.
               9D - the interface  acting as  a primary  station on  this line
                    received an illegal control  field in information transfer
                    state.  9E - the interface acting  as a primary station on
                    this line received an information frame.
               9F - an RR frame was received during  timer recovery.  All out-

                    not receive a SARM in return, and sent a disconnect.
               A4 - LAPB or  SLP protocol: a  disconnect was sent  the maximum
                    number of times, but no UA was received.
               A5 - LAP protocol:  the interface acting  as a  primary station

               This message is a RAM error log message.

               If "aa" =  12, there has been  a tape error.  RAM  cannot write
               out to a tape drive because no  tape drive is in an "in-use" or
               an "enabled" state.  The  message will be output  every 15 min-
               utes for as long as the condition exists.  The message will not
               be repeated  if the condition no  longer exists, or if  RAM has
               paused.

               If "aa" = 13, there has been a disk error.  The message is sent
               every 15 minutes for as long as the condition exists.  The pos-
               sible failure reasons, defined in "bbbbbb", are as follows:

                    0001 - There is not enough disk space for RAM to use.
                    0002 - A bad status  condition has been returned  from the
                           disk drive or the controller.
                    0003 - There was  a checksum error  in data  received from
                           the disk.

               If "aa"  = 14, illegal accounting  data has been  received from
               the network.   RAM will  not process this  data.  The  value of
               "bbbbbb" contains  the number  of bad  records ignored  by RAM.
               The message is sent every 15 minutes  for as long as the condi-
               tion exists.

               If  "aa" =  15, the  account  slave program  transmitted a  bad
               checksum disk block  to RAM.  There is no  data associated with
               this message  subtype.  This message  is sent every  15 minutes
               for as long as the condition  exists.  Note that RAM will never
               throw away a  block with a good checksum.  To  date, this error
               has never occurred.

               If "aa" = 17, RAM is running  on insufficient memory.  The ses-
               sion pool  has overflowed.   There is  no data  associated with
               this message.

               If "aa" =  18, the current session  number is not equal  to the
               previous session number +  1.  This may occur  because approxi-
               mately 45 session numbers may be  skipped when a new Supervisor
               is brought  up.  It may also  occur if the Supervisor  builds a
               command circuit and the session  counter is incremented, but no
               accounting data  is reported.  The  value "bbbbbb"  contains an
               occurrence count of this condition.

               This is an OnTyme error log message.  The subtype "t" indicates
               the type of error, as follows:

               10 - disk drive unit "u" is down.
               11 - the switch that permits outdial activity is turned off.
               12 - disk unit "u" failed during a slot restart.
               13 - there is a data integrity error  in the disk file's Volume
                    Allocation  Table  (VAT).   A  reset  error  of  type  "u"
                    occurred during a slot restart.
               14 - there is a data integrity error  in the disk file's Volume

                                 type.

               Node code  reports occur  in TYMNET II  networks and  have this
               general format.  Some of them are documented below.

          node# NODE REPORT TYPE 1 aaaabbbb

               Event number:  8  (40)

               Report criteria: Node test

               where: 1 - channel in use.
                      aaaa = neighbor node number (+8000 if attached,
                             -1 if not a neighbor channel).

                             absolute channel number if a host channel.

               This message  was generated  because a  circuit assignment  was
               attempted on  a channel already in  use.  Within a  given node,
               each  channel is  assigned an  absolute number.   When a  given
               channel is  active, it is referred  to by its  relative channel
               number, beginning with channel 0 of each link.

          node# NODE REPORT TYPE 2 aaaabbbb

                      aaaa = neighbor node number +8000.
                      bbbb = relative channel number.

               This message was  generated because data appeared  on a channel
               that was  not assigned  to a circuit  between the  two neighbor
               nodes.

                      aaaa = buffer number.
                      bbbb = character count in buffer.

               This message was  generated because the node ran  out of memory
               space and  zapped the buffer with  the most amount of  space to
               free up memory space for general network use.

                      bbbb = 8081, if neighbor was removed; or
                             8082, if neighbor was not removed because it
                             was not found.

               This message  indicates that that  a neighbor node  was removed
               during a  change of neighbor  sequence.  In TYMNET  I, changing
               neighbors is achieved by the change  neighbor command.  In TYM-
               NET II, changing  neighbors is a two-step  process.  Neighbor X
               is removed (this  node report is logged); neighbor  Y is added,
               replacing neighbor X (the following node report is logged).

                             FFFF, if no link space available.

               This report indicates  that a neighbor node was  added during a
               change of node sequence.  Since the  number of neighbors a node
               has been  predetermined in  the Tymfile,  an existing  neighbor
               must be removed before another may be added.  (See the previous
               node report.)   This node report  is the second  necessary step
               when changing neighbors in TYMNET II.

          node# NODE REPORT TYPE 6 aaaabbbb

               Event number:  8  (40)

               Report criteria: Node test

               where: 6 - link bubble.
                      aaaa = neighbor node number +8000.
                      bbbb = number of channels.

               This  message was  generated because  a  link bubble  procedure
               occurred when a new  circuit was to be built over  a link which
               had used all of its  allocated channels.  Channels are allotted
               in increments of 128  (a half page).  The  bubble process allo-
               cates an  additional half page of  permuter table space  on the
               node.  If, for example,  a link has all of its  256 channels in
               use, the next circuit  to be built will cause the  link to bub-
               ble, allocating an additional 128 channels to the link's permu-
               ter table space.   At that time, the link will  have 257 active
               channels out of 384 allocated to it.

               Note:  The  link bubble  process should be  viewed in  terms of
               pairs of  links.  When  the link bubble  process occurs  on the
               specified node, it will also occur on the neighbor node link.

                      aaaa = neighbor node number +8000.
                      bbbb = number of channels.

               This report was generated to indicate  that a link shrink proc-
               ess has  occurred.  The link shrink  process is the  reverse of
               the  link bubble  procedure.  Whenever  4 times  the number  of
               inactive channels is greater than the  number of channels allo-
               cated plus 600, the link will shrink by a half page of permuter
               table space.  This  is done to recover permuter  table space as
               the channels  assigned are  spread out  over a  large available
               range.

               Note:  The  link shrink  process should be  viewed in  terms of
               pairs of  links.  When  the link shrink  process occurs  on the
               specified node, it will also occur on the neighbor node link.

                      bbbb = line number + 8080.

               This report was generated because a  new link was identified on
               the  line reported  in bbbb,  but the  link could  not come  up
               because the specified node was out of permuter table space.

                      bbbb = line number + 8080.

               This report occurred  because a new link was  identified on the
               line reported in "bbbb", but the link could not come up because
               the specified node was out of link descriptor space.  This con-
               dition can be fixed by increasing the number of links allocated
               to the specified node.

               This message reports the number of circuits being zapped due to

               This  message indicates  that  the node  is  out of  dispatcher
               ports.  The situation can be corrected by increasing the number
               of dispatcher ports in the Tymfile.  This involves reassembling
               and reloading the node and Kernel code.

               This message indicates that an ISIS slot host rejected a needle
               because the host was out of  ports, yet the node code indicated
               that the host had ports available.

               This message  is generated because two  slots in the  same node

               This message occurred because character pairs split, or because

               Because the  breaking up  of character  pairs is  illegal, this
               message should  not normally occur.   When character  pairs are

               This report  indicates that  the node  has taken  and recovered
               from a MAC  error (other than a  DMA timeout) in a  part of the

               error occurred in SYLVER (the  line receiver routine), no other
               action was taken.   If the error occurred in RMAKE  or RTD, the
               link being serviced at the time  of the error was snipped.  The
               virtual  address of  the error  is "aaaaaaaa".   The MAC  ABEND
               facility is  invoked by certain parts  of the code  except when
               the frequency  of all types of  MAC errors exceeds one  in four

          SECTION 5.0 REPORT CRITERIA          ___________________________

          This section  contains a description of  the types of  test criteria
          used to screen the output of log messages for specific nodes, hosts,
          lines, links  and ports  using TMCS  (see Sections  3.1.2 and  4.0).
          They are also used to screen the nodes, hosts, and lines for network
          exceptions output by the Display command (see Section 3.1.1), and to
          screen information output by the  Probe command (see Section 3.1.3).
          They are listed for  each log message as "Report  Criteria" to indi-
          cate the  requirements for generating  or restricting the  output of
          specific log messages (see Section 4.0).

          A user's  access to  log message  information is  controlled by  the
          user's profile,  and by select  lists.  The user's  profile controls
          access rights established using the  Create and Modify commands (see
          Sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.4).  The select lists are generated using the
          Ignore, Restore, and Select commands (see Sections 3.1.4, 3.1.7, and
          3.1.8).  They  determine output restrictions  for the duration  of a
          login session.

          The test criteria described below  includes the conditions that must
          be satisfied for a  user to access log message  and display informa-
          tion  regarding specific  nodes,  hosts,  lines, links,  and  ports.
          Every condition must be satisfied for a message to print.

          Node Test - is  applied to a single  node number.  It checks  to see
               that the node is in the user's profile, and that it is selected
               (not ignored).

          Host Test - is  applied to a single  host number.  It checks  to see
               that the host is in the user's profile, and that it is selected
               (not ignored).

          Node/Host Test - is  applied to a host number and  the node the host
               is on.  It checks  to see that the node or the  host are in the
               user's profile,  and that the node  and host are  selected (not
               ignored).

          Link Test - is applied to two  nodes which are neighbors.  It checks
               to see that at least one of the two nodes is in the user's pro-
               file, and that  that node has been selected  (not ignored).  It
               also checks to see that the link, consisting of both nodes, has
               been selected (not ignored).

          Port Test - is  applied to a node  number and a port  number on that
               node.  It checks to see that the  node is in the user's profile
               and has  been selected  (not ignored,  a node  test).  It  also
               checks to  see that the  line, consisting  of the node  and the
               port has been selected (not ignored).

          Link/Port Test - is applied to two nodes which are neighbors, and to
               a port  on one of  the nodes which  connects to the  other.  It
               checks to  see that  at least one  of the two  nodes is  in the

               user's profile and is selected (not  ignored, a link test).  It
               also checks  to see that the  line, consisting of the  node and
               the port has been selected (not ignored).

          Line Test - is  applied to two nodes  which are neighbors, and  to a
               port on  each node  that is  connected to  the other  node.  It
               checks to  see that  at least one  of the two  nodes is  in the
               user's  profile, and  has been  selected (not  ignored, a  link
               test).  It also checks to see  that both the line consisting of
               the first node and  the port and the second node  and port have
               been selected (not ignored).

          Note that  "General Type" messages are  not tested using any  of the
          above criteria.  They are, therefore, not restricted in any way.

          SECTION 7.0 ERROR MESSAGES          __________________________

          This section contains  a listing of the TMCS error  messages, with a
          description of each message.

          <BREAK>

               This message prints when the user hits the Break or Escape key.

          CANNOT SEND TO SELF

               This message prints  when a user attempts to send  a message to
               his own logged  in user identifier.  Messages can  only be sent
               to all users or to another user (see Section 3.5.7).

          CHECKSUM ECHO MISMATCH

               The  checksum was  echoed  incorrectly  during the  setting  or
               clearing of the remote greeting message.  The login string used
               to build the circuit for the operation precedes the message.

          CIRCUIT ERROR: FAILURE OPERATION: RECEIVE

               This message occurred  because a circuit zap  occurred during a
               read operation while attempting to send  a remote greeting mes-
               sage.  The login string used to build the circuit for the oper-
               ation precedes the message.

          CIRCUIT ERROR: FAILURE OPERATION: SEND

               This message was  sent because a circuit zap  occurred during a
               send operation while attempting to send  a remote greeting mes-
               sage.   The login  string used  to  build the  circuit for  the
               remote greeting operation precedes the message.

          CLEAR DATE MUST BE IN THE FUTURE

               This message printed because the  date specified  using the Set
               Greeting Message or  the Set Greeting Entry command  must be in
               the future.

          COMMAND BYTE ECHO MISMATCH

               The command byte was entered  incorrectly during the setting or
               clearing of a  remote greeting message.  The  login string used
               to build the circuit for this operation precedes the message.

          END OF LINE EXPECTED

               This message prints when the system  has scanned an entire com-
               mand and finds excess characters on the line.

          EVENT NUMBER OUT OF RANGE

               This message prints when the event number specified in the Add,
               Remove, Select,  Ignore, and Restore  command is not  a decimal
               number from 1 to 255 (see  Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.6, 3.1.8, 3.1.4,
               and 3.1.7).

          HOST NUMBER OUT OF RANGE

               This message prints when the host number entered using the Add,
               Remove, Select, Ignore or Restore command is not a decimal num-
               ber in the  range of assembled-in host  numbers.  (see Sections
               3.4.2, 3.4.6, 3.1.8, 3.1.4 and 3.1.7).

          ILLEGAL DATE

               This message  prints when there is  a syntax error in  the date
               entered, or when an invalid date is entered.

          ILLEGAL PAIR

               This message prints  when there is an  error in a line  or line
               specification in  the Select, Ignore,  or Restore  command.  It
               usually  indicates that  the first  number of  the pair,  which
               should be a node, is not an octal  number, or that the two num-
               bers are not separated by a colon.  (See Sections 3.1.8, 3.1.4,
               or 3.1.7)

          ILLEGAL TIME

               This message  prints when there is  a syntax error in  the time
               entered, or when an invalid time is entered.

          ILLEGAL USER NUMBER

               This  message prints  when an  invalid user  number is  entered
               using the Hang command or the  Send command (see Sections 3.5.2
               and 3.5.7).

          LOGGER ACCESS LOST

               This message prints  when access to the  event message database
               has been lost.   If the problem persists,  contact your account
               representative.

          LOGGER NOT AVAILABLE

               This message prints when the user is unable to access the event
               message  database while  using  the  Log command  (see  Section
               3.1.2).  If the  problem persists, contact your  account repre-
               sentative.

          NO CIRCUIT TO AWAKE SUPERVISOR

               This  message prints  when the  user enters  the PROBE  command
               without specifying a Supervisor and TMCS cannot build a circuit
               to the active Supervisor (see Section 3.1.3).

          NO MORE ROOM FOR NEW USERS

               This message prints when a user tries to log in and exceeds the
               current limit of TMCS users.

          NODE NUMBER OUT OF RANGE

               This message prints when the node  number specified in the Add,
               Remove, Select, Ignore, or Restore command is not an octal num-
               ber from 1 to 3777 (see Sections 3.4.2, 3.4.6, 3.1.8, 3.1.4 and
               3.1.7).

          NOT A NUMBER

               This message prints when the user does not enter a number where
               one is expected.

          NOT A SUPERVISOR

               This message  prints when  a nonexistent  Supervisor number  is
               specified.

          NOT A SYMBOL

               This message prints when the user enters  a number where a non-
               numeric character is expected.

          NOT ALLOWED

               This message prints  when a user enters a command  that he does
               not have proper license to use.

          NOT FOLLOWED BY A BREAK

               This message prints when the user  does not follow a command or
               a value with the required space or Carriage Return.

          OFFSET OUT OF RANGE

               This message  prints when the offset  given in the  Log command
               would produce  a time before January  1, 1974 0:0 GMT  or after
               January 21, 2042 3:14:07 GMT (see Section 3.1.2).

          PORT NUMBER OUT OF RANGE

               This message prints when  the port number in  a line specifica-
               tion in  a Select, Ignore, or  Restore command is not  an octal
               number from 1 to 377 (see sections 3.1.8, 3.1.4, and 3.1.7)

          ***PROBE CIRCUIT LOST***

               This message prints when the circuit  to PROBE has been discon-
               nected.

          PROBE NOT AVAILABLE

               This  message prints  when a  circuit  cannot be  built to  the
               requested PROBE Supervisor.

          RANGE BACKWARDS

               This message prints when the second  value entered to specify a
               range is less  than the first value entered.   The second value
               must be greater than or equal to the first value entered.

          REMOTE GREETING CIRCUIT BUILD ERR; OR: reason

               A circuit build operation failed during the setting or clearing
               of a remote greeting message, for one of the following reasons:

                    -  ACCESS BARRED
                    -  BAD MUD
                    -  DOWNLINE LOAD REQUEST FAILURE
                    -  ERROR IN ISIS
                    -  ERROR TYPE: # (0, or greater than 9 and less than 128)
                    -  FORMAT ERROR
                    -  HOST UNAVAILABLE
                    -  LONG QUEUE IN SUPERVISOR
                    -  TIMEOUT
                    -  USER NOT IN MUD

          REMOTE GREETING CIRCUIT BUSY

               Only one user may set or  clear remote greeting messages at any
               given time, because TMCS reserves only one port for these oper-
               ations.  This message printed because one user tried to execute
               the Set Greeting message command  or the Clear Greeting message
               command while another user was using one of them.

          REMOTE GREETING MESSAGE TOO LONG

               This message printed  because a user attempted to  set a remote
               greeting message  that was  longer than  254 characters.   Note
               that the  sequence to  set a remote  greeting message  has been
               aborted.

          SHOULD BE: bbbbb

               This message  prints when  the user does  not enter  a required
               parameter.  The list of acceptable parameters is "bbbbb".

          aaaaa SHOULD BE: bbbbb

               This message prints when the  user enters an invalid parameter.
               The invalid parameter is "aaaaa".  The choices for valid param-
               eters are the list "bbbbb".

          STOP TIME MUST BE AFTER START TIME

               This message  prints when the stop  time in the Log  command is
               less than the start time (see Section 3.1.2).

          SYSTEM ERROR ACCESSING PROFILE

               This message prints when a disk  failure or a programming prob-
               lem prevents the user from accessing the specified profile.

          TOO MANY LINES

               This message prints when more than thirty lines are selected or
               ignored in the Select, Ignore,  or Restore command (see Section
               3.1.8, 3.1.4, or 3.1.7).

          TOO MANY LINKS

               This message prints when more than thirty links are selected or
               ignored in the Select, Ignore,  or Restore command (see Section
               3.1.8, 3.1.4, or 3.1.7).

          UNKNOWN COMMAND

               This message prints when the command string entered is unrecog-
               nizable and therefore invalid.

          USER nnnn BUSY

               This message prints  when a user attempts to send  a message to
               user identifier nnnn,  and that user already  has four messages
               pending (see Section 3.5.7).

          USER ALREADY EXISTS

               This  message prints  when  a  username being  created  already
               exists.

          USER BEING MODIFIED

               This message prints when  the user is trying to  modify a user-
               name that is  currently being created, modified,  or deleted by
               another user (see Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, and 3.3.5).

          USER DOES NOT EXIST

               This message prints when the  username specified in the Modify,
               Delete, or  List Profile command  does not exist  (see Sections
               3.3.3, 3.3.4, 3.3.5, and 3.3.1).

          USER NOT LOGGED IN

               This message prints when one user attempts to send a message to
               a user who is not logged in (see Section 3.5.7).

          ZONE BIAS SHOULD BE BETWEEN -720 AND 720

               This message prints  when the user enters an  invalid zone bias
               in the Zone command (see Sections 3.4.9 and 3.5.11).
