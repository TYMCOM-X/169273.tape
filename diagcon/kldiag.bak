        Software Backup for the KL diagnostics is in the following
        form.

        1). There are 12 source files for the KL diagnostics. They are
            on C39 under user name DIAGCON. (See attachment A for the
            file names). These files are the working set and are declared
            READ ONLY to protect against accidental changes.

        2). There are 12 backup files on C39 under user name DIAGNAT.
            (see attachment A for the file names). These files are 
            READ ONLY and changed only when the source file is debugged.

        3). A redundant set of files is stored on C33. The source files
            are in DIAGCON and the backup files are in DIAGNAT.
            The file names are the same as on C39.

        4). A mag tape with the source files is kept in my office. This
            tape is generated about once a month using the BACKUP program.

        5). These files can also be recovered using the standard ALL FILES
            and BACKUP procedures from operations.

        The source files are the only files that are protected in this manner.
        The other files are generated using the MACY11 assembler. The assembler
        generates a list file which is spooled to provide the listings.
        It also generates a binary file which is used by the CONVRT program to
        generate the "ASCIIZED" .A11 file.

         Listings for the source files are kept in my office.
