        MODEMS

        THERE ARE SEVERAL LEVELS OF MODEM SOPHISTICATION. THE LOWEST
        LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY IS USED FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION
        OF DIGITAL DATA THROUGH THE USE OF LOW-FREQUENCY NORMAL DIAL PHONE
        LINES.
        THE SECOND LEVEL OF MODEM TECHNOLOGY ,CALLED A SMART MODEM , OFFERS
        FEATURES SUCH AS AUTOMATIC ANSWERING , AUOTMATIC DIALING ,AND
        AND AUTO LINE RESET AT THE COMPLETION OF OPERATION. IN ADDITION IT
        WILL TRANSMIT DATA AT A BAUD RATE OF 1200 BITS PER SECOND AS OPPOSED
        TO THE MORE PRIMITIVE 300 BAUD RATE.
        A HIGHER LEVEL MODEM CALLED A INTELLIGENT MODEM , INCORPORATES A
        MEMORY,AND MICROPROCESSOR BASED CONTROL SYSTEM. THESE SYSTEM
        INCLUDE AN ON-BOARD REAL TIME CLOCK/CALENDAR TO PROVIDE AUTO
        -MATIC TIME MANAGEMENT. IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BUILT IN MEMORY
        AND MICROPROCESSOR ,A MODEM CAN BE PROGRAMED TO TRANSMIT 
        DATA ON A SCHEDULED BASIS.
        FEATURES THAT PERMIT THE TRANSMISSION AND RECEPTION OF DIGITAL DATA
        WITH OUT A OPERATOR IN ATTENDANCE REQUIRE A MORE COMPLEX COM-
        MUNICATIONS SOFTWARE PROGRAM.
