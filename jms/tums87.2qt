Hello Joe..

Remember the crashes on D55 last weekend right after rebuild on
3652 disk. Running with /B03 monitor they were keep crashing with
GTSAP1 STCODE. System would not run more than hour or so.

When operation try to bring F26 up with /B03 this mornning, system
crashed with GTSAP1 and crash is saved. System is now up with
SYSTEM which is /B01.

Only crash saved is on F26. The ones on D55 could not be saved because
of CRASH.SAV being 0 word long and BOOTS not quite working.

Joe,
  What needs to be done to build a P034/P-14 monitor for system B-39 with
more than 16 disks?   (What I'm really asking is:  Where are the sources?
Are the old P034 config files with the sources?  Do we have a place, or a
system to restore the files, so that we can build it?)

  B39 is currently configured for 2*8 disks, so we do have to recompile
since we do not have a fix (as yet) for the problems they are having.

I saw in some of the crash mail on 29 or 74 that they were had reloaded the
system because of BADPAG messages.  You may wish to include some message
which specifically states that the flare-up of messages is NOT a reason to
reload, although it may be reason to move a pack or PAKCOP a pack before
the count gets too high on a single unit.

Subject: Telephones at MDC center 

Craig,
  as per the 5.18.87 minutes for the relocation users group concerning
telephones at MDC center...

"Wiring orders have been placed for the telephone system.  The Scheme
calls for two terminals and one voice line per office.  Work areas and
file rooms requiring special requirements need to be identified with
your telephone coordinator.  Departments requiring other than twisted
pair wiring for data need to contact Judy Carlson.  Recommended tele-
phone equipment standards will remain as issued."

Our telephone needs (as we presented them for the current AT&T system
at Liberty) with multi-line capability for the hotline, support-line
and our own individual lines with call-hold (via call-waiting or multiple
lines for our individual stations) do not fall into the "two terminals
and one voice line per office" guidelines.

Are we going to be able to have the multi-line phones in the new offices
with these capabilities?

Will we need more than twisted pair to communicate with our micronodes?
Will our access to our micronodes be via the phone, or via hard lines?
If by phone, what data speeds and might we not want a couple of direct
dial modems installed on dataset lines on the micronodes in the new lab
building?  (I guess we still need to talk to Judy Carlson about this?)

Subject: WHEN program change 

TO make WHEN work correctly with ARGPAR, only switches may exist in the
SWITCH.INI file.  To make the OLD usage of WHEN work do the following:

Old:  WHEN  /MULTI CARL, OSMAN, JMS
New:  WHEN  /MULTI /USERS:CARL, OSMAN, JMS

You may also specify /USERS:xxx on the command line, but that defeats the
purpose of the command line and overrides it. SO, proper usage is:

WHEN user,user/switch
WHEN ?
WHEN

This works but the results are funny:

WHEN user1,user2/USERS:user3,user4

...this reports user3 and user4, completely ignoring user1 and user2.

Subject: THUNG Fix, /B07 monitor .. 

I copied P035/B07 from (M33) to (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on systems
F26, F29, F39, F58, F70. Sent mail to oper to bring the
systems up with NEWMON next time they come up. System F38
is running with /B07 as of today.

o  (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all of the PDP10's except B39 is a P035/B08 monitor.
   Please bring all the systems up with it next time they come up.  Some
   of them already running with /B08 monitor, this is to make all of them
   run with the same monitor.

o  B39, please continue to run it with P034/P-16 monitor untill we find
   out why it wouldn't run the /B06 monitor.

o  FTACFC STOPCD, we are looking into it, will let you know when we come
   up with a solution.

(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all Fremont D. C. systems are P035/B10 monitor.
Please bring the systems up with it next time they come up.  It has
a fix so that the system won't crash (KAF) when OSIRUS RESTORE is
reading ONTYME accounting tapes.  Thank You.
