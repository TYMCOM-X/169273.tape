Hi Joe.  Oddly enough, I have tested all this stuff on my own Rainbow (which is
a 100B with 380K) and it all worked OK -- I can roll back 6 or 8 screens with
no problem, and double-h/w lines roll back & forth just fine.  I use your
torture test all the time, and it comes out as it's supposed to, but you're 
right, even on my 100B, I get duplicates of the top line of the last screen,
but instead of 24, I get 46 of them...  Of course, it's not totally obvious
what the program should do with lines that scroll off the top of the lower
scrolling region...  I suspect the latter problem is caused by saving the
top line of the screen each time a line scrolls off the top of the scrolling
region.  I'm not sure it's worth the effort of fixing...  The other problems
are either a matter of incorrectly sensing the amount of memory available for
screen buffers, or else some peculiarity of the 100A vs the 100B.  I take it
you have a 100A...  How much memory?  - Frank

How do things get into (BADFILES) in the first place?

(BADFILES) = [3,777006] and exists on 930/62/95 only.  It has NFS set on the
UFD so TITO won't look at it.  Files are renamed there manually when we
discover them bad.  On all other systems, we use (CRASH) for this purpose.

KI hung, opcode 0, PC 0.  I restarted the null job, got a APRFAT with NXM.
System cam up, saw only 512K.  Then I notice the 2nd memory box had shut itself
off.  Hit the poer-on button, came back OK.  Does Lenny know about this?  /Joe

Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, Bonnie, System 58.
Symptom:  Accounting/MIS people could not run 1022.  This problem had
          occurred previously and Rick Daniels said to have them call
          us about it.
Problem:  (SYS)1022.SHR was protected ALL RD NO.  I changed it to ALL
          RD RD and I was able to run it without license.  I don't
          know for sure if this solves MIS's problems but we will see.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, Bonnie, System 74.
Symptom:  MAGCON doesn't work right... keep getting checksum or parity
          errors when trying to generate tapes.

          I tried MAGCON, TITO and BACKUP and at 1600 BPI, all three had
          problems with tape write parity errors (or the equivalent). I
          then tried TITO at 6250 and it worked fine.  This confirms that
          Operations has had NO problems with the backups and all-files.

Problem:  Tape drives work fine at 6250, not at all at 1600. Have FSC
          look at the hardware, probably in the formatting circuitry if
          they are anything like our Kennedys, they use they use two sets
          of circuits, one for high and one for low density.

Subject: (M33)A07.SCM 

I've combined the DIFFERs of *.A00 thru current into A07.SCM.  I can't see
anything that would cause the noname stopcode when TITO starts restoring
after a refresh.  (The stopcode is caused when CORE1 sees a page fault for
a PCB that is not associated with any UPT, at PCBFLT+2.)  Please check if
there is anything you can see that I missed.  /Joe

Re: A07.SCM

Only things I wondered about...
  @IOCHN1-5 added label CPYKON with code
  previous references JRST CPYKON changed to PUSHJ P,CPYKON
 *previous references JRST CPYCHN changed to PUSHJ P,CPYKON  (NOT CPYCHN???)

  @GTSAP0++
  rearranged DSKOFF could change timing, but for 2-3 instructions? I will
  have to really doubt it.

  SATMRK code modified, removed MOVE T4,STTFPC(T2) in lieu of MOVIE T4,777777
  (ahem MOVEI not MOVIE) inside error code... possible side effects of T4 set
  prior to calling error routine, especially if NO error happens?

Didn't see anything else...

  minor complaint about TOPS-10 code you've moved around... adding more &
  more of the comments...  WE are NOT TOPS-10!  Compatibility is one issue
  but we don't need to litter our code with all the comments, where we are
  different!  Seeing all these comments in the FILCOMs is just confusing
  if we are hunting for real differences to the code...  and as once before,
  I will not be surprised if the bug is a typo, due to TOPS-10 not working
  the same as TYMCOM-X and using their code!  Please try to find and fix
  our bug without cluttering everything internally.  Thanks.

Didn;'t see anything else worth mentioning...

Subject: FULL DSKCLN on X95 

I rebuilt the RIB to HOME.SYS (using 1051's HOME.SYS as a guide).
The RIB on page 4 got wiped out when I tried writing BOOTS to pages 3,4,5
which does not work on a system without SPAGES.SYS.  Anyway, we can now
run a FULL DSKCLN again on our 2020.  You can look at (JMS:95)HOME2.CTL to
see how I did it.   /Joe

I have attacked the symptom (but not the cause) of the system dying with
KAF (Keep Alive Failure) when attempting to recover from tape read errors
at 1600 bpi.  See MARKER for comments - the real culprit has yet to be
located.   /Joe

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mary (415) 498-2588, System F58.
Problem:  System had THUNG errors earlier and related disk problems, so
          FSC had the system to check things out.  When FSC gave the
          system back, they left some of the spare drives powerd up and
          on-line.  They told operatios that they didn't change anything
          so operations started to bring the system up.

          This resulted in missing or inconsistant pack-set id on one
          or more of the spare drives.  BPA7 was formatted a DSKB0, so we
          had two dskb0's, system wanted to know if they wanted to init
          the BAT pages, etc.

Solution: I had them stop the machine, bring it to boots... check the CTY
          output for the previous "good" load of the system, and verify
          which packs should be spinning and which ones should be off-line.
          After that, I had them follow the procedure for missing/inconsist-
          ant pack-set id (i walked them through DDT).  System came up and
          is running a FULL DSKCLN at this very moment.
