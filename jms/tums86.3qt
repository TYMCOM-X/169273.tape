Subject: KL in Training is not in good shape. 

They removed the internal memory and were in the process of installing the
external memory interface when work stopped on the KL-2050 on Albrae Street.
I think it is a political problem that has prevented Rhett from verifying that
the existing hardware works (right now, it won't even run diagnostics).
Theoretically, new peripherals could be plugged in and it would work the first
time.  But Osman and Rhett do not have confidence in that particular piece of
hardware, and do not expect that reviving it will be made high priority.
Jim Daughtry has some say in the matter, you should approach him.

There was a second KL, a 1080 with a model-A backplane that was purchased from
U.C. Berkeley for it's DMA10 memory controller.  It is not in good shape
either.

Since you are looking for a KL that is guarenteed to be in good working order,
I don't think either KL in Training is suitable.

For some reason, I had always thought that 930 was located in Cupertino
on Bubb Road in Bldg. C.

I also noticed that some of the C machines were transferred to Bubb's
internal network (in particular, C39 => B39).

On other subjects, when are you guys leaving for Worldcon?  Gonna bring
back any peaches or pecan pies?  :-)

WORLDCON was fine.  New Orleans won the honor of hosting the 1988 Worldcon,
Boston in 1989 (England in 1987, but we will be going to the alternate in
New Mexico instead).

I noticed several garbled mail messages, so I hung 930, stopped its microcode
long enough for the base to notice, and then reloaded the F3.  The problem is
something in P034/P34 that affects all processors - COMMON does not clean up
after itself when taking the system down like is used to.  In the process of
fixing that, I will look into passing more information across reloads.  Such
as time of day, and reason for the reload.			/Joe

The name used to get to the TXS micronet from TYMNET has changed.  The hyphen
has been removed, it is now "TXSTEST", "TXSTEST:930", "TXSTEST:62", or
"TXSTEST:95".			/Joe

Osman,
   I'm not sure if CUPC is providing this information... but I know that
DALLAS is NOT...  in the crash mail, I'd like them to list what monitor
was running as well as what monitor was loaded after the crash.  Dallas
is telling us the STOPCD and the monitor that is being loaded, but not the
monitor that was running at the time of the crash.

   Does everyone agree that this information is a good idea?

C70 had MISSING OR INCONSISTANT PACK-SET ID.  L.T. Smith tried calling
(415)495-3891 without success (the number is 3841).  He tried the TYMCOM-X
Hotline at (415)794-2567 but got no answer after 6 rings.  He did have my
home phone number, left over from Tuesday night.  I fixed the PACK-SET ID
problem over the phone, then told the right beeper number and warned them
about the amount of time it takes our phone system to forward to South Bay.

Craig, we need to send out an updated memo so that all three datacenters will
use the same procedure.  Also, who do we call about getting my beeper fixed
before Sep 29th?		/Joe

Bill Fischergave me a contact at Memorex who gave me a contact who

Bob Reddell at 408-987-1450.  I will try to call to see if he is the

In-reply-to: A41514@Ontyme.Tymnet of F30 TIME RESET

I have built a new monitor for F30 and copied it to NEWMON.  This monitor will
adjust the time-of-day whenever it gets the date/time from the Supervisor.
The adjustment is gradual so that accounting files will not be messed up
by a sudden change.  There will be an EVENT stopcode "TIMEOK" whenever the
time is adjusted by more than 60 seconds.  At the end of the gradual adjustment,
another message will come out on the CTY stating what the date/time has been
set to.

The time will be adjusted automatically at least once a day, when the new
Supervisor takes over the network.  It will also be changed whenever the
system changes from being SHUT to UNSHUT.  Therefore you can cause an
immediate adjustment by simply typing "SCHED 400000" then "SCHED 0".
