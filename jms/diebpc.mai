Subject: Ignore CRA010 and CRA011 on X32. 

The two stopcodes DIEBPC on X32 should be ignored.  When the correct patch -4
was applied, it was put on all systems in Fremont EXECPT 32.  I don't know
how I could have missed that one.  Therefore, these two crashes were not
the result of running the KL with a fast clock.   /Joe
