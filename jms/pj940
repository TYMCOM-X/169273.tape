.nextsect '940 PJ Program Source Files'
The source files for the various 940 PJ programs are all on the directory SSPAMSYM
on system 1. The commands files used to create the go files and PAM overlay
are on SSPAMBIN on system 1. The commands files require that the object
files are on SSPAMBIN and that BPAM and BPAM1, the PAM
object files, are on SSPAMBIN. The
object files are created on SSPAMBIN by running NARP with the source file.
There are also commands files to create DDT files
on SSPAMBIN from the object code for each source.
The controlling program on PJ is PAM which controls the start up of
all the automatic programs which run on PJ. The automatic programs are referred
to as JOBs and the schedule is set for them on each system by running MAKEJOB.
The following are the names of all the go files for PJ jobs:
.sp 2
.in 10
L732MMUD - Updates Supervisor MUDs, runs consistency
.br
NLLUD10 - Updates PDP-10 LUDs
.br
LLUD70 - Updates 370 LUDs
.br
LPERP - Checks PERP and sets alarm if not running
.br
LMPADR - Moves remote printer addresses to all systems.
.br
LTABLE - Copies rotation tables and Class and Group tables
.br
LPTFR - Moves master DS password file to all 940s
.br
LCLET - Cancels old mail and writes it to user's mailbox
.br
LMAIL - Checks oper mail on MDSI, sets alarm
.br
LLUD - Updates 940 LUDs
.br
LRES - Restricts and unrestricts system, sets and resets priority schedule
.br
LPSCHED - Sends PERP schedule system updates
.br
LSLUD - Makes save LUD file, cancels expired broadcast letters
.br
LSPWARN - Warns operator of Spool overflow
.br
L10TFR - Transfers 940 accounting files (CAIS940) to PDP-10 accounting
.sp

The programs are installed on PJ as a JOB without any license, PAM is
the only program with license, it has exec license. The last
six programs listed are on all the 940s, the first 10 are only on
some of the 940s, the systems on which each program should be
installed is listed in the section below which describes the program.
In the sections below there are examples for creating the go files, the
lower case letters are input by the user and the UPPER case
letters are output by the programs, the leftmost dash are exec level command
prompts.

.pushsect 'PAM - Control Program'
PAM is the control program which reads the JOBS control file and starts programs
at the intervals input in MAKEJOB. There are two source files for PAM on
SSPAMSYM:1, 16PAM and 13NPAM1. To assemble PAM run NARP to create
the object files BPAM and BPAM1 on SSPAMBIN and run the commands MAKESHORTPAM.
Below is an example of how to create the go file.
.in 10
.sp 2
(Run NARP to assemble BPAM.)
.sp 2
-narp

and the results of the assembly.)
.sp 2
(Run NARP again the assemble BPAM1.)
.sp 2

.br
OBJECT FILE: (sspambin)bpam1
.br
 NEW FILE                (*enter a carriage return*)
.br
TEXT FILE:               (*enter a carriage return*)
.sp 2
(Next cfd to SSPAMBIN and run the commands file MAKESHORTPAM.)
.sp 2
-cfd sspambin
.sp 2
-com makeshortpam
.sp 2
(The commands file will output the identities of the source files
NPAM and NPAM1 and the results of creating the go file PAM.)
.sp 2
.in
When the commands file has completed it will return to the exec level prompt and PAM
may be installed on PJ. PAM must be given exec status and INIT, since it
runs automatically when PJ is logged into.
To set exec license set your SETE license then run 1SETLIC as follows:
.in 10
.sp 2
-1setlic
.sp 2
SET LICENSE, VERSION 1
.sp 2
LICENSE: exec
.sp 2
FILE: (pj)pam
.sp 2
LICENSE SET (PJ)PAM
.br
E.O.J.
.sp 2
(Then INIT the program.)
.sp 2
-init (pj)pam
.sp 2
(Do a directory on (PJ)PAM to be sure everything is set.)
.sp 2
-dir (pj)pam
.sp 2
R/W  INT  21000017,64361 10-11(1977)  1021   5376  PAM
.sp 2
.in
Everything up to the comma must be as above, the 17 before the comma
means exec license is set and the program is an INIT file.

.popsect 1 'Supervisor MUD Update - L732MMUD'
The program which updates the supervisor's MUDs and runs consistency
is a critical program which must run frequently to avoid serious
problems with NETWORK validations. The source file for the (PJ) MUD
update program which was installed May 3, 1984 is (SSPAMSYM:1)15C732MMUD.
To create the go file, run narp to make an object file on SSPAMBIN:1,
then cfd to SSPAMBIN and run the commands file MAKESHORTPAML732MMUD as shown in the following example (lower case is input by the user and UPPER
case is output by the program).
