i don't really know much about formatting disks.  i do know that you can use a

a way. also, this board is running on a corvis 20 meg.  you should either talk

Subject: 3DVS.arc
Hoot,
    Thank you very much.  In trying to get the graphics routines patched
together into a set of callable library functions I have found that the
init_option routine doesn't initialize the option correctly.  If you use
the routine and then draw some rectangles in different colors the results are 
bizarre unless you first run REGIS or Colormagic.  If either of
those is ruirst then everything works as expected.  Any idea what might
be wrong?  I downloaded the code from this board, I assume it is correct.
                                         Bruce

Subject: 3DVS.ARC
Hi Marshall,
      I uploaded the file 3DVS.ARC and the utility program ARC410.EXE today.  
3DVS.ARC contains the source code for a program which is reputed to perform 
real-time 3-d graphics.  It is described in the September 1984 Byte Computer 
Graphics issue.  Here is the problem.  The source is all in ASM86 for CP/M.  I 
have assembled it and tried to run the program but it doesn't work.  It seems 
that the routines to initialize the graphics option are missing.  I know that 
such routines are in the graphics manual but not being much of an assembler 
programmer I don't know how to convert the MASM-86 code to ASM86.  Is there 
any chance that you or someone there has those routines in ASM86?
Alternatively, is there any interest there at the Rainbow group in 
implementing such a set of routines under MS-DOS?  I know of many people who 
would be very happy to be able to do 3-d graphics on the Rainbow.  Thank you 
very much for your time.  You can leave a message for me here or else send 
mail to FIDO #36.
                                        Bruce
