	1) Rename the new file as DSK:COOKIE.TXT and run the CKYSRT.SNO
	   program which sorts the entries, and discards duplicate lines.

	2) Execute COOKIE.MAC (.REL) which reads COOKIE.INP (created by

	3) .SSAVE the resultant core image as SYS:COOKIE.EXE and you
	   should be finished.  COOKIE.MAC builds the cookie pointers

	   eaters on the system.

	The format of the file is <first record (this one)> <bar>
