                         TECO COMMAND SUMMARY

     For complete descriptions and examples of TECO's commands,  refer
to the TECO manual and DOC:TEC124.DOC.

                            * * * * * * *



                              SYMBOLS AND DEFINITIONS
                              ------- --- -----------

^             Designates  the  following  letter  or  character  as  a
              control  character.   In general, TECO will allow you to
              type a control character in the  "<up-arrow><character>"
              form, unless it is part of a text string within a search
              or insert command.

$             Altmode or escape key (^[).

<CR>          Carriage return key (^M).

<LF>          Line feed key (^J).

<TAB>         Tab key (^I).

<FF>          Form feed key (^L).

m or n        Represents any number.   Many  TECO  commands  accept  a
              numeric  argument, which, if missing, generally defaults
              to 1.

i             Represents  one  of  A-Z,  0-9,  or  *  for   Q-register
              commands.

Buffer        A block of core memory within TECO into  which  text  is
              read or inserted, edited, and output.

Page          The amount of text read into  the  buffer  by  an  input
              command  or  output  by  an  output command.  Editing is
              performed in the buffer on a page by page basis.

Buffer Pointer
              Represents the current position within the buffer  where
              editing  is  taking place; always positioned between two
              characters.

Q-registers   Auxiliary data storage locations available  for  storing
              numbers, character strings, and TECO commands.

Filespec

     dev:filnam.ext<prot>[proj,prog,sfd1,sfd2,..]/switch1/switch2..

Creating and Editing a File


                            CREATING AND EDITING A FILE
                            -------- --- ------- - ----

              The following monitor  commands  automatically  run  the
              TECO editor and perform standard file initialization.

MAKE filespec<CR>
              Create a new file  with  TECO.   Performs  an  automatic
              EWfilespec$.

TECO filespec<CR>
              Edit an existing file with TECO.  Performs an  automatic
              EBfilespec$EY$ sequence.

TECO<CR>      Enter TECO using the file named in the previous edit.

MAKE filespec1=filespec2<CR>
              Same as "TECO  filespec2",  but  direct  the  output  to
              filespec1,  and  don't create a .BAK file.  (Performs an
              automatic  EWfilespec1$ ERfilespec2$ EY$  sequence.)   A
              "TECO" command will always ignore the second filespec if
              given, causing filespec1 to be editted  normally.   This
              allows  "TECO <CR>" commands following a MAKE command to
              continue to edit the newly created file rather than read
              from the original one again.

TECO filespec$command$...$command<CR>
              Execute the specified commands  following  the  filespec
              automatically after entering TECO (works with MAKE too).
              The command string will be remembered  as  part  of  the
              filespec  on  subsequent "TECO<CR>" commands.  Note that
              the "$" characters shown are dollar-signs, not  escapes.
              Since  real  escapes on the command line would cause the
              command to terminate  prematurely,  we  make  use  of  a
              "pseudo-escape"  character,  the dollar sign.  TECO will
              substitute real escapes as it executes the command(s).

R TECO<CR>    Run the TECO editor  without  selecting  any  files  for
              editing.   File  selection  must  be  made with the TECO
              commands described under "File Selection".


                                 EXITING FROM TECO
                                 ------- ---- ----

EX            Output the remainder of the input file, close the output
              file, and then exit to the monitor.  If an ED command is
              in effect, run the specified program.

EG            Output  the  remainder  of  the  file,  close  and  then
              re-execute  the  last  compile  class  command  that was
              typed.
TECO Command Summary                                            Page 4
Exiting from TECO


^C            Exit immediately to the monitor.  May also  be  used  to
              abort  an editing session (leaves original file intact).
              Typing CONTINUE (perhaps after performing  some  monitor
              commands)  will allow you to resume your editing session
              where you left off.  Typing REENTER will cause  TECO  to
              abort  any command string it may have been executing and
              ask for the next command.  (This is  good  for  stopping
              infinite  search  loops,  etc.) ^C can be entered in the
              command string by typing it as up-arrow C.

^Z            Close the output file and exit to the monitor.   (Simple
              close; no files are renamed).


                                  BUFFER POSITIONS
                                  ------ ---------

B             Beginning of the buffer; 0.

.             Current pointer position; number of  characters  to  the
              left of the pointer.

Z             End of the buffer; number of characters in the buffer.

m,n           m+1st through nth characters in the buffer.   Used  with
              the K, P, S, T, and X commands.

H             Entire buffer; B,Z.


                                POINTER POSITIONING
                                ------- -----------

nJ            Move  pointer  to  position  between   nth   and   n+1st
              characters.

nC            Advance pointer n positions.

nR            Move pointer back n positions.  Equivalent to -nC.

nL            Move pointer to  beginning  of  nth  line  from  current
              pointer position.

0L            Move pointer to beginning of current line.


                                ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
                                ---------- ---------

m+n           Add.

m n           Add.
TECO Command Summary                                            Page 5
Arithmetic Operators


m-n           Subtract.

m*n           Multiply.

m/n           Divide and truncate.

m&n           Bitwise logical AND.

m#n           Bitwise inclusive OR.

                              FILE SELECTION SWITCHES
                              ---- --------- --------

              These switches may also be used with the MAKE  and  TECO
              monitor commands.

/READONLY     Used with TECO command to cause ER instead of EB.

/INPLACE      Used with EB to cause file to  be  overwritten  with  no
              .BAK file.

/APPEND       Used with MAKE command to cause EA instead of EW.

/DEFAULT      Used with ER, EW, EA,  EB,  EI  and  EP  to  cancel  any
              filespec defaults previously in effect.

/GENLSN       Used with EW or EB to cause line sequence numbers to  be
              generated.

/SUPLSN       Used with ER,  EB,  or  EW  to  suppress  line  sequence
              numbers.

/NOLSN        Used with ER, EB to assume no sequence numbers.


                                     LOG FILES
                                     --- -----

/NOIN         Used with EL to keep terminal input out of the log file.

/NOOUT        Used with EL to keep terminal  output  out  of  the  log
              file.

/APPEND       Used with EL to append to rather than supersede the  log
              file.

Terminal Initialization


                              TERMINAL INITIALIZATION
                              -------- --------------

EVterminal$   Specifies terminal type.   (ACT4,  ACT5,  ADD580,  ADM2,
              ADM3,  ADM3A,  BEE,  CDC, CRT, DPT, H1200, H1500, H2000,
              HP2640, VT05, VT50, VT52, and TTY).  TECO is initialized
              to CRT.

nEV$          Returns value of terminal parameter n.

m,nEV$        Set terminal parameter m to a value of n.


                                       INPUT
                                       -----

EY            Clear buffer and input one page.   (Y  may  be  used  at
              macro level).

A             Input one page and append to current buffer contents.

:nA           Input n lines of  text  and  append  to  current  buffer
              contents.  (Won't read past a form feed.)

n^Y           Input until page n is in the buffer.

n^U           Perform a USETI.  Positions input file to  block  n  for
              next input command.  (ER'd files only; illegal with EB).
              Must be typed as up-arrow U.


                                       OUTPUT
                                       ------

nPW           Output n copies of the current page and  append  a  form
              feed character to each.  Does not change the buffer.

nP            Output the current page, clear the buffer, and  read  in
              the next page.  Continue this process until the nth page
              from the current page has been input.

m,nP          Output the m+1st through the  nth  characters.   Do  not
              append  a  form  feed  character,  and do not change the
              buffer.

n^P           Same as nP, but end up at the nth absolute page  of  the
              file, rather than the nth page past the current page.

EF            Close the output file.

Insertion


                                     INSERTION
                                     ---------

Itext$        Insert the text delimited by I and altmode.

^Itext$       Insert a tab followed by all the text up to the altmode.


                                 ADVANCED INSERTION
                                 -------- ---------

@I/text/      Insert the text delimited  by  the  arbitrary  character
              following I.

nI$           Insert the character with ASCII value n (decimal).

n\            Insert the ASCII representation of the  decimal  integer
              n.

n\\           Insert the ASCII representation of the octal integer n.

^V            In  an  insert  string,  translate  next  character  (if
              alphabetic) to lower case.

^V^V          In an  insert  string,  translate  remaining  alphabetic
              characters to lower case.

^W            In  an  insert  string,  translate  next  character  (if
              alphabetic) to upper case.

^W^W          In an  insert  string,  translate  remaining  alphabetic
              characters to upper case.

^^            In a insert string, translate next character (if  @,  [,
              \, ], ^, or _) to "lower case" range.

^R            In an insert string, accept next character as text.

^Gi           Used inside an insert string to cause  the  contents  of
              Q-register  i  to  be  inserted  into the string at that
              point.

^T            Used  inside  insert  strings  to  cause   all   control
              characters  except  ^R,  ^T,  and altmode to be taken as
              text.  Nullified by a second ^T.  (Note:  does not  work
              unless  the  monitor  command  "TTY RTCOMPATIBILITY" has
              been given).

Deletion


                                      DELETION
                                      --------

nD            Delete the n characters following the pointer position.

-nD           Delete the n characters preceding the pointer position.

nK            Delete all characters in the  buffer  from  the  current
              pointer  position  to the beginning of the nth line from
              the pointer position.

m,nK          Delete the m+1st through the nth characters.


                            IMMEDIATE TYPE-OUT COMMANDS
                            --------- -------- --------

              The following commands execute immediately when typed as
              the first character following the prompting "*".

^J <LF>       When typed  immediately  after  the  prompt,  moves  the
              pointer  to the beginning of the next line and types the

nStext$       Search for the nth occurrence (following the pointer) of
              the  text  delimited  by  S  and  altmode, but do not go
              beyond the end of the  current  page.   If  n<0,  search
              backwards.

m,nStext$     Same as S, but search only between pointer  positions  m
              and n.  If m>n, search backwards.

nFSoldtext$newtext$
              Search for the nth occurrence (following the pointer) of
              the  first  text  string  and replace it with the second

                                        ----

:             Enables error control.  Many commands (especially search
              and  file  commands), if preceded by a :, will not cause
              an error message if they  fail.   The  :  modifier  will
              cause the command to return a value of 0 if it fails, -1
              if it is successful.  Exception:  :nA command uses :  to
              distinguish it from nA.

     TECO's buffer pointer is always positioned between two characters
in the editing buffer.  It is never positioned exactly on a particular
character.  This concept is fundamental to TECO and  must  be  clearly
understood.  Make frequent use of the semicolon type-out command until
you are familiar with the  positioning  and  movement  of  the  buffer
pointer.

     Disk area TED: contains many  useful  TECO  macros  that  may  be
executed with the EI command.  Of particular interest is TED:HELP.TEC.
This macro makes an interactive help facility available  at  any  time
during an editing session simply by typing "EIHELP$$".  Try it!

     The use of an TECO initialization  file  can  be  very  powerful.
TECO  commands  placed in a file named TECO.INI on your disk area will
be executed automatically each time you enter TECO.  It can be used to
specify  the  type  of  terminal  you  use, to load your favorite TECO
macros into appropriate q-registers, to  set  up  default  values  for
filenames,  type  messages,  etc.   Here  are the contents of a sample
TECO.INI file:

EVADM3A$ EPTED:LINE$ [*]L ^AWelcome to TECO!
^A

This command string will specify the terminal  in  use  as  an  ADM3A,
store  the TECO macro LINE.TEC into Q-register L, and type a welcoming
message.  You may now type "ML=" at any time to find out what line  in
the text buffer the pointer is at.

     Q-registers can be used to recover text "lost" because you forgot
to  type  an  "I" at the beginning of an insert command.  TECO usually
types an error message like "SEARCH STRING TOO LONG" or "MISSING  TAG"
when  this happens.  A "*i" typed as the first command after the error
message will place the text you intended to insert in q-register i.  A
subsequent  "Gi" command will copy the text into the buffer.  Remember
to delete the altmode (-D$$ works fine) at the  end  of  the  restored
text.

     TECO error messages actually consist of three parts:   1)  a  six
letter  error  code,  2) a one line description of the error, and 3) a
detailed explanation of the cause of the  error.   The  command  "nEH"
(n=1,2,3)  will  tell TECO how much of every error message you wish to
see.  Novice users  should  put  "3EH"  into  their  TECO.INI  command
string.   Advanced users may wish to use "1EH".  In any case, typing a
slash after an error message appears will cause TECO to type the  next
portion of the error message.

     The "?"  command  has  two  uses.   Immediately  after  an  error
message,  a  "?"  will  type  out the command that caused the detected
error.  At any other time, a ? puts TECO in trace  mode.   Trace  mode
displays  each  command  as  it is executed.  A subsequent ? turns off
tracing.

     Q-registers can be used to save positions within the  buffer  for
use  as  arguments  to  other  commands.   You  can move around in the
buffer, saving the current value of the buffer pointer  at  places  of
interest  by  typing  ".Ui".   "Qi"  is  then used to return the value
stored  in  q-register  i.   For  example,  suppose  different  buffer
positions  have  been  saved in q-regs a, b, and c.  Then Qa,QbT types
out the text in the buffer between a and b; Qa,QbXd stores a  copy  of
the text between a and b in q-reg d; Qa,QbK deletes the text between a
and b; QcJ moves the buffer pointer to position c; Gd gets a  copy  of
the text in q-reg d and inserts it at c (our current buffer position).

     At the conclusion of any K or D command, the  buffer  pointer  is
positioned  between  the  characters  that  preceded  and followed the
deletion.  In the above example, note that this means a "QcJ" followed
by  a  "Qa,QbK" will leave you at the position of the deletion, not c.
Further, remember that the values stored in q-regs a, b, and c do  not
refer  to  particular  character  strings, but to locations within the
buffer.  Following a deletion (or insertion), they may no longer point
to the same text as before.

     Q-registers can be used to  save  and  execute  command  strings.
"*i",  when  typed  as  the  first  command of a new string, saves the
previous command string in q-reg i.  Subsequently, "Mi" can be used to
execute  the  commands  stored  in  i, much like calling a subroutine.
Saves a lot of typing if you find yourself repeatedly using  the  same
set of commands!

     If you forget what is in a q-register, simply type "Qi=".

     To copy the contents of  q-register  i  into  q-register  j,  use
"[i]j".

     <FStext1$text2$;> is a fast way  to  change  all  occurrences  of
text1  in  the buffer (starting at the pointer) to text2.  This leaves
the pointer positioned at the last place a change was made.  Note that
<FStext1$$;>  will  NOT  cause  all occurences of text1 to be deleted,
since  the  two  adjacent  altmodes   will   terminate   the   command
prematurely.   To  make this work, we must use use a control character
which doesn't  generate  text  to  separate  the  two  altmodes  (e.g.
<FStext1$^V$;>).   Use  an  FN  search  instead  of  FS if you want to
continue beyond  the  current  page  in  the  buffer  and  change  all
occurrences  of  text1  in  the file.  At the end of an FN search, all
pages in the file have been input and output and the buffer cleared.

     It is a good idea to  exit  and  then  reenter  TECO  every  5-15
minutes  (EX$$  followed by TECO<CR> works fine).  This will keep your
source and .BAK files as current as possible as a safeguard against  a
system  crash.   If  the  system  does  crash  while  you are editing,
everything typed in the current session will be lost.

     The maximum length of a search string is 36 character  positions.
However,  the search string itself may contain up to 80 characters, if
needed, to specify special control commands (like "^E<nnn>").

     In order to insert or search for control characters, they must be
preceded  by  a ^R which "quotes" them.  ^R is preferable to ^Q, since
^Q will not allow insertion of $ (altmode) as a text  character  while
^R will.

     To save a command string (without having  to  execute  it  first)
simply  type  the command as if it were to be executed and replace the
final two altmodes ($$) at the end of the string with two  control-G's
(^G^G).   Then type *i.  This stores the command, ready for execution,
in q-reg i.

     The maximum depth of the Q-register pushdown list is 32 entries.

     The Q-register pushdown list is cleared after  the  execution  of
each  complete  command  string  (eg,  every  time  TECO types an * to
indicate readiness to accept a new command string).

     When used as a command, the two character sequence  "up-arrow  x"
is  equivalent  to  the single character "control-x" (made by pressing
the CTRL and x keys simultaneously).  This method  can  be  used  only
when the control character is typed as a command, not when it is typed
as text or as an alphanumeric argument.

     B, ., Z, and H are symbolic values often used as  arguments  with
the  K,  J, P, T, and X commands.  For example, BJ (or simply J) moves
the pointer to the beginning of the buffer.  ZJ moves the  pointer  to
the  end of the buffer.  Two letter combinations of B, ., and Z can be
used to selectively delete, page-out, type, or copy (to a  Q-register)
different  sections  of text in the buffer.  B,Z means everything from
the beginning to the end  of  the  buffer  (same  as  H).   B,.  means
everything  from the beginning of the buffer up to the current pointer
position.  .,Z means everything  from  the  current  pointer  position
through the end of the buffer.

     TECO's editing buffer normally holds about  3000  characters,  or
roughly  50  lines  of  text.   The text in the buffer is known as the
current page.  Text is read in and out of the buffer a page at a time.
Form feeds may be placed in an input file to delimit pages and control
the amount of text read by an input command.

     On input, TECO accepts text until one of  the  following  occurs:
1)  the  end of the input file is reached, 2) a form feed character is
read, 3) the buffer is two-thirds full and a line  feed  is  read  (or
filled  to  within  128  characters  of capacity), or 4) the buffer is
completely filled.  If the buffer is not large enough to accomodate at
least  3000  characters  (or  3000 more characters if appending to the
buffer), TECO automatically expands its buffer  by  1K,  if  possible,
before beginning to input.

     Except as text or numeric arguments, the  carriage  return,  line
feed,  and  space  characters  are  ignored by TECO and may be used to
improve the readability of macros and command strings.   NEVER  use  a
<TAB> (control-I) for this purpose; it is an insert command!

     If you try to exit from TECO and are told "No File  for  Output",
you  probably  typed  an  "EF"  command  by mistake during the editing
session.  This is often the result of an "EC" mistyped as "EF"  or  by
the  partial  execution  of  an insert string that was not preceded by
"I".  To recover from this error, open a new output file with the "EW"
command  (use  a  name different from the file being edited) and exit.
Your original file should contain all the text output up to the  point
where  the  "EF"  occurred and the new file you created should contain
the rest.  Then combine the two files with a copy command (it  may  be
necessary  to  delete  a  few lines duplicated in both files).  If all
else fails, you can start over with the .BAK file.

     Always try to use the FS  command  rather  than  a  delete-insert
sequence, since fewer characters need to be shuffled around.

     When saving the state of TECO with an EE command, try  to  reduce
the size of the resulting .SAV file as much as possible by making sure
there is  no  unwanted  text  stored  in  Q-registers  (put  there  by
TECO.INI,  for  example)  and by doing an EC (garbage collect) command
just before the EE.

     The ^V (translate to lower case) and ^W (translate to upper case)
commands are very powerful.  When used inside an insert or search text
argument, two successive ^V or ^W commands cause translation,  to  the
specified  case,  of  all following alphabetic characters in that text
argument.  A single ^V or ^W command causes translation  of  the  next
single  character  (if  it  is alphabetic) to the specified case.  The
single ^V or ^W in a text argument  takes  precedence  over  the  case
conversion mode defined by double ^V or ^W commands.

     When used as independent commands,  ^V  and  ^W  set  TECO  to  a
prevailing  case  conversion  mode  that affects all insert and search
text arguments (except as specified by ^V and ^W commands  within  the
text  arguments).   Thus,  you can use a terminal without a lower case
keyboard to create and edit files containing both upper and lower case
alphabetic  characters.   First,  use an independent ^V command to set
the prevailing case conversion mode so that all upper case  alphabetic
characters  are  translated  to  lower  case.  Then use the ^W command
within individual text arguments to "shift" temporarily to upper case.
An  independent  0^V  or 0^W command will reset the prevailing mode so
that no case conversion is performed (TECO default).   These  commands
provide  a  quick  method for converting the case of characters in the
buffer.  For example, HXA$HK$^V$I^GA$0^V$$ will convert all the  upper
case characters in the buffer to lower case.

     An TECO command string is not executed until you type two escapes
($$)  in  succession.  This allows you to concatenate as many commands
as desired into one command string (this is, in fact, what TECO macros
are).   Single  escapes are required within the string only to delimit
commands with variable length arguments.

     It is possible for a TECO macro stored in a Q-register to receive
and  return  arguments.   For  example,  if the string in Q-register A
contains "U1 U2 ...  Q3", then the command "5,10MA="  will  cause  the
TECO Command Summary                                           Page 22
Hints


5,10  to  be passed to the first U command, which will store the 10 in
Q-reg 1 and send the 5 on to the second U command, which will store it
in Q-reg 2.  The Q3 command at the end of the macro returns the number
in Q-register 3, and this value becomes an  argument  to  the  command
following  the  "MA", in this case an "=" which causes the value to be
typed on the terminal.  When writing TECO macros,  however,  it  is  a
good idea to save and restore the original contents of any Q-registers
needed.  This can be done with the help of the "[" and  "]"  commands.
Assuming that the macro in our above example makes use of Q-regs 1, 2,
and 3, we could rewrite the macro  as  "[1 [2 [3 ... ]3 ]2 ]1",  which
will preserve the contents around the macro call.  Arguments may still
be  passed  to  the  macro,  since  "m,n [i [j"   is   equivalent   to
"[i [j m,nUiUj".   Note  that our original macro returned the value in
Q-reg 3 by having "Q3" as the last command.  It is a little harder  to
return  a  value  from a macro if all Q-regs must be restored to their
original  contents.   The  idea   is   to   use   parentheses   in   a
non-conventional  manner:   "[1 [2 [3 ...Q3+(]3 ]2 ]1 0)".   This will
result in the return of the value Q3+0; the  trick  is  that  we  have
performed   some  non-arithmetic  functions  within  the  parentheses,
something which is perfectly legal as long as a numeric value precedes
the   closing   right  paren.   Another  example  of  this  technique:
".+(ZJ IHello$ 0)J" will allow you to go to the  end  of  the  buffer,
insert "Hello", and then restore your original pointer.

     TECO  is  really  a  programming  language  for  writing  editing
programs.   If  you  want  anybody  to understand what you've written,
remember to make extensive use of spaces and crlf's.  Each line  of  a
TECO  program should be no more complicated than a line of code in any
other programming language.

     You may insert comments in TECO programs  by  enclosing  them  in
exclamation points; in effect, making them into very long tags.

     See the TED:  area for examples of  several  well-formatted  TECO
macros.   In  particular,  see  TED:MAKTEC.TCO for an explanation of a
simple convention which makes writing TECO macros much more pleasant.
