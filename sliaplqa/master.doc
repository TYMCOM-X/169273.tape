
MASTER and SLAVE reproduce the state of APL,when
-MASTER sends a "short" block in block io mode,ended with a yellow ball
-SLAVE answers with a short block  ,ended with a yellow ball

Interrupts on yellow and orange balls are tehe same as APL.

USE
-because "gmt midnight" is not the same on two different hosts,MASTER and
SLAVE try to have a better reference time.But that implies an
imprecision on measures.So MASTER first prints the maximum possible
imprecision (in seconds).

Then MASTER prints * and waits for input of the number of samples 
 (0 or carriage return implies exit of MASTER and logout of SLAVE)
for each sample, the master prints the delay for the message to reach the slave, 
followed by the delay for the answer to come back.
t1:TIME WHEN MASTER sends a block
T2: TIME WHEN SLAVES RECEIVES IT (IT IMMEDIATELY ANSWERS)
T3:TIME WHEN MASTER receives answer
MASTER prints t2-t1 and t3-t2 FOR EACH SAMPLE
these values are sometimes lower than 2 seconds,sometimes higher than 14 sec.

the tests have been made with 83 ASSEMBLED AS THE SLAVE HOST
(to use on another host,the word HOST in MASTER must be changed)
BUT BEAR IN MIND THAT MASTER AND SLAVE SYSTEMES MUST BE DISTINCT FOR
THE PROBLEM TO APPEAR.
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO GO ON.
