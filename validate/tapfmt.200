         This document describes the format of the Archive tape  used  in
     version 2.00 of NETVAL; the same version is used for all releases of
     version 2,  i.e.,  2.02,  2.03,  2.04,  etc.  Version 3.00 and later
     tapes have a new version which includes ANSII standard  labels,  the
     storing of the operator log file, and other various improvements.

         All numbers are decimal unless indicated otherwise.

         Only three files are stored on version 2 tapes; the are, in
     order of appearance:

                       CUD
                       NETVAL Class and Group Definitions
                               (classes, groups in terms of hostlists and
                                nodelists)
                       MUDupdate file


         Each  file is preceded by a 40 byte header record;  the general
     format of the header record is:

          file id                                    4 bytes
          tape creation date (ISIS time)             4 bytes
          Netval version                             4 bytes
          unused                                    28 bytes

                                   CUD file

        'CUDT'  is  the  file  id  for the CUD header file.  There is one
     record  for  each  CUD  block  on the disk,  i.e., MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK
     records,  where MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK  is  defined  in  NVAL02.A##;  the
     maximum size of CUD data is:

                 (MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SECTORS * 256) - 4

     where MAXIMUM_CUD_BLOCK_SIZE_IN_SECTORS is defined in the NVAL02.A##
     file.  The format of the CUD tape block is:

          size                                      4 bytes
             (total size of this tape record,
              including size, block number, data
              and checksum; minimum size is 12
              if CUD block is empty)
          CUD block number                          4 bytes
          CUD data                       up to maximum size
                                                of CUD data
          CUD block checksum                        4 bytes



                      NETVAL Class and Group Definitions

        'CLST'  is the file id for the NETVAL Class and Group Definitions
     header file.  The NETVAL Class and Group Definitions file contains a
     description of:

              Classes in terms of nodelists and hostlists
              Nodelists descriptions
              Groups in terms of hostlists
              Hostlist descriptions

         Each record in the NETVAL Class and Group  Definitions  file  is
     268 bytes.  The general format of records in the file is:

          size                                      4 bytes
             (total size of this tape record,
              including size, page number, data
              and checksum)
          page number                               4 bytes
          page (or sector) of data                256 bytes

                               MUDupdate file

         'MCHT' is the  file  id  for  the  MUDupdate  file  header.  The 
     information stored on tape about the MUDupdate file is the file 
     header information which contains a description of which Supervisors 
     are legal and various consistency data.  There is a single record in 
     the  file  of 268 bytes.  The format is:

          size                                      4 bytes
             (total size of this tape record,
