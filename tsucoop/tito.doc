ENTERING TITO


                            ENTERING TITO

          From  Monitor  level  type  "R TITO"  to  execute  the  TITO
          program.   TITO  asks  for  an initial device assignment and
          density setting.  (TEX  asked  only  for  a  unit  no.   and
          required  logical  assignment  of  devices to access devices
          other than MTAn.)

          The DEVICE NAME may be the name of any magtape device.

          The  DENSITY SETTING   must   be   a   decimal   no.,   e.g.
          6250,1600,800,556,  or  200 and will be accepted only if the
          device is capable of using the specified density.


          Example:  .R TITO(cr)

INITIALIZATION OF TAPES


                       INITIALIZATION OF TAPES

          With the exception of the CUT AFTER command, which  requires
          confirmation, a tape may not be written on until it has been
          INITIALIZED.    There   are   three   means   provided   for
          initializing tape.  These are (a) the NEW TAPE command;  (b)
          the SKIP WRITE n  command;   and  (c)  the  APPEND  command,
          roughly equivalent to SKIP WRITE E.

          The NEW TAPE command rewinds the tape to load point so  that
          the  next STORE command will begin with saveset no.  1, file
          no.  1.

          The  SKIP WRITE n  command  skips  forward  n  savesets,  as
          SKIP n,   but   in   addition,   the  tape  is  initialized.
          WARNING:  SKIP WRITE  does  not  rewind  the   tape   before
          scanning  forward.   A  SKIP WRITE  issued while not at load
          point may not position to the  intended  saveset.   For  the
          purpose of writing elsewhere than at the beginning or end of
          the tape, the CUT command is to be prefered.

          SKIP WRITE E  skips  to  logical  end  of  tape.   The  only
          deficiency  in this command is the possibility that the tape
          may be positioned past logical end of tape when the  command
          is  issued.  The program reads tape in buffered mode and the
          physical position of the tape is  unknown  to  the  program.
          The  probable  result  is  that  TITO will print a tape read
          error, and then skip to some previously defined logical  EOT
          which is past the actual logical end of tape.  Files written
          here will disappear the next time the tape is  scanned  from
          load point, and will eventually be overwritten as more files
          are added to the tape.

          The APPEND command  does  what  SKIP WRITE E  ought  to  do.
          Unless  TITO  is  certain  that  the  tape  is positioned at
          logical end of  tape,  a  REWIND  is  automatically  issued,
          followed by a SKIP WRITE E.

                             NEW FEATURES

          TITO features tape position numbers,  verification  of  file
          checksums,  indirect  files,  translation of user names, and
          ability to continue  to  drives  other  than  the  initially
          assigned  tape  drive.   In  addition,  TITO  is  much  less
          sensitive to tape format problems  than  TEX,  and  is  more
          selective in specifying sets of files to be processed in the
          DIRECTORY, RESTORE, and GET commands.

          1.  TAPE POSITIONS

          Each file on tape contains  a  file  position  number  which
          defines  the  location  of  the file on tape.  Tape position
          numbers may be used to further restrict the range  of  files
          selected on tape by the RESTORE, GET, or DIRECTORY commands.
          Files not in the range will be ignored, and tape  processing
          stops  when a file position greater than the end of range is
          read.

          The first TITO file header record read on a tape will  cause
          the  program  to ask the operator for a tape position range.
          Several options exist at this point:  (1) the  operator  can
          type  "?"  to print a list of options;  (2) a "W" will print
          the current tape position;  (3) a series  of  tape  position
          nos.  separated by commas or hyphens (to indicate a range of
          positions) may be entered;  (4) a  carriage  return  may  be
          typed  to  default to all possible positions.  an "E" may be
          used for the end of a range to denote the  highest  possible
          tape  position.   Carriage  return,  then,  is equivalent to
          typing "1-E".

          EXAMPLE:  *DIRECTORY ALL(cr)
                    INPUT TAPE POS. RANGE: W(cr)
                    LAST KNOWN POS WAS 12

                    *


          2.  FILE CHECKSUMS

          As each file is written to tape, its  checksum  is  computed
          and  written  just  past  the  last  data  word in the file.
          DIRECTORY, RESTORE, and GET  all  read  the  tape  data  and
          recompute  the  tape checksum.  The new checksum is verified
          against the last word of data and if a mismatch occurs, TITO
          prints  "EXPECTED  CHECKSUM" and the expected checksum.  The
          checksum is also printed in the last six character positions
          of a directory entry.

          Whenever new files  are  added  to  a  tape,  it  should  be
          customary  procedure to make a directory of the files added.
          The checksum printed will verify that the  files  have  been
          correctly written.

          Making a full tape directory is more expensive that doing  a
          directory  of  the  last few files written.  If saveset nos.
          are not desired (these are printed in the directory only  if
          the  tape  is  at  load  point when the DIRECTORY command is
          issued).  then a partial directory may be made of the  files
          written  by  specifying  a partial range of files instead of
          "1-E" or (cr).

          3.  INDIRECT FILES

          The STORE, RESTORE, GET and DIRECTORY command  are  normally
          followed  by  one  of the following as the first modifier:  
          (1) a list of global  account  nos  preceded  by  "G",  e.g.
          G11447,11550-11600,13464;    (2)   a  list  of  PPN's  ,e.g.
          [11447,113411],[11447,123046];  (3) a list  of  user  names,
          e.g.   (KINGHAM),(BURGESST),(SALTYRON),(YOUNGERC)  ;   (4) a
          list             of             filenames,              e.g.
          (YOUNGERC)TITO.CMD,USR.CMD,BUG.*,*.REL;   (5)  a  user  name
          followed by  the  pseudofilename  ALL,  e.g.   (BURGESST)ALL
          which  matches all filenames for BURGESST;  (6) the modifier
          ALL, which matches all files in all directories;  (7) a list
          of  file  position  numbers preceded by a "P" or a poundsign
          "#",  e.g.   P2,3-5,13  or  #2,3-5,13.   In  addition,  TITO
          permits a filename immediately preceded by an at-sign "@" to
          be entered at this point.  This file is called  an  indirect

NEW FEATURES


          file,  and  it  may  contain  anything which can normally be
          typed on the same line as the command verb  STORE,  RESTORE,
          GET  or  DIRECTORY, with one important difference:  carriage
          returns in the file are automatically treated as commas.

          Thus, the following are equivalent:

          *STO (YOUNGERC)*.CMD STA W (YOUNGERC)USR.CMD<10><12341,,456453>(cr)

          or

          *STO @FOO STA W (YOUNGERC)USR.CMD<10><12341,,456453>(cr)

          where file FOO.  contains the following
          line:  (YOUNGERC)*.CMD.

          or

          *STO @FOO (YOUNGERC)USR.CMD<10><12341,,456453>(cr)

          where file FOO. contains the line:  (YOUNGERC)*.CMD STA 

          or

          *STO @FOO(cr)

          where file FOO. contains the line:

          (YOUNGERC)*.CMD STA W (YOUNGERC)USR.CMD<10><12341,,456453>


          More typical indirect files might contain the following:

          (multiple users)

          (BURGESST)(cr)
          (YOUNGERC)(cr)
          (SALTYRON)(cr)


          or

TITO USER'S GUIDE; SEPTEMBER 1975                                      Page 5
NEW FEATURES


          Indirect files may contain no more than about  62  filenames
          or  125  individual user names.  TITO will print "RAN OUT OF
          SPACE  FOR  INPUT  STRING"  when  its  command  capacity  is
          exceeded.

          Indirect files may be specified in another user  by  placing
          the   user   name   in   parentheses  after  the  "@",  e.g.
          "@(BURGESST)FIL.CMD".

          WARNING:   Indiscriminate  use  of  indirect  files  can  be
          hazardous.    Indirect   files  should  not  be  created  in
          directories other than OPER.  A user may  find  an  indirect
          file  in his directory and use it to discover user names and
          filenames  to  which  he  has  no  legitimate  access.   The
          operator  MUST in all cases examine the indirect file to see
          if the owner of the indirect file has legitimate  reason  to
          access the files contained therein.

          4.  TRANSLATION OF USER NAMES

          Frequently it is necessary to restore files  to  a  user  on
          disc  which  differs from the user on tape.  The GET command
          accomplishes this for  one  user,  but  if  many  users  are
          involved,  the  procedure is tedious.  Another case in point
          is that a tape user is not set up in the LUD on  the  system
          to receive the files.

          TITO permits  mapping  between  tape  and  disc  user  names
          through  a  translation  table.  When TITO locates a file on
          tape, it checks to see if the [tape] user  name  is  in  its
          translation  table,  and  substitutes  the [disc] PPN in the
          translation table for the one on tape.  Tape  files  written
          by TEX, which do not have the username on tape, are skipped.

          The translation table may be  set  up  through  use  of  the
          TRANSLATE command or by entering disc/tape username pairs in
          a RESTORE, GET, DIRECTORY, or CUT AFTER command line.

          Disc/tape username pairs may be entered in a command line by
          typing  the  disc username, an underscore or back arrow "_",
          and the tape username where normally the  [disc]  user  name
          would appear in the command:

               *RESTORE (GBLOOD)_(ABLE)TAP.MAC(cr)

               *RESTORE (GBLOOD)_(ABLE),(BURGESST)_(BAKER)(cr)

               *RESTORE (GBLOOD),(GBLOOD)_(ABLE)(cr)

               *CUT AFTER (GBLOOD)_(ABLE)TAP.MAC(cr)
TITO USER'S GUIDE; SEPTEMBER 1975                                      Page 6
NEW FEATURES


          In the first example, file TAP.MAC from user  name  ABLE  on
          tape  is  restored  to user GBLOOD.  A file named TAP.MAC on
          tape in user GBLOOD would be skipped.

          In the second example, all files in users ABLE and BAKER  on
          tape   are   restored   to   users   GBLOOD   and  BURGESST,
          respectively.  Users GBLOOD and BURGESST  on  tape  will  be
          skipped.

          In the third example, files in users GBLOOD and ABLE on tape
          are  both  restored  to user GBLOOD.  If this had been a GET
          command, files from ABLE on tape would have been  mapped  to
          disc  user  GBLOOD,  since  the  GET function is weaker than
          translation, but files from GBLOOD on tape would  have  been
          mapped into the directory of the program user.

          In the last example, the cut on tape is performed after file
          (ABLE)TAP.MAC,  where  ABLE was not in the LUD and could not
          be entered directly into the command line.

          Note that disc/tape username pairs are meaningful only  when
          the processing request is for individual usernames or files.
          The translation table is cleared  after  completion  of  the
          command.

          The TRANSLATE command can be used  to  build  a  translation
          table  which  will not be cleared after each command (unless
          the  command  involves  explicit  translation).   Once   the
          TRANSLATE  command  has  been  issued,  implicit translation
          remains in effect until the  translation  table  is  cleared
          using  the UNTRANSLATE command.  Implicit translation has no
          effect on processing requests of GANS, individual USERS,  or
          individual  FILENAMES.   The  translation  table will NOT BE
          USED  FOR  PERFORMING  TRANSLATIONS  UNLESS  THE  PROCESSING
          REQUEST IS FOR ALL FILES WITHIN A RANGE OF TAPE POSITIONS.

               *TRANSLATE (ABLE)_(BAKER)(cr)

               *RESTORE #1,5,7-13(cr)

               (files in given positions with name BAKER
               will be restored to user ABLE on disk.
               files in given positions with names other
               than BAKER will be skipped).

               or

               *RESTORE ALL(cr)
               INPUT TAPE POS. RANGE: 1,5,7-13(cr)

NEW FEATURES


          The TRANSLATE command can be used with an indirect file with
          a separate disc/tape username pair on each line:

               *TRANSLATE @TRA.CMD(cr)

               where file TRA.CMD contains the following:

               (ABLE)_(BAKER)(cr)
               (BAKER)_(ABLE)(cr)
               (CHARLIE)_(DELTA)(cr)
               (EPSILON)_(GAMMA)(cr)

          Note that when this translation table is  used,  files  from
          BAKER  are  mapped  into ABLE and files from ABLE are mapped
          into BAKER.

          5.  MULTIPLE TAPES

          When the files in a saveset will not  fit  on  one  physical
          tape,  TITO  generates continuation tapes.  The tape no.  in
          the save set (e.g.  1,2,...) is shown in the  second  column
          under the heading "POSITION" in the tape directory.

          When physical end of tape is reached, TITO prints one of the
          following messages which indicate that the current operation
          (STORE, RESTORE, GET, DIRECTORY):

          (SALTYRON) WILL BE CONTINUED ON THE NEXT TAPE.

          or

          FILE (SALTYRON)SRC.MAC WILL BE CONTINUED ON THE NEXT TAPE
          STARTING WITH BLOCK 24.  PARTIAL CKSUM: 134256,,7703421

          or (printed by STORE only)

          THE LAST FILE ON THIS TAPE IS (SALTYRON)XRF.TES
          THE FIRST FILE ON THE NEXT TAPE WILL BE (MARCINJ)HASH.REL


          TITO      then      prints       "MOUNT NEXT TAPE"       and
          "CONTINUE ON DEVICE: ".   Several  options  are available at
          this point:  (1) The operator can type "?" to print  a  list
          of  options;   (2)  "U"  OR  "UN"  OR  "UNL" will unload the
          current tape;  (3)  "N"  or  "NO"  will  abort  the  current
          operation;   and (4) a magtape device name may be entered to
          signify that the next tape is ready to go on said device.

          The magtape device specified MUST be capable of  writing  at
          the  same  density which was set for the preceding tape, and
          MUST be the same no.   of  tracks.   Otherwise  TITO  prints
          "CANNOT  CHANGE NO.  OF TRACKS IN PROCESS" or "CANNOT CHANGE
          DENSITY IN PROCESS" and asks for the device name again.

          EXAMPLE:

          FILE (YOUNGERC)TAP.MAC WILL BE CONTINUED ON THE NEXT TAPE

          If, for some reason,  it  becomes  necessary  to  restart  a
          STORE,  RESTORE,  or  DIRECTORY  operation  after  an  abort
          (operator typed "NO" to continue on device or system crashed
          in  the middle of an operation) then a tape may be restarted
          beginning with a particular user, file, and block  within  a
          file.   The  following  examples  show how to restart an ALL
          files operation with a (1) user;  (2) file;   (3)  file  and
          block:

          *STO ALL STA W (MARCINJ)(cr)                            (1)

          *STO ALL STA W (MARCINJ)ERA.SAV(cr)                     (2)

          *STO ALL STA W (MARCINJ)ERA.SAV<200><405231,,37602>(cr) (3)

          In the last example, the file ERA.SAV  is  to  be  continued
          starting  with block 200 and partial checksum 405231,,37602.
          It is necessary to enclose the block no.  and  the  checksum
          in  angle  brackets "< >" and the two halves of the checksum
          should be  separated  by  two  commas  ",,".   Note  if  the
          checksum  is  mistyped  on  a STORE then a checksum mismatch
          will  be  indicated  in  subsequent  RESTORE  or   DIRECTORY
          operations.

          TITO is much less sensitive to  tape  format  problems  than
          TEX.   Saveset header records are not needed, and file marks
          on tapes (except double file mark for logical EOT)  have  no
          special  meaning.   Data  records  that do not belong to any
          file are simply ignored.

          TITO does make the following checks on file header  records:
          (1) the file pos.  no must be one greater than the last file
          read;  (2) the file must be written at the same  density  as
          the previous file;  and (3) the date written must be greater
          than or equal to the date the  previous  file  was  written.
          TITO   warns  of  such  incompatibilities  and  permits  the
          operator to abort or to continue.  This  feature  may  prove
          valuable  in stopping a tape which is missing a file mark at
          logical end of tape.

          TITO features an expanded tape directory which is 86 columns
          wide.   In  addition,  each  saveset  header record printout
          includes the  system  identification,  the  physical  device
          name, and the density and number of tracks recorded.

          The DIRECTORY format is given below.

          Columns         Contents
           00-05          File position no. in octal
           06-08          Tape no. in saveset (1,2,3,...)
           12-17          Filename
           19-21          Filename extension
           27-38          Username
           41-45          Creation time
           47-55          Creation date
           58-62          Time tape written
           64-72          Date tape written
           73-77          Allocated size of file in blocks
           79-84          Checksum

          Column headings are printed for each user, and the  PPN  for
          the  user is printed in the same line as total user files in
          columns 41-55.  Total blocks allocated to a user is  printed
          in columns 72-77 of this same line.

          TITO prints usernames directly from tape  without  accessing
          the  DUL.   If  a  tape  contains  no  TEX  savesets, a full
          directory can be made from it on any Tymcom X system.

NEW COMMANDS


                                NEW COMMANDS

          The  following  commands  are  unique  to  TITO:   NEW TAPE,
          APPEND,  CUT AFTER,  TRANSLATE, UNTRANSLATE, UNLOAD, DEVICE,
          AND WHERE.  NEW TAPE,  APPEND,  TRANSLATE,  AND  UNTRANSLATE
          have already been described.

          The CUT AFTER command takes the form CUT AFTER filename  and
          can  be  used  to redefine logical EOT.  It spaces out after
          the specified filename and writes a  dummy  saveset  trailer
          record  and  two  filemarks.   The  tape  is then positioned
          between the two filemarks with the logical end of tape  flag
          set,  so  that  an APPEND at this point initializes the tape
          for writing without moving the tape.

          CUT AFTER will automatically skip any  TEX  formatted  files
          that  it  finds  on tape.  The tape file specified to become
          the last tape file must have a tape position no., i.e.  must
          be a TITO file.

          Example:  *CUT AFTER (YOUNGERC)FOO.MAC(cr)
                     INPUT TAPE POS. RANGE: 17(cr)
                     ARE YOU SURE?(cr)
                     CUT FINISHED--NOW POSITIONED AT LOGICAL END OF
          TAPE.
                     *

          There may be a noticeable delay between the time the command
          is  given  and  the  time the program asks for the tape pos.
          range.  The delay is the time it takes TITO to locate a file
          header record on tape.

          The UNLOAD command unloads the current tape without  waiting
          for completion.

          The DEVICE command can be used to change tape drives  or  to
          change density settings of the drives.  It has the form

          DEVICE <DEVNAM> <DENSITY>(cr)

          where <DEVNAM> and <DENSITY> are optional.  If  <DEVNAM>  is
          missing,  the  current  device  is  implied;  if <DEVNAM> is
          present, TITO attempts to use this device.  If <DENSITY>  is
          missing, the command merely prints all known characteristics
          of the device (or interrogates the operator for them if  the
          DEVICE  is  a  new  one  unknown  to TITO).  If <DENSITY> is
          present, then TITO will attempt to set that density and  ask
          for  it  to  be reentered if the device is incapable of this
          density setting.

NEW COMMANDS


          Example:
                  (supposing initial device is MTA0)
                    *DEV MTA1(cr)
                    TRACKS: 7                     (Printed by TITO)
                    DENSITY(800,556,200): 800(cr)
                    *
                  (we are now using device MTA1)
                    *DEV MTA0(cr)
                    MTA0: 800 BPI 7 TRACK
                    *
                  (we are now back to MTA0)

          TITO keeps a table of device names and  d  density  settings
          which  it  uses  so  that  the  density  does not have to be
          reentered each time the  DEVICE  command  is  used.   It  is
          possible  to  confuse  TITO  by manipulating the unit select
          switches on the DEC drives after the device name has already
          been  entered.   In this case the device name printed in the
          tape directory may be incorrect.   For  this  reason  it  is
          urged  that  the unit select switches be left alone, and the
          DEVICE command be used to  switch  drives.   The  old  habit
          should  be  forgotten quickly, as more effort is required to
          change the switches, and the IBM and Calcomp drives  do  not
          have the switches.

          The WHERE command prints the last tape position  no.   read.
          The tape will probably be positioned a few records past this
          position no.  TITO prints "POSITION UNKNOWN" if the  current
          position no.  is meaningless.

MIXED FORMAT TAPES


                             MIXED FORMAT TAPES

          Files written by TITO have tape  position  nos.   and  other
          format  changes  which  prevent tapes from being read by the
          TEX program.  TEX tapes, however, can still be read by TITO.
          Files  written  by TITO can be appended to TEX tapes, though
          it is preferable for ease in tape handling  to  rebuild  TEX
          tapes in the new format.

          Let us suppose that a tape contains old savesets written  by
          TEX  and  new savesets written by TITO.  Let us also suppose
          that the savesets are not in chronological order as  far  as
          the versions are concerned (somehow the operator got hold of
          an old copy of TEX and appended  to  a  tape  which  already
          contained  a  TITO saveset).  Suppose the tape contains four
          savesets written by:  TEX;  TITO;  TEX;   and  TITO.   These
          savesets  are refered to below as savesets no.  1, 2, 3, and
          4, respectively.

          Since the DIRECTORY command no longer  issues  a  rewind,  a
          complete  tape  directory  is  possible  only  if the REWIND
          command is issued before the DIRECTORY command.  If the tape
          is  initially  positioned  in  saveset  no.   2 and and file
          position range 1-E is given, the  tape  directory  will  not
          report  files in saveset no.  1, since this section contains
          no file position nos.   Saveset  no.   3  will  be  printed,
          however,  since  this is scanned before reaching position E.
          If the tape is positioned somewhere in saveset  no.   4  and
          file  positions  are selected in saveset no.  2, TITO in all
          likelihood will be unable to locate these  files.   It  will
          probably  oscillate between savesets no.  3 and 4, since the
          file positions in saveset no.  3 are zero.  In this case,  a
          rewind  should  be issued to permit TITO to locate the start
          of the file position range.

          The RESTORE command will skip over files in saveset  no.   3
          if the tape is initially positioned in saveset no.  2.  This
          prevents files which were restored from saveset no.  2  from
          being  accidentally  overwritten by the same names appearing
          in saveset no.  3.  Note that the  DIRECTORY  command  would
          not  have  skipped  over the files.  (if it had, there would
          have been no way  to  make  a  full  tape  directory).   The
          RESTORE will quit when (a) there is nothing to do;  or (b) a
          file header is read one past the end of the specified range;
          or (c) logical EOT is read.

          To restore files written by TEX, the tape must be  initially
          positioned  to  the  beginning of the saveset containing the
          files.  There is a  saveset  header  record  which  contains
          information  needed  to do date conversions.  Use REWIND and
TITO USER'S GUIDE; SEPTEMBER 1975                                     Page 13
MIXED FORMAT TAPES


          SKIP to position the tape.  The RESTORE will quit  when  (a)
          there  is  nothing to do;  or (b) a saveset trailer is read;
          or (c) logical EOT is read.

          If the saveset header cannot be found, TEX issues a  warning
          message and asks if the operator wishes to continue.  If the
          tape is  a  bad  tape  containing  no  saveset  header,  the
          operator   should  continue  at  this  point  and  get  date
          conversions  corresponding  to  MONITORS  P012  and   later.
          Otherwise,  he should abort, which automatically rewinds the
          tape so he can SKIP to the beginning of the saveset.

          Savesets written by TITO do not need saveset header  records
          since  the  required  information is kept in the file header
          record.

OPERATING COMMANDS


                             OPERATING COMMANDS

          All TITO commands and keyword modifiers may  be  abbreviated
          to  the  mininum  no.   of  characters  required to make the
          command unique.  mininum no.  of characters required to make
          the   command   unique.    For  example,  DIRECTORY  may  be
          abbreviated "DI" and DEVICE may be abbreviated  "DE".   TITO
          will  always  inform the operator if the abbreviation is not
          unique, for example, the ambiguous abbreviation "D".

          The following operating commands  appear  in  both  TEX  and
          TITO.  They are documented here for completeness.

          COF
          REWIND
          RWNW
          QUIT
          HELP
          UPDATE
          NOUPDATE
          SKIP
          STORE
          RESTORE
          GET
          DIRECTORY
          MODE

          The COF command changes the output file from terminal to the
          specified  device.   The following devices are valid objects
          for  the  COF  command:  PRINTER,  TERMINAL,  TELETYPE.   In
          addition,  a  filename  in the file directory of the program
          user may be specified.  The  output  file  remains  the  one
          specified  until  another COF command is issued, or until an
          altmode (^C in PDP mode) or a fatal error occurs.

          The REWIND command rewinds the tape to load point and  waits
          for completion before returning to the command dispatcher.

          The RWNW (ReWind No Wait) command rewinds the tape  to  load
          point  without  waiting for completion.  The command returns
          immediately to the command dispatcher.

          The QUIT command is used to  exit  the  TITO  program.   Two
          altmodes  (or  ^C in PDP mode) can be used to accomplish the
          same.

          The HELP command lists in summary form the program  commands
          and  the purpose of each.  In addition, HELP may be typed in
          the middle of a multipart  command  to  obtain  the  options
          available at that point.
TITO USER'S GUIDE; SEPTEMBER 1975                                     Page 15
OPERATING COMMANDS


          The UPDATE command sets a switch (which  remains  set  until
          the user does a QUIT or NOUPDATE) which specifies that files
          to be RESTORED will be opened in  update  mode.   This  mode
          uses  the  blocks  already  allocated  to  a file instead of
          acquiring new ones, so it can be useful when the  system  is
          low  on disc space and a particularly large file needs to be
          restored.

          The NOUPDATE command turns off the  UPDATE  mode  switch  so
          that the normal mode of opening files is reinstated.

          The SKIP command takes as its object the number of  savesets
          to  skip  on tape.  If there are three savesets on tape, and
          the tape is positioned at load point, SKIP 2 will cause  the
          tape to be positioned to the beginning of the third saveset.
          SKIP E can be used to position to logical end of tape.  Note
          that  if a tape has n savesets, SKIP n from load point will,
          in effect, position the tape to logical eot but TITO  cannot
          print a confirming "NOW POSITIONED AT LOGICAL END OF TAPE".

TITO USER'S GUIDE; SEPTEMBER 1975                                     Page 16
OPERATING COMMANDS


          The next four commands (STORE, RESTORE, GET, and  DIRECTORY)
          have identical three-part structures.

          1.  The first part of  each  command  is  the  verb  (STORE,
          RESTORE, GET, DIRECTORY).

               STORE is used to write files on tape and requires  tape
               initialization.

               RESTORE retrieves files from tape and  places  them  in
               their original directories.

               GET functions the same as RESTORE, except that the tape
               files are written to the program user's directory.

               DIRECTORY goes through all of the motions  of  RESTORE,
               but  files  are not written to disc.  Instead a listing
               of tape file names and positions is made.

          2.  The second part of each command is the object.  This may
          be  (1) a list of global account nos.  preceded by "G", e.g.
          G1-4,6;  (2) a list of  PPN's,  e.g.   [1,1],[1,4]  or  user
          names  (SYS),(OPER);   (3) a list of filenames preceded by a
          PPN or user name, e.g.
          [1,4]A.X,B.X,C.X or (OPER)A.X,B.X,C.X;
          (4) the directive "ALL" preceded by a username to select all
          the files belonging to a user, or not preceded by a username
          to select all files belonging to all users;  (5) a  list  of
          file position numbers preceded by "P" or poundsign "#", e.g.
          #1,3-5,14;  or (6) an indirect file preceded by an "@" sign.

          Position numbers, when used, are not  meaningful  to  STORE.
          When  used  in the command line the effect is the same as if
          the directive "ALL" was used.

          Filenames, except for that of an indirect file, may  contain
          wild  card  characters  "#"  or  "?"  to  match any filename
          character, or an asterisk in the name or  extension  portion
          of  the  filename (or both) to match all names or extensions
          (or both).

          3.  The third part of the  command  is  a  modifier  to  the
          second  part  and a command may have more than one modifier.
          The  following  modifiers  are  available:  TWICE,   THRICE,
          CREATED   AFTER,  CHANGED, and STARTING WITH.  All modifiers
          can  be  used  with  any  command  but  the  TWICE,  THRICE,
          CREATED AFTER,  and CHANGED modifiers are meaningful only to
          STORE.

OPERATING COMMANDS


               The TWICE modifier causes TITO to  write  two  savesets
               instead of one in the STORE command.

               The THRICE modifier causes TITO to write three savesets
               instead of one in the STORE command.

               The CREATED AFTER modifier takes as its object  a  date
               expressed  as  HH:MM DD MON YR, where HH:MM is the time
               in  hours   and   minutes,   and   DD MON YR   is   the
               day-month-year.   Files  to be STOREd are restricted to
               those created after the specified time and  date.   The
               time  and  date  may  be abbreviated:  if only HH:MM is
               given, the date defaults to the current day-month-year;
               if  only  HH:MM DD  is  given, the date defaults to the
               current month-year;  if only HH:MM DD MON is given, the
               date defaults to the current year.

               THe CHANGED modifier takes no object and specifies that
               all files which do not have the "file dumped" bit on in
               the UFD will be written to tape.  Note that  the  "file
               dumped"    bit   can   be   turned   on   only   by   a
               "STORE ALL CHANGED"  operation  (backup).    Thus   the
               CHANGED modifier is specifying files which have changed
               since the last backup operation.

               The STARTING WITH modifier takes username  or  filename
               as  an  object and begins the current operation (STORE,
               RESTORE, GET,  DIRECTORY)  at  the  specified  user  or
               filename.  In the case of files split between tapes the
               object is a filename followed by block no.  and partial
               checksum enclosed in angle brackets "<>".

OPERATING COMMANDS


          The MODE command is used to print or change a number of TITO
          options.   One  set  of options pertains to what information
          prints at the terminal  during  a  STORE/RESTORE  operation.
          THe other set of options pertains to what action is demanded
          of the operator when an attempt is made by TITO to restore a
          file on top of an existing file.

          MODE is a three part command.  The first part is always MODE
          and may be followed by a carriage return, in which case TITO
          prints the prevailing modes.  The second  part  may  be  the
          name  of  a  file type like OLD or SYS.  OLD files are files
          which exist on both disc  and  tape  and  are  about  to  be
          overwritten  by  a  RESTORE or GET operation.  SYS files are
          files in username (SYS)  which  are  very  critical  to  the
          system  operation and have a separate mode switch to protect
          them against being overwritten.

          If the second part is a file type, then the  third  part  of
          the  command tells what version of the file to use in case a
          file exists on both disc and tape and  is  to  be  restored.
          The version types are NEWEST, DISC, TAPE, and CONFIRM.

               NEWEST selects the most recent file, as  determined  by
               the creation date.

               DISC keeps the disc version of  the  file.   TITO  will
               print "NOT WRITING OVER FILE ...".

               TAPE replaces the disc version from  the  tape  in  all
               cases.

               CONFIRM is  the  normal  mode  and  requires  that  the
               operator confirm writing over the old file.

          The second part of the command may  be  an  operation  type,
          such  as  STORE  or RESTORE.  In this case the third part of
          the  command  specifies  what  is  to  be  printed  on   the
          operator's  terminal  during  the  operation.   The  listing
          controls are TOTALS, USERS, and FILES.

               TOTALS prints only the grand totals for the  operation,
               e.g.  "XX  FILES PROCESSED."

               USERS prints totals for  each  user  along  with  grand
               totals.  This is the normal mode.

               FILES  prints  each  filename  as  it  is  read/written
               from/to tape, as well as user and grand totals.

                                TAPE FORMATS


          The tape consists of savesets followed  by  logical  end  of
          tape  (two consecutive filemarks).  Each saveset consists of
          a saveset header record, user files, and a  saveset  trailer
          record.   A filemark separates each user on the tape and can
          also be found between a  saveset  trailer  and  the  saveset
          header  of  the next saveset.  No filemark follows a user if
          the next record is a saveset trailer.

          Each user is written as one physical tape file, and consists
          of  file  header records and data records.  Each file begins
          with a file header record which is always a new tape record.

          The  file  header  record  contains  all   extended   lookup
          information about the file plus tape parameters such as file
          pos.  no., date written,  etc.   The  balance  of  the  file
          header record contains file data.  The last data record in a
          file contains at least 5 tape words.  The file  checksum  is
          written in the first word past the file data and is repeated
          if necessary to up the record word count to 5.

                                 APPENDIX B
                               MESSAGE CONTROL


          TITO messages are normally directed to  the  terminal.   The
          COF  command  may  be  used  to  direct output from the next
          command to the file or device specified by the COF  command.
          In  the  past this has resulted in the loss of some messages
          which should have appeared on the terminal.

          TITO directs some messages to the terminal only, some to the
          COF file only, and some to both.  The following messages are
          directed to both the terminal and the COF file:
