                                     FDM

(A program to combine files into one file or extract individual files from
this 'master' file.)


The FDM program is run with the command "RUN (<user>) FDM" (where <user> is
the username where the program is stored.  When ready to accept a command from
the user the program presents a prompt consisting of a number followed by a
colon.  The numbering starts with '1' and is incremented each time the program
has completed a command and is ready to accept another command.  Some of the
commands are followed by a special prompt before they are executed.  Some
examples of these special prompts are confirmation or rejection of the
requested action (response is:  "Y" or "N"), or a request for a file-id.

All input to the program MUST be in upper case.  


ACCESSING FDM MASTER FILES:

Any work with/on a FDM master file requires opening the master file.  While in
FDM the user can close an opened master file and open another, but only one
file may be open at any one time.

The commands to open and close the master FDM files are, respectively:  "OPEN
filename.ext" and "CLOSE".  The file requested in the 'OPEN' command must
reside in the directory in which the programmer is currently operating, the
program cannot accept a directory as part of the file-id.  The 'OPEN' command
can be given without the file-id.  The program then prompts with:
"FILENAME:".  If the full 'OPEN' command is given with an incorrect or
non-existent file-id the program responds with the "FILENAME:"  prompt.  After
the prompt the program accepts the file-id from the user.  The directory
cannot be specified in the file-id.

Whenever a file 'OPEN' is requested and the file-id is given the program
prompts the user with "OLD FILE.  OK?"  or "NEW FILE.  OK?"  (whichever is
appropriate).  After a "Y" response it opens the file then continues to the
next numbered prompt.  If the user responds with a "N" the program does not
open any file and returns to the last numbered prompt.


WORKING WITH THE OPENED FDM MASTER FILE:

After a file is opened the normal use of the program is to:
1.)  load files into the FDM master file;
2.)  write the contents of the master file to individual files with their
original names; 
3.)  list a directory of the individual files contained in the master file; or
4.)  list one of the contained files to the user's terminal.


1.)  Loading a master file:  

The command to write the contents of a discrete file on the system to the FDM
file is given in response to the numbered prompt.  The command is:  "READ
file-id" or "APPEND file-id".  The system file named in 'file-id' is appended
to the opened FDM file.

To write multiple system files to the FDM master file, use the at-sign ("@")
followed by the name of a 'command' file as the 'file-id'.  This command file
must contain a list of the files to be read into the master file, with one
file-id per line followed immediately by a carriage- return.  If a command
file listing file-ids is not used, multiple calls to "READ" or "APPEND" can be
used:  each call to the 'READ'/'APPEND' function appends the named file to the
opened master file.


2.)  'Breaking out' the contents of the master file to individual system
files:

    a.)  The command to extract one file from the FDM master file and write a
copy of that individual file on the system with its original file-id is given
in response to the program's numbered prompt.  The command is:  "n WRITE",
where 'n' = the position number of the individual file within the FDM master
file.  The program writes the file to the user's currently GFD'd directory
with its original file-id.  If a file with the same name exists in that
directory, it will be over-written.

    b.)  The command to write all the contents of the FDM master file to
discrete files on the system with their original file-ids is given in response
to the program's numbered prompt.  The command is:  "WRITE".  The program
responds with "ALL?".  A response of "Y" starts the program writing each of
the included individual files to the user's currently GFD'd directory with
it's original file-id.  If files with the same file-id as any of the files
contained in the FDM file exist in the current directory they are
over-written.  If the user responds with a "N" the program aborts the 'WRITE'
and returns to the last numbered prompt.


3.)  Listing a directory of files contained in the FDM master file:

Two commands list the names of files in the FDM master file.  The command to
provide a short list is:  "FILES".  The command to provide the more
informative list is "DIRECTORY".  The 'FILES' command provides the position
number of each file and the file-ids only.  The 'DIRECTORY' command provides a
list of the position number, the file-id and a count of the number of computer
words of storage for each contained file.


4.)  Listing the contents of one file contained in the FDM master file to the
user's terminal:

The command to list the contents of one (character, 'EDITOR'-type) file to the
user's terminal is given in response to the numbered prompt.  The command is:
"LIST n", where 'n' is the position number of one of the files contained in
the FDM master file.  When the listing of the contained file is completed the
program gives the next numbered prompt.


OTHER COMMANDS OF USE:

Each of these commands is given in response to the numbered prompt.

1.)  "HUSH" turns off the numbered prompt, so that the only indication to the
user that the function is completed is an additional line-feed.

2.)  "NO HUSH" turns the numbered prompt back on.  (This command is not given
in response to the numbered prompt, because the prompt is turned off by
'HUSH'.  This is true of all commands to the program when 'HUSH' is on.)

3.)  "DO file-id" executes a command file, which can include any of the
commands to the program.

4.)  "HELP" or "?"  prints a list of commands to the program.  This list
includes informational commands which are not fully implemented, like
"INSTRUCTIONS".

5.)  "QUIT" exits the program and returns user to the EXEC.





Information about the FDM files:

1.)  file names, counts of pages, creation date and time, the count of words
     per file, the program's version, and the FDM file's checksum; and

2.)  a list of information about the files contained in each of the FDM files.
     The information provided about the 'contained' files is:  file-id; the
     size of the file in words of storage; and the file's checksum.
     

NOTE: Naming convention for FDM master files:
      1)  name part = program name, with last character = 'F' (if program 
      name is less than 6 characters, append the 'F', otherwise change 
      last character of program name to 'F');
      2)  extension = version number.
