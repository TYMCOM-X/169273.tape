     In the following, some strange  set notation is used to  define the
possible  values  that  some  record  fields  may  contain.   The  basic
constructs are:


     Set notation     "{x}"  translates to  "the set  consisting of
                      x".

     Set-inclusion    "x (=Y)" translates to "x is in set Y"

     Sequences        "[x,  y]" translates  to "the  set  of values
                      between x and y (inclusive)".

     Ordered Lists    "<x,  y>"  translates  to  "the  ordered pair
                      consisting of x followed by y".

     Set Operations   "X + Y" translates to "X union Y".

                      "X - Y" translates to "the set  difference of
                      X and Y".


     Additionally, this list contains information of variable certainty,
so, as Mike Hinckley might advise, read it with some caution and an open
mind.

     Updates and comments should be directed to (KEN:930).

BATCH:

     When a  user wants  something done  on his  behalf by  the computer
     operations  staff  -  things like  reading,  writing  or converting
     tapes, punching cards,  and so forth -  he runs BATCH, and  after a
     brief interrogation, describes in  free format the set of  tasks he
     would like performed.


     (*1BATCH)PARCHG.DAT

          PARCHG.DAT  (Partial-Charge Data  File).  It  contains records
          for BATCH  or SPOOL-center requests  on which  the fundamental
          work has been done, but for which some post-processing charges
          may  yet  be  pending  (things  like  postage,  other delivery
          charges, or special handling charges).

          id.field = status.code  (=[1, 3]), although some  programs are
          said to put system numbers there (possibly inviting trouble).

          job.type = {ALL - [9, 11]} + {0}.


     (*1BATCH)PPRTMP.DAT
     (*1BATCH)PPRBAK.DAT
     (*1BATCH)PPRBAK.mmm

          PPRTMP.DAT  (Peripheral  Processing  Request   Temporary  Data
          File).   When  a batch  request  is entered  by  a  user, some
          identification  information,  along  with  the  text   of  the
          request, is placed  in PPRTMP.DAT, signifying that  some piece
          of work needs to be performed.

          At  the  same  time,   the  same  information  is   placed  in
          PPRBAK.DAT, as a backup.

          If this is the first  request of a new month, the  backup file
          is renamed to PPRBAK.mmm (where "mmm" is the  previous month),
          and a new instance of PPRBAK.DAT created before a copy  of the
          request is stashed in it.


     (*1BATCH)REQNUM.DAT

          A binary file containing a five-digit (decimal) number used to
          (partially)  identify batch  requests.  The  first  two digits
          represent the  system number and  the last three  constitute a
          serial number.   It is accessed  and updated  (incremented) by
          programs generating batch requests (BATCH, BCHARGE, SPOOL).

BCHARGE:

     Typically, BCHARGE is run by an operator to service one or a number
     of BATCH or SPOOL requests.  If a request cannot be  finalized when
     it is first processed, due to delivery or special  handling charges
     which must be  assessed later, a  record is created  in PARCHG.DAT,
     and  removed when  such  charges are  applied.  Also,  if  a fully-
     completed request is found to be erroneous, the operator can modify
     that request using the "recharge" command.


     (*1BATCH)BAT0ss.mmm

          Contains  records  for  all  requests  which  have  been fully
          processed.

          id.field = sysno.

          job.types = {ALL - {0, 9}}.


     (*1BATCH)BATCAN.mmm

          Contains BATCH or SPOOL-center records which have been voided.

          job.types = {(ALL - [9, 11]) + {0}}.

          ppn.field = cancelling operator's name.


     (*1BATCH)PARCHG.BAK
     (*1BATCH)PARCHG.DAT

          See BATCH above for  description.  When a request  is finished
          off  by  BCHARGE,  its  record  is  moved  from  PARCHG.DAT to
          PARCHG.BAK.

TAPCHG:

     When a  user makes a  SPOOL-center request on  a host which  has no
     printer on-line (or  a remote request for  which both the  node and
     the host are  unable to do the  printing), the files are  placed on
     mag tape, moved to another system, and printed there.

     The  file  (PJ)SPOOL.TAP, containing  information  about  the files
     printed, is created  on this system and,  upon seeing it, job  3 in
     user (PJ)  automatically dials  the original  host, runs  TAPCHG in
     (*1BATCH)  there,  and  feeds it  information  from  SPOOL.TAP, one
     request at a time.

     TAPCHG searches SPOOL.GDF to find a match on the  request identity,
     and, finding it, updates the GDF entry and creates an entry  in the
     appropriate  accounting file.   Once this  is  accomplished, TAPCHG
     sends  a completion  code  to PJ,  and the  corresponding  entry in
     SPOOL.TAP is marked as complete.


     (*1BATCH)BAT0ss.mmm

          See BATCH above for description.  If no delivery or processing
          charges  are  pending on  a  request, a  record  is  placed in
          BAT0ss.mmm.


     (*1BATCH)PARCHG.DAT

          See BATCH  above for description.   If delivery  or processing
          charges need to be added  to a request, a record is  placed in
          PARCHG.DAT.


     (SPOOL)REMCNT

          If the request was for remote-spooling, TAPCHG  decrements the
          count in this file for the given remote location.


     (SPOOL)SPLCNT

          If the request was for center-printing, TAPCHG  decrements the
          count in this file for the host.
