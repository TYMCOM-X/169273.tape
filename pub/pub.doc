ABSTRACT:

PUB is an advanced text justifier and page formatter  intended primarily
for use  by programmers.  It  can automatically number  pages, sections,
figures, footnotes, etc. and  can print their numbers in  roman numerals
as well as in digit  or letter form.  It can generate  cross references,
tables of contents,  and indexes.  Page  layout is flexible,  and allows
multiple  column output.   Line formatting  includes  tabs, underlining,
superscripts,   subscripts,   centering,   and   justification.   Macros
programmed in a  SAIL-like string-processing language can  generate text
to be printed  in the document.   The output of  the compiler is  a file
which can be printed on the terminal or on a line printer.

1.1 PURPOSE    


               PUB is  a compiler which  translates a manuscript  into a                                                      
               document.               

               A "manuscript" is  an SOS file  containing the text  of a
               publication  interspersed  with  control  characters  and
               commands.   The function  of the  compiler is  to arrange                                                 
               this text on formatted  pages under the direction  of the
               control characters and commands.

               Output  is  written  on  a  ".DOC"  file  known   as  the
               "document".   TYPE,  SPOOL or  PRINT  it.   Under certain
               conditions,  the document  can be  edited with  TECO (see
               Section 7.16),  but it  is wiser  to make  corrections in
               the manuscript and then rerun the compiler.

1.2 CAPABILITIES    


               PUB  provides the  usual capabilities  of a  simple text-
               justifier, including:

>Page numbering
>Optional justification to the right margin
>Centering of titles
>Headings and footings
>Control of Spacing and Indentation
>Underlining

               In   addition,   it   features   advanced   documentation
               capabilities, such as:

>Columnar output
>Footnote placement
>Macros
                               1.1 - 1.2>Index Generation
>Table of contents generation
>Cross-reference to a variable target
>Automatic numbering of equations, tables, notes, etc
>Superscripts and Subscripts

               The  command  language  is  a  dialect  of   SAIL  Algol,
               providing the user with:

>Block structure
>Conditional command execution
>Conditional text inclusion
>Arithmetic and String calculations
>Embedded Source Files



1.3 OPERATION    


               The compiler  is "two-pass".   The first  pass interprets
               the  manuscript  and outputs  several  intermediate files
               with extensionso, then deleted (unless deletion is waived
               by a switch setting -- see below).

               The first pass typically requires 40K of core and runs at
               the rate of 15  pages per minute.  The second  pass needs
               18K  and runs  at  50 pages  per minute.   If  the system
               should crash  during Pass  Two, and  you wish  to restart
               without rerunning Pass One,  R PUB2.  "R PUB2" also gives
               you an opportunity  to specify a different  output device
               than originally requested.

               You may run the document compiler with or without RPG.  A
               manuscript  file  which  is  ".PUB"  or  a  document file
               extension  which  is   ".DOC"  need  not   be  mentioned.

               Do not specify more than one input file nor more than one
               output file.  Multiple input files are handled  using the
               REQUIRE statement (see Section 7.11).

               WARNING (RPG  users): If  in addition  to file  X.PUB you
                                  1.3 X.FAI, etc.) and if you  type "COM               have a file X.SAI (or
               X", RPG will do a SAIL (or FAIL)  compilation.  SOLUTION:
               Type "COM X.PUB".
SAILON-70                     INTRODUCTION                        Page 3


               FURTHER WARNING  (RPG users):  If you  have a  fRle X,REL
               which  is  newer  than  X.PUB,  then  RPG  won't  do  any
               compilation.  SOLUTION: Type "COM /COM X.PUB".

               Feed, it  types out the  manuscript page  number.  During
               Pass Two, whenever PUB writes a Form Feed, it types out a
               count of the number of output pages so far.

               During  Pass  One,  PUB also  types  out  error messages.
               After each message, an  arrow () or a question  mark (?)
               is typed out.  You may  then respond as in SAIL.   If you
               are  not  familiar  with  SAIL,  here  is  a  summary  of
               responses:

       <CR>        Continue compiling after this error.
       <LF>        Continue  compiling,  and  after  subsequent  errors,
               continue automatically.
           NOTE: The above two responses are not valid after "?"
E<file><CR>        Edit file <file>.
      E<CR>        Edit the manuscript file.
      S<CR>        Start Over.

               In DEBUG  mode (the /D  switch), some error  messages are
               also output in the right margin of the document.
                                  1.4
               Whenever PUB prints a line number in an error  message or
               in the right margin of the document, it is of the form:
<file id><line no.>/<page no.>[<macro line no.>/<macro page no.>]
SAILON-70                     INTRODUCTION                        Page 4


               If the  line is  from the  manuscript, then  <file id> is
               empty.  If it is from another file (such as one  of those
               ".PUG"  files  mentioned above),  then  <file id>  is the
               first three letters of the first name of that file.

               If  the file  is in  SOS format,  then the  <line no.> is
               always   five   digits,  including   leading   zeroes  if
               necessary.  If it is from a TECO file, then PUB generates
               line numbers 1, 2, 3, etc. without leading zeroes.  If it
               is from a  ".PUG" file, then  the <line no.> is  the line
               number/page number of a relevant line in  your manuscript
               or in some other source file.

               If a macro was  being expanded, the line number  and page
               number  of  its   definition  are  noted   within  square
               brackets.  The file that contained the definition  is not
               noted,  so  if  can't  find  it  in  your  manuscript, it
               probably  came from  PUBSTD.DFS, the  PUB  standard macro
               file,  or from  one of  your REQUIRE  files  (see Section
               7.11).

               Examples:

02300/10        Manuscript file, page 10, line 2300 (SOS)
IND02300/10/1   INDEX.PUG file, page 1, comes from Manuscript 2300/10
PUB25/1         PUB Standard Macro file, page 1, line 25 (TECO)



1.5 READING THIS MANUAL      


               This  manual is  ordered such  that as  soon as  you have
               learned  enough of  the system  to solve  your particular
               problem, you can  skip the rest  of the manual.   Read at
               least  through  Section   2.3  before  making   any  such
               assumption.

               In describing the  syntax of PUB commands,  the following
               meta-linguistic symbolism is employed:

      <...>        These brackets delimit the name of a syntactic entity
      [...]        These delimit optional components of the command
    ...|...        This  character separates  alternatives for  the same
               command component

               Cross-references   in   this  document   are   always  to
               subsections.   Subsection  numbers  are  printed  at  the
               bottom of each page.

1.6 TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS      


               PUB is a  string processing language.  Characters  can be
               formed  into   words,  words   into  lines,   lines  into
               paragraphs, paragraphs into columns, columns into "areas"
               (such as  the title areas  at the top  and bottom  of the
               page), areas  into pages,  pages into  sections, sections
               into "portions"  (such as  the Table  of Contents  or the
               Appendices), and portions  into a document.   The methods
               of bulding  larger units from  smaller ones  are flexible
               and under control of the programmer.

               The most trivial use of PUB is tote a  document that
               is  exactly  identical  to  the  manuscript,  adding only
               headings and  footings.  PUB assumes  that the  format of
               each output  page is as  follows.  The first  three lines
               are a  Heading area  of which only  the first  is usually
               used.  The  next 48 lines  (lines 4 to  51) are  the Text
               area.  Line 52  is blank and line  53 is a  Footing area.
               The Footing area is for page numbers and  other reference
               information,  not for  footnotes.  (Footnotes  are placed
               inside the Text area, towards its bottom).

               The width of  each page is  assumed to be  69 characters.
               It  is assumed  that  there is  only one  column  of text
               output.  Therefore, the longest an output line can  be is
               69 characters.

               The number of lines  in each area, the number  of columns
               of text, and the number of characters in each  column may
               be changed by  declaration.  See Section 6.7  and Section
               7.13 for  details.  If all  you want to  do is  widen the
               page,  e.g., to  75 characters,  then make  the following
               line the first of the manuscript:
.PAGE FRAME 53 HIGH 75 WIDE

               The "Dot"  in column  one indicates that  this line  is a
               Command Line for PUB to opey and should not be printed in
               the document. If  you would rather a  different character
               in column one served for this purpose, see Section 2.2

               PUB assumes that you  want no headings and  footings.  It
               will leave the heading and footing areas blank unless you
               specify otherwise.  The simplest way to  specify headings
               and footings is with the standard macros  "EVERY HEADING"
               and "EVERY  FOOTING".  These macros  can specify  a title
               for the left edge, center, and right edge of  the heading
               area and the footing area.  For example, the macro call:
                                  1.6.EVERY HEADING(PRELIMINARY REPORT,PARACYBERNETIC PHENOMENA,1972)

               will print on the top line of every page the three titles
               shown.
SAILON-70                     INTRODUCTION                        Page 6


               To  make the  top line  of every  page display  the title
               "PRELIMINARY REPORT" on the left and the current  date on
               the right, use:
.EVERY HEADING(PRELIMINARY REPORT, ,{DATE})

               The consecutive commas indicate that the center is empty.
               The curly brackets around the word DATE specify that DATE
               is not a title to be printed but rather a variable  to be
               evaluated.

               To make  the number  of each  page appear  bottom center,
               use:
.EVERY FOOTING(,{PAGE},)

               To learn  about fancier headings  and footings,  you will
               have to  read most of  this document,  especially Section
               7.5 and Section 10.2.

               PUB  will  number  your pages  1, 2, 3,  etc.  unless you
               declare otherwise.   To learn how,  see Section  6.11.  A
               new  page  of  output  will be  started  for  one  of two
               reasons: the  previous page is  full, or  a page-changing
               command  is  executed.   The  most  common  page-changing
               command is:
.NEXT PAGE

               This  always starts  a  new page,  even if  one  was just
               started and nothing  is on it yet.   To start a  new page
               only if there is something on the current page, use:
.SKIP TO COLUMN 1

               To leave a few blank lines in the document, use:
.GROUP SKIP 10

               The SKIP command is described in Section 7.12.

               PUB processes text a paragraph at a time.  The  usual way
               to indicate the end of a paragraph in your  manuscript is
               by a blank line (that is, just a CR and LF).   Other ways
               are  discussed  elsewhere in  this  manual,  beginning at
               Section 2.3.

               Usually, PUB packs a paragraph as tightly as  possible by
               filling up each output line with words before beginning a
               new  line. This  is called  "filling".  Then  PUB inserts
               extra spaces  between words to  eliminate a  ragged right
               edge from the paragraph. This is called "justifying".

               PUB will not indent  the first line of  paragraphs unless
                                  1.6     in the manuscript, e.g.:               and indent command appears
.INDENT 6

               To learn more about indentation and related  matters, see
               Section 6.4 through Section 6.7.
SAILON-70                     INTRODUCTION                        Page 7


               PUB assumes you would like your text lines filled out and
               justified.   You can  selectively exempt  blocks  of your
               manuscript  from  this  fate.  Each  such  block  must be
               delimited by ".BEGIN" and ".END".  After "BEGIN", specify
               a  formatting mode  to persist  for the  duration  of the
               block.  Examples:

Fill, but don't Justify    Don't even fill   Copy verbatim

.BEGIN NOJUST              .BEGIN NOFILL     .BEGIN VERBATIM
   ...                        ...               ...
.END                       .END              .END

               In "NOJUST" mode, lines will be filled but not justified.
               In "NOFILL" and "VERBATIM"  modes, they will not  even be
               filled.  The  difference between  NOFILL and  VERBATIM is
               that VERBATIM  is both faster  and dumber.  It  is faster
               because  it copies  the lines  of the  manuscript  to the
               document without looking at them, except to see  if there
               is a dot in column one.  It is dumber because it does not
               recognize  text  control  characters  that  PUB  normally
               recognizes, and it does  not reformat in any  way.  Thus,
               VERBATIM is  used to copy  blocks of manuscript  that are
               already formatted perfectly.

               Filling allows the manuscript to be quite ragged, a great
               convenience in editing.   Short lines are  lengthened and
               long  lines  are  shortened.   Be  careful  in  NOFILL or
               VERBATIM mode that no  manuscript line is longer  than 69
               characters (or whatever limit you have declared), or some
               of it will be lost and an error message given.

               You now know enough  to use PUB for simple  purposes. The

               document that PUB produced from it.

It has been observed that the sigma 3 in Horsetown, Mass. and the
CDC 6600 in Liverless, Cal. tend to have parity errors at the same
time. When records were compared by
Miss Minnie Messer, Director of the Horsetwon Chamber of Commerce
Computation Facility,
and Mr. Solomon Crunch of Liverless Hospital's Organ-Transplant
Inventory Project, it was shown that
the correlation of parity error occurrences was 0.8, with a
probability of random coincidence of <.00000001.

Miss Messer and Mr. Crunch revealed these discoveries at the
Universal Users Union meeting in Cranchville, Tenn. after they
arrived two hours late for Mr. Crunch's scheduled talk there.
They said that in the excitement of discovery
the meeting slipped their minds.

This report has motivated this author to undertake
a wider survey to determine if similar
phenomena have occurred elsewhere.  The author has
solicited Miss Messer's assistance in this survey,
but without the cooperation of the entire computing community,
it is unlikely that sufficient
data
can be collected.  Therefore, we request that interested
parties tabulate the exact times of occurrence of parity
errors on their computer during the 7 day period
1200 April 18 to 1200 April 25 and send it to:

Results of the study will be presented at the next UUU meeting
in December.

2.1 ILLEGAL CHARACTERS     


               If the following characters occur in the manuscript, they
               may cause problems:

       '177        Rubout
       '175        Altmode
        '13        Vertical Tab

               These characters are ignored in the manuscript:

         '0        Null
        '14        Form Feed (except after LF, where it is a page mark)

               A manuscript prepared using  SOS is legitimate if  it has
               no vertical tabs.  If it is prepared using TECO,  be sure
               as well that every line ends with CR LF.

               Tabs are expanded to the appropriate number of spaces, as
               in the line editor.



2.2 COMMAND AND TEXT LINES       


               Every line with a dot (".") in column 1 is processed as a
               command line.   Every other line  is processed as  a text                                                         
               line.               

               If you  would prefer a  different character  to introduce
               command lines, e.g., $, use the command:
COMMAND CHARACTER "$" ;



2.3 PARAGRAPHING    


               The   text   is  processed   in   logical   units  called
               "paragraphs".  A paragraph  is the accumulation  of words
                               2.1 - 2.3    terminated by the occurrence               from one or more text lines,
               of a paragraph break.                     

               A paragraph break can  be caused by the command  BREAK as                  
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 12


               well  as  by  several  other  commands.  In  addition,  a
               paragraph break can be caused by signals in the text.

               Paragraphing  conventions can  be  varied by  the  use of
               various mode and switch settings.



2.4 FILL MODE     


               In FILL mode, the compiler puts as many words as  can fit
               on each output line  before beginning a new line  -- each
               line is "filled" with words.

               For convenience of  exposition, names have been  given to
               the  parts of  the output  paragraph in  FILL  mode.  The
               first line is called the crown, and the rest of the lines                                        
               are called the  vest.  It is  common to indent  the crown                               
               and  not  the vest,  or  vice versa,  or  to  indent them
               different amounts.  The last  line of the vest  is called
               the hem.  While the  other lines of the paragraph  can be                   
               subject  to   justification,  the   hem  line   is  never
               justified.



2.5 JUSTIFICATION    


               In FILL mode, whether or not output lines are justified
               to the right margin is determined by the setting of the
               "ADJUST-NOJUST" switch; but the hem line is never
               justified in any case.



2.6 BREAKING AT BLANK LINES       


               In FILL mode, a BREAK is caused by every blank line (just
               CR-LF).   Redundant  blank  lines  have  no  effect.   To
               disable this response, see Section 10.1.



2.7 BREAKING AT TABS      


                               2.4 - 2.7            number of  spaces by               Tabs are converted to an appropriate
               PUB.  If you would like a single tab at the  beginning of
               a text line to cause a paragraph break, put  this command
               at the beginning of your manuscript:
.TABBREAK
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 13


               This makes text lines that are indented exactly  8 spaces
               cause a break.   Since an initial  TAB is converted  to 8
               spaces, it will also  break.  The inverse of  TABBREAK is
               TABSPACE.



2.8 BREAKING AT CARRIAGE-RETURNS      


               In FILL mode, PUB usually converts  every carriage-return
               at the end of  a text line to a  space.  If it is  at the
               end of a sentence, it converts the carriage-return to two
               spaces.  If you  would rather that  every carriage-return
               ending a  text line  caused a  paragraph break,  use this
               command:
.CRBREAK

               The inverse of CRBREAK is CRSPACE.



2.9 NOFILL MODE     


               In NOFILL mode, one input line produces one  output line,
               even if it  falls far short of  the right margin;  if the
               line  is  too  long,  characters  will  be  lost.   Every
               carriage-return ending a text line in NOFILL  mode causes
               a  paragraph break.   The commands  ADJUST,  CRSPACE, and
               TABBREAK do not affect this mode.

               NOFILL mode has  several variations, which  differ mainly
               in the final treatment of the o the left margin.

JUSTJUST:    Justify     it    by     the    insertion     of    spaces.

VERBATIM: Copy text lines to output exactly as written,
                 without changing
   indentations.  Ignore all control characters {^B^[#]&^C\^O-^N_^Y.
            Dot in column 1   still signals a command line.
        This mode speeds text processing
                                 when no formatting is needed.

               SUPERIMPOSE [n]: Suppress the LF after each  line, except
               every n'th line.

2.10 HORIZONTAL SPACE COMPACTION       


               In COMPACT mode, redundant  spaces in the input  line are
               discarded.        In       RETAIN  mode,        they  are
               retained.

               More precisely,  in COMPACT  mode, a  sequence of  two or
               more spaces is reduced to one space, except at the end of
               a sentence, where it  is only reduced to two  spaces, and
               at the  beginning of  a text line,  where all  spaces are
               discarded.  Of course,  spaces may be  re-inserted during
               justification.



2.11 VERTICAL GROUPING      


               In GROUP mode, all  output lines are forced to  appear in
               an unbroken column.  Its  inverse is APART mode.   If the
               bottom of the output  page is encountered while  in GROUP
               mode, the  whole group is  moved to the  top of  the next
               column or page.

               It is unwise to use GROUP mode for more than a  few lines
               that must appear undivided in the output.  Example:

.GROUP
EQUATION 6
  m = vt
.APART
               This  would prevent  "Equation 6"  from appearing  at the
               bottom of one page and "m = vt" at the top of the next.



2.12 MODE AND SWITCH SETTING COMMANDS         


               The commands that select the paragraphing mode  are FILL,
               NOFILL,  CENTER,  FLUSH  RIGHT,  FLUSH   LEFT,  JUSTJUST,
               VERBATIM, and SUPERIMPOSE [n], where n [optional]  is any
               "SAIL" expression.

               The  commands  ADJUST   and  NOJUST  set   the  FILL-mode
               justification switch.   TABBREAK, TABSPACE,  CRBREAK, and
               CRSPACE control the reactionching to NOFILL or to  any of
               its  variations  automatically switches  to  RETAIN mode.
                              2.10 - 2.12 by  following  the  command by               This  can  be  overridden
               COMPACT.

2.13 WORD BREAKS      


               The  compiler  processes  the  input  paragraph  in units
               called words.  A "word" is roughly defined as  a sequence                      
               of consecutive  visible characters.  More  precisely, the
               compiler concatenates  characters into  a word  until the
               occurrence of a word break.                                

               A  word  break  is  normally  signalled  by  any  of  the
               following in a text line:

>A space (or a sequence of spaces)
>A carriage-return (the end of an input line)
>The control character ^C, if activated (as well as some others)

               Word breaks serve two functions.

               (1) FILLING:  In  generating  an  output  paragraph,  the
               compiler  puts as  many  words as  can fit  on  each line
               before beginning a new line.  The paragraph will  only be
               divided for this purpose at word breaks.

               (2) JUSTIFYING:  During justification, extra  spaces will
               only be inserted at word breaks.



2.14 CONTROL FUNCTIONS      


               Several  control  functions  can  be  invoked  by control
               characters in  the text  line.  The  user can  choose the
               characters  he  wishes  to  serve  these  functions.  For
               simplicity of exposition, a suggested character  has been
               designated for each function.

               The following  control functions  are available.   If the
               description states: "BLA mode only", then in other modes,
               the  character   is  treated   no  differently   than  an
               alphanumeric.

          ^C       Cause a word Break.

          ^B       Pretend the next character is Alphanumeric (this lets
               you slip in control characters);

          #        Same as ^B<space>; sneaks spaces into words.

                              2.13 - 2.14   at the end of a  word: marks          . ! ?    FILL mode only, and only
               the end of a sentence. This means:

                   (1) If  followed by  two or  more  spaces, COMPACTion
               only reduces the spaces to two instead of one.
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 16


                   (2) If followed by a carriage-return, replaces the CR
               by two spaces instead of one.

          -        FILL  mode only,  and not  the first  character  of a
               word: marks the end of a sentence. This means:

                   (1) If at the end of a line, prevents the  word break
               that usually occurs there.
                   (2) Otherwise, permits  the word  to be  broken after
               the hyphen in case it overfills the output line.

          \        TAB. Insert spaces up to the next tab stop set by the
               TABS command (see Section 6.3).

          ^O+n     MOVE RIGHT.  Leave n spaces in the output line.

          ^O-n     MOVE LEFT  n characters. Create new characters

          ^On      TAB.  Insert spaces up to but not including  the n'th
               character position  from the left  margin (flush  left is
               n=1).  Both kinds of TAB (\ and ^On) inhibit insertion of
               all justification spaces to their left.

                   For ^On  and  ^O+n,  n may  be any  "SAIL" expression
               enclosed in parentheses.  In the case of a  single letter
               variable or  a one-digit number,  the parentheses  may be
               omitted.  RESTRICTION... ^O(<expression>) may  not appear
               as the last thing on a text line.

                  Right Flush.  If a \ or ^On occurs later in the line,
               slide  the  text that  is  between here  and  there flush
               against the column designated by the tab.  Otherwise, 
                                slide the rest of this paragraph against the right
                                                 margin, inhibiting justification.

          _        Center.   If a  \ or  ^On occurs  later in  the line,
               center the  text that is  between here and  there halfway
               between the current  column and the column  designated by
               the tab.   Otherwise, center  the following  text between
               the margins, inhibiting justification.

          ^Nx      Repeat.   `x' is  any character.  If ^Nx  precedes \,
               ^O+, ^On, ,  or _, then use  the character x  instead of
               spaces as filler to the left of the affected  text (i.e.,
               ^N.\ puts ..... up to the tab column).

          ^Nx^Ny^Nz...       Use  the  repeating  string   xyzxyz...  as
               filler.

                                  2.14   In  the text  between brackets,          ^A^X...^X^A        Underline.
               every visible  character is underlined.   "^X" is  only a
               control  character when  paired with  "^A".  If  you want
               spaces   underlined   as   well   in   a   title,  simply
               replaceeachspacebyanunderbar.
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 17


          ^S       Underline one  word.  The following  word (consisting                                                        
               of letters and digits only) is underlined.

          {        Switch  to  Command  Processing.  To  return  to text
               processing, use }. See Section 2.16.

          ^Ax      Subscript The text x is                (an extra line
                                           lowered a line
               is  reserved  for it).   x  may be  any  single character
               except "[" or  "^A", or may  be a sequence  of characters
               bracketed between [...] .  A Subscript must appear all on
               one line.

          ^x       Superscript.   Analogous to  Subscript, except  x may
               also  be   the  single  character   "^A".   Collectively,
               superscripts
                            and            are called somescripts.
                                subscripts

                   These  may  combine  and  nest  in  interesting ways.
               Super/subscripts may not nest more deeply than 4.

          x&y      Align.  "&" is only considered a control character if
               it is the first character following a somescript  x.  Its
               effect is to align the leftmost characters of x and  y by
               backspacing after printing  x and before printing  y, and
               to align the  rightmost characters by forward  spacing to
               the end of the longer of x and y when done.  x must  be a
               somescript.  y  may be any  single character  except "[",
               "^", or "^A", or may be another somescript, or may be any
               sequence   of   characters  enclosed   between   [...]  .

2.15 CONTROL CHARACTER ACTIVATION       


               At the outset of compilation, the only control characters
               recognized  are the  punctuators ".",  "!", and  "?" when
               they appear at the end  of a word, and hyphen  ("-") when
               it appears in the middle  of a word.  NOTE: Not  even "{"
               is recognized  unless you activate  it.  However,  "}" is
               permanently  active, because  it  is not  a  text control
               character but really a command langauge delimiter.

               To  turn  on  any control  function  using  its suggested
               character ("^B" for example), use the command:
.TURN ON "^B"

               To  activate  the  control  function  using  a  different
               character, such as "%" or "^C", write:

.TURN ON "%" FOR "^B"
.TURN ON "^C" FOR "^B"
               To de-activate a control  character, such as "?"  or "%",
               use:

.TURN OFF "?"
.TURN OFF "%"

               One TURN command  may have several operands  separated by
               commas:
.TURN ON "%" FOR "^B", "@" FOR "_", "^A", "\"
.TURN ON "^", "^A", "[", "]", "_", "&"

               The latter may be abbreviated:
.TURN ON "^^A[]_&"

               There  is  a  subtle  problem  that  arises  when control
               characters have  been turned  on inside  a macro  and the
               macro wants to  turn  off only  the ones that  weren't on
               previously.  If it  has done a TURN ON "^",  for example,
               it  can not  undo it  with TURN OFF "^",  for  that would
               always TURN it OFF whether  or not it was  originally on.
               There are two ways to  do it right.  One is to  use block
               structure  (see  Section  5.2),  but  sometimes  this  is
               impossible, because  blocks cause paragraph  breaks.  The
               other  way  is  to use  the  command  TURN ON|OFF without
               arguments.   Its  effect   is  to  cancel   the  previous
               TURN ON|OFF that had arguments, was in the current block,
               and has not yet been cancelled.

               For purposes  of smooth exposition,  in the rest  of this
                                  2.15      you have  turned on  all the               manual  it is  assumed that
               control functions and  used all the  suggested characters
               for them.   Remember, though,  that only  the punctuators
               are turned on unless you command otherwise!
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 19


               It is recommended that  you don't turn on  any characters
               except  in short  blocks where  you know  you'll remember
               they're on.   Ideal places are  inside macro  bodies (See
               Section 3.1).



2.16 COMPUTED TEXT      


               The  control  character   "{"  will  switch   to  command
               processing  right in  the middle  of a  text  line.  This
               allows the  execution of any  PUB commands  without first
               causing either a paragraph break or a word break.  If you
               want a word break before the {, force it by means of a ^C
               or a space.

               The  command  most  commonly executed  after  "{"  is the
               Computed  Text Command.   A  variable, a  constant,  or a                  
               parenthesized  expression   occurring  in   isolation  is               
               evaluated and  its string  value is  then scanned  by the
               text scanner as text.  Example:

A = {A}, and B = ^A^X4^X^A.

               If  the  value of  A  was the  string  "^S3",  this would
               output:

A = 3, and B = 4.              

               Caution: If a {...} construct extends onto a second input
               line, be sure to  begin the continuation line with  a "."
               -- or you won't be in the command scanner!

               Caution: A  string constant following  the word  BEGIN is
               considered a  block name,  as in  SAIL, and  not computed
               text.  If you put  computed text after BEGIN,  precede it
               by a semicolon.

               Note that  a "}"  (which can  not be  TURNed ON  and OFF)
               switches to  text processing  from command  processing at
               any time. This allows a  Short Text Line to be  put right                                          
               into a command line:
.NOFILL }I am a short text line.{BREAK FILL

               which is the compact equivalent of:

.NOFILL
I am a short text line.
                                  2.16.FILL

               To summarize, there are  two ways to switch  from command
               to text processing:
SAILON-70                   TEXT CONVENTIONS                     Page 20


>New line without "." in column 1
>}
               and two  ways to switch  from text processing  to command
               processing:

                                 MACROS




3.1 CALLING A MACRO FROM A COMMAND LINE          


               It is common to repeat an identical sequence  of commands
               many times in a manuscript, e.g.,
.FILL ADJUST COMPACT TURN ON "^O{^B^C"

               You could define the following macro:
.MACRO FAC $( FILL ADJUST COMPACT TURN ON "^O{^B^C" )$

               and then whenever  you want the whole  sequence executed,
               write simply:
.FAC

               The  body of  the  macro enclosed  between $(  and  )$ is
               substituted for its name and then scanned by  the command
               scanner.

               A macro may also have arguments:
.MACRO T(CHR) $( NOFILL TURN ON "CHR" )$

               which when called by:
.T(^B)

               expands to:
. NOFILL TURN ON "^B"



3.2 CALLING A MACRO FROM A TEXT LINE          


               It  is  also  common to  repeat  an  awkward  sequence of
               control characters many times in the manuscript, e.g.,
X^i&^A[j,k]

               You could define the following macro:
.MACRO XIJK $("X^i&^A[j,k]")$

               but to call it you must get to the command scanner:
{XIJK}

                               3.1 - 3.2    for the name, this becomes a               When the body is substituted
               string constant inside curly brackets:
{"X^i&^A[j,k]"}
SAILON-70                        MACROS                          Page 22


               so it is considered  computed text and is scanned  by the
               text scanner, producing the output:

 i
X
 j,k

               Again, parameters can be used:
.MACRO S(X,I,J,K) $("X^i&^A[j,k]")$

               If called by {X(i,j,k)} this would expand to the  same as
               above, but called by
{S(Y,t,t1,URG)}

               it would expand to "Y^t&^A[t1,URG]" which would output:
 t
Y
 t1,URG

               Some  macros are  declared  for you  in  an automatically
               loaded file PUBSTD.DFS  (see Section 7.5).   Other useful
               macros are  declared in  a file  PUBMAC.DFS that  you can
               REQUIRE (see Section 7.11) to be loaded.



3.3 TEMPLATES    


               A  "template"  occurs  as  a  part  of  several commands,
               including  the  macro  declaration,  and   requires  some
               explanation.  Its purpose  is to  store away  a  piece of
               program for later, instead of immediate, execution.
        Syntax:
$( <piece of program> )$

               The <piece of  program> may include other  templates, and
               may span several lines.  However, several rules should be
               followed:

               (1) The template should begin and end on a command line.

               (2) Every ^U or unpaired  $( or )$ must be preceded  by a
               ^U.

               (3)  People   who  change   COMMAND  CHARACTER   in  mid-
               manuscript, note:  the character beginning  command lines
               within the template must  be the one current at  the time
               of declaration -- not the one current when you  invoke it
                                  3.3               later.

3.4 MACRO DECLARATION     

        Syntax:
MACRO <name> [<formal parameters>] [;] <template>

               The <name>  may be one  or two identifiers.   The <formal
               parameters> if present, are in the following form:
(  [^F]<identifier>  , ...  )

               Each parameter preceded by  ^F is a value  parameter, and                                                   
               when  called, the  actual parameter  that  corresponds is
               evaluated  and   the  value   is  substituted   for  each
               occurrence in  the <template> of  the <id>.   Every other
               parameter  is  a   literal  parameter,  and   the  actual                                  
               parameter is substituted unevaluated.  Example:
.MACRO PLUG IN(X, ^FY) $( "X --- Y" )$

               If called  by: {PLUG  IN(Peter Pauper, V)}  where V  is a
               variable whose  current value  is "Henrietta",  the macro
               expands to: {"Peter Pauper --- Henrietta"}



3.5 MACRO CALLS     


               A macro can be called from anywhere in a command  line as
               well as inside  curly brackets on  a text line.   A value
               parameter  must  be  a  "SAIL"  expression  (see  Section
               4.1), while  a literal  parameter may  take any  of three
               forms (form 2 is recommended):

          (1) A  string enclosed  in "..."  in which  every "  inside is
                represented by "" . It must appear all on one line.

          (2) A string enclosed in |...| in which no | appears.   It may
                span several command lines.

          (3) A string not beginning with " or | and containing no comma
                or right parenthesis.  It  must appear all on  one line.
                Leading spaces are ignored.

               Thus, all the folowing are equivalent:

PLUG IN ("Peter Pauper", V)
PLUG IN (|Peter Pauper|, V)
PLUG IN ( Peter Pauper, V)
"Peter Pauper --- Henrietta"

                               3.4 - 3.5

3.6 OMISSIONS    


               Any actual  paramiter may be  omitted; its value  is then
               NULL. Furthermore, if  all paramiters that follow  it are
               also omitted, all their terminal commas may be omitted.

               In a macro call -- but not in a macro declaration  -- the
               parentheses  around  the  actual  parameter  list  may be
               omitted (both  -- not just  one).  However, care  must be
               taken if  this is  done.  In  particular, the  comma that
               follows each  parameter must appear  on the same  line as
               the parameter.  Also, the third form of literal parameter
               may not contain any of the following:
,  )  ]  ;  {  $(  CR

               This convention is useful for macros to  generate section
               headings; a typical call is:
.SEC SPECIAL FEATURES

               which is equivalent to:
.SEC(|SPECIAL FEATURES|)

               and would presumably go to a new page, update the section
               number, print  the heading centered,  and send it  to the
               Table of  Contents for  inclusion there.   How to  do all
               this will unfold gradually.



3.7 RECURSIVE MACROS     


               If a macro is  declared "RECURSIVE MACRO ...",  then when
               its call occurs in  the FALSE part of a  conditional, the
               compiler processes  the actual  parameters as  usual, but
               does not expand the macro body.  Instead, the  whole call
               is replaced by NULL.

               For  macros  not  declared  RECURSIVE,  their  bodies are
               expanded even in the  FALSE part of a  conditional.  This
               prevents syntactic  anomalies, but attempts  at recursion
               will create infinite looping.

               Recursive macro  hackers: If you  call a  RECURSIVE macro
               after a  conditional statement,  an empty  statement must
               intervene:
.IF A<0 THEN B ELSE C ; ; RECMAC(...) ;

4.1 DATA TYPE     


               PUB has only one data type: String.  A string consists of                                           
               zero or more ASCII characters.

               Strings  may participate  in arithmetic  operations.  The
               string "764"  is automatically  converted to  the integer
               764 for  this purpose.   The result  of the  operation is
               similarly converted  back to a  string.  Because  of this
               convention,  the  data   type  Integer  exists   for  all                                              
               practical purposes.



4.2 VARIABLES    


               Variables may be declared by the command:
.VARIABLE A, BETA, C

               This  would make  A, BETA, and C local  to  the innermost
               block in which the declaration occured. The variables are
               of course type String.

               Any  variable  that  is  assigned  but  not  declared  is
               automatically Global.                             

               All  decared  variables  are  initiallized  to  NULL, the
               string of length zero.

               The  name  of  a variable  is  an  identifier.  The first                                                  
               character of an identifier should be a letter  The letter
               may  be  followed   by  letters,  digits,  and   !.   The
               identifier   is  terminated   by  any   other  character,
               including  CR.  Before  looking  up an  identifer  in its
               symbol table, PUB changes all lower case letters to upper
               case.

               In  syntactic  descriptions  in  this  manual,  <id> will
               denote any identifier, and <v> will denote a  variable in
               particular.

4.3 AUTOMATICALLY DECLARED VARIABLES      


               Some variables are automatically declared for you  by the
               compiler, in a block outside your outermost block.  A few
               of these are  read-only -- it  is not possible  to assign
               them a value by an assignment statement.

       CHAR        (read-only) The number  of characters so  far printed
               on the  current output  line, not  counting justification
               spaces.  This is sometimes an overestimate.
       LINE        (read-only)  Value  is  zero  if  the  current output
               column is empty.  Otherwise, the sequential number of the
               last line output.
     COLUMN        (read-only)  Value is  zero  if the  current  page is
               empty.   Otherwise  the  sequential  number  of  the last

    TOPLINE        (read-only) The line number on this page  that starts
               the current area.  (see Section 6.7).
    FILLING        (read-only) FALSE ("0") if in a NOFILL mode.  TRUE if
               in FILL mode -- "1" if ADJUST, "-1" if NOJUST.

               line spacing.   SPREAD=1 is  single spacing,  SPREAD=2 is
               double  spacing,  etc.   Its initial  value  is  1 unless
               otherwise specified in the (nS) CUSP option.

     !SKIP!        (read-only) May be set by extreme substring operators
               (see SAIL manual, 9-43).   To examine the left  and right
               halves, examine !SKIPL! and !SKIPR!.
    FOOTSEP        Before the first footnote (if any) in each  column, a
               blank line  is usually left.  This is because  FOOTSEP is
               initially  NULL.  If  you assign  it another  value, then
               that string will be printed instead.

4.4 SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS     


               Most  of the  SAIL  <string expression>  syntax  has been
               implemented.  Exceptions: function designators (but there
               are  macro calls);  exponentiation; LDB,  ILDB,  and LOP;
               shifts and masks; LEAP operators.

               PUB has three unary operators of its own: "^" capitalizes
               its argument  (only lower case  letters and  underbar are
               affected).   EVEN  and  ODD  are  predicates  which  tell
               whether  the low  order bit  of the  last character  of a
               string  is  off  or  on.   They  are  used  primarily  to
               distinguish left and right facing pages:
.IF ODD PAGE THEN etc.

               All  the  available  operators are  listed  in  the table
               below.  If operator op1 is listed above operator op2 then
               op1 is performed before op2.

               The  identifiers OR,  LEQ,  etc. are  not  reserved words
               except in context.   (The same holds for  all identifiers
               in the language except command names.)

               Both division operators  (/, DIV) are equivalent  -- they

4.5 GENERAL EXPRESSIONS     


               Assignment  expressions and  conditional  expressions are
               allowed. If used alone  to compute text, enclose  them in
               parentheses,  otherwise they  will look  to  the compiler
               like assignment statements or conditional statements, and                                               
               the text processor won't scan their values.

               In  syntactic  descriptions, <e>  will  denote  a general
               expression --  simple, assignment, or  conditional, while
               <se> will denote a strictly simple expression.



4.6 CONSTANTS    


               PUB recognizes three forms of constants: quoted, decimal,
               and octal.  WARNING: CR will terminate any form, so don't
               continue a quoted constant on a new line.

               A  quoted constant  (<qc>)  is a  sequence  of characters
               surrounded by quotes ("...").  To include a quote  in the
               represented  string,  write   two  quotes  ("")   in  the
               constant.

               A  decimal  constant  (<dc>)  is  a  sequence  of decimal
               digits.

               An octal constant (<oc>) is an apostrophe (') followed by
               a  sequence  of octal  digits.   The value  of  the octal
               number  is  taken  modulo 200   and  converted  to  a one
                                            8
               character ASCII  string.  The  following octal  codes are
               illegal: '0, '11-'15, '175, '177.

                               STATEMENTS




5.1 STATEMENT TYPES     


               Syntactically,   any   command   can   be   a   statement
               (abbreviated  <s>  in   this  manual).   There   are  two
               categories  of commands:  declarative and  imperative.  A
               declaration is limited  in its scope by  block structure,
               while an imperative isn't.



5.2 BLOCK    

        Syntax:
BEGIN [<qc>] <s> ; ... END [<qc>]

               The optional block name [<qc>] should be the same in both
               places.  Mismatches will  be flagged.  Missing  END's are
               calamitous to say the least!

               Note that declarations don't  have to be the  first thing
               in  the  block.   The  scope  of  a  declaration  is  the
               remainder of the innermost block in which it occurs.

               Both  BEGIN and  END  cause a  paragraph  break.  Neither
               produces output, not even a blank line.

               The semicolons between statements may be omitted  as long
               as no ambiguity is presented thereby.



5.3 COMPOUND STATEMENT or CLUMP       

        Syntax:
START [<qc>] <s> ; ... END [<qc>]

               Declarations are not local  to clumps, and START  and END
               never break.  Thus:
.IF TRUE THEN START FILL ; ADJUST END ;

               sets the modes FILL and ADJUST and leaves them  set after
                               5.1 - 5.3    instead of START,  the scope               END.  If BEGIN had been used
               of the modes woulds have extended only to END.

5.4 ONE PARAGRAPH SCOPE      

        Syntax:
ONCE

               The command ONCE breaks and begins a local scope which is
               implicitly terminated by  the end of the  next paragraph.
               There must not be an END provided to match it. If a BEGIN                          
               is encountered before a paragraph breaks, then everything
               that has been declared in the ONCE's scope is  donated to
               the scope of the BEGIN's block and the ONCE is forgotten.
               Examples:

.ONCE FLUSH RIGHT
George
               is equivalent to:

.BEGIN FLUSH RIGHT
George
.END
               and

.ONCE FILL
.BEGIN NOJUST
Harry
.END
               is equivalent to:

.BEGIN FILL NOJUST
Harry
.END

               You will find the ONCE construct useful in writing macros
               and in  formatting odd paragraphs  here and  there.  Note
               that ONCE  is a complete  statement, unlike  BEGIN, which
               introduces a statement that extends to the  matching END.
               Thus, you  can say "IF  X THEN ONCE  ELSE i_i+1"  but you
               can't say "IF X THEN BEGIN ELSE i_i+1".

6.1 SCOPE    


               (For the third time:) A declaration is in force until the
               occurrence of an overriding declaration or until  the end
               of the innermost block in which it occurred  (see Section
               5.2 through Section 5.4).



6.2 MODE DECLARATIONS     


               Most  of these  have already  been described.   Some mode
               declarations cause paragraph breaks and some  don't.  The
               ones that first Break are: FILL, all the NOFILLs, ADJUST,
               NOJUST,  GROUP,  and  APART.  The  ones  that  don't are:
               CRBREAK, CRSPACE, COMPACT and  RETAIN.



6.3 TABS DECLARATION     

        Syntax:
TABS <e>, ...

               The expressions are  sorted in algebraic  ascending order
               and duplicates are eliminated.  These then become the tab
               stops for the \  control character.  If you tab  when the
               target  is already  passed, no  spaces are  inserted, but
               justification to the left of the current position  in the
               output  line  is  inhibited  anyway.   Tab  distances are
               measured from the left margin.



6.4 INDENT DECLARATION     

        Syntax:
INDENT [<e>] [ ,<e>] [,<e>]

               This command  can change the  values of  three parameters
                               6.1 - 6.4 format:  INDENT1,  INDENT2, and               that  control  paragraph
               INDENT3.  They can also be changed directly by assignment
               statements.  Every change is local to the current block.

                    INDENT1 and INDENT2 specify indentation from
                         the left margin.

                    INDENT1  specifies  the value  of  the crown                                                           

                         first line of output paragraphs.

                    INDENT2  specifies  the  value  of  the vest                                                            

                         lines in FILL mode.

                    In NOFILL, SUPERIMPOSE, and  JUSTJUST modes,
                         INDENT1  is  observed,  and  INDENT2 is
                         ignored.  Old PUB users note: this is a
                         change from previous conventions.

                    INDENT3 specifies indentation from the right
                         margin in FILL mode.  It is  ignored in
                         NOFILL modes,  and in text  affected by
                         the control  characters "^Y",  "_", and
                         "^N".

                         FLUSH RIGHT modes are never indented.

                         corresponding     parameter     remains

               preceded by an implicit  SKIP N.  There are  actually two
               Preface numbers maintained --  one for FILL mode  and one
               for NOFILL  modes.  The  one you  change by  this command
               depends on the current mode.



               Initially, the FILL Preface  is 1 and the  NOFILL Preface
               is 0.

DOUBLE SPACE

               These are standard macros that set SPREAD to 1, 2, and 3,
               respectively.  At the end  of the current block,  the old
               value is restored.   SPREAD controls the  spacing between
               lines within a paragraph.

         [IN <e> COLUMNS <e> WIDE|APART]

               Each page is divided  into Areas into which  the compiler                                          
               will  place output  text.  The  areas HEADING,  TEXT, and

Each  area is  a  rectangle that        begun.  In  the case of  a TITLE
must lie  within the  bounds set        AREA overflow, an  error message
by the last PAGE FRAME Statement        is issued.
(see  Section  7.13).    If  the

taken  when  so  many  lines are        edges of each column.   How they
written in it that it overflows.        can be moved inward and back out
In  the  case  of  a  TEXT  AREA        is explained in Section 6.8.
                               6.6 - 6.7overflow,    all    areas    are
"closed",  the  whole   page  is
written out,  and a new  page is
SAILON-70                     DECLARATIONS                       Page 34


               The bottom  line of  a TEXT  AREA is  not used  except to
               print  the last  line  of a  paragraph.   This convention
               prevents  the appearance  of "windows"  at the  top  of a
               page.



6.8 MARGIN CONTROL     

        Syntax:
NARROW <se> [ ,<e>] <paragraphs and statements> WIDEN

               NARROW  and  WIDEN cause  paragraph  breaks.   NARROW L,R
               moves the  left and  right margins  of the  current PLACE
               area  inward  L  and  R,  respectively.    Their  initial
               positions are determined by the AREA declaration.   L and
               R may be negative.   If either is omitted, it  is assumed
               0.   The matching  WIDEN  restores the  margins  to their
               former positions.

               Alternatively, you can have:
WIDEN <se> [ ,<e>] <paragraphs and statements> NARROW

               which moves the margins outward.  Both kinds can nest.

               These   commands   change   the   automatically  declared
               variables LMARG and  RMARG (the Left and  Right Margins).
               They  can   also  be   changed  directly   by  assignment
               statements; such changes  are local to the  current block
               and to the current NARROW-WIDEN nest of the current PLACE
               area.

               Upon  exit  from a  block,  if the  margin  positions are
               different than they were at the beginning, then  they are
               restored and  instead of  the usual  Break, END  causes a
               CONTINUE (See Section  7.15), which treats the  next line
               as a vest instead of a crown line.

               Every paragraph is output in the following format:

       |      ----------------------------------------             |
       |     |                                        |      |     |
       |     |           (P blank lines)              |      |     |
< A-1 >|     |                                        |      |     |
       |     |<- I1 -> The crown line of the paragraph|      |     |
       |     |<----- I2 ----> a vest line ............|< I3 >|     |
       |< L >|               another vest line .......|      |< R >|
       |     |               the hem line.            |      |     |
       |      ----------------------------------------             |
                                  6.8       ^     ^                                               ^     ^
       A  Left-margin                                Right-margin  B
               The format suggested by the diagram above may be achieved
               by the following declarations:
SAILON-70                     DECLARATIONS                       Page 35


.AREA TEXT CHARS A TO B ;
.NARROW L, R ;
.FILL ; PREFACE P ; INDENT I1, I2, I3 ;

               The  automatically  declared variable  CHAR  and  all tab
               stops count characters from the left margin; they  may at
               times be negative.  It is possible to produce output past
               the right margin by setting tab stops out there.



6.9 PLACE DECLARATION     

        Syntax:
PLACE <area id>

               This breaks and switches output to the named  area.  This
               may be done many times  on the same page; output  to each
               area always picks up where it left off.

               If a column of  the current Place Area  overflows, output
               continues at the top  of the next column.  When  the last
               column overflows, either a  new page is begun (if  a TEXT
               AREA overflowed) or an error message is given (if a TITLE
               AREA overfowed).



6.10 TEMPORARY AREAS      


               This section is complicated.  Only read it if you need to
               create temporary  areas within a  page.  To do  this, you
               need to know where you're  up to on the page so  far.  If
               there's not enough room  for the new area, you  will want
               to go to a new  page.  Then a temporary area (local  to a
               block)  should  be  declared,  and  text  placed  in  it.
               Finally, you may need to  find out where you're up  to on
               the page again before you exit that block, skip  over the
               temporary area, and resume regular output.

               A more convenient way to handle this may be  available in
               a  future version  of  PUB in  the  form of  a  BOX FRAME
               declaration.  In the meantime, you should be able  to get
               by as follows.

               To  determine the  top line  on the  whole page  that the
               current PLACE  area uses, look  at TOPLINE.   Within that
               area,  lines  are  numbered starting  from  1  --  but if
                               6.9 - 6.10     1"  of the area  is really               TOPLINE is 6  that means "line
               the 6'th  line on  the page.  We can  distinguish P-lines
               (numbered  relative  to  the  whole  page)  from  A-lines
               (numbered local to the area); A-line 1 be P-line 6.
SAILON-70                     DECLARATIONS                       Page 36


               To determine the column  number and A-line number  of the
               last line output in  this area, look at COLUMN  and LINE.
               To determine how many empty columns remain in  this area,
               look at COLUMNS; for how many empty lines remain  in this
               column, look at LINES.  Note that LINE+LINES can  be less
               than the full height of the area, because a few  lines at
               the bottom may be occupied by footnotes.

               To declare a  two-column area 10  lines high for  a table
               starting just below the last output line, write:

.IF LINES < 10 THEN NEXT PAGE ;
.BEGIN
.AREA AXE LINES TOPLINE+LINE TO TOPLINE+LINE+9 IN 2 COLUMNS 5 APART
.PLACE AXE
         <table text>
.END
.GROUP SKIP 10
               Adding  TOPLINE  in  the  AREA  declaration  is necessary
               because it expects P-line numbers.



6.11 COUNTER DECLARATION      

        Syntax:
COUNT <id> [INLINE] [FROM <e>] [TO <e>] [BY <e>] [IN <counter id>]
         [PRINTING <e>|<template>]

               This is PUB's excuse  for a FOR statement.  The  user can
               declare certain identifiers  to be counters,  and arrange
               them  in hierarchies.   A  counter is  anything  you want
               numbered  sequentially.   Typical  counters  are SECTION,
               APPENDIX,  SUBSECTION, PAGE,  FOOTNOTE,  EQUATION, TABLE,
               FIGURE, NOTE, and REFERENCE.  A common hierarchy is:

                        SECTION
                       /       \
                   SUBSECTION  PAGE
                                |
                             FOOTNOTE

               The declarations for this hierarchy might be:

.COUNT SECTION FROM 1 TO 9
.COUNT SUBSECTION FROM 1 TO 99 IN SECTION
.COUNT PAGE FROM 1 TO 99 IN SECTION
.COUNT FOOTNOTE INLINE FROM 1 TO 9 IN PAGE

                                  6.11   the hierarchial parent counter;               The "IN" clause specifies
               it must have been previously declared.

               The range of each  counter is specified by the  FROM, TO,
SAILON-70                     DECLARATIONS                       Page 37


               and BY clauses; if omitted,  FROM 1, TO 18, and BY  1 are
               assumed.  The counter need not ever attain  the TO-value;
               it is just an  upper limit used to determine  the maximum
               number of characters needed to print the counter  in case
               it  is  referred  to in  a  Forward  Cross-Reference (see
               Section 9.1).

               The INLINE option  suppresses a BREAK which  is otherwise
               automatically  generated  before  each  stepping  of  the
               counter.

               The PRINTING clause is explained in Section 7.3.

               The commands  in this  section are  non-declarative. That
               means that their scope is not limited by block structure.
               an occasional  exception to this  rule is  the assignment
               statement; when the  assigned variable is  SPREAD, LMARG,
               RMARG, INDENT1, INDENT2,  or INDENT3, then the  change is
               local to the current block.



7.1 ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT     

        Syntax:

               "IF", "THEN", and "ELSE" don't break.



7.3 NEXT COUNTER VALUE STATEMENT       

        Syntax:

               This  breaks (unless  INLINE appeared  in  the designated
                               7.1 - 7.3     and the counter  is stepped               counter's COUNT declaration),
               to  its next  value.  The  first time  it is  called, the
               counter's value is initiallized.
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 39


               Every  COUNT   declaration  automatically   declares  two
               variables with special properties, and  initiallizes them
               to NULL.   The first  variable has the  same name  as the
               <counter id>, e.g., "SUBSECTION", and its value is always
               the  decimal integer  value  of the  counter.   The other
               variable's name is constructed by appending an "!" to the
               <counter id>, e.g., "SUBSECTION!".  The two variables are
               called the counting or "C-value" and the printing  or "P-
               value", respectively.

               The precise effect of the statement "NEXT U" in  terms of
               these variables is as follows.

               (1) If  U=NULL, then U  is set to  the FROM value  of the
               COUNT declaration; otherwise, U is incremented by  the BY
               value of the COUNT declaration.

               (2) The P-value is computed under control of the PRINTING
               clause  of  the  COUNT  declaration  (just  how  will  be
               explained shortly).  In addition, the P-value is assigned
               to the variable "!" as a convenient abbreviation.

               (3)  If   the  counter  has   hierarchically  subordinate
               counters,  all their  C-values  and P-values  are  set to
               NULL; thus, when you say NEXT SECTION, SECTION  becomes a
               new number  while SUBSECTION,  PAGE, and  FOOTNOTE become
               NULL  (assuming  the hierarchy  of  the  recent example).
               Exception: If "PAGE" was one of the subordinate counters,
               after it is cleared it is immediately initialized.

               The computation  of the P-value  depends on  the PRINTING
               clause of the COUNT declaration. There are three cases.

Case One  The PRINTING clause is omitted.  P-value is the same as the C- 
          value.

Case Two  PRINTING  <template>.   After each  C-value  is  computed, the 
          expression inside the template is evaluated, and the result is
          the P-value.  Thus, the template should contain  an expression
          which involves the C-value.  Examples:

.COUNT FOOTNOTE TO 9 IN PAGE PRINTING $("*****"[1 TO FOOTNOTE])$ ;
          When FOOTNOTE=1, this sets FOOTNOTE!=*; when  FOOTNOTE=5, this
          sets FOOTNOTE!=*****.

.COUNT SUBSECTION IN SECTION PRINTING
.               $(SECTION! & "." & SUBSECTION)$ ;
          When SECTION!=4  and SUBSECTION is  counted to  7, SUBSECTION!
          becomes 4.7 .
                                  7.3
Case ThreePRINTING  <e>.   The  expression is  evaluated  only  once, at 
          declaration  time,  and  its value  serves  as  a  pattern for
          conversion of  the C-value to  the P-value.  For  example, the
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 40


          pattern "(i)" will produce  P-values such as (iv)  and (xlii),
          and the pattern  "!-A" will produce  P-values such as  6-A and
          33-L.  The pattern should evaluate to a string of the form:
<prefix> [ !  <middle> ] <format> <suffix>
          where  <prefix>,  <middle>,  and <suffix>  may  be  empty, and
          <format> must be 1, a, A, i, or I.  This is roughly equivalent
          to the template:
$(<prefix>& ! &<middle>& CONVERT(<counter id>,<format>) &<suffix>)$
          Here's what happens.   The P-value becomes this  pattern after
          substituting the parent counter's P-value for "!" (if present)
          and after converting the  C-value to the specified  format and
          substituting  it  for  <format>.   Before  explaining formats,
          let's give a simple example:

.COUNT SUBSECTION IN SECTION PRINTING "!.1" ;
          Here, <prefix>  and <suffix>  are empty  and <middle>  is ".".
          Format  "1" is  no-conversion, so  the C-value  is substituted
          unchanged for the "1".  The P-value of SECTION  is substituted
          for the "!".  Say SECTION!  is 6 and SUBSECTION is  stepped to
          4; then SUBSECTION! becomes 6.4 .
          The various <format> conversions are:

1         No conversion
I         Upper case Roman, i.e., 59 == LIX
i         Lower case Roman
A         Capital letters A,...Z,AA,BB,...ZZ,AAA,...
a         Little letters



7.4 NEXT PAGE STATEMENT      


               This variety  of Next  Statement has  special properties.
               Before stepping the PAGE counter, it "closes" and outputs
               all the  areas on the  current page and  sets up  a fresh
               page frame.

               Conversely,  when  a  page is  closed  due  to  text area
               overflow or "SKIP TO COLUMN 1", etc., the page counter is
               automatically stepped before  the new page is  opened, as
               if the command NEXT PAGE had been given.

               create fancy  headings and footings  at that or  at other
               times  (see  Section   10.2).   For  simple   cases,  the
               following command (which is actually a call to a built-in
               macro) is provided.

               pages (EVERY);  on the top  line (HEADING) or  the bottom
               line (FOOTING); the three <text>s will be printed  at the
               left edge, the  center, and the  right edge of  the page,
               respectively.   A  <text>  may  not  contain  quote  (").
               Example:
.ODD HEADING({DATE}, MACHINES THAT WONDER, {SUBSECTION!})

               This would cause to print on the top line of every right-
               facing page something like:
July 14, 1789             MACHINES THAT WONDER                   VII.iii



7.6 SECTIONING    


               The correct way to start every new section on a  new page
               is:
.NEXT PAGE ; NEXT SECTION ;

               If the order of  these were reversed and if  SECTION were
               the parent of PAGE, then NEXT SECTION would change PAGE's
               value before the old page got written out.



7.7 COMMAND CHARACTER STATEMENT      

        Syntax:
COMMAND CHARACTER <qc>|<v> ;

               The parameter must evaluate to a single character string.
               That character subsequently  assumes the function  of dot
               in column  1.  Since this  command is not  a declaration,
               its scope  is global;  i.e, it is  not affected  by block
               nesting.  Don't omit the semicolon!



7.8 PORTION DEMARCATION     

        Syntax:
PORTION <id>

               The  manuscript  may  be  (ought  to  be)   divided  into
                               7.6 - 7.8             CONTENTS,   THESIS,               Portions,   such   as   TITLEPAGE,               
               APPENDICES, NOTES, INDEX, and BIBLIOGRAPHY.

               Precede each portion by a Portion Demarcation, e.g.,
.PORTION NOTES
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 42


               The compiler  will assure that  each portion starts  on a
               fresh page and ends with a paragraph break.

               In general,  the order of  appearance of the  portions in
               the manuscript becomes  their order of appearance  in the
               document.  However,  this is  not always  convenient. For
               example,  the entries  for PORTION  CONTENTS  are usually
               generated  during the  processing of  the  other portions
               (see  Section  7.9);  therefore,  PORTION  CONTENTS  must                                                     
               appear at the end  of the manuscript.  To show  where you                      
               would like its output to be inserted in the document, use
               the statement:
.INSERT <id>, ...

               which  is  sort  of  a  "forward   portion  demarcation".
               Example:

.PORTION TITLEPAGE
         ...
.INSERT CONTENTS
. COMMENT This is where the table of contents should be printed;
.PORTION THESIS
.COUNT PAGE ; COMMENT Before NEXT SECTION starts a new page;
.NEXT SECTION
         ...
.PORTION INDEX
         ...
.COUNT PAGE PRINTING "i"; COMMENT Before PORTION starts new page;
.PORTION CONTENTS
. COMMENT This is where the table of contents is defined ;
         ...



7.9 SEND STATEMENT     

        Syntax:
SEND <portion id> [;] <template>

               With  every  portion  is  associated  a  file  called its
               generated  file.   A  generated  file  is  in  manuscript                                                 
               format.   The   idea  is  that   you  can   avoid  manual
               preparation of certain portions of your  manuscript (such
               as the  table of  contents and the  index) by  making PUB
               prepare them mechanically.

               The generated file of a portion may remain empty,  or may
               be  written on  during  the processing  of  portions that
               appear  earlier  in  the  manuscript.   For  example, the
                                  7.9        CONTENTS and  PORTION INDEX               generated files  for PORTION
               are usually  generated during  the processing  of earlier
               portions.
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 43


               The SEND statement writes a template onto the end  of the
               generated file for  the named portion.  The  portion must
               appear  later  in  the  manuscript.   Before  sending the
               template, the  compiler substitutes for  every occurrence
               of:
{ <v> }

               the (unquoted) value of the variable <v>.

               Thus, if S=6 and PAGE=26, then the statement:

.SEND CONTENTS $(
Section {S} -- Findings ^N.^Y {PAGE}
.)$ ;
               would send the following data to the file associated with
               PORTION CONTENTS (CRLF shown here for clarity):

<CRLF>
Section 6 -- Findings ^N.^Y 26<CRLF>
.

               If  a similar  SEND were  performed at  the  beginning of
               every section and  subsection of the manuscript,  then by
               the  time  the  compiler  reached  PORTION  CONTENTS, its
               generated files  would be  in perfect  manuscript format,
               e.g.:

Section 1 -- Introduction ^N.^Y 1
.
Section 2 -- Remarks ^N.^Y 6
.
         (etcetera)
Section 6 -- Extraneous Factors ^N.^Y 26
.
         (etcetera)
Section 413 -- Conclusions ^N.^Y 864
.
               The  empty command  lines are  of course  harmless; their
               inclusion was caused by the method of conforming with one
               of the rules of writing templates: a template must end on
               a  command  line.  Of  course,  a  template alternatively
               could end with a text line terminated by "{".

               The subtleties  of generated files  are discussed  in the
               Appendices to this manual.  If you would  rather postpone
               becoming an expert on the technique, you can still obtain
               a  table of  contents  and index  by the  use  of someone
               else's macros.  These macros (STANDARD FRONT and STANDARD
               BACK) are stored in file PUBMAC.DFS and described in file
                                  7.9               PUBMAC.TES.

7.10 RECEIVE STATEMENT      

        Syntax:
RECEIVE [<qc>|<v>]

               This  statement  substitutes the  generated  file  of the
               current portion for the statement and causes the compiler
               to compile it.  Thus, PORTION CONTENTS typically consists
               of a  few mode  setting commands, a  title, and  then the
               statement "RECEIVE".

               If the optional parameter is present, it  should evaluate
               to a string  of one or two  characters, say "L"  or "LR".
               The presence of  the parameter causes the  generated file
               to be alphabetized before it is compiled.  Entries in the
               file should be in the form:
<0 or more characters> L <Key> [R <0 or more characters>]

               PUB will alphabetize the entries by the <Key>s  using the
               ASCII collating sequence,  except lower case  letters are
               ranked with the corresponding upper case letters and "!".
               Then it will read the alphabetized file, including  the L
               and R characters.

               WARNING: The characters L and R must be chosen carefully.
               They  may not  occur in  the generated  file in  any role
               except  as key  delimiters.  Furthermore,  the characters
               "[", "]", "@" may not be  used.  It is legal for L  and R
               to be the same character.

               If your index is very large, PUB may exhaust  SAIL string
               space  trying  to  alphabetize  it.   The  error  message
               "STRING   SPACE    EXHAUSTED"   will   be    typed   out.
               Unfortunately, the only way  to get more string  space is
               to REEnter  the program and  go through the  ALLOC ritual
               (see  SAIL  manual  14-22).  The  original  allocation is
               presently 4000 words; try 7000 or 10000.

               To generate a simple index, use SEND statements such as:

.SEND INDEX ; $(
^CKeyword ^N.^Y {PAGE}
.)$ ;
               and the RECEIVE statement:
.RECEIVE "^C^N"

               The file generated will be quite funny-looking,  but will
               result in the document:

                                  7.10...

               Rather than all those hideous dots, it is  suggested that
               the number immediately follow or precede the word.

7.11 REQUIRE STATEMENT      

        Syntax:
REQUIRE <qc>|<v> SOURCE!FILE

               The  parameter  must  evaluate  to  a  file  name,  e.g.,
               "BRAIN.BAZ".  The file must be in manuscript  format.  It
               will  be  substituted  for  the  REQUIRE   statement  and
               compiled.  If the last line  of the file is a  text line,
               PUB will still be  scanning for text when it  resumes the
               original file, so don't put a semicolon after the REQUIRE
               statement -- put a CR.

               REQUIREd files may REQUIRE other files.  You will run out
               of channels if the number of open SOURCE!FILEs, generated
               files  (extension  ".PUG")  and  pass  one  output  files
               (extension ".PUI") exceeds 15.



7.12 SKIP STATEMENTS      

        Syntax:
[GROUP] SKIP [<se>]
SKIP TO LINE <e>
SKIP TO COLUMN <e>









               SKIP N breaks and  leaves N blank lines in  the document.
               If N is omitted, SKIP 1 is assumed.  Note that N  must be
               a  simple  expression  --  no  assignment  or conditional
               expression is allowed unless it is parenthesized.

               Blank lines that  would appear at  the top of  any column
                              7.11 - 7.12     if you want to  force them               are automatically suppressed;
               to appear (say, to leave space for a drawing),  use GROUP
               SKIP.
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 46


               If  you  are going  to  run off  the  same  document with
               different values of SPREAD (i.e., sometimes  single space
               and sometimes  double space), you  should write  all your
               SKIP  statements  with this  factor  taken  into account,
               e.g., SKIP 2*SPREAD-1 .

               SKIP  TO  LINE  N  outputs  blank  lines  up  to  but not
               including the N'th line (A-line) in the current column of
               output  text,  unless  the  N'th  line  has  already been
               passed, in  which case it  goes to the  N'th line  in the
               next column.  The most  common use  of this  statement is
               SKIP TO  LINE 1, which  assures you are  at the top  of a
               clean column.

               SKIP TO COLUMN N outputs blank lines until it reaches the
               top of the N'th column  of this or the next page.  If the
               compiler is already at  the top of the N'th  column, this
               statement does nothing.  The  most common use is  SKIP TO
               COLUMN 1, which goes to a new page unless a new  page has
               just been begun.   (To go to  a new page  regardless, use
               "NEXT PAGE" -- See Section 7.3).



7.13 PAGE FRAME STATEMENT       

        Syntax:
PAGE FRAME <e> HIGH <e> WIDE

               This statement causes  a break, goes  to a new  page, and
               sets up its size as specified (number of lines, number of
               characters).  No output can appear outside the bounds set
               by this statement.  Area declarations normally follow it.



7.14 BREAK STATEMENT      

        Syntax:
BREAK

               If  a paragraph  has been  started, BREAK  terminates it.
               Breaks are implicitly  caused by many other  commands and
               conditions.



7.15 CONTINUE STATEMENT      

                              7.13 - 7.15        Syntax:
CONTINUE

               Sometimes you would like to insert an  indented quotation
SAILON-70                     IMPERATIVES                        Page 47


               or equation in the middle of a paragraph of prose.  After
               the  quotation,  a   paragraph  break  is   necessary  to
               terminate it.
                    Unfortunately, the  break also causes  the next
                    output line to be  treated as a crown  line (in
                    FILL mode).  If  you would rather  continue the
                    interrupted paragraph than start a new one, use
                    the command CONTINUE.
               It  breaks,  but causes  the  next paragraph  to  have no
               crown, as long as no regular breaks intervene.



7.16 DEVICE STATEMENT      

        Syntax:
DEVICE  LPT|TTY

               This statement  is equivalent  to setting  the /L,  or /T
               switch when starting  up PUB.  It  has no effect  on Pass
               One  output.   However,  Pass Two  reacts  to  the switch
               setting as follows.

               DEVICE LPT and DEVICE TTY produce identical output unless
               the page frame  is higher than  53 lines.  In  that case,
               DEVICE  LPT uses  strange control  characters  instead of
               line feeds to inhibit page-ejection.  DEVICE  TTY assures
               that only line feeds are issued.

               Files produced under DEVICE TTY can be edited  with TECO.
               Hardly any  document file can  be edited with  SOS, which
               doesn't like CR's without LF's (used for  underlining and
               superimposing).



7.17 UNIMPLEMENTED STATEMENTS      


               The  following commands  have not  been  implemented, but
               ought to be, so their names are reserved words:

CASE statement -- SAIL-style
ALIGN statement -- it would align output to side-by-side areas
PACK statement -- it would align the bottoms of parallel columns
BOX FRAME STATEMENT -- to insert a table in a corner of the page
LOCK statement -- to protect lines from being moved by a BOX FRAME
SHOW statement -- to output to the console during compilation
NOPRINT mode -- would suppress output
                              7.16 - 7.17PRINT mode -- would renew output

                               SECTION 8

                                COMMENTS


               There are two ways to get comments into a command line --
               not in the middle of an identifier or constant, however.
        Syntax:
COMMENT anything but semicolon ;

               This one is probably familiar.  The other one is:
<<  anything but two greater-than-signs in a row  >>

               Comments may extend  over several command lines.   If you
               leave out  the terminator, you'll  lose everything  up to
               the next text line.

               Comments have no effect  on the document.  Why  would you
               want them?  Maybe you  could write English comments  on a
               French manuscript to help  you find your way  around.  Or
               maybe   you've   got   complicated   macros   that   need
               explanation.  Or you left out a bunch of text and want to
               leave a reminder in the manuscript.  Don't ask me  why --
               I just implemented them.

               To get  a comment  into a text  line, use  curly brackets
               around a regular comment {<< Like this >>}.  Continuation
               lines must be command lines.

                      LABELS AND CROSS-REFERENCES




9.1 CROSS-REFERENCES    


               A cross-reference is like computed text in that it causes
               characters to  be processed by  the text scanner,  and in
               that it  normally appears between  curly brackets  in the
               midst of a text line. First there will be an example, and
               then an explanation.
... invented by Owsley (See {"PAGE!" PURE}) ...

               This might produce output such as:
... invented by Owsley (See Page 3-7) ...

               The identifier PURE is called a label and must be defined
               once and  only once in  the manuscript, either  before or
               after the cross-reference.  Every label has a value, much
               like a variable, but the value is assigned only  once, at
               the place the label is defined.   Several cross-reference
               statements may reference the same label.  Labels  will be
               explained further in Section 9.2.

               There is a  major problem in  handling forward-references
               in a  text-justifier.  The justifier  must know  how many
               characters  there  will be  in  the value  before  it can
               decide where to  break off the  output line and  how many
               spaces to insert  during justification.  PUB  solves this
               problem by two slightly awkward hacks.  One hack  is that
               you must state or imply  an upper limit on the  number of
               characters, so it  can leave enough  room for it  and not
               break off the line too soon.  The other hack is  that PUB
               has two  passes.  In the  second pass, the  actual values
               are substituted, and only then are lines justified.

               To "state or imply" the upper limit, you have a choice of
               three forms of cross-reference.

Form 1:  [ <e> ] <label id>              
               Those are really  square brackets!!!!  Write them  in the
               manuscript, really!  The expression evaluates to a number
               which is the maximum number of characters, and  the value
               printed is the value of the label <label id>.  If this is
               a backward  reference (unless to  the current  page), the
                                  9.1    can say just:  {[] <label id>}.               number is ignored, so you
               You can't just say the label name.

Form 2:  <counter id>[!] <label id>
SAILON-70             LABELS AND CROSS-REFERENCES                Page 50


               Those square brackets mean  the "!" is optional  -- don't
               write them in the  manuscript!  This form means  that the
               value of the  label will be the  C-value (if there  is no
               "!")  or P-value  (if  there is  an "!")  of  the counter
               <counter  id>.   PUB  can  compute  the  upper  limit  at
               declaration time by looking  at the TO clause  unter, for
               both values of its parent, and for !, and  the expression
               is evaluated.

Form 3:  "<counter id>[!]" <label id>
               This is  identical to form  2, except before  sending the
               value  of the  label to  the text  scanner, it  sends the
               string  (without  the  "!")  and  a  space.    Thus,  the
               following are exactly equivalent:

... See Section {Section! X} ...
... See {"Section!" X} ...

               The macro used for cross-references in this manual was:
.MACRO YON(LBL) $( "Section " ; SUBSECTION! LBL )$

               which was called like this:
...lots of useless words (See {yon someplace}). Lots more ......



9.2 LABELS    


               The syntax of <label definition> and  <label definer> are
               defined (::=) as:
        Syntax:
<label definition> ::=  <label id> :  <label definer>
<label definer> ::=  [NEXT] <counter id>[!]   |  <e>  |  <text line>

               Here is an example of each kind of <label definer>:

.INTRO: NEXT SECTION

.LAPLACE: IF ODD PAGE THEN PAGE ELSE PAGE+1

.EXPLANATION:
This is the line that is labelled by the label "EXPLANATION".

               The first kind of definer makes the value of the label be
               the current C-value (if  there is no "!") or  P-value (if
               there  is  an "!")  of  the named  counter.   If  NEXT is
               present, the counter is stepped before the  assignment is
               made.  The second  kind makes the  value of the  label be
                                  9.2        The third kind makes  it be               the value of the expression.
               the  value of  PAGE! for  the page  that the  <text line>
               begins on.
SAILON-70             LABELS AND CROSS-REFERENCES                Page 51


               The  first  and  third  kinds  of  definer  both  cause a
               consistency check between all forward-references  to this
               label that mention a  counter name and the  counter named
               here.   The  second  kind does  not  cause  a consistency
               check.   CAUTION:   There  is  no  consistency  check  on
               backward-references.   There is  no check  when  a cross-
               reference specifies a P-value (or C-value) that the label
               definition also specifies a P-value (or C-value).   So if
               the output is  incorrect, check for  such inconsistencies
               yourself.

               A label must always be on a command line, or inside curly
               brackets on  a text line.  If the /D  switch was  used to
               obtain  debugging  information, then  the  label  will be
               printed on the right side of the document.

               There  is  a  slight ambiguity  if  your  <label definer>
               involves PAGE (or PAGE!).  If you use the first  or third
               kind  of definer,  the evaluation  is deferred  until the
               next text line is output, i.e., until the  next paragraph
               break or overflowed FILL line.  Thus, you may think  of a
               PAGE label as labelling the following text line;  even if
               a new page is begun before that line is output, the label
               value will be  the page on  which that line  appears.  On
               the other  hand, if  you use the  second kind  of definer
               (i.e., an expression involving PAGE or PAGE!),  the value
               used will be the current one at the time of evaluation --
               even if the following text line doesn't get  output until
               the next page.

               Note that  L:NEXT PAGE  will go  to a  new page  and then
               assign L a  value when the first  line is output  to that
               page.  If the page  is blank, the assignment  is deferred
               another page.  All this kludgery is to insure that if you
               say: See  {"Page" X}  there will  really be  something to
               see!  Be sure to position the label just before  the text                                                        
               line you want them to see.

                               RESPONSES




10.1 TEXT RESPONSES      


               A Text Response enables you to detect  certain conditions
               in the text,  and to call macro-like  subroutines without
               using {....}  Presently, four conditions can be responded
               to:

(1) Page Mark or Form Feed
(2) Blank Text Line
(3) Indented Text Line
(4) Presence of a one-to-five character signal

        Syntax:
AT <condition> [;] <template>

               When the condition is detected, the characters causing it
               are replaced by:
{ <template> }

               which is immediately executed.

               To dis-declare a response exit the block in which  it was
               declared, or use a null template:
AT <condition> [;] $()$

               The various <condition>s available are as follows:

               AT  PAGEMARK  responds to  an  SOS page  mark  or  a TECO                 
               <CR LF FF>.  A typical use is:
.AT PAGEMARK $(SKIP TO COLUMN 1)$

               AT  NULL  responds to  a  blank text  line.   There  is a                 
               predeclared response for this:
.AT NULL $(IF FILLING THEN BREAK ELSE SKIP 1)$

               This is the  only reason that  blank lines break  in FILL
               mode.  You can redeclare it to treat them  otherwise.  If
               you want them ignored, write:
.AT NULL $(IF NOT FILLING THEN SKIP 1 )$

               AT N, where N is  a positive integer N, responds  to each                
                                  10.1      N  spaces. For  example, the               text  line indented  exactly
               standard macro TABBREAK declares:
.AT 8 $( IF FILLING THEN BREAK ELSE "        " )$
SAILON-70                      RESPONSES                         Page 53


               AT  S,  where  S  is  a  string  beginning  with  a  non-                 
               alphanumeric  character,  responds to  the  occurrence of
               that  string   (up  to   5  characters   long)  appearing
               uninterrupted in a  text line.  This one  <condition> can
               be  followed by  a formal  parameter list  of up  to five
               arguments, e.g.:
.AT "%%" A "$" B "%" C "$"   $( SEND INDEX $( }A B-C{BREAK )$ )$

               Each parameter name is followed by a string  containing a
               single character called  its delimiter.  When  the signal                                            
               (in  the example,  %%)  is spotted  in a  text  line, the
               compiler  continues   to  scan  for   actual  parameters,
               terminating each scan  at the appropriate  delimiter.  An
               actual parameter  may span several  text lines,  but each
               carriage-return is converted to a space if  this happens.
               No parameters may be omitted.  None are evaluated -- they
               are all literal.



10.2 TRANSITION RESPONSES      


               A  transition response  permits the  specification  of an
               action to be taken at the beginning or end of any counter
               or at the opening or closing of any area.
        Syntax:
BEFORE|AFTER <counter id>|<area id> [;] <template>

               Here is  how this response  fits into the  NEXT <counter>
               algorithm.   To  execute NEXT SECTION,  PUB  performs six
               steps:

1) If SECTIONNULL then do AFTER SECTION response (if any)
2) Step SECTION using FROM and BY values
3) Compute SECTION! using PRINTING clause, and assign it to !
4) Do BEFORE SECTION response (if any)
5) For each sub-counter of SECTION, and each of their sub-counters:
         a) If C-valueNULL: AFTER sub-counter response (if any)
         b) Clear sub-counter C-value and P-value to NULL
         c) If it is PAGE, initialliize PAGE and PAGE!
6) Re-assign SECTION! to ! (steps 4 and 5 may have changed it)

               The END  of the  block in which  any counter  is declared
               (except PAGE) also causes Step 1 to occur.

               The most useful transition responses are BEFORE  PAGE and
               AFTER  PAGE.  The  BEFORE PAGE  template is  executed not
               immediately  after NEXT  PAGE is  executed, but  a little
                                  10.2     of output is ready to  be put               later, when the first line
               on  the  new  page.   BEFORE  <area  id>   responses  are
               similarly deferred  until the first  output is  ready for
               the named area. The AFTER PAGE template is  executed just
SAILON-70                      RESPONSES                         Page 54


               before the page is written out -- is had better not place
               into a text area that is already full!

               One transition responce is pre-declared for you:
BEFORE PAGE $( STANDARD TITLES )$

               STANDARD TITLES is  a pre-declared macro that  prints the
               headings and  footings set  up by  EVERY HEADING  and its
               friends.  You can of course redeclare this response.

               Every  transition  response template  is  automatically a
               block.  It  is surrounded by  BEGIN !?@3 ...  END !?@3 or
               something of that sort (which you will  occasionally spot
               in error messages).   It is usually necessary  to declare
               all the mode settings and formats you want to be in force
               inside the <template>.  Consider the case of BEFORE PAGE.
               At  the  time that  a  page happens  to  overflow,  it is
               entirely possible that the compiler is in the midst  of a
               FILL block with INDENT 10,20, all control characters off,
               and the NOFILL PREFACE  set to 2.  However,  the headings
               and  footings should  be  processed in  NOFILL  mode with
               preface 0, no indentation, and several control characters
               activated.  You might declare:

.BEFORE PAGE $( NOFILL ; INDENT 0  ; PREFACE 0 ; TURN ON "{_^Y"
.PLACE HEADING
{DATE}_AUTOMATIC VETERINARIAN^Y{SECTION!}

_{SUBTITLE!}
.PLACE FOOTING

.)$

                               FOOTNOTES


               Every column of every area has two portions, the calf and                                                                
               the foot.  During preparation of the calf, paragraphs can                   
               be sent to  the foot.  A  column is considered  full when
               the sum of the lines in the calf and the foot exceeds the
               height of the area.

               You can not declare Portion FOOT nor do a RECEIVE for it.
               The compiler automatically declares a FOOT for  each area
               you declare, and does a RECEIVE for it after each line is
               placed in  the calf.  Your  only foothold is  the command
               "SEND FOOT".

               Example:

.COUNT FOOTNOTE INLINE IN PAGE PRINTING "(i)"
.AT "$$" ENTRY "*" $( NEXT FOOTNOTE ; ! ;
.SEND FOOT $( TURN ON "{" PREFACE 1 SPREAD_1 INDENT 0,0
{!} ENTRY
.BREAK )$ )$

                         *
               An example  of the use of the "$$" signal response is:

...have been shown $$Abelwitz has obtained
similar results in his experiments with
hippopotami.*.
               which will print in the calf:
...have been shown (iv).

               and in the foot:

(iv) Abelwitz has obtained similar results
in his  experiments with hippopotami.

               There  is  an  implicit  BEGIN  FILL  ;  ...  END  around
               footnotes.

               At  the beginning  of each  section, it  is  customary to
               perform the following ritual:

<<1>> Begin a fresh page
<<2>> Count up the section number
<<3>> Print the section number and name
<<4>> Skip a few lines
<<5>> Send the section number, name, and page number to the CONTENTS

               See  the document  PUBMAC.TES  for a  description  of the
               macros  STANDARD FRONT  and STANDARD  BACK, which  do all
               these things  for you.   If you want  to define  your own
               macros, read on.

               A macro to perform all the steps listed above <<commented
               for reference>> is:

.MACRO SEC(NAME)
.<<1>> NEXT PAGE
.<<2>> NEXT SECTION
.<<3>> ONCE CENTER
^A^XSECTION {!}^X^A -- ^A^XNAME^X^A
.<<4>> SKIP 3
.<<5>> SEND CONTENTS $(
{!}\\NAME^Y{PAGE!}{)$)$

               A sample call on this macro is:
.SEC SPECIAL FEATURES

               At the beginning of each subsection, a similar  macro can
               be called.  The one below prints the subsection name on a
               line by  itself but prints  the subsection number  at the
               beginning of the first line of the first paragraph of the
               subsection. It makes sure that there are enough lines for
               all this to be contiguous; if not, it first goes to a new
               page.  Finally,  it allows  the macro  call to  specify a
               label to be used in cross-references to this subsection.

               include a colon at the end:
.SS MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES,MISC:

               which would  define the label  MISC and  output something
               like this:

A.3 ONE-LEVEL INDEXES     

               There  is  presently  no way  to  have  a  phrase indexed
               automatically  every time  it occurs.   PUB  now requires
               that  you  mark  each  phrase  to  be  indexed  at  every
               occurrence  that  you  wish  to  be  referenced.   The AT
               <signal characters>  response is particularly  useful for
               this purpose.

               Choose  a character  or a  pair of  characters  that will
               never appear in the text of your manuscript;  for example
               "%<".  This will be  your signal that the next  phrase is
               to be indexed.  Then  choose a character that  will never
               appear in such a phrase; for example, ">".  This  will be
               your end-of-phrase delimiter.  Suppose you would like the
               phrase  "Simple  variables"  to  be  indexed.   Find each
               occurence of this phrase in your manuscript  and surround
               it by your chosen characters:

Nothing warms the heart like %<simple variables>. We

               Your favorite  text editor  may be of  some help  in this
               task;  however, watch  out for  a phrase  that  is broken
               across two lines:  the editor will miss it if your search
               string is too stringent.

               Suppose you would like your index to look  something like
               this:

signed constants  8.0
significant digits  10.3, 10.7
signs  2.4, 3.7
simple variables  8.1, 20.8, 20.11

               Now you  need to declare  a signal response  (see Section
               10.1) at the beginning of your manuscript:
                                  A.3
.AT "%<" PHRASE ">" $( }PHRASE{
.SEND INDEX $( }$<PHRASE>{PAGE!}${)$)$
SAILON-70            THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED EXAMPLES               Page 60


               This will respond to  each occurrence in the text  of the
               signal "%<".  The characters that follow this  signal, up
               to but not including the next ">", will be substituted in
               the body of the template for every occurrence of the word
               PHRASE.  Then the body of the template will be surrounded
               by  "{...}"  and  embedded  in  the  text,  replacing all
               characters from and including "%<" to and  including ">".
               The effect in the example above would be:

Nothing warms the heart like { }simple variables{
.SEND INDEX $( }$<simple variables>{PAGE!}${)$}. We

               SEND causes  the current PAGE!  to be substituted  in the
               SEND  template.   Thus,   the  characters  sent   to  the
               generated file will be:

} $<simple variables>2.6${

               In the generated file,  each index entry is  signalled by
               the character pair "$<", followed by the phrase, followed
               by ">", followed by the page number and "$".  You  may of
               course  choose  your   own  delimiters.   They   will  be
               recognized by the following signal response  that appears
               in PORTION INDEX:

.PORTION INDEX
.NOFILL
.LETTER _ PHR _ NULL
.AT "$<" PHRASE ">" PGNO "$" $(
.IF "PHRASE" = PHR THEN START ,#PGNO{ END
.ELSE   START COMMENT NEW PHRASE, GO TO A NEW LINE ;
.       IF ^LETTER = ^"PHRASE"[1] THEN BREAK
.                               ELSE SKIP 1 ;
PHRASE##PGNO{
.       PHR _ "PHRASE" ; LETTER _ "PHRASE"[1] ;
.       END )$ ; COMMENT END SIGNAL RESPONSE ;
.RECEIVE "<>" ; COMMENT ALPHABETIZE BEFORE READING ;

               RECEIVE will  alphabetize the  entries.  The  "AT" signal
               response will  analyze each  entry and  make a  couple of
               checks before outputting it:

               (!) If the phrase is the same as the one just printed, it
               simply appends the  page number of  the new entry  to the
               last line printed. For example, if the  alphabetized file
               contained:
...}$<signs>2.4${}$<signs>3.7${...

               then the index would include:
                                  A.3Signs  2.4, 3.7

               (2) Else, if  the first letter  of this and  the previous
               phrase are the same, it  goes to the next line;  else, it
SAILON-70            THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED EXAMPLES               Page 61


               skips a line.   Thus, between the  A's (and a's)  and the
               B's  (and b's)  there  will be  a blank  line.   Then, it
               prints both the phrase and the page number.



A.4 TWO-LEVEL INDEXES     

               A "two-level index" divides some phrases into  two parts:
               a "generic" part and a "specific" part, e.g.:

compilers,
        Algol  13, 15
        Fortran  18
        LISP  22
        SAIL  15
computers,
        analog  29
        digital  10, 64, 80
consoles  16, 25

               In  the  phrase  "Fortran  compilers",  "Fortran"  is the
               specific part and "compilers" is the generic part.

               This  time  we  will  approach  the  problem analytically
               instead  of  synthetically.   There  are  two   kinds  of
               entries: one part and two part   If two entries  have the
               same generic part  (e.g., "computers"), then  the generic
               part should print only once.

               As PORTION INDEX receives each entry, it must  compare it
               with the preceding entry.   Say that the generic  part of
               the preceding  entry was WASL  and the specific  part was
               WASR (WASL was thus printed  on the Left and WASR  on the
               Right).  The generic part  of the current entry is  L and
               the specific part is R.   If WASL and L are  different, a
               whole new generic entry is to be printed.   Otherwise, if
               WASR and R are different,  a new specific entry is  to be
               printed.  Otherwise, a new page number is to be  added to
               the last entry printed.

               As an extra feature in this index, we will not  print the
               same page number twice on the same line, i.e., twice in a
               row.  Thus, an additional variable, WASP, will  be needed
               to remember the page number last printed.

               Furthermore,  if  the  entry has  no  specific  part (see
               "consoles" in the  above example), the page  numbers will
               be printed on the same line as the generic part.
                                  A.4
               The PORTION INDEX that follows assumes that the generated
               file has entries of the form:
"<" generic-part "/" specific-part ">" page-number "%"
SAILON-70            THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED EXAMPLES               Page 62


               where the specific-part can be empty.

.PORTION INDEX
.WASL _ WASR _ WASP _ NULL ;
.NOFILL ; TABS 6 ;
.AT "<" L "/" R ">" PGNO "%" $(
.       IF ^WASL[1] NEQ ^"L"[1] THEN SKIP 1; <<1st letter different>>
.       IF WASL NEQ "L" THEN
.               START "NEW GENERIC"  BREAK ;
L{IF "R" NEQ NULL THEN START "WITH SPECIFIC PART"
\R##{              END   "WITH SPECIFIC PART" ; }PGNO{
.               END "NEW GENERIC"
.       ELSE IF WASR NEQ "R" THEN
.               START "NEW SPECIFIC"  BREAK ;
\R##PGNO{       END   "NEW SPECIFIC"
.       ELSE IF WASP NEQ "PGNO" THEN START },PGNO{ END
.   )$ ;
.RECEIVE "<>" ;

               To create the generated file for PORTION INDEX requires a
               signal response such as:

.AT "%<" SPECIFIC "/" GENERIC ">" $(
.       IF "SPECIFIC" NEQ NULL THEN START }SPECIFIC { END ;
.       }GENERIC{ ;  comment print SPECIFIC and GENERIC in the text ;
.       SEND INDEX $( }<GENERIC/SPECIFIC>{PAGE!}%{)$ ;
.    )$ ;

               Every phrase to be sent to the index should  be bracketed
               as follows where it appears in the manuscript:

that there are more %<Algol/compilers> than Algol users ...
the world's leading expert on %</consoles>.
