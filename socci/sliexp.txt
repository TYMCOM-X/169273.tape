DELAY OF 1 SEC AFTER MASTER SENDS MESSAGE AND BEFORE MASTER SENDS
	YELLOW BALL CAUSES SLAVE TO GET MESSAGES ONLY EVERY 14 SECS.
TAKING OUT ENABLING FOR YELLOW BALL INTERRUPT IN SLAVE SOMETIMES
	BUT NOT ALWAYS ELIMINATED THE DELAY. ON ONE RUN, NO DELAY
	ELIMINATION HAPPENED. ON ANOTHER, THE DELAY ONLY HAPPENED
	A FEW TIMES.
SLAVE ENABLING FOR YELLOW BALL BUT NOT TURNING ON INTERRUPT CHANNEL
	STILL MAKES THE 14 SEC DELAY HAPPEN EVERY TIME.
