************

28 Jul 80	28		Debug executive XCT problems
25 Aug 80	40		New DMA tape control board installation with
				new microcode supplied by Foonly, write
				block I/O microcode
22 Sep 80	32		Block I/O microcode debug

************

20 Oct 80	24		Block I/O microcode debug with John Goltz
				Microcode merge with Foonly version, done
				by hand.
27 Oct 80	16		Continue microcode merge - merge pass 1
				complete, but didn't assemble.

************

19 Jan 81	32		Finish microcode merge started  20 Oct 80,
				get it to assemble and run
2 Feb 81	16		Debug arithmetic overflow, misc. changes
				(JRSTF with user IOT problem, unused opcodes)
9 Feb 81	8		Arithmetic overflow debug
16 Feb 81	32		Discover need to fake overflow bit - code
				and debug.
23 Feb 81	36		Write trap test diagnostic, chase problems
				discovered by diagnostic. Discovered bugs
				in original trap instruction design.
				Examine/deposit in physical space change.
1 Mar 81	32		Fix problems in overflow trapping, find
				and fix bug which smashed A-MEM[0] for switch
				device which caused use of switches while
				system was up to hang machine.
9 Mar 81	40		Try to make long records work by increasing
				microcode timeout - unsuccessful. Start
				writing ADJBP.
16 Mar 81	32		Debug ADJBP, fix another overflow trap bug.
23 Mar 81	8		Write and test DADD, DSUB.
30 Mar 81	8		Initial meeting with Poole for interrupt tape
				microcode project, begin writing interrupting
				tape microcode.
6 Apr 81	32		Finish writing tape interrupt code.
				Debug non-interrupt forms of instructions.
				Debug interrupt forms of instructions.
13 Apr 81	24		Find the "missing $" problem.

Total		507		At the end of week of 27 Apr 81.

All known microcode which is to be written at Tymshare has now been
written. Tasks still remaining which will be charged to Foonly are
whatever services are necessary from me to integrate this microcode
back into Foonly's main version, and some small debugging time
needed to make sure microcode will assemble and run with the
extended microcode option (will probably be a couple of bugs).

I am also having a problem starting up disk transfers in time
to allow full transfer speed due in part to the fact that our PI
cycle is somewhat longer than the KA style one, and maybe some
other reasons. If this requires a microcode solution, we may
decide that this is also a part of microcode work we charge to
Foonly.
