     PURPOSE:   This  is  the  compiler  initialization  module.   It
        creates  the  initial  (builtin) symbol table and initializes
        the global variables (which are located in PASDAT).  This in-
        formation  is  then  saved  in a file  TargetMachinePREFIX ||
        'ENV.INI' which is  loaded on  initial execution of  the com-
        piler.
     
     ENTRY POINTS:
     
        pasini      This is a mainline program.  When run the  symbol
                    table image file is created.  The program returns
                    to   monitor   command   level    without    user
                    interaction.
