     PURPOSE:  This routine extracts a file name from a text line.
     
     USAGE:
     
        EXTERNAL FUNCTION CMD_FILE_NAME
              ( LINE: PACKED ARRAY [1..*] OF CHAR;
                VAR CURSOR: INTEGER;
                NAME_REQUIRED: BOOLEAN;
                VAR NAME: STRING [*] ): BOOLEAN;
     
     INPUT:
     
        LINE        is any text string.
     
        CURSOR      is the index of a character in the text string.
     
        NAME_REQUIRED
                    is TRUE if  a  complete  file  name  is  required
                    (i.e.,  a  string  which uniquely identifies some
                    file),  and  FALSE  if  any  file  name  fragment
                    (including  the empty string) is acceptable.  For
                    example, on the DEC-10,  the  string  "[245,542]"
                    would  be  acceptable if NAME_REQUIRED was FALSE,
                    but not if it was TRUE.
     
     OUTPUT:
     
        <return value>
                    is TRUE if a file  name  or  file  name  fragment
                    (depending  on  NAME_REQUIRED)  can  be extracted
                    from LINE,  starting  with  the  first  non-blank
                    character   (if   any)   following   CURSOR.   If
                    NAME_REQUIRED is false, CMD_FILE_NAME will always
                    return TRUE unless there is a malformed file name
                    fragment (e.g., "[234/"), since the empty  string
                    is  a  valid  file  name  fragment,  and  can  be
                    extracted from any text string.
     
        NAME        is unchanged if CMD_FILE_NAME returns  false.  If
                    it   returns  TRUE,  then  NAME  is  set  to  the
                    recognized file name or fragment.
     
        CURSOR      is advanced to the next non-blank  character.  If
                    CMD_FILE_NAME  returns  TRUE, then it is advanced
                    to the character following the NAME string.
     
     REQUIREMENTS:  CURSOR must be greater than zero.
     
     NOTES:   The  particular  file   name   syntax   recognized   by
        CMD_FILE_NAME   will  vary,  depending  on  the  machine  and
        operating system that it is implemented on.
