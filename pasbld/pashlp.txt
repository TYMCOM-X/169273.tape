          TYM-Pascal, HELP!

          1) This is how to get to the compiler and documentation:
            On systems 26 and 55: RUN (PASNEW)PASCAL
            The compiler may exist in other directories and
	    on other systems.  It will probably be under the
	    name of "NEWPAS".  This will all become standardized
	    soon, to a single program name in a single directory
	    on every system where TYM-Pascal is supported.
	    All documentation is currently in (PASNEW) on sys 55.

          2) There is no (INPUT, OUTPUT) on the PROGRAM line in
	    this Pascal.  Use the following routine to access
	    the terminal.

            PROCEDURE setuptty;
            (*set up standard input and output to be terminal*)
            BEGIN
              OPEN(TTY);
              REWRITE(TTYOUTPUT);
              INPUT := TTY;
              OUTPUT := TTYOUTPUT
            END;

          3) Line oriented input is different for files or
	    terminals.  Use the following routine for consistant
	    line input.

            PROCEDURE read_line(VAR source: TEXT; VAR line: STRING[*]);
            (*read a line from the source, file or terminal*)
            BEGIN
              IF source = TTY THEN BEGIN (*read from terminal*)
                BREAK(TTYOUTPUT); (*flush out any prompt string*)
                READLN(source);
                READ(source, line)
              END
              ELSE BEGIN (*read from file*)
                READ(source, line);
                READLN(source)
              END
            END;
  
          4) The Language Refrence Manual describes the language
	    and its features.  (PASNEW)PASREF.TXT

          5) The TYM-Pascal User Guide describes how to use the
	    compiler.  (PASNEW)PASGDE.TXT

          6) The Debug Manual describes the TYM-Pascal Debugger.
	    (PASNEW)DEBMAN.TXT

          7) The Overlay Manual describes overlays.
	    (PASNEW)OVLMAN.TXT

          8) TYM-Pascal is being maintained by Zon Williamson.
	    Mail to (ZONNIE) on sys 55 or call  446 6696.

          9) There are some bugs with compile-time errors.
