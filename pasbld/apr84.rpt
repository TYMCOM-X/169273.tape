     TYM-Pascal Status Report, April, 1984

     The  TYM-Pascal  product  is  currently  available  for
internal  usage.  It is reliable in the sense that it can
correctly compile itself.

     In addition to the compiler, several other utility programs
have been brought back to life.  I am keeping them in with the
compiler sources so that they will all stay compatable as the
utility library changes.  The list of programs is:
PAS -- the compiler (with code generators for PDP-10, VAX and M68000)
OVL -- overlay manager
FMT -- a pascal source file formatter
SRC -- a source file database (to be connected with BLD maybe)
BLD -- program builder (combines PAS and the system linker)
EDT -- a text editor (from QED)
TXT -- a text processor (from SCRIBE)
MAC -- a macro processor (from PMF)
DOC -- a document processor (combines MAC and TXT)
HLP -- a help file processor
LOG -- usage log file analyzer
VER -- DEC standard version number manipulator
UTLLIB -- utility library

     Not all of the machine dependencies have been removed yet.
All of the changes have been planned and composed.  They are now
being incorporated into the compiler one by one.

     Some simplification has been done already and several modules
have been removed from the compiler structure.

     The Language Reference Manual and Compiler  User  Guide
both  need  to  be  re-worked to include the latest compiler
features and to fix known inconsistancies in the  tables  of
contents  and  indexes.   This  should  take about a week to
complete.  Still in the queue.  Depends on success in getting 
the document processor on-line.

     The QA  testing  system  is  very  unorganized  at  the
moment.   There  are  many test routines available, but they
have to be connected into a  workable  procedure.   Allocate
two weeks for this.  Still in the queue.

     A new project has come about to gather documentation on
the various other PASCAL compilers around TYMSHARE.  This is
to enable the "Pascal Department" to  become more able to 
respond to user's problems and questions in general.
