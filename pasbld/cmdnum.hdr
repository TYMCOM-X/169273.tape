     PURPOSE:  This routine scans a string of digits in a text  line,
        returning the numeric value that they represent.
     
     USAGE:
     
        EXTERNAL FUNCTION CMD_NUMBER
              ( LINE: PACKED ARRAY [1..*] OF CHAR;
                VAR CURSOR: INTEGER;
                NEG_OK: BOOLEAN;
                VAR NUMBER: INTEGER ): BOOLEAN;
     
     INPUT:
     
        LINE        is any text string.
     
        CURSOR      is the index of any character in the text string.
     
        NEG_OK      is true if a negative number (preceded by "-") is
                    acceptable.
     
     OUTPUT:
     
        <return value>
                    is TRUE if the next non-blank character in  LINE,
                    starting from CURSOR, is the first character of a
                    string which can be converted to an  integer.  It
                    is false otherwise.
     
        NUMBER      is  unchanged if CMD_NUMBER returns FALSE.  If it
                    returns TRUE, then NUMBER is  the  numeric  value
                    represented by the digit string from LINE.
     
        CURSOR      is  advanced to the next non-blank character.  If
                    CMD_NUMBER returns TRUE, then it is  advanced  to
                    the character following the digit string.
     
     REQUIREMENTS:  CURSOR must be greater than zero.
     
     INCLUDE FILES REQUIRED:
