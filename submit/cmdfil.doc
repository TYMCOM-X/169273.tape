      NOTE:  This is a preliminary draft of the Reference Manual  for  the
      Job  Processor  system's  Exec language.  This Exec language and the
      Job Processor system are in development continually  changing.   The
      manual  is  also  changing  as  the  Exec  is  developed  and as the
      documentation for the system develops.

      Please  check  the  documentation  files   regularly   during   this
      developmental   time.   Updates  to  the  documentation  will  occur
      frequently, reflecting new  developments  in  the  system  and  more
      clearly  explaining  the  Job  Processor  system's  and  the  Exec's
      features.  Checking the documentation files for new  information  is
      the quickest and surest way to get this information.

  1.0  INTRODUCTION



  1.1  Overview


  The TYMCOM-X Job Processing  System  replaces  the  TYMCOM-IX  and  TYMCOM-X
  products PERP, DEFER, PCOM and COM.  The purpose is to provide a system that
  will process command files both instantaneously and repetitively on and  for
  a single PDP-10 host computer.

  The Exec language for the Job Processor system uses many of the commands and
  formats  used in PERP's Exec to allow users to migrate PERP command files to
  the system with little modification to their PERP command  files.   However,
  PERP  command files are not guaranteed to run under the Job Processor system
  without change.

INTRODUCTION


  1.2  Notational Conventions And Definitions


  A.  Square brackets "[" and "]" are used to enclose  optional  items  or  an
      optional  syntax.  The brackets are not part of the actual Job Processor
      syntax.


  B.  Angle brackets "<" and ">" are used to enclose the names  of  conceptual
      ideas and entities.  These names are given in the examples to illustrate
      the class of information entered.  These brackets are not  part  of  the
      Job Processor syntax.

      There are two exceptions to the angle bracket notation as follows:

      1.  <cr> means "carriage return".  This is an actual  character  on  the
          terminal  keyboard,  as  opposed to a conceptual idea or entity.  On
          various keyboards this key is labeled RETURN, CR, ENTER  or  NEWLINE
          depending   on   the   standards   set   by  the  specific  terminal
          manufacturer.  The octal representation of this key is '015.

      2.  <esc> means  "escape"  or  "attention".   This  is  also  an  actual
          keyboard  character.   On  various keyboards this key will be labled
          ALTMODE, ALT, ESC, META or PREFIX.  The octal representation of this
          key is '033.




  C.  In the examples computer output is shown in upper case and user input is
      shown in lower case wherever possible.


  D.  PDP10 mode is used in all examples  instead  of  XEXEC  or  TYMEX  mode.
      PDP10  mode is the preferred mode for TYMCOM-X since the majority of the
      PDP-10 software follows the PDP10 command conventions.  XEXEC  or  TYMEX
      mode simulates the TYMCOM-IX exec commands on the PDP-10.  


  E.  In the examples used lines preceeded immediately by  a  period  (.)  are
      commands  typed to the monitor.  See the section on prefix characters in
      EXEC.DOC for more detailed information.


  F.  In the examples below lines preceeded by an asterisk (*) or  equal  sign
      (=) are data lines to be read by the program being run.  See the section
      on prefix characters in EXEC.DOC for more detailed information.


  G.  In the examples below reference to a  <file  spec>  means  a  file  name
      optionally  followed  by  a  file extension and optionally preceded by a
      user or directory name in parentheses.

THE COMMAND FILE


  2.0  THE COMMAND FILE

  2.1  Getting Started

  To run a job as though it were being run from a terminal the user must first
  create  a  command file.  This is a file which contains all the input to the
  job stream that the user would normally enter from a terminal.  The file  is
  a  normal  text  file  which  may be created using any text editor available
  (EDITOR, TECO, PEAK, VUE, etc.) or by any program which writes  normal  text
  (for example, output from a Tymshare-BASIC or FORTRAN program).  The command
  file may contain monitor commands, input to programs and various commands to
  the Job Processor itself.

  The Job Processor currently  has  a  temporary  restriction:   it  currently
  ignores  any  initialization  program  that the user has set up with NONAME.
  The Job Processor  sessions  may  run  differently  than  the  user's  usual
  interactive  session  if  the  user  has an initialization program.  The Job
  Processor sessions can be made to resemble the user's sessions by  including
  the following command as the first line of the command file:

      .INITIALIZE

  This will cause the user's initialization program to be run.


  A sample command file follows.  If the terminal session includes:
      .run progrm
      REPORTING PERIOD: daily
      SEPARATE DIVISIONS: yes
      SELECTION CRITERIA: collect all
      OUTPUT FILE NAME: report.lst

  the following would be included in the Job Processor
      command file:

      .run progrm
      *daily
      *yes
      *collect all
      *report.lst


  The lines in the command file are sent to the job one at a time.   To  avoid
  problems  with  type ahead, each line is sent only when the job is ready for
  input.  This resembles a user waiting until the terminal a prompts for input
  before entering a line of input.

  To instruct the system to execute the commands in an existing  command  file
  the  user  enters  the  SUBMIT  command at the monitor prompt.  (See the Job
  Processor Reference Manual (*6NEWS)SUBMIT.DOC.)

THE COMMAND FILE


  2.2  Command File Format

  A.  Line Prefix Characters

      In TYMCOM-IX PERP and TYMCOM-X PCOM command  files,  all  lines  in  the
      command  file  which  begin with the colon (:) character are commands to
      PERP or PCOM.  All other lines  are  sent  to  the  host  system  to  be
      processed  as  part of the users job.  The TYMCOM-X Job Processor System
      provides an extension to this convention by  providing  the  ability  to
      specify  the type of data for each line in the command file and how that
      data should be processed.  For example, a command line (such as  "EXIT")
      meant for the user's program could abort the job if sent to the monitor.
      For this reason, the first character of the line is  used  to  determine
      what to do with the line.


      1.  Colon (:) - to the TYMCOM-X Job Processor only.

          All lines  beginning  with  a  colon  are  interpreted  by  the  Job
          Processor.   These commands are never sent to the job stream.  Thus,
          they are never seen by the monitor or the user's program.  They tell
          the  Job  Processor  what to do with the following command lines and
          modify job parameters which control various options available to the
          user.


      2.  Period (.) - to the monitor only.

          Lines beginning with a period are commands to the  monitor  and  are
          only  sent  to  the job stream when the user is waiting for input at
          monitor level.  If a user's program is running,  the  Job  Processor
          waits until the program will accept input and it then interrupts the
          program.  This forces the job stream to monitor level as  though  an
          :ESCAPE  command  had  been  sent.  The Job Processor then sends the
          command line to the job stream.


      3.  Asterisk (*) - to a user's program only.

          Lines beginning with an asterisk are sent to  the  job  stream  only
          when the user's program is waiting for input.  If the line cannot be
          sent to the job stream because the job is in monitor mode  the  line
          is discarded and the next line of the command file is processed.


      4.  Equal sign (=) - to a user's program only.

          Lines beginning with an equal sign are sent to the job  stream  only
          when  the  user's  program  is  waiting  for input.  These lines are
          treated the same as lines which begin with an asterisk  except  that
          the  carriage  return  at the end of the line is not sent to the job
          stream.  This can  be  very  valuable  for  running  programs  which
          require  input  without  the  ending carriage return.  (For example,
          TECO or DDT).
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                March 10, 1987            Page 6
THE COMMAND FILE


      5.  No prefix character.

          If no prefix character is specified, the entire line will be sent to
          the  job  stream as soon as the stream is ready for input.  The line
          may be read by the user's  program  if  it  is  running  or  by  the
          monitor.


      6.  Prefix characters as data to a user program.

          To send a line of data beginning with one of the  designated  prefix
          characters,  the  line  must  simply be prefixed with an asterisk or
          equal sign.

              Example:                    (sent to program)
                  *..TEXT..                   ..TEXT..<cr>
                  *=FOO                       =FOO<cr>
                  =HELP=1                     HELP=1             (no <cr>
              sent)
                  **.DOC                      *.DOC<cr>




      Summary:

      The following is generally true and can be helpful in  remembering  when
      these  prefixes are used:  A colon prefix is used where it would be used
      in a TYMCOM-IX PERP or TYMCOM-X PCOM  command  file.   A  period  prefix
      would  be  used  where a period prompt should appear in the log file (in
      PDP10 mode).  An asterisk prefix would be used where  a  normal  program
      prompt  should  appear  (which  is  actually an asterisk in some utility
      programs).  The equal sign is used for program input when  the  carriage
      return is to be omitted.

THE COMMAND FILE


  B.  Commands

      Commands to the Job Processor which are imbedded  in  the  command  file
      employ   the  colon  (:) line  prefix  character.   These  commands  are
      generally similar to those available in the TYMCOM-IX  PERP  system  and
      have  the  same  format.   Any control file command word which apears in
      upper case in the following list may be abbreviated to its  first  three
      characters unless indicated otherwise.


      1.  :BACKTO <label>

          Jump back to <label> in processing of command file.  The label  must
          be  in the command file before the occurrence of this command and in
          the proper format for  this  jump  to  occur.   Otherwise  an  error
          occurs.  

          The minimum abbreviation for the word "BACKTO" is "BACK".


      2.  :COM <file> ["<param val1>" ["<param val2>" [... "<param valN>"]]]

          Begin taking commands from the named command file.  The called  file
          is  a  standard  Job  Processor  command file.  Command files may be
          nested approximately 5 deep with this command.

          The optional syntax  includes  specifying  parameter  values  to  be
          passed  to  the called file on the same line after the filename.  To
          the called file this resembles the way parameter values  are  passed
          to  the  first  command file when the parameter values are declared;
          when the job is inserted while SUBMIT is being run.  (See discussion
          of Parameters below and in SUBMIT.DOC.)

          If parameter values are included in the command line each  parameter
          value  must  be  delimited  by  quotation  marks.   Single or double
          quotation marks are acceptable;  however, the same character must be
          used as both the opening and closing delimiter for each value.

          When a command file calls another  command  file  a  parameter  name
          delimiter  currently  declared in the calling command file file (see
          the $DELIMITER Keyword) is passed down to the  called  (subordinate)
          command  file.   However  a  parameter  name delimiter declared in a
          called (subordinate) command file  is  overridden  by  the  previous
          delimiter  set  in  the  caller  when  the  called file is completed
          processing.


      3.  :DEFINE <par1>="<val1>"[ <par2>="<val2>"[ ... <parN>="<valN>"]]

          Assign value <val#> to parameter-variable <par#>.  This  command  is
          identical  to  :<par>=<val> below which is included to be compatible
          with TYMCOM-IX PERP.

          NOTE:  Both forms of this command allow multiple assignments.   Each
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                March 10, 1987            Page 8
THE COMMAND FILE


          parameter  value  must  be  delimited by quotation marks.  Single or
          double quotation marks are acceptable;  however the  same  character
          must  be  used  as  both  the opening and closing delimiter for each
          value.  A comma is acceptable after a value to separate elements  of
          the list.


      4.  :ESCAPE

          Interrupt the currently executing program when it is next ready  for
          input  forcing  the job stream to monitor level.  This is similar to
          the user entering a user interrupt while the program is waiting  for
          input.   (A "user interrupt" is a control-C when in PDP10 mode or an
          <ESC> when in XEXEC mode.)


      5.  :GOTO <label>

          Jump forward to <label> in processing of command  file.   The  label
          must be in the command file after the occurrence of this command and
          in the proper format for this jump to  occur.   Otherwise  an  error
          occurs.

          The word "GOTO" may be abbreviated to "GO"  for  compatability  with
          PERP.


      6.  :PARAMETERS [<nam1>[="<val1>"][, ..., <namN>[="<valN>"]]]

          Turn on parameter substitution  and  optionally  declare  each  name
          <nam#>  included as the name of a parameter to mark the place in the
          command file for substitution  of  the  value  associated  with  the
          parameter  name.   Optionally define a default value <val#> for each
          parameter name.

          The command :PARAMETERS without any parameter names or values  turns
          on  parameter  substitution.   This  is  needed  when using only the
          predefined Keyword parameters in the command file.

          NOTE:  Each parameter value must be delimited  by  quotation  marks.
          Single  or  double quotation marks are acceptable;  however the same
          character must be used as both the opening and closing delimiter for
          each  value.   A  comma  is  acceptable  after  a  value to separate
          elements of the list.


      7.  :QUIT

          Cause normal termination of the running job.


      8.  :REMARK

          This line is a comment to the TYMCOM-X Job Processor.  It causes  no
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                March 10, 1987            Page 9
THE COMMAND FILE


          action to be taken.  However it is printed in the log file if one is
          created.  


      9.  :REVIVE

          Re-enable output to the user's specified log file (if a log file has
          been provided for).  (See :SILENCE.  Also see Keyword $LOGGING.)


     10.  :SEND CHARACTER <nnn>

          Transmit the character represented by  the  octal  (base  8)  number
          <nnn>.


     11.  :SEND FILE <file>

          Transmit the contents of <file>.  Line-feed  characters  immediately
          following  a  carriage-return  are  removed so that input to the job
          stream from the file resembles terminal  input.   However  no  other
          data interpretation occurs.


     12.  :SEND STRING "<text>"

          Transmit the literal string "<text>" without any carriage-return  or
          line-feed  following  the  string.   The  string  of  text  must  be
          surrounded by double quote marks.


     13.  :SILENCE

          If a log file is provided stop  sending  output  to  the  log  file.
          (Same as $LOGGING=0) Logging is resumed with :REVIVE or $LOGGING=1.


     14.  :STOP

          The same as :QUIT.  Causes normal termination of a running job.


     15.  :TIMELIMIT <n>

          Changes the job's run time limit to <n> minutes.  The  dt  time
          limit  for job execution is 60 minutes.  Changing the run time limit
          with this command within the command file will not change  the  time
          limit  known by the Job Processor prior to the actual running of the
          job.  Providing the Job Processor with a fairly accurate estimate of
          the  time  required  for  the  job's execution can enhance the job's
          reliability so specifying the timelimit as an option when  inserting
          the job while running SUBMIT is greatly preferred.

THE COMMAND FILE


     16.  :TRULIMIT <n>

          Changes the job's TRU limit to <n> TRUs.  The default is  no  limit.
          When  the  limit of TRUs is reached the job is stopped.  This can be
          very useful for stopping a program error from causing the program to
          run up many more TRUs than expected.


     17.  :<par1>="<val1>" [,<par2>="<val2>"[, ..., <parN>="<valN>"]]

          Assigns value <val#> to parameter <par#>.  Each parameter value must
          be  delimited  by quotation marks.  Single or double quotation marks
          are acceptable;  however the same character must be used as both the
          opening and closing delimiter for each value.  A comma is acceptable
          after a value to separate elements of the list.


     18.  <label>::[<command file line>]

          Defines a label in the command file.   The  label  is  used  as  the
          object  of  a  command  file :GOTO statement the object of a command
          file :BACKTO statement or the location in the file for  the  job  to
          restart.    The  last  applies  if  the  options  RESTART LABEL  and
          LABEL <label> are specified in the INSERT command in SUBMIT when the
          job   is   being   entered  into  the  Job  Processor's  queue  (See
          SUBMIT.DOC).  

          A label in this format may precede any line that would be  legal  in
          the  command  file.   The included line must begin immediately after
          the double colon which ends the label.  Any blanks between the label
          and  the  included  line  are  sent  to  the job stream as the first
          characters of the line.

          NOTE:  An alternative format for defining the label  follows.   This
          is  to allow consistency with the Tymshare PERP format.  This format
          does not allow a line of the command file to be on the same line  as
          the label.  The format is:

              ::<label> <cr>



  C.  Use of Variable Parameters in Command Files

      One command file can do essentially the same job many  times  with  some
      differences  through  the  use  of  variable  parameters  in  the  file.
      Variable parameters provide a mechanism by which strings of text  within
      the  file  may  be varied.  These parameters may be used anywhere in the
      command file after they have been declared even in commands to  the  Job
      Processor system.

      When the command file  is  created  each  parameter  name  is  initially
      declared  (see  the  ":PARAMETERS"  command).   The  parameter  name (or
      keyword) is then placed with delimiters in the file where  its  variable

THE COMMAND FILE


      string  is to appear.  The string which is to replace the parameter name
      is assigned to the parameter name in the command file itself or  in  the
      process  which  calls  the  command  file.   The definition of parameter
      values (strings) by the calling process is one of  the  OPTIONS  to  the
      INSERT  command in the program SUBMIT (see SUBMIT.DOC) or is done in the
      :COM command line in the calling command file.



      1.  Assigning Values to Parameter Names


          a.  Initially Declaring Parameter Names and Assigning Values

              All parameters used in the command file must  be  named  in  the
              :PARAMETERS  command  line  in  the command file before they are
              used in the command file.  This command  may  also  be  used  to
              assign  an  initial value to the parameter names.  If no initial
              value is assigned to a parameter name the default value is  NULL
              or zero.


          b.  Assigning Values to the Parameters from Outside the Command File

              New values can be assigned to the parameters before the  job  is
              executed  without making any changes to the command file.  These
              values override the initial values assigned when  the  parameter
              names  were  declared or they are given to parameters which have
              not previously had a value assigned.

              If the command file is used directly by the Job Processor system
              the  new  parameter  values  are  supplied  to  it  through  the
              PARAMETERS  option  to  the  INSERT  command  in  SUBMIT.   (See
              SUBMIT.DOC.)  If  the  command file is called by another command
              file with the :COM command the new parameter values are supplied
              to it through the :COM command line in the calling command file.
              (See the :COM command.)


          c.  Changing Parameter Values while the Job Is Running

              A parameter value established when the command  file  is  called
              can  be changed later by assignment within the command file (see
              the :DEFINE command).  The new value assigned to  the  parameter
              name  within the command file can be any value that is valid for
              the parameter including the value assigned to another  parameter
              name.   This  assignment  of a new value to a parameter with the
              :DEFINE command can occur multiple times within a command file.



      2.  Substitution of Parameter Values (Strings) in Command File

          Substitution is invoked by placing the parameter name  (or  keyword)
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                March 10, 1987           Page 12
THE COMMAND FILE


          with  delimiters  where  the  substitution  string is desired in the
          file.  "With delimiters" means the parameter delimiter character  is
          placed  immediately  before and immediately after the parameter name
          or keyword.  The parameter  delimiter  character  is  initially  the
          backslash (\) but may be changed at the discretion of the user.

      3.  Pre-Declared Keyword Parameters

          A special type of parameter is  the  "keyword"  parameter  variable.
          These  keywords are pre-defined.  They are used to examine or change
          selected system attributes.   The  Job  Processor  system  currently
          provides  information about and/or control over the following system
          variables:

          $DAYTIME      - A string displaying the current time of day  in  the
                          form  HH:MM:SS  using the 24-hour clock.  Values can
                          range from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.  (Read-Only)
          $DELIMITER    - A character variable which contains the value of the
                          character   used  to  delimit  parameter  names  for
                          substitution.  Initially  the  value  is  back-slash
                          (\).  The delimiter must be a character which is not
                          valid  in  a  parameter  name  otherwise   the   Job
                          Processor  will  not  be able to determine where the
                          parameter name "really" ends.
          $FALSE        - A boolean variable equal to 0.  (Read-Only)
          $LOGGING      - A boolean variable for controlling whether output is
                          sent  to  the log file (if one exists).  If there is
                          no log file then this variable becomes Read-Only and
                          is equal to 0 (FALSE).
          $MAIL         - A boolean variable which controlls whether  mail  is
                          to be sent to the user upon completion of the user's
                          job.  The initial value depends on the value of  the
                          /MAIL switch.
          $SUBSTITUTION - A  boolean  variable  for  controlling  the  in-line
                          substitution  of parameters.  The initial value is 0
                          (FALSE) unless  a  parameter  is  specified  on  the
                          command   line   or   a   :PARAMETERS  statement  is
                          encountered.
          $TIMELIMIT    - A decimal value containing the remaining time  limit
                          for  the  processing  frame.   This  variable is set
                          initially to the value of the /TIME switch  and  may
                          be  reset  directly  or by the :TIMELIMIT n command.
                          If this variable is set to 0 then there is  no  time
                          limit.
          $TRUE         - A boolean variable equal to 1.  (Read-Only)
          $TRULIMIT     - A decimal value containing the  remaining  TRUs  for
                          the  processing  frame.   This variable is initially
                          set to 0 which means that there is  no  initial  TRU
                          limit.   Setting  this  variable means that from the
                          current point that many TRUs may be  accrued  before
                          the job is stopped.  This is very useful if the user
                          expects a program to use a small number of TRUs  and
                          something goes wrong.  The Job Processor system will
                          prevent the program from running up too many TRUs.

THE COMMAND FILE


  2.3  Sample Command File


  The following sample command file does the following:  
  1.)  it turns on parameter substitution declares the following as
       parameter names:  'OUTDIR', 'NAME', 'EXT', 'USER' and 'SPEC' and
       assigns initial values to parameter names 'OUTDIR' and 'USER';
  2.)  it accepts from the caller any values the caller assigns for any of
       the parameters; 
  3.)  it assigns to parameter name 'SPEC' the following string (all
       values concatenated):  the value contained in parameter 'NAME' a
       period and the value contained in parameter "EXT';
  4.)  it gets the time of the job's start and records it in the log file;
  5.)  it runs the user program 'UPDATE' and provides the input to the
       program; 
  6.)  it calls the subordinate command file 'MAKRDY' passing it the
       value of the parameter 'SPEC'; 
  7.)  it copies the file named in parameter 'SPEC' from the username in
       'USER' to the username in 'OUTDIR'; 
  8.)  it redefines the value assigned to parameter name 'SPEC' to be
       'output.fil' and 
  9.)  it gets the time of the job's completion and records it in the log 
       file.  

      :PARAMETERS  OUTDIR= tymnet  NAME  EXT  USER = tymnet  SPEC 
      :DEFINE SPEC = "\NAME\.\EXT\" 
      :REMARK  Time of start of execution:  \$DAYTIME\.  
      .run (\USER\) update 
      *1 week 
      :REMARK  The next command runs the command file MAKRDY.CTL providing 
      :REMARK    it the name of the output file as a parameter value.  
      :COM MAKRDY \SPEC\ 
      .copy (\USER\) \SPEC\ to (\OUTDIR\) \SPEC\ 
      :DEFINE SPEC = output.fil 
      :REMARK  Time of end of execution:  \$DAYTIME\.  
      :QUIT
