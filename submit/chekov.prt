File (SUBMIT) CHEKOV.PRT:
Partial SUBMIT Check-off Wish List:  what is yet undone.

"Every <n> hours ref <time>" re-calculates execution times for each day.  If
interval not integer factor of 24 hrs, first execution of the day is relative
to the previous day's 'ref' time, other times relative to current day's ref
time.  Wishes:
************

*  SUBMIT needs to change the runtime field when a record is modified and the
*  field that is modified is the date expression.  Currently, it keeps the old
*  runtime no matter what is changed.
*  **** This is a feature and will not be removed /Carl 01-Nov-86 ****

************

If you ABORT out of an INSERT and possibly a MODIFY, then proceed to insert a
new record, at least some of the old record info is still there, eg.  LOGFILE.
************

No limit to size of month:  April 44, 1986 accepted.
************

"Last day of month" is always the 31st, even for February.
************ (Program design limitation)

In LIST and STATUS commands, it would be nice to have "on frame 3" come out
in the "Next Run" column if the job is active.
************ (under advisement, hooks being added)

Abort-License or Abort-Enter does NOT record output in log file, despite the
mail message that says "Output recorded in file ...".  No log file is created
for Abort-License and Abort-Enter because the log file could not be opened for
output.
************

No complaints about misspelled license names. 
OPTIONS[Insert]: LIC SY,TOTAL,UNBELIEVABLE,GARBAGE,RF
SUBMIT did not complain about illegal license names, it merely ignored them.
************

Jobs with Abort-Time are not logged off.  In particular, frame 10 in X930 at
7:00 has been detached since 4:05, in TI for command port running TELECO.  The
log file had only the one-line comment about the time limit being exceeded, no
record of any logout attempted.
************

TIME option does not allow hours.  I requested "TIME 5:00:00", and SUBMIT
assigned a time limit of 5 minutes instead of 5 hours.  Bug.
************ (Program design limitation, to be addressed later)

SEND FILE doesn't seem to work.
The text in the file should have be included in the log file, if it was
sent to the frame.  Nothing showed in the log file.
************

Suggestion:  Allow turning on logging with "OPTION> log <action_arg>",
without specifiying log file name in INSERT command.  Default to
filename:  <jobname>.LOG.
************

Suggestion from Joe:  Sort the entries in the output of the LIST command
by "Next Run", in ascending order.  this would list aborted jobs first,
then all active jobs, then all queued jobs.
************

2nd INSERT after defining a DATES expression lost!  Joe reported:
entered:
	SUBMIT> date every day at 7:30 
	SUBMIT> INSERT fndbad.log=fndbad.ctl
	SUBMIT> INSERT fndbad.now=fndbad.ctl
	SUBMIT> exit
The 2nd insert falls into the bit bucket, rather than entering an
IMMEDIATE job.  User must EXIT from SUBMIT then re-run SUBMIT to enter
the second, immediate job.  Is this failure to run the "immediate" job
because "immediately" is now in the past, when the second job is
entered?
************

Joe wants to define a job DATE expression for 5 minutes from now,
regardless of when "now" is.
