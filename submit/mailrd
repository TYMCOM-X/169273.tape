BUG Report
    1.  Submit job under username TELCOBILL
    2.  Create aux circuit to different username and if I go into
        submit and do LIST command, it will list jobs of username
        TELCOBILL.
        (I may be the only one using submit on 23, so this would be
         a list of all submit jobs on system.)
    3.  Am able to delete job even if logged into different username.
    
    Is this right?

    I HAVE READ YOUR DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE NEW JOB PROCESSING SYSTEM AND AM
DISTRESSED TO LEARN THAT THE IF...THEN OPTION HAS BEEN REMOVED. WITHOUT
THIS OPTION, HOW IS THE EXECUTION OF A JOB TO BE CONTROLLED WHEN IT IS
DEPENDENT ON SOME OTHER JOB BEING COMPLETED FIRST, FOR WHICH A QUERY PROGRAM
GIVES THE STATUS? THE SPECIFIC CAS I REFER TO IS ONE IN WHICH I RECEIVE
DAILY CLOSING QUOTATIONS FROM THE TYMQUOTE SECURITIES DATA BASE.
HOWEVER, THIS DATA BASE CANNOT BE DEPENDED UPON TO BE UPDATED AT ANY GIVEN TIME,
SO IT IS NECESSARY TO RUN A PROGRAM WHICH TELLS THE USER WHETHER CURRENT PRICING
HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. WHETHER OR NOT TO EXECUTE MY PRICING JOB DEPENDS ON THIS
INFORMATION. IF I AM ONLY ABLE TO SPECIFY A TIME FOR EXECUTION OF MY JOB, I CAN
(AND PROBABLY OFTEN WILL) GET BACK BAD OR NO DATA AND SPEND TIME AND MONEY FOR
NOTHING. HAVE I OVERLOOKED SOMETHING THAT CAN HANDLE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM?

Output width for logfile name (and perhaps other LIST parameters) need
to be wide enough to accomodate the entire file name.  As it is, the last
few characters are being truncated.
