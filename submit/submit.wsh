NEXTIM: Don't allow constructs using STARTUP 'and/or/etc.'
	Startup means run once...  For SUBMIT, flag 'and' as illegal.

"Every <n> hours ref <time>" re-calculates execution times for each day.  If
interval not integer factor of 24 hrs, first execution of the day is relative
to the previous day's 'ref' time, other times relative to current day's ref
time.  Wishes:
    1.)  Allow using 'after', where 'ref' is in current construct.  All times
then relative to the base date/time, rather than current day's base time.
    2.)  Allow current construct (with 'ref'), with one fix:  make all times
for a day relative to that day's base time.

ref <time> should really be ref <daytime> and thus actually works like
after <daytime> except that it refers to the execution interval not the time
it is actually run.

ref <time> relative to each day is an interesting idea, but may not be very
reasonable to implement with the exception of running once a day at x o'clock.

SUBMIT needs to change the runtime field when a record is modified and the
field that is modified is the date expression.  Currently, it keeps the old
runtime no matter what is changed.

BUG!  When interactively running INSERT, typing a question mark in response to
the prompt for the Command File name puts SUBMIT into an INFINITE LOOP with

Sending mail to "SUBMIT Maintainer <SUBMIT@X62>" will result in appending

In a future release of SUBMIT, after I get XEXMAI written, I will add the

Version 1(165) and some earlier
Problem is that if you ABORT out of an insert, and possibly a modify
then proceed to insert a new record... the old record info is still
there... or at least some of it, eg. LOGFILE in my experience.

Subject: Your 'bug report' of Mon 24 Nov 

Your job did not run for two reasons:

1.)  The job processor had a bug that caused it to be unreliable.  The bug was
fixed today.

2.)  The way you entered the job request will not work.  The DATES information
must be on a different line from the INSERT command.  You should neter the
following:

SUBMIT> DATES TODAY AT 14:00
SUBMIT> INSERT TEST.CMD TEST.LOG


Re. your command file (TEST.CMD):  do not use ".LOG" in the command file.
This will cause an ABORT of the job, and the job will not run again, if it
scheduled to repeat, like a PERP job.  Use the Job Processor command ":QUIT".

Subject: Abort-License or Abort-Enter does NOT record output in log file. 

The mail message sent when a job terminates with Abort-Licens or Abort-Enter
says that "Output recorded in file ...".  This is an outright lie!  No log
file is created for Abort-License and Abort-Enter is because the log file
could not be opened for output.

I noticed a nice thing.  When SUBMIT asks "Oper name:", I typed "JMS" and

means we can us MHX to set up jobs that need license.

I discovered this by accident when by habit I typed "O" and ESCape.  Could
we make SUBMIT special case the Opername "O" and translate it to the
logged in name?  "O" should never be allowed as a legal OPER name.

Dennis,
I just uncovered a nasty feature of the Job processor: there is a
conflict with the :GOTO command and the system command GO.  The minimum
abbreviation of GOTO cuses the GO operand to be taken incorrectly as a
lable.  For example I had a job with the line:
.GO ONTSLV
the job aborted since it could not find label ::ONTSLV.
I have changed the job to
.GO(ENSS)ONTSLV
to see if that will parse better.  In any case it will be preferable
if the :GOTO command had a minimum abbreviation of :GOT so there won't
be any conflicts.

Subject: SET NO ATTACH should be done by EXECX for RUN jobs. 

I found only 2 jobs free out of 109 on D39, so I put FREE into the queue.
It is in there at startup and another entry to run immediately.  After it
started, I TAUXed to OPER:37, and LOGINN asked if I wanted to attach to
the job running FREE.  Doesn't XEXEC set no attach for frames it creates?
I know the programs can do it themselves, but I feel XEXEC should do it
as well.   /Joe

I HAVE A COUPLE JOBS WHICH I WANT TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY.  I HAVE SET THEM

THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I SUPPOSE ON SOLUTION WOULD BE TO CHANGE THEM SO THAT
THEY NEVERY END (THAT'S "ONE SOLUTION"), AND JUST SUBMIT THEM ONCE, ASSUMING
THAT SUBMIT WILL RESTART THEM WHENEVER THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN.  OR I COULD
MAKE THEM "STARTUP" JOBS, WHICH RUN FOREVER, AND WHICH DON'T AUTOMATICALLY
RESTART WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN.  (IN THESE CASES I WOULD JUST HAVE THEM
RUN THROUGH THE WEEKENDS TOO).  HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED THAT IN BOTH CASES
THEY MIGHT NOT GET STARTED FOR SOME REASON--WHICH IS WHY I WANTED THEM
TO START UP EACH DAY AT 04:00.  UNDER THE OLD PERP SYSTEM, WE WOULD
HAVE PERP START THEM AT 04:00 EVERY WEEKDAY--AND IT DID, REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE PREVIOUS RUN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT.  CURRENTLY THEY
ARE RUNNING OK, EXCEPT WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN.  PLEASE SUGGEST THE
BEST WAY TO HANDLE THIS SITUATION.

System 62 was reloaded.  When it came up, my FNDBAD job was marked as
Abort-License.  I cancelled the original, inserted a new one, and then did
a RERUN on it.  It got Abort-License.  Maybe it was dying because of some
sort of error it gets on the first job after startup that needs license.
So I inserted another entry, RERUN on it, expecting it to take off running.
It aborted also!.  What is going on?    /Joe

A suggestion.
I think a help to the user, when scanning a log file, would be a format for 
the list of number of lines skipped when doing a :BACKTO that somehow resembles
the listing of the lines skipped when doing a :GOTO.  I.e., indent the line
displaying the number of lines of control file skipped by a tab, ... and 
replace the lines immediately preceding and following it with lines consisting
of a tab and an ellipsis (or some other space taker).  This would provide the
user with a short block of indented lines indicating a skip, somewhat like a
forward skip.  I know it would greatly help me in reading the log file created
by your test.ctl.

Just a suggestion.   -D.-

The test in the file should have be included in the log file, if it was sent to

A suggestion, re. log files.
I believe that currently no log file is created unless a log file name is
specified with the INSERT command.  I don't see any reason why the user
couldn't enter his command file name (or RUN program file name) with the INSERT
command, then just enter the logging action declaration at the OPTION> prompt.

I.e., the word LOG, without an argument, could cause logging into the file
<jobname>.LOG, with the supersede action.  This would be after defaulting to
no log file due to no log file name specification at the INSERT prompt (with
either the wild-card or <cr> response to the prompt).

It seems easier, and less likely to log to the wrong file name than my having
to type the log file name every time~v
(This logging to the wrong file has already happened to me, while testing.)

Subject: LIST loops on CANCELed entries. 

The bug you mentioned about SUBMIT stopping on the first canceled entry is
much more serious than you had let on.  I had two entries in the queue, canceled
the first one, then tried "LIST".  SUBMIT was stuck in an infinite loop with
Control-C being trapped!  TURN OFF THE *#$%&# CONTROL-C TRAP!!!!!  If you
must have it, enable ONLY during the critical code and disable IMMEDIATELY
afterward!
  Operations is not going to like see naive users running a job that
chews up all the CPU cycles and cannot be killed.

The following sequence of commands do not work:
	.SUBMIT
	SUBMIT> DATE EVERY DAY AT 7:30
	SUBMIT> INSERT FNDBAD.LOG=FNDBAD.CTL
	SUBMIT> INSERT FNDBAD.NOW=FNDBAD.CTL

The 2nd INSERT falls into the bit bucket.  The following DOES work:
	.SUBMIT
	SUBMIT> DATE EVERY DAY AT 7:30

	SUBMIT> EXIT
	.SUBMIT
	SUBMIT> INSERT FNDBAD.NOW=FNDBAD.CTL

Is SUBMIT rejecting the date expression of "immediately" simply because it
is a few seconds in the past?  How can I tell it to run something 5 minutes
from now, regardless of what now is?   /Joe

A bug in SUBMIT's verifying wild-card job I.D.s.
I believe the following happens, and is undesirable:  
A user with access to other users (ie: with Account Supervisor status) gets
different responses to the use of a wild-card character in the job ident-
ification for the command, depending on whether he has a job which meets
the I.D. specs provided.

E.g.:  I had a job entered, name:   (DENCOFF)TST1.  I entered 4 more jobs, all
with name:  (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1.
I gave the command:  DELETE (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1 *.  SUBMIT asked for verification
for each deletion.
I deleted 2 of the four jobs this way.
I gave the command:  DELETE TST1 *.  All 3 remaining TST! jobs were deleted 
immediately:  two from (NOT-DENCOFF) and one from (DENCOFF).

i will test further to ascertain whether the non-verifying happens when no
username is provided, or when a job with the user's username matchs the job
specs provided.

Carl,

Re. my previous message re. commands working on jobs identified with
wild-cards in part of I.D.:  I have done further testing and found out about
the verifying for individual jobs from among the group selected via wild-card
characters.  The verifying is turned on only if a username is provided in the
job name.  If the user has sufficient status, DELETE * * will wipe out the
queue.  (At least it did for me.)

AM STILL having probllems with 2 of my jobs.  They are DETCH1.PER and
DETCH2.PER.  They are supposed to run on weekdays at 4:00.  They run
for 24 hours.  They work fine as long as the system does not have problems.
*but 
but when the system has problems, they seem to get deleted from the queue.
And, don't run.  Yesterday (2/16), DETCH2 started at 04:00, and DETCH1
started at 10:00.  The system went down around noon and came up around
23:00.  Neither of the jobs started at 4 this morning, and both have been
deleted from the queue.  I received no mail (mail=error).

System 58 needs SUBMIT version 205.
I got mail from 58 when SZRPT.CTL was aborted due to system reset.  I thought
I had RESTART START set, but when I looked, the request was gone.  I re-entered
the request with "DATE EVERY DAY AT 0:45" to SUBMIT version 200, and it ran
immediately.  That was OK for this particular request, but not expected.  It
looks like edit 203 also fixes this problem - SUBMIT version 205 does not have

I believe that SUBMIT should not fill in the default log file name.
Instead, the log file field should be blank up until the time that EXECX
looks at the first line of the CTL file.  I should be able to put

	:LOGFILE TEST.CTL/SUPERSEDE/MAIL:ERROR/RESTART:START

as the first line of the CTL file and have all the options honored.  The
default settings for some switches really ought to come from the CTL file
not SWITCH.INI and not from the user input every time.   /Joe

If there are 1000 entries in the SUBMIT queue when you type LIST, there is
no way to stop it.  Control-C doesn't work!  Grrrr!!  When are you going to
fix it so that the Control-C trap is enabled only when it needs to be and

Subject: submit bugs 

We've been having problems with Submit that you may be able to shed some 
light on.  For starters, runniong jobs on system 26 during the day seems flaky.
Jobs run fine at night but after about 8 am they will be queued but the times will
be hours ago, i.e. they are not getting executed on time or even close to it.
Then when they do get executed, the log files are empty except for 
Req #xx completed message.  It should
have the results of the command file execution.  None of the commands get
executed but the job does not get aborted with any error.
 
The second problem we are having is with Abort-License errors.  I have 
determined that if you modify any job that has license set then that job
will abort-license the next time it is run.  However we have had jobs
abort that were not modified in any way.  for example, one job ran all night
without error then had an abort-license in the morning.  These jobs
are building aux circuits so at the minimum I'm setting AC license.
 
On the plus side, I've had backup jobs in the queue for months and have never had
problems with them executing so its strange when I do have problems.
 
By the way, you might pass on a request for enhancement of submit:  It would
be extremely useful to add a weekday parameter for the date request.  
PERP used to have it.  If you want to run something several times a day
but not on weekends (which we often do) then it is very difficult (if 
not impossible) to get the date request setup properly.  It would be so 
nice to be able to say: 
date weekdays at 10 and weekdays at 12
for example.

An interesting anamoly I discovered regarding the jobs that were
run by submit but had empty log files.  I had called the command file 
'lstat.sw'.  Changing it to 'lstat.sub', making the extension 3 char 
instead of 2 makes it run ok.  Another bug I would say.

Jobs run OK with the new version of SUBMIT but if a job is rerun
and it requires license to operate, it aborts.  Example - I havea job called f.com that requires license to run.  It Abort-Zap this

seems license is ignored if a rerun is issued.  Output appended:

Dave,
  1.)  The day vs. night execution dependability will require some further
investigation.  It MAY be due to an excessive number of jobs being in the
host's Job Processor's queue for executio9n at the same time.  I'll check.
  2.)  The way the date and time expressions are parsed makes a 'weekdays'
expression impossible without re-writing all the date/time code.  So sorry,
but we just can't do it---we don't have the staff to commit to it.
  3.)  the 2 character vs. 3 character command file extension specificity is
a 'feature' we did not know about.  Thanks much for letting us know.  We'll
look at making it more flexible.

-Dennis-

For reasons unexplainable, 2 of my submit jobs aborted last night.  they
have been running just find for a long time.  they are CKST.PER and
(that's CKTS.PER) and BACKUP.PER, both schduled at 20:00.  The mail
message said "Abort-enter (12)   -Normal-".  The BACKUP job was still in
the queue in an aborted state.  the CKTS job disappeared from the queue.

My job BACKUP.PER aborted last night due to time ??  It ran at 20:00,
and has a timelimit of the ddefault (1 hour).  The job submits a batch
request (and does a few other things).  It stopped in the middle of the
batch request.  This job has been running for months with no problem.
It normally only takes a few minutes.

I inserted a job, but made a mistake, and tried to cancel it--request not
found.  Tried about 4 more times to insert (no date spec)--never showed 
up on job list.  Finally quit out of submit, and reentered, and success-
fully sumitted job.  Note, each time I submitted job, it said the job was
submitted, and gave me the next job number, but it did not show up in
job list.  The job that finally worked was CKTS #2982.

Suggestion: Have SUBMIT output a warning if XEXEC is not running.  If the
job running XEXEC is ^C or TI or not logged in, the user running SUBMIT will
be disappointed that jobs are not being processed.

Add a word in the queue that if nonzero means that job processing has been
disabled until the specified date/time.   People without QM license are not
allowed to add to the queue while jobs processing is disabled.

This job disappeared from the queue.  It's not supposed to do that.  Because
I have set RESTART:START it's supposed to be rerun when the system comes back
up, not deleted.    /Joe

Why does it not exit when ^C is typed at the top-level prompt?

In the INSERT dialog, it says to type 'option-name ?'.  That does not
work.  I have to type '? option-name'.  The built-in help text is wrong.

The JQUEUE.SYS file on the 1-tape save has PJ logged in as job 1 running PAM.
However, since X118 does not have a base, the only time XEXEC can ever run is
if I bring it up CONSOLE+GO and login to set the date/time.  XEXEC starts up,
sees job 1 logged in, and assumes that it is PAM.  When I run TAKEIT to hang
the system (or otherwise kill XEXEC), XEXEC thinks I am one of its children,
and it evicts me!  That is, TAKEIT kills XEXEC, so XEXEC kills TAKEIT.  Bug.
Simply doing a GETTAB on the PPN and program name would show XEXEC the error
of its ways.   /Joe
