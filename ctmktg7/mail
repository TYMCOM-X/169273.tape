Subject: Running SUBMIT on the 2020s. 

P034/P-10 is the latest monitor supported on the KS machines.  SUBMIT will
not run on the P034/P monitor.  SUBMIT requires P034/P37 or P035/B.
P035/B cannot be supported on the 2020 until KSFEFS is modified to put
BOOTS in the right place on disk.

There are no software conflicts between P034/N and P034/P, which means that
S59, S60, S92, S264, S301, and Mallenkrodt's M169 can be upgraded with no
problems.  S443 is running P034/K which may be a hassle.  Upgrading W1051
will take as much effort as upgrading TRW from P034/J to P034/P.

I would like to see all of the 2020 systems upgraded to P034/P or better
by the end of June 1987.

Your account on 930 has been changed so that you can use "SENDMAIL JMS" instead
if "SEND JMS".  This message is being brought to you using SENDMAIL.  You will
note that a copy of these messages get appended to the file MAIL in your
directory.     /Joe

Subject: TUMS.INI set up 

There is now a TUMS.INI in CTMKTG7.  This allows you to use "TUMS TXS" to
send to Dennis, Joe, Carl, Osman, and Craig.  You can add other aliases to
TUMS.INI if necessary.		/Joe

Subject: Used 2020s 

Are any of the shutdown 2020s still intact?  One of our other customers
could use a second 2020 to duplicate their current hardware.
