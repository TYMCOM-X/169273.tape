                  I.  Description of MAGCON

                  MAGCON is a program which transfers data and  will  convert  from
                  one  character  set  to  another  in the process.  It runs on the
                  TYMCOM X and is designed mainly for use with magnetic  tapes  and
                  disk  (FTA,  MTA  and  DSK)  although  it will use other devices.
                  MAGCON  will  perform  blocking,   duplication,   character   set
                  conversion,  unblocking, and positioning.  It can also prepare an
                  octal dump of a  file  which  can  be  printed  or  type  a  file
                  containing text.

                  MAGCON may be used in either of two  modes,  dialog  or  command.
                  During  dialog  mode,  information is input to MAGCON in terms of
                  answers to questions.  Command mode requires the user to input in
                  a  specific  format  the  information  needed  to  effect  a data
                  transfer or store a command or perform other  functions.   MAGCON
                  can  be  operated from command files.  When MAGCON is started up,
                  it is in dialog mode;  to change to command mode, an "!" is input
                  as the answer to the first question.  (See Sections 3 and 4.)

                  Character sets with more than  128  characters  cannot  be  fully
                  handled,  and  characters  in  some  sets  may  not have suitable
                  equivalents in the target desired sets.  if a character cannot be
                  translated,  MAGCON  places  a back slash "\" in that position in
                  the record.  A  tally  of  the  number  of  bad  characters  (not
                  translatable) is printed out when the transfer is complete.

                  In general, commands and  switches  may  be  abbreviated  to  any
                  number  of characters that will allow that command to be uniquely
                  interpreted.  However, no more than six  characters  are  checked
                  for validity in any of the commands.

                  A command file that MAGCON will read for commands is  denoted  by
                  the character "@".

                  To leave MAGCON, type an alt-mode or a control-c or use the  QUIT
                  command during command mode.

                  II.  Definitions

                  The following definitions should be helpful in understanding  the
                  information that must be supplied to MAGCON.


                  BLOCK


                  A block pertains to a set of one or  more  records  which  MAGCON
                  deals  with  as  a  unit.   On a tape, this will be the same as a
                  physical record.

                  LOGICAL RECORD

                  A record refers to a contiguous set of characters  which  may  be
                  delimited by a CR-LF sequence or be defined by a character count.
                  A record is artificially defined;  it has no relationship to  the
                  device.


                  BLOCK FACTOR

                  This refers to the number of records contained in a block.   This
                  is  a  value  that the user of MAGCON must supply for tape files.
                  Blocking, the grouping of records together in a block involves  a
                  special  structure  or  meaning  in  only  two cases.  One is the
                  special block structure of a VEBCDIC file, and the other  is  the
                  separation  of HPASCII blocks with blank tape.  (See also Section
                  5.)


                  UNBLOCKED TAPE

                  In this context, an unblocked tape will refer to one whose  block
                  factor is one.


                  PHYSICAL RECORD

                  A physical record is device dependent and refers to the  smallest
                  unit of data that can be processed by the hardware (128 words for
                  disk, 80 columns for card  reader,  the  data  between  gaps  for
                  magnetic tape).  The blocks and records mentioned above may cross
                  the boundaries of these physical records.


                  CHARACTER OR BYTE

                  The number of bits forming a character or byte  is  dependent  on
                  the  mode  of  the  data.   If one is reading an EBCDIC tape, the
                  character size of the input is considered to be eight  bits.   If
                  operating  in  image  mode,  the  byte size dealt with is a whole
                  word, 36 bits.
                                                                             Page 4


                  INDUSTRY TAPE

                  An industry tape or industry compatible tape refers to one  whose
                  character  size  is  eight  bits and which can be read or written
                  four characters at a time (in 32 bit words).


                  EOF MARK

                  An EOF mark follows every file on a magnetic tape.   It  consists
                  of  a  record  containing  an  octal 17 (for 7-track tapes) or an
                  octal 23 (for 9-track tapes).


                  EOT MARK

                  MAGCON does not write any special end of tape mark.
                                                                             Page 5


                  II.  Questions Asked in Dialog Mode

                  A set of questions is asked the user for  the  input  and  output
                  files.  The first two questions are always asked.  Depending upon
                  the answers to those questions and whether the file is for  input
                  or  output,  the  remaining  questions which apply will be asked.
                  Changes to the numbered questions, asked  during  the  dialog  or
                  not,  may  be  made  as noted when MAGCON prompts for corrections
                  following the dialog, or before a repeat.


                  1.  FILE:

                  Enter a file name which may take one  of  the  following  general
                  forms.

                                   DEVICE:FILE.EXTENSION(username)

                                                 or

                                      DEVICE:(username)FILE.EXT

                  The complete file specification is  optional  and  will  take  on
                  default  values  if  any part of it is omitted.  For example, the
                  device will default to DSK:  and the user  name  to  the  current
                  disk  area.   The  input and output file names will be created as
                  follows.  The file names will have the form FILXXX where XXX is a
                  three-digit  number,  and  the file extensions will have the form
                  XXX where is XXX  is  the  same  three-digit  number.   Numbering
                  starts  at 001 when MAGCON is run, and the values are incremented
                  as needed to get unique file names.

                  If the output device  is  a  magnetic  tape,  and  the  drive  is
                  write-locked,   MAGCON  allows  the  user  to  remount  the  tape
                  correctly and continue.  MAGCON will type:

                          FILE "file spec." STRUCTURE IS WRITE-LOCKED.
                          REMOUNT TAPE IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE
                          CONTINUE?

                  A "YES" answer tells MAGCON to continue.  A  "NO"  answer  causes
                  the program to restart the output dialog.

                  Changes:  There are no restrictions;  however  the  rest  of  the
                  dialog  for  either  input  or  output is done over if the device
                  changes from the previous value.



                  Wild card file names (or parts of names) may be  used  to  effect
                  various   transfers  of  multiple  files.   The  following  table
                  explains results of the legal wild card transfers.
                                                                             Page 6

                                                  a three-digit number.

                  ("#" AND "*")

                  standard        FTAn:*.*        Transfers appropriate
                  wild card       MTAn:*.*        disk files to separate
                  notation                           file.
                  ("#" AND "*")


                  WARNING:  When using wild card  transfers,  it  is  important  to
                  replace  the  file name when repeating specifications, evenif the
                  same transfer is desired, since the wild card names are  replaced
                  by real names as MAGCON is running.


                  2.  MODE:

                  Mode  specifies  the  character  set  mode  for  the  file.   The
                  following  table describes the options briefly.  The third column
                  indicates whether that option  normally  has  fixed  or  variable
                  length records.  For more information, see Section IV.

                  Changes:  No restrictions.  The rest of the dialog is repeated if
                  the mode has changed from the previous value.


                  3.  VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS?

                  This question is asked for disk  and  mag  tape  devices  if  the
                  specified  mode  is  ASCII,  HPASCII,  or  GEASCII.  The supplied
                  default is YES for VEBCDIC and SIXBIT mode and NO otherwise.

                  Changes:  no restrictions.
                                                                             Page 8


                  4.  CRLF'S IN ASCII FILE?

                  Are  carriage-return  line-feed  sequences  included  in   ASCII,
                  HPASCII  and GEASCII files?  This question applies only to one of
                  these three types of files on a disk or mag tape and is not asked
                  otherwise.

                  Changes:  The value may be changed if mode is  HPASCII,  GEASCII,
                  or ASCII.


                  5[A].  [MAXIMUM] RECORD SIZE

                  One form of this question is always asked if  disk  or  mag  tape
                  device  and  not in OCTAL mode.  The bracketed portion is printed
                  for variable length record files.  Enter the number of characters
                  in  a logical record or, for variable length records, the maximum
                  number.

                  Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.  When
                  making  a  change, the item number to enter is "5" and never "5A"
                  regardless of which form of the question was asked.


                  6.  BLOCKING FACTOR:

                  This question is asked for non-disk files.  Enter the  number  of
                  logical  records contained in one block.  The supplied default is
                  1 for tapes and 0 for disk (to satisfy MAGCON) when the  question
                  is not asked or when the user supplies a 0.

                  Changes:  Can be changed if tape.


                  8.  STOP ON ERRORS?

                  This question is always asked.  Should the job be  aborted  on  a
                  parity error in the file in question?

                  Changes:  no restrictions.


                  9.  HEADERS FOR LPT?

                       Should the LPT  (line  printer)  listing  include  a  header
                  consisting  of the user's user name, output file name, extension,
                  time and date?

                  Changes:  Can be changed if LPT device.


                  NOTE:  Questions numbered 10 through 20 are asked for tape  files
                  only.
                                                                             Page 9


                  10.  IS THIS AN ULTRA TECH TAPE?

                  This question is not normally asked, and the supplied default  is
                  NO.   This  feature  supplies  a  terminator  (octal 25) for each
                  logical record in the non-ASCII output file.

                  Changes:  Changes may be made if the following conditions are all
                  true.   The file must be output, tape, and in any mode other than
                  one of the three ASCII modes.  The input file must  currently  be
                  in ASCII.


                  11.  DENSITY:

                  What is the density of the magnetic tape?  The options are:

                            200
                            556
                            800
                            1600
                            6250

                  Changes:  Changeable for tape devices.


                  12.  PARITY:

                  This question is asked for  7-track  tapes  only.   The  supplied
                  default is ODD otherwise.  Enter the parity of the magnetic tape,
                  ODD or EVEN.

                  Changes:  Value may be changed if device is a 7-track tape.


                  13.  ADVANCE:

                  Enter the number of eof marks that MAGCON should  advance  before
                  processing  a  file.  If a magnetic tape has labels, there may be
                  several eof marks per file, depending  on  the  label  type.   If
                  there is no advance count, the user should input a zero.

                      BACKSPACE:

                  Tells MAGCON to backspace the magnetic tape n eof marks and  then
             forword  space  one  eof  mark  if the tape is not at load point.
                  BACKSPACE is asked only if the answer to ADVANCE was zero.

                  Changes:  Changeable for tapes.


                  14.  ADVANCE RECORDS:

                  This question is  asked  for  input  tape  files.   The  supplied
                  default is 0.  Enter the number of logical records to skip before
                  reading the tape file.
                                                                            Page 10


                  Changes:  Changeable for tapes.


                  15.  REWIND:

                  When should the magnetic tape be rewound?  The options are:

                            BEFORE (the operation)
                            AFTER (the operation)
                            ALWAYS (before and after the operation)
                            OMIT (do not rewind)

                  Changes:  Changeable for tapes.


                  NOTE:  The following feature is not fully operational In order to
                  read  back  a  labeled tape, the advance records or advance files
                  options may be used to skip over extra records or file marks.

                  16.  LABEL:

                  What should the label look like?  The options are:

                            NONE (no label)
                            MINE (special DEC labels)
                            DIGITAL   (DEC COBOL labels)
                            BURROUGHS (standard BURROUGHS labels)
                            IBM (IBM 360 labels)
                            GE635 (General Electric 635 labels)

                  Labels are written in the character set specified except for  IBM
                  and  GE635  labels.   IBM  labels  are written in BCD for 7-track
                  drives and EBCDIC for 9-track drives.  GE635  labels  are  always
                  written in GEBCD.

                  An additional note:  If IBM  lables  are  specified,  the  labels
                  conform  to  the  IBM  370 standard as of version 5.05 of MAGCON.
                  However, there is one  small  quirk.   That  is,  that  both  the
                  filename  and the extension part of the PDP-10 name are preceeded
                  with the letter "Z" and a period is  placed  between  them.   For
                  example,  the name "FOOBAR.DAT" appears as "ZFOOBAR.ZDAT".  Also,
                  "FOO.BAR" would appear as "ZFOO.ZBAR".  This is  to  insure  that
                  any legal PDP-10 filename is legal on the IBM label.

                  If a label is used, the following 2 questions are asked:

                       REEL:

                  Sets the reel serial number in labels  that  have  this  feature.
                  For  some  labels the reel serial number is retained when writing
                  over a label.  For instance, for BURROUGHS labels the output tape
                  is  read  to  retrieve  the serial number and then a new label is
                  written with this number.  To  override  this  feature  the  reel
                  option is given and the output tape is not read first.
                                                                            Page 11


                       SCAN TAPE FOR FILE?

                  Should the magnetic tape be searched until the input file name is
                  found  or an end of tape condition is detected.  The search is in
                  a forward direction only.  (Used with labelled tapes only.)

                  Changes:  Changeable for tapes.


                  18.  SPECIAL 36-BIT MODE?

                  This question is not asked during the dialog and is defaulted  to
                  NO.   It refers to a means of interpreting the characters read in
                  from tape as a series of 8-bit  characters  in  a  packed  format
                  containing  four and one-half characters per word (characters may
                  cross word boundaries.  (The author has found no  case  in  which
                  MAGCON  stores the characters read from tape in this fashion;  it
                  may be an obsolete feature.)

                  Changes:  Changeable if tape and  the  mode  is  either  HPASCII,
                  EBCDIC, or VEBCDIC.


                  19.  INDUSTRY TAPE?

                  This question is not asked during the dialog.  The default is YES
                  for  EBCDIC and HPASCII tapes and NO otherwise.  This refers to a
                  tape in industry compatible mode in which  its  8-bit  characters
                  are  written  or  read  in  groups  of four (a 32-bit word).  The
                  buffer storage  of  characters  to  be  written  (or  just  read)
                  contains  words  of  four characters with the low order four bits
                  not used.

                  Changes:  Changeable if tape and  the  mode  is  either  HPASCII,
                  EBCDIC, or VEBCDIC.


                  20.  UNLOAD TAPE?

                  Should the magnetic tape  be  unloaded  after  the  operation  is
                  completed?

                  Changes:  no restrictions.


                  22.  MULTIPLE OUTPUT FILES FOR THIS INPUT FILE?

                  This question is asked for input files.  MAGCON  will  allow  the
                  user  to  split  up the input file by blocks into separate output
                  files.  In this case, a block is  considered  to  be  a  physical
                  record  on  the  particular device involved.  if the user answers
                  YES, then the following questions will be asked:

                                                                            Page 12


                       NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO SKIP:

                  If the input file is being  split  into  separate  output  files,
                  MAGCON  allows the user to skip a number of blocks before writing
                  into the output file.


                       NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO TRANSFER:

                  If the input file is being  split  into  separate  output  files,
                  MAGCON asks how many blocks to transfer.

                  Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.


                  23.  DO YOU WISH ONLY 1 OUTPUT RECORD PER INPUT RECORD?

                  This question is asked if output, the file is on disk,  the  mode
                  is  either GEASCII, HPASCII, or ASCII, and the output record size
                  is less than the input record size.  In other cases, the supplied
                  default  is  YES meaning the output records may be truncated.  If
                  the user answers NO, then MAGCON will create a  new  record  from
                  information  remaining from an input record which will not fit in
                  the output record.

                  Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.


                  24.  DELETE TRAILING BLANKS?

                  This question is asked for output files when the device  is  disk
                  and the mode is HPASCII, GEASCII, or ASCII.  It does not apply to
                  other cases.

                  Changes:  Need same conditions as for question to be asked.


                  NOTE:  All of the above numbered  questions  may  be  changed  as
                  noted  when  MAGCON requests corrections at the end of dialog for
                  input specifications and for output specifications.  For example:

                  ALL [INPUT ] ENTRIES CORRECT?
                      [OUTPUT]

                  To change one of the attributes,  enter  "N"  to  this  question.
                  Then MAGCON will ask:

                  ITEM TO CHANGE?

                  Enter the number of the appropriate question.   MAGCON  will  ask
                  the question if the change conditions are met, and the answer can
                  be  supplied.   These  questions  continue  until  a  "Y"  answer
                  indicates  all  entries  are  correct.  MAGCON allows corrections
                  after each dialog or before a repeat.  Enter input  changes  only
                  when MAGCON asks about input entries and output entries only when
                                                                            Page 13


                  MAGCON asks about output entries.

                  NOTE:  The remaining questions are not  numbered  and  cannot  be
                  altered once they are answered.


                  USING "DSK:MAGCON.DAT" CONVERSION FILE - OK?

                  This question is asked if MAGCON finds a conversion file  in  the
                  user's  directory.   If  it  is acceptable to use this file, then
                  answer YES.  If a NO answer is  given,  then  the  standard  file
                  found in SYS is used.  For more information about using a special
                  conversion table, see the documentation for  the  program  MAGTAB
                  found in MAGTAB.DOC and also MAGCON.INF.


                  SUBSTITUTIONS?

                  MAGCON allows the user to make a small number of changes  to  the
                  standard  substitutions  in  the  conversion table MAGCON uses by
                  entering them from the keyboard.  If this  question  is  answered
                  affirmatively, MAGCON will type:

                  MAKE SUBSTITUTONS:

                  Type the new character first.  MAGCON will type "  for  ".   Then
                  type  the  character  to substituted for.  When done with all the
                  substitutions, type an extra carriage return.

                  EXAMPLE:

                  SUBSTITUTIONS?  Y
                  A FOR Z
                  Z FOR A
                                  (extra carriage return)

                  Each time MAGCON encounteres an "A" in the input file, a "Z" will
                  be  substituted and vica-versa.  Printing characters are the only
                  characters that may be used for substituting.


                  OKAY TO WRITE ON OLD FILE?

                  Is it all right to write over the existing file on disk with  the
                  name specified?


                  REPEAT SPECIFICATIONS?

                  This question is asked following a completed data transfer.   The
                  transfer  may  be  repeated  with the same specifications, or the
                  user may correct individual responses;  MAGCON will  ask  if  all
                  input  and then all output specifications are correct.  If either
                  the file device or the mode changes, then the remaining questions
                  of  the  dialog  will be asked.  In other cases, the user will be
                                                                            Page 14


                  responsible for changed responses  which  should  be  altered  to
                  conform  with  any  of his/her corrections.  Use with care.  (See
                  warning concerning the  use  of  wild  card  file  names  at  the
                  beginning of this section.)
                                                                            Page 15


                  IV.  Command Mode Structure


                  IV.A Format of Data Transfer Commands

                  The commands which effect a data transfer,  performing  the  same
                  function  as the dialog, use the traditional DECsystem-10 command
                  string format.  MAGCON will accept one input  file  specification
                  and  one  output file specification separated by a back arrow "_"
                  or equal sign "=".  For example:

                                       OUTPUT FILE_INPUT FILE

                                                 or

                                       OUTPUT FILE=INPUT FILE

                  The file specifications are the same as described in  Section  2,

                  IV.B Switches for Data Transfer Commands

                  Each  input  or  output  file  file  specification  must  contain
                  switches to give MAGCON the necessary information about the files
                  being handled.  A switch begins with a slash and is terminated by
                  the  next  slash  or  by the carriage return which terminates the
                  whole command as well.  For example:

                                               /SWITCH

                                                 or

                                          /SWITCH:ARGUMENT

                  In all cases, switches  may  be  abbreviated  to  the  number  of
                  characters  that will allow unique interpretation of that switch.
                  In the following table of possible switches,  "n"  represents  an
                  integer decimal number, and "ARG" represents a key word that must
                  be present.  The values of the switches and the arguments  should
                  be  apparent  from referencing the corresponding dialog question.
                  Switches flagged with an "*"  can  be  turned  off  or  have  the
                  opposite effect noted by concatenating "NO" with the switch.  For
                  example:  NOLIST, NOCRLF.

                                          See the RUN command for a complete
                                          description.

                  /SCAN *         16      Search for file on labelled tape.

                                          (default).

                  /UNLOAD *       20      Unload tape when transfer complete.


                  IV.C Additional Commands


                  BYE     MAGCON returns to monitor level, resets all I/O, and logs
                          the user off the system.


                  DIALOG  Returns user to dialog mode.  MAGCON will  ask  the  user
                          questions  about the input and output file specifications
                          according to the explanation in Section II.


                  ERASE   This command causes the current retained  command  to  be
                          deleted  and  returns  MAGCON  to  the  immediate mode of
                          operation;  MAGCON will go back to executing commands  as
                          they are typed.


                  EXIT    MAGCON returns to monitor level and resets all I/O.


                  PRINT   Types out the current retained command.


                  RETAIN  Used to save a subsequent command.   In  this  mode,  the
                          next   command   entered  is  not  executed  immediately.
                          Instead, MAGCON saves the command  line  and  allows  the
                          user  to  edit  it.  To edit the command string, the user
                          need only retype the part of the command he/she wishes to
                          change.   Items  that follow the back arrow or equal sign
                          will be edited to the input side of  the  command,  while
                          items  that  precede the back arrow or equal sign will be
                          edited to the output side of the command.


                  REWIND  Rewinds the specified magnetic tape.  MAGCON will  prompt
                          for  the  device  to  be rewound (the device name must be
                          terminated with a colon ":".  In this way, a tape may  be
                          rewound without transferring any data.

                  RUN     Performs the current retained command.

                  QUIT    Same function as EXIT.
                                                                            Page 18


                  The following commands may be  input  to  MAGCON  during  a  file
                  transfer.  Unless noted, they will not affect the transfer.


                  FILES   Prints the input and output file specifications  for  the
                          user.

                  PAUSE   Exits to the monitor level.  MAGCON may be continued with
                          the CONTINUE command.

                  STOP    Closes files and returns to MAGCON command level -- stops
                          the data transfer.

                  WHAT    Prints the  input  and  output  file  specifications  and
                          statistics associated with the transfer to the user.
                                                                            Page 19


                  V.  Tape Formats

                  MAGCON handles a large number of tape formats.  The following  is
                  a  description  of  the  various  record  formats and their usual
                  characteristics.

                  ASCII

                  An ASCII record is a set of  contiguous  7-bit  characters  whose
                  boundary  may  be  determined  by  a  carriage  return-line  feed
                  sequence or a character count.  An ASCII disk file is stored with
                  five  7-bit  characters  to  the  word with the low order bit not
                  used.  A successive record begins at the character following  the
                  last  character of the previous record.  If terminated by a CR-LF
                  sequence, the records are probably random  length;   the  records
                  would  be  fixed  length  otherwise and may contain a blank fill.
                  MAGCON will fill a fixed length record with blanks on  output  to
                  satisfy  the character count given.  Null characters found during
                  an ASCII transfer are discarded.


                  HPASCII

                  The general characteristics of ASCII files hold for HPASCII files
                  with  the  exception  that  the  characters  are 8-bit values.  A
                  buffered record is stored with four characters to each  word  and
                  the  low  order  four  bits not used.  Tapes written by MAGCON in
                  HPASCII format will contain additional blank  tape  between  each
                  block.   Character values <= 377octal are equivalent to the ASCII
                  values.


                  GEASCII

                  The general characteristics  of  ASCII  files  hold  for  GEASCII
                  files.  The characters are 9 bits long and are stored on the disk
                  four to a word.  Characters whose  values  are  <=  377octal  are
                  equivalent to the ASCII characters.


                  BCD

                  Records are composed of a contiguous set of 6-bit characters of a
                  length  determined  by  a  character  count.   In core, bytes are
                  stored six to a word.  In order to satisfy  an  output  character
                  count,  MAGCON  will fill with blanks;  records being read from a
                  tape may have this same characteristic.


                  BCL (BURROUGH'S 6-BIT)

                  Same general characteristics as BCD.


                  CDC (CONTROL DATA)
                                                                            Page 20


                  Same general characteristics as BCD.


                  GEBCD (GENERAL ELECTRIC BCD)

                  Same general characteristics as BCD.


                  HONBCD (HONEYWELL BCD)

                  Same general characteristics as BCD.


                  FIXSIX

                  Same general characteristics as BCD.


                  SIXBIT

                  A SIXBIT record consists of a contiguous set of 6-bit characters.
                  When  buffered,  the  records  consist  of  an integral number of
                  words.  The right half of the first word,  the  header,  contains
                  the  number  of  characters  in  the record, excluding that first
                  word, and the remainder of the record follows.


                  EBCDIC

                  An EBCDIC record is a set of 8-bit characters whose  boundary  is
                  determined  by  a  character count.  When buffered or stored, the
                  characters are packed four to a word with the low order four bits
                  not  used.  In order to satisfy an output character count, MAGCON
                  will pad with blanks;  records being read from a  tape  may  have
                  this same characteristic.


                  VEBCDIC

                  Variable EBCDIC characters are the  same  as  EBCDIC  characters.
                  VEBCDIC files may have one of two block structures.  In unblocked
                  format, a block and a record are equivalent.  In  blocked  format
                  (blocking  factor > 1), a block contains more than one record and
                  has an additional header word describing the size of  the  entire
                  block.  The individual records follow.

                                  |--------|--------|-------------------|
                  unblocked:      | length |   00   |      record       |
                                  |--------|--------|-------------------|

                                  |--|--|--|--|-----|-----------|--|--|-----|
                  blocked:        |bl|00|rl|00|rec 1|   . . .   |rl|00|rec n|
                                  |--|--|--|--|-----|-----------|--|--|-----|

                                                                            Page 21


                                  where:  length = block and record character count
                                                   (2 byte quantity)
                                          00     = 2 bytes of 0
                                          bl     = block character count
                                          rl     = record character count

                  In these formats, the character counts include the header  words.
                  When buffered, bytes are stored four to a word as for EBCDIC.


                  IMAGE

                  IMAGE mode referes to the treatment of a file as a contiguous set
                  of  binary data.  Every bit counts.  If the input file is treated
                  as IMAGE, then the output mode must be in IMAGE or OCTAL.


                  OCTAL

                  OCTAL mode can be used as an output mode only.  The input file is
                  treated  as  image no matter how the user specifies it.  An OCTAL
                  mode file, when typed on the TTY or spooled to a line printer, is
                  an octal dump of the original file.
                                                                            Page 22


                  VI.  Errors

                  Most of the error messages which can occur during the running  of
                  MAGCON  are self-explanatory.  Errors made while entering answers
                  to the  dialog  questions  can  be  corrected,  and  the  program
                  continued.   A  more serious problem with a device usually causes
                  MAGCON to return to the beginning of the dialog sequence.
