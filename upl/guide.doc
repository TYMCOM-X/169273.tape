User Guide         Tymcom-X Project Code Facility    November 2, 1976


                            Introduction.

Every user on the Tymcom-X  is assigned by his Account  Supervisor to
one of 3 classes for purposes of Project-Code accounting.  This guide
explains how to use the Project-Code faicilities to change a terminal
session from one Project-Code to another, and how to  change Project-
Codes on files.

All users are Class "0" users until otherwise declared to  the system
by the Account Supervisor, who will notify you in that  event.  Class
"0" users are not required to verify Project-Codes,  and consequently
the facility  will allow  them to set  the Project-Code  however they
wish  as  long  as  the  character-restrictions  described  below are
observed.  For such users, many  of the comments in this  guide about
validity-checking will not  apply.  Otherwise, the facility  works as
described.

A Class  "1" user is  subject to verification  of Project-Codes  by a
program written  by his Account  Supervisor.  Please consult  him for
details of the operation of his program.

Class "2"  users are  subject to  verification by  a Tymshare-written
program whose use will be explained in this Guide.

You do not need to know which  class (1 or 2) you are in;  the system
has  this recorded  and will  run the  appropriate programs  for you.
Simply give  Project-Codes that are  valid according to  the criteria
given you by your Account Supervisor.

A Project-Code  (PJC) is  a 12-character  string of  letters, digits,
spaces, &etc.   It may not  begin with an  asterisk "*" or  contain a
Tab, Semicolon, Carriage Return, or Linefeed character.   Although 12
characters is its maximum length, you need not enter trailing blanks.
The  system  will always  pad  a PJC  with  blanks to  produce  a 12-
character string.

The Tymcom-X Project-Code Facility allows you to associate  any legal
PJC  with a  terminal  session.  During  the session,  any  files you
create  will  also  have  this  PJC  recorded  on  them.   Under some
circumstances you may wish  to have Tymshare break down  your storage
bill according  to PJC's.  Your  Account Supervisor  has instructions
for indicating this option to the system.

               Setting the Initial PJC for the Session

When you  have received the  "Please Log In:"  message, you  may type
your username, password, and PJC all on one line, separating  them by
semicolons, as in the following example, where user MOORE  enters his
name, a non-printing password, then his Project-Code, K-333:
                PLEASE LOG IN:  MOORE;;K-333

An alternate method of logging in is to type a Carriage  Return after
each entry and let the system request the next entry.  For example,
PLEASE LOG IN:  ANDREWS
PASSWORD:                       (The password does not print)
PROJ CODE: ALPHA-BETA

If the PJC you have given is not correct, you will get this message:
INVALID PROJECT CODE FOR YOU
TYPE "HELP" IF YOU NEED HELP
*

At  this point  you may  type CODES  or LIST,  to find  out  what the
legitimate PJC's are. You may also type HELP.  If you wish to get off
the system, you may QUIT, EXIT, or LOGOUT.

To enter a valid PJC and get on to doing useful work, use the SESSION
command.   Suppose user  MOORE should  have typed  K-330 when  he was
logging in;  his dialog with the system would look like this  once he
corrected his error:
PLEASE LOG IN:  MOORE;;K-333
TYMSHARE 1234 15 OCT 76
INVALID PROJECT CODE FOR YOU
TYPE "HELP" IF YOU NEED HELP
*SESSION K-330
PROJECT CODE: K-330
.                       (useful work can begin here)





                       Login After Disconnect

If you  re-login after  a disconnect,  the PJC  in effect  before the
disconnect will remain in effect.  Any PJC you give when attaching to
a disconnected job will  be ignored.  This holds true  when attaching
to a job for any reason.

                      What is the Current PJC?

To  print  the PJC  which  is  currently in  force,  use  the command
".PROJECT="





                 Changing PJC for a terminal session

The system will allow you to change the PJC to another legal code via
the command
.PROJECT SESSION XXXX
where XXXX is your new legal PJC.  You will receive the response
CHANGE SESSION PROJECT CODE TO XXXX
FROM: YYYYY    (OLD CODE)
.

There are a variety of  flavors of this command.  If you  simply type
.PROJECT  to  the system,  you  will  enter into  a  dialog  with the
system's PROJECT program, which has the following facilities:
SESSION         command, to set the terminal session
FILE            command, to change PJC on a file
LIST
CODES           commands, to enumerate your legal PJC's
HELP            command, to get a short summary of commands
QUIT            command, to get out of the program.

The program will tell  you what the current  PJC is as you  enter the
program and after unrecognized commands.





                       Project-Codes on Files

When you create a file, the current PJC will be recorded on the file.
If you  want to see  what PJC's are  on your files,  you may  use the
switch "/PROJ" with FILES or DIRECTORY commands given to  the system.
For example, to list your files and their PJC's, use:
.FILES/PROJ
User Guide         Tymcom-X Project Code Facility    November 2, 1976


        Your output will look like this:
SUM MAC   K-330         (PJC)
BLOB F4   K-333         (PJC)
VAR BAS  [NULL]         (PJC)   (none on this file)

Note that if you put the  blank PJC on VAR.BAS, (12 blanks)  you will
not get the "[NULL]" PJC message.  Blank PJC is not the same  as null
PJC.

Suppose you are  currently under PJC "ALPHA"  and you want  to change
the PJC  on VAR.BAS to  ALPHA from its  present null value.   You may
enter the following command:
.PROJECT
*FILE VAR.BAS
CHANGE PROJECT CODE ON VAR.BAS TO ALPHA      FROM: [NULL]
*QUIT
.               (here you could continue)
A shorter method is available, and has identical results:
.PROJECT FILE VAR.BAS
CHANGE PROJECT CODE ON VAR.BAS TO ALPHA      FROM: [NULL]
.     (next system command)

Note  in  these examples  that  the system  has  applied  the CURRENT
project-code to the file.  It is also possible for you to put  a non-
current PJC onto a file.  Suppose you are under ALPHA and you want to
put K-375 on file BLOB.F4, because for some reason its  current code,
K-333,  is  wrong. You  may  issue the  "PROJECT  FILE  FILENAME PJC"
command, explicitly naming a PJC to apply to the file.  For example:
.PROJECT FILE BLOB.F4 K-375
CHANGE PROJECT CODE ON BLOB.F4 TO K-375     FROM: K-333
.   (next command)
or, its longer equivalent:
.PROJECT
CURRENT: ALPHA
*FILE BLOB.F4 K-375
CHANGE PROJECT CODE ON BLOB.F4 TO K-375     FROM: K-333
*QUIT
.    (next command)

Note that such a command does not change the current session PJC.

The system  will NOT allow  you to  change PJC on  a file  in someone
else's directory.  So for instance, a command such as  ".PROJECT FILE
(FRIEND)FILE.REL" will not be recognized.
