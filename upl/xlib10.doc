        SUBROUTINE TYTLE

THIS SUBROUTINE IS USED TO PUT TITLES ON A PAPER TAPE.  THE TITLES 
MAY BE UP TO 72 CHARACTERS LONG AND SHOULD BE STORED LEFT JUSTIFIED IN
AN ARRAY ONE CHARACTER PER ELEMENT.  THE CALL TO THE SUBROUTINE IS:

        CALL TYTLE(TITLE)

WHERE TITLE IS A 72 ELEMENT INTEGER ARRAY CONTAINING THE TITLE.

        THE FOLLOWING IS ADESCRIPTION OF NEW ROUTINES IN XLIB:



CALLING SEQUENCE: I=IOR(I,J)      I=IXOR(I,J)      I=IAND(I,J)
DESCRIPTION: THESE ROUTINES ALLOW FULL WORD LOGIC. EACH PERFORMS
THE INDICATED OPERATION ON THE TWO PASSED ARGS AND RETURNS THE RESULT
AS A FUNCTION VALUE. IOR IS OR OPERATION, IXOR IS EXCLUSIOVE OR AND
IAND IS AND.


CALLING SEQUENCE: CALL GETUSN(IARRY)
DESCRIPTION: THIS ROUTINE RETURNS THE USER NAME THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY
RUNNING UNDER INTO THE ARRAY IARRY. IARRY SHOULD BE DIMENSIONED 3.



CALLING SEQUENCE: CALL GETPPN(I)
DESCRIPTION: RETRUNS THE PROJECT PROGRAMMER PAIR IN THE CUSTOMARY WAY 
(LEFT AND RIGHT HALF WORDS) OF I.



CALLING SEQUENCE: CALL MOVE(A,B,NO)
DESCRIPTION: MOVES ARRAY A TO ARRAY B FOR "NO" WORDS IN A 
VERY RAPID MANNER.



CALLING SEQUENCE: I=LINEP(0)
DESCRIPTION: DETERMINES IF A TTY LINE IS READY 
TO INPUT, IF IT IS -1 IS RETURNED ELSE 0 IS RETURNED.
COMMENTS: USEFUL FOR DOING PAPER TAPE INPUT



CALLING SEQUENCE: CALL CORFIL(NAME,IN,LENGTH,CODE)
DESCRIPTION: PERFORMS A CORE UUO TO READ,WRITE,
ERASE ETC. TMPCOR.
NAME=FILE NAME RIGHT JUSTIFIED IN SIXBIT
IN=YOUR BUFFER
LENGTH=LENGTH OF BUFFER (IN WORDS)
CODE=UUO CODE (PAGE 3-170 IN NEW DEC BOOK)
COMMENTS: NOTICE THAT NAME IS IN SIXBIT.....



CALLING SEQUENCE: CALL PACK(A,B,LEN)
DESCRIPTION: PACKS BYTES STORED IN ARRAY "A" IN "A1" FORMAT IN ARRAY(OR
SINGLE WORD OR DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLE) B IN "A5" FORMAT.
LEN IS LENGTH TO BE PACKED FROM A. B IS NOT BLANK FILLED IF LESS
THAN 5 CHARS ARE PUT INTO IT,;ONLY THE BYTES TRANSFERED ARE
CHANGED IN B.



        A NEW VERSION OF XLIB HAS BEEN RELEASED WHICH INCLUDES THE
FOLLOWING NEW SUBROUTINES:

        CALL TIO

        THIS SUBROUTINE REQUIRES NO ARGUMENTS AND ALLOWS THE USER
TO ACCESS THE TIO PROGRAM IN UPL.  IT WILL EXPECT TO FIND INPUT IN THE
FORM OF COMMANDS TO TIO IN THE FILE INPUT.TIO.  UPON COMPLETION
OF EXECUTION OF TIO, IT WILL RETURN CONTROL TO THE MONITOR.

        CALL PERFORM(CHAFIL)

        THIS SUBROUTINE ALLOWS THE USER TO TEMPORARILY MODIFY THE
THE PERFORM FILE UNDER WHOSE CONTROL HE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING.  IT
DOES NOT CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE PERFORM FILE ACCESSED WITH
THU PERFORM COMMAND BUT DOES CHANGE THE VERSION CURRENTLY BEING USED.
CHAFIL IS A DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLE CONTAINING THE NAME OF A
FILE WHOSE CONTENTS ARE APPENDED TO THE CURRENT PERFORM FILE.

        E.G.

        -TYPE CHANGES
        RUN MYPROG
        FILES /TODAY

        -TYPE PROG
                DOUBLE PRECISION CHAFIL
                DATA CHAFIL/'CHANGES.'/
                CALL PERFORM(CHAFIL)
                END
