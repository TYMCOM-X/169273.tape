DATA ARE GIVEN FOR TWO PLESSEY N-CHANNEL GAAS FET TRANSISTORS (GAT4&GAT5)
AT THEIR LOW-NOISE (5V 10MA) AND HIGH-GAIN (5V 50MA) BIAS CONDITIONS. 
DEVICES HAVE HIGH RESISTIVITY BUFFER LAYERS AND ARE GROWN USING VPE.
THE METAL SYSTEMS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE USED IN DEVICES THAT PASSED 
STRINGENT SPACE QUALIFICATION PROCEDURES AND ARE NOW WORKING IN SATELLITE 
APPLICATIONS. 
MAXIMUM RATINGS: VDS=6V 
                 VGS=10V
                 PTOT=500MW 
MOUNTING:  DEVICES AVAILABLE IN SPACE QUALIFIED P103 PACKAGE OR IN
CHIP FORM (P100). THE DATABANK S-PARAMETERS ARE FOR CHIPS MOUNTED 
BY DISK TECHNIQUE. (CONTACT PLESSEY OR COMPACT ENGINEERING FOR THE
DETAILS). 
BECAUSE OF THE SIMILARITY OF CHIP MOUNTING TO PACKAGE MOUNTING, THE 
S-DATA FOR DEVICES IN THE P103 PACKAGE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE CHIP 
DATA.  DEVICES IN THE P104 PACKAGE (STUDLESS VERSION) WILL BE AVAILABLE 
SHORTLY.
RESULTS OF STUDIES INTO FAILURE MODES OF PLESSEY'S GAAS FET'S SHOW THAT 
IF PRECAUTIONS AGAINST STATIC BURNOUT ARE TAKEN (SUCH AS GROUNDED OPER- 
ATIONS, SUITABLE BIAS NETWORKS, ETC), AND THE MAXIMUM RATINGS ARE NOT 
EXCEEDED, EXTREMELY RELIABLE DEVICES RESULT.  MTTF IS BETTER THAN 10**7 
HOURS, SUPPORTED BY LIFE TEST RESULTS IN EXCESS OF 500,000 DEVICE HOURS.
PLESSEY GAAS FET'S HAVE SURVIVED A NEUTRON BOMBARDMENT OF 5*10**15
NEUTRON/SQ CM.  OUTPUT POWER SPIKE LEAKAGE RATING IS 16W PEAK, .7 ERG,
8 N SEC FOR THE GAT4 AND GAT5 SERIES.  DEVICES CAN BE SUPPLIED TO SPACE 
SCREENING LEVELS FOLLOWING MIL 883.

HE OPERATION OF THE COMPACT DATABANK DESCRIBED IN DETAILS IN THE NEW
APPENDIX V.  CALL COMPACT ENGINEERING IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COPY.
AS INDICATED IN THE MANUAL, COMPACT OFFERS EXTRAPOLATION, AS WELL AS
INTERPOLATION.  THEREFORE, FREQUENCIES MAY BE SPECIFIED OUTSIDE OF
THE LIMITS SHOWN IN THE DEVICE CATALOG (CAT). OF COURSE, THE PROGRAM
DOES NOT FORESEE ANY ABRUPT CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE DATA. 
===>THE USER MUST REALIZE THAT THE DATABANK PROVIDES INFORMATION ON 
"TYPICAL" DEVICES AND THAT THE DATA IS NOT GUARANTIED BY
COMPACT ENGINEERING OR THE MANUFACTURER.  HOWEVER, EVERY EFFORT IS
MADE TO PROVIDE THE LATEST REPRESENTATIVE DATA.<===
 TWO TYPES OF DATABANKS ARE AVAILABLE, AS FOLLOW:
1.  CENTRAL LIBRARY:
 THE CENTRAL TRANSISTOR LIBRARY CONTAINS BROAD-BAND, SMALL-SIGNAL 
S-DATA FOR THE TRANSISTORS OF SIX MANUFACTURERS(CTC, HP, NEC, FUJITSU,
PLESSEY, AND FAIRCHILD). ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURERS AND DEVICES WILL BE
CONSTANTLY ADDED.
ANY OF THE AVAILABLE DEVICES CAN BE CALLED BY THE FOLLOWING FORMAT
NEC DD BB 
 WHERE THE THREE-LETTER CODE ("NEC" IN THIS CASE) IS THE MANUFAC- 
       TURER'S CODE 
       THE TWO-LETTER CODE IN THE SECOND COLUMN (DD) IS THE NAME OF 
       THE TWO-PORT INTO WHICH THE DATA IS LOADED 
  AND  THE TWO-LETTER CODE IN THE THIRD COLUMN REFERS TO THE PAR- 
       TICULAR DEVICE AT A GIVEN BIAS CONDITION (TYPE "CAT" FOR 
       LISTING THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DEVICES) 
WHEN THE DATA FILE IS EXECUTED FOR THE FIRST TIME, COMPACT WILL 
RETRIEVE THE APPROPRIATE S-DATA FROM THE DATABANK, INTERPOLATE IF 
NECESSARY, AND LOADS THE DATA PERMANENTLY INTO THE USER'S FILE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, THE MANUFACTURER'S CODE IS CHANGED TO "TWO" 
AND THE DEVICE CODE IS CHANGED TO "S1 50". AFTER THIS CHANGE, THE 
FILE WILL RUN WITHOUT USING THE DATABANK. 
IMPORTANT: TWO "END" CODES ARE REQUIRED AT THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION 
OF THE DATA FILE.  THE S-DATA WILL BE LOADED BETWEEN THE TWO "END"
CODES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FILE
. 
FUJ AA BB 
PRI AA S1 50
END 
1000 1500 
END 
END 
. 
WILL LOOK AT THE FUJITSU FJ402E DEVICE AT 1000 AND 1500 MHZ.  THE 
S-DATA WILL BE LOADED INTO THE FILE, BETWEEN THE 5HT AND 6TH LINES
AFTER THE FIRST TIME THE THE DATA FILE IS EXECUTED BY COMPACT.
AT THE SAME TIME, THE FIRST LINE WILL BE CHANGED TO
TWO AA S1 50
. 
IT IS ALL RIGHT TO MIX DEVICES FROM THE DATABANK WITH "TWO" 
TYPES FOR WHICH THE USER TYPES IN THE DATA. 
2.  LOCAL LIBRARY:
IN ADDITION TO THE CENTRAL DATABANK, EACH USER MAY ESTABLISH A
PROPRIATORY DATABANK IN HIS OWN USERNUMBER.  THIS DATABANK CAN BE 
USED IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE CENTRAL DATABANK, EXCEPT THAT THE 
"OWN" CODE MUST REPLACE THE MANUFACTURER'S CODE, AND THE DEVICE 
CODES ARE ASSIGNED BY THE USER WHEN THE LOCAL DATABANK IS ESTAB-
LISHED.  THE LOCAL DATABANK MUST BE STORED UNDER THE NAME OF "SDATA", 
AND IT MUST FOLLOW THE FORMAT SHOWN BELOW:
OWN AA N NLF NHF ZCH
NF1 S11M S11A S21M S21A S12M S12A S22M S22A 
NF2 S11M    ETC 
OWN BB K KLF KHF ZCH
KF1 S11M    ETC 
 WHERE THE FIRST LINE OF EACH DEVICE SECTION CONTAINS THE "OWN" 
         CODE, FOLLOWED BY
                          A. THE DEVICE CODE (AA, BB, ETC)
                          B. THE NUMBER OF FREQUENCIES FOR WHICH
                             DATA IS AVAILABLE (N,K, ETC) 
                          C. THE LOWEST AND HIGHEST FREQUENCIES 
                             IN MHZ WHERE THE DATA IS GIVEN 
                          D. CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE, ZCH, IN OHMS
 AND   THE FOLLOWING LINES CONTAIN THE FREQUENCY (MHZ) AND THE
         THE CORRESPONDING S-PARAMETERS (NOTE ORDER)

IS IGNORED DURING EXECUTION.
THEREFORE, THE FIRST DEVICE WOULD HAVE THE DEVICE-CODE "AA"; THE
S-DATA IS GIVEN AT N NUMBER OF FREQUENCIES BETWEEN NLF AND NHF MHZ. 
(N, NLF AND NHF ARE NUMBERS). 
EACH DATA MAY BE SEPARATED BY COMMAS OR ANY NUMBER OF SPACES. 
FOR FURTHER INFO. PLEASE REFER TO APPENDIX IV OF THE NEW MANUAL.
AGAIN, A DATA FILE MAY CONTAIN A MIXTURE OF DEVICES, SOME FROM THE
CENTRAL DATABANK, SOME FROM THE LOCAL DATABANK, AND OTHERS WITH THE 
"TWO" CODES.  THE USER WILL ONLY NEED TO PROVIDE THE DATA FOR THE 
"TWO" TYPES, THE REST WILL BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY BY COMPACT.
****NOTE: CURRENTLY THE DATABANK ONLY CONTAINS S-DATA****
