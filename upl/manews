                              M A N E W S
                              ===========


           New features and corrections to the MANMAN manual

                          VERSION 2.8/H 2-9-76

VERSIONS 2.8/D,E,F,G,H introduced the following new commands:

              Command 27- Inventory extended cost listing.
              This report is similar to the inventory status
              listing,but also includes an extended cost
              (qoh x unit cost) for each part.

              Command 38- Cost a BOM and record the total cost in the
              inventory file.

              Command 400- List all (or selected ) BOMs in command 
              40 format.

              Command 105- Kit and receive a work order.  This 
              transaction combines commands 135 and 104.

              Command 110- Delete and decommit an unkitted work order.

version 2.8/c permits six-character alphanumeric vendor codes
              introduces command 109 - change quantity committed
              adds command 123 - list parts with QCOM>QOH

version 2.8/b adds quantity committed field

(UPL)INVCHG permits changes to specified fields for a sequential set of
parts.

version 2.8/a adds work-in-process management

version 2.7/i adds command 95 - Transaction report

version 2.7/h introduces:
          * Transaction register option
          * Lot-sizing availability in MRP commands
          * Command 96 to change system options

                                                                PAGE   2



* AVERAGE COST OPTIONAL INSTEAD OF STANDARD COST
------------------------------------------------

     Users now have the option of maintaining average unit cost for each
part instead of standard cost.  When initializing a data base, MANMAN
asks:

DO YOU WISH TO MAINTAIN AVERAGE UNIT COST INSTEAD OF STANDARD COST?

     An affirmative response will cause MANMAN to update each part's
unit cost as purchase orders are filled.  The calculation is:

new average cost=[(existing cost)x(quantity on hand)+(p.o.  unit cost)x
     (quantity received)]/(quantity on hand+quantity received)

     There are two exceptions to this rule:
1.  If a part's average cost is zero or quantity-on-hand is negative,
and a purchase order receipt arrives, the new average cost becomes the
purchase order unit price.
2.  If a p.o.  unit price is zero, the part's average cost will remain
unchanged.
     To convert existing systems to use average cost, use command 96.


* VENDOR CODE OPTIONAL WITH PURCHASE ORDERS
-------------------------------------------

     Users now have the option of maintaining any six characters as
vendor code with their purchase orders.  Upon first running MANMAN prior
to establishing a data base, the system will ask if you wish to maintain
vendor code information.  Existing users who would like their files
reformatted to maintain vendor codes may convert their files by running
a program called    (UPL)VENDOR.



                                                                PAGE   3



* TRANSACTION REGISTER OPTION
-----------------------------

     Users may specify that MANMAN maintain a register of all
transactions which change any part's quantity on-hand.  When first
setting up the data base, MANMAN will ask:

DO YOU WISH TO MAINTAIN A TRANSACTION LOG FILE?

     An affirmative response will cause MANMAN to maintain a register of
the following transactions:

1 - ADD A NEW PART TO INVENTORY
2 - WITHDRAW PARTS FROM STOCK
4 - RECORD PARTS RECEIVED
9 - CHANGE A PART'S QOH
15 - DELETE A PART
35 - WITHDRAW PARTS FOR A BOM FROM INVENTORY (SINGLE-LEVEL)
36 - WITHDRAW PIECE PARTS FOR BOM'S FROM INVENTORY
104 - RECEIVE PARTS ON A WORK ORDER
135 - KIT A WORK ORDER

     The information maintained in the register (a binary file named
TRANL) consists of:

1. part number                     suggested print format 2A5
2. date as YYMMDD                  suggested print format I6
3. description                     suggested print format 6A5
4. unit cost                       suggested print format F10.3
5. quantity                        suggested print format I7
6. command number                  suggested print format I3
7. reference (po# or next higher assembly)   sugg. print format 2A5

     The data will be maintained until the user deletes the file, which
may be done by typing, from the XEXEC:

DELETE TRANL

     This will customarily be done after a monthly or quarterly report
of the transactions, at which time the file may be preserved in some
off-line mode.  If there is no existing TRANL file, MANMAN will create
one.  Otherwise, each qualifying transaction will be appended to TRANL
when the MANMAN data base is updated.



                                                                PAGE   4



* COMMAND 1 - ADD A NEW PART TO INVENTORY
-----------------------------------------

     When entering new purchase orders, the due date must be expressed
as  MMDDYY.  In addition, if the user is maintaining vendor codes with
his purchase order data, the interactive prompt for existing purchase
orders will be:

P.O.#,QTY,VENDOR,UNIT COST,DUE DATE(MMDDYY)?

For file or tape input, the purchase order data is input as:

line# P,p.O.#,quantity,vendor,unit cost,due date


* COMMAND 2 - WITHDRAW PARTS FROM STOCK
---------------------------------------

     This command may also be used to add a quantity of parts to
inventory.  Just enter a negative quantity as the indicated withdrawal
quantity and that quantity will be added to existing inventory.


* COMMAND 3 - RECORD PARTS ORDERED
----------------------------------

     The due date specified in this command must be expressed in the
form MMDDYY.  Also, if the user has specified that he wishes to maintain
vendor codes with his purchase orders, the interactive MANMAN format
will be:

PART?
P.O.#,QTY,VENDOR,UNIT COST,DUE DATE(MMDDYY)?

The file input mode requires the transaction to be in the following
form:

line# 3,part#,p.o.#,qty,vendor,unit cost,due date


* COMMAND 4 - RECORD PARTS RECEIVED
-----------------------------------

     For a purchase order having multiple delivery dates for the same
part, if the number of that part received exceeds the number ordered for
the first delivery date, the excess is applied towards the next delivery
date for that part.
     When operating in the file or tape input mode, if the specified
purchase order/part number combination is incorrect, MANMAN will reject
the transaction, indicating the incorrect combination.



                                                                PAGE   5



* COMMAND 5 - CHANGE A PART'S DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------

     This command will now accept parts not yet entered into inventory.
MANMAN will add the part and the desired description to the inventory
file, with all other data set to zero.  This feature may be useful if
you have previously entered parts on your bills of material only and
want to enter corresponding descriptions in the inventory file.


* COMMAND 12 - CHANGE A PART'S QUANTITY ON ORDER BY P.O. #
-----------------------------------------------------------

     The particular due date for the desired purchase order quantity
must be specified.  This date must be entered as  MMDDYY.
Interactively, MANMAN prompts:

P.O.#, OLD DUE DATE(MMDDYY), NEW QTY?

For file input, use:

line # 12,part #,p.o. #,due date,qty


* COMMAND 13 - CHANGE A P.O.  DUE DATE
-------------------------------------

     The old delivery date for the purchase order item to be changed
must also be specified.  Both the old due date and the new due date must
include the year, as  MMDDYY.  Interactively, MANMAN prompts:

P.O.#,OLD DUE DATE(MMDDYY),NEW DATE(MMDDYY)?

File input format is now:

line #  13,part #,p.o. #,old date,new date


* COMMAND 17 - CHANGE A P.O. VENDOR CODE
----------------------------------------

This command is valid only if vendor codes are being maintained with the
user's purchase orders.  The interactive format is:

PART?
P.O.#,NEW VENDOR CODE?

The format when running from a file is:

line # 17,part #,p.o.#,vendor code



                                                                PAGE   6



* COMMAND 18 - CHANGE PURCHASE ORDER UNIT COST
----------------------------------------------

     This command will change all occurences of a unit cost for the
specified part-purchase order combination.  Interactively, MANMAN
prompts:

PART?
P.O.#,NEW UNIT COST?

For file input, the format is:

line # 18,part #,p.o.#,unit cost


* COMMAND 19 - DELETE A PURCHASE ORDER
--------------------------------------

     This command will delete all line items for each indicated purchase
order.  In the interactive mode, one command call can be used to delete
up to 100 purchase orders.  MANMAN will print:

P.O.# ? 

after which a purchase order number should be entered.  The prompt will
be repeated, asking for another purchase order to be deleted.  An extra
carriage return indicates that all purchase orders to be deleted have
been entered.  In file or tape mode, the format to delete a purchase
order is:

line# 19,purchase order number


* COMMAND 21 - COMPLETE INVENTORY AND OPEN P.O.  LISTING
--------------------------------------------------------

     The format for running this command from a file or from tape input
and listing the report to a file is incorrect on page 34 and page 48.
The number of print positions must be included after the name of the
output file.  For example:

90 21,YES,NAME,130,YES          command,YES for listing to a file,
                                file name,number of print positions,
                                YES for purchase order listing.

     For line-by-line input (page 48):

YES,file name,number of print positions,YES or NO for purchase order
listing



                                                                PAGE   7



* COMMAND 22 - SHORTAGE LIST
* COMMAND 24 - LIST ALL OVERDUE ORDERS
* COMMAND 25 - LIST ALL OPEN P.O.'S
--------------------------------------

     Any of these reports may now be printed to a file.  Interactively,
MANMAN will now ask where to output the report; the following represent
file or tape input format:

line#   command#,NO                 for terminal output

or

line#   command#,YES,file name         for file output.


* COMMAND 23 - LIST ALL PARTS BELOW ROP/MINIMUM
-----------------------------------------------

     Outstanding purchase order quantities are considered, along with
the quantity on hand in the calculation to determine which parts have
fallen below the reorder point/minimum level.
     This report may now be output to a file, as well as to the
terminal.  In the interactive mode, MANMAN will ask where to place the
report output; if file output is specified, MANMAN will request NEW
FILE/OLD FILE confirmation.  The format for file or tape input is now:

line#  23,NO               indicating terminal output

or

line#  23,YES,file name        for file output.


* COMMAND 27 - INVENTORY EXTENDED COST LISTING
----------------------------------------------

     This report is very similar to the Inventory Status Listing.  The
interactive and file input formats are exactly the same as command 21.


* COMMAND 36 - WITHDRAW PIECE PARTS FOR BOMS FROM INVENTORY
-----------------------------------------------------------

     This command withdraws all piece parts required to make the
indicated bills of material in the indicated quantities.  All
subassemblies are exploded until piece parts are encountered.  This
command will also produce a listing of all parts which do not have
enough on-hand balance to produce the specified bom's, as well as the
shortage quantities.  The interactive format is:

COMMAND? 36                       command request

PART,QTY? 72-876-001,2            BOM part number, quantity desired
?                                 next bom? (CR ends input)

                                                                PAGE   8



     The file input format is:

100 36                          line number 36
110 R,234-567-9,2               line number  R,part number,quantity
120 R,456-453-0,3               line number  R,part number,quantity


* COMMAND 37 - COPY A BILL OF MATERIALS TO A NEW PART NUMBER
------------------------------------------------------------

     This new command is useful if you want to enter a new bill of
materials which differs only slightly from an existing bill of
materials.  You may issue a command 37 to duplicate the bill under
another name, then modify the new bill of materials with command 31.
Operation in the interactive mode is self-explanatory; for file mode,
the format is:

LINE# 37,OLDBOM,NEWBOM,NEWREVISION


* COMMAND 38 - COST A BOM AND RECORD THIS COST IN THE INVENTORY FILE.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

     This command will add up the extended costs of all components on a
BOM and will record this cost as the unit cost for the BOM.  
     The format for running from a file is:

100 38,200-00101                       line # 38,part number

     Interactively, MANMAN will request the BOM number.


* command 41 - list a bom by part # & qty (single level)
* command 42 - indented bom (all levels)
----------------------------------------

     these reports can now be listed to a file instead of to the
terminal.  From file input, this is accomplished by appending the file
name to the input line:

LINE# 41,BOM#,QTY,FILENAME
LINE# 42,BOM#,FILENAME


* COMMAND 43 - WHERE USED LISTING (SELECTED PARTS)
* COMMAND 44 - WHERE USED LISTING (ALL PARTS)
--------------------------------------------

     The format for running these commands from a file or from tape
input is incorrect on page 36.  The command number must be followed by a
"Y" or a "N" to indicated whether file output is desired and, if so, the
"Y" must be followed by a legal file name.  For example:

176 44,NO                       command,NO for terminal output
180 44,YES,NAME                 command,YES for file output,file name

                                                                PAGE   9



* COMMAND 45 - LIST PIECE PARTS REQUIREMENTS FOR SELECTED BOM'S
---------------------------------------------------------------

     The description of command 45 (page 27) and the format for running
from a file or tape input (pages 36 and 48) are incorrect:

     Command 45 prints a list of the total piece parts required for
entered quantities of entered bills of material.  MANMAN prompts with:

PART,QTY?

for the first bill of material entered and

?

thereafter.  After each prompt, enter the number of the bill of
materials and the quantity desired.  When all bills of material and
quantities have been entered, type an extra carriage return.  MANMAN
then prompts for the destination of the listing and the carriage width
of the terminal which will type the report.  (if no carriage width is
indicated, the report will be output at full width of 92 positions.) The
system will total all piece parts required to make all the entered bills
of material in the quantities entered, and will print a sorted list of
total requirements for each part needed, along with the quantity on
hand, quantity on order, balance (=qoh-reqd), unit cost and extended
cost.  For example:

COMMAND? 45

PART,QTY?  200-00101,100
? 201-00012,75
?

DO YOU WANT THIS LISTING PRINTED TO A FILE? NO

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PRINT POSITIONS FOR REPORT? 80

     For file or tape input, the format is:

100 45,YES,NAME,80              command,file output,file name,80
positions
or

100 45,NO,80                    command,terminal output,80 positions
101 R,200-00101,100             R,part number,quantity
102 R,201-00012,75              R,part number,quantity

     Each bill of materials entered must be preceded by an "R" as shown
(this is not entered in the interactive mode).


* COMMAND 46 - LIST ALL CURRENT BILLS OF MATERIAL
-------------------------------------------------

     This command lists all current bills of material with their
description and revision/issue.

                                                                PAGE  10



* COMMAND 400 - LIST ALL OR SELECTED BOMs
-----------------------------------------

     This command will list all BOMs or selected BOMs (up to 100) to a
file or to the terminal.  The BOMs will be listed in command 40 format.
     Interactively, MANMAN will request: BOM,QUANTITY?
If all BOMs are desired, answer ALL to this prompt.  (In this case, one
is assumed for the quantity.) For selected BOMs, keep responding with a
BOM #,quantity, up to 100 entries.  
     File format is:

100 400,FILE,ALL                  line # 400,file name,ALL
or

100 400,FILE                    line # 400,file name
110 L,200-00101,1               line # L,part number,quantity

Note: When running command 400 from a file, output must be to a file,
not to the terminal.  There is no pagation with command 400.



                                                                PAGE  11



* COMMAND 50 - REQUIREMENTS PLANNING REPORT
-------------------------------------------

     The requirements planning reports can now be run in two different
modes:
     LOT-FOR-LOT ORDERS - All MRP suggested orders will be for only the
quantity of the part necessary to remove the negative on-hand balance.
     LOT-SIZED ORDERS - The minimum quantity suggested by MRP processing
will be the part's economic order quantity (EOQ).  If more than the
economic order quantity is required, the quantity suggested will be that
which will remove the negative on-hand balance.  That is, if more than
the EOQ is required, both modes will yield the same suggested order
quantities.  (If the part's EOQ value is less than 2, lot-for-lot
ordering wilassumed for that part.)
     A new parameter called "slack days" has recently been added to the
MRP.  Use of this parameter will cause the MRP to "expedite", on paper,
existing work orders and purchase orders by the number of slack days
entered.  This can best be explained by an example:
     Let's say there is a requirement for 15 of a part due on March 15,
1976.  In addition, there is a work order for 20 for this same part, due
on March 20, 1976.  If a slack time of 7 days was entered, the MRP would
move the work order due on March 20 back 7 days to March 13.  The work
order would then fall BEFORE the requirement due on March 15.  If no
slack time was being used, the requirement due on March 15 might have
caused an MRP generated order due on March 15, which in turn generated
lower level requirements.  The use of a slack time will cause the MRP to
first look for existing orders falling within the 'slack period' before
generating new orders.
     In addition, the commands can be run for either gross or net end
requirements.  Net end requirements indicate that the quantity on hand
of the end requirements entered is not to be considered, and the
quantity entered is planned for beyond what exists in inventory for that
end requirement.  Gross end requirement specification means that the
quantity entered is the total quantity that will be required on the due
date entered, including the current quantity on hand for the end
requirement.  In other words, no gross-to-net calculation is performed
on the top level if NET end requirements are specified.  On all other
levels, the gross-to-net explosion is always performed.  End
requirements are specified as gross or net by following the due date
with  ",GROSS" (",G" is accepted) or  ",NET" (",N" is accepted).  If
neither GROSS nor NET is specified, NET is assumed by default.
Interactive example:

PART,QTY,DUE(MMDDYY)? 200-00101,100,071075 (net requirement by default.
                                            note due date is 7/10/75.)
? 220-00021,79,081075,NET                  (net requirement)
? 212-00001,225,122075,GROSS               (gross requirement)
? 202-01101,150,022576,G                   (gross requirement)
?

ENTER UNIT OF LEAD TIME IN DAYS? 7         (lead time is in weeks)

DO YOU WANT LOT-SIZING? NO                 (lot-for-lot ordering)

ENTER NUMBER OF SLACK DAYS:  7

                                                                PAGE  12



DO YOU WANT THIS LISTING PRINTED TO A FILE? NO  (terminal output)

The format for running commands 50  from a file is:

180 50,7,YES,NAME,YES,7    command,days per unit lead,YES for listing to
                          a file,file name,YES for lot-sizing,slack days
or

180 50,7,NO,NO,7           command,days per unit lead,NO for printing at
                          at the terminal,NO for lot-for-lot,SLACK DAYS
 ordering,slack days
182 R,200-00101,100,071075                        (net by default)

* COMMAND 95 - TRANSACTION LOG REPORT
-------------------------------------
 
     FROM THE EXECUTIVE (XEXEC), PLEASE TYPE RUN (UPL)TRANREP FOR A
REPORT, SORTED BY PART NUMBER AND DATE.

* COMMAND 96 - CHANGE SYSTEM OPTIONS
------------------------------------

     This command allows the user to change the options which he has
specified for his MANMAN system.  The command may only be run
interactively, and permits the user to change any of the following
options:
1. Average cost instead of standard cost of parts.
2. Maintenance of a transaction register.
 
* (UPL)INVCHG - SEQUENTIAL INVENTORY UPDATE PROGRAM
---------------------------------------------------

     THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS THE USER TO MAKE CHANGES TO ANY FIELDS IN THE 
INVENTORY FILE (EXCEPT THE PART NUMBER) FOR A GROUP OF SEQUENTIAL 
RECORDS.  THE PROGRAM IS EXECUTED AS:
RUN (UPL)INVCHG

     INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN IN THE PROGRAM.

                     MANMAN WORK-IN-PROCESS SYSTEM
                     -----------------------------

     MANMAN's work-in-process management allows the user to control and
monitor his in-production jobs as well as his raw material, assembly and
finished-goods inventory.
     The commands which have been added to handle work-in-process are:

103 - ENTER A WORK ORDER
135 - KIT A WORK ORDER
104 - RECEIVE PARTS ON A WORK ORDER
105 - KIT AND COMPLETE A WORK ORDER
110 - DELETE AND DECOMMIT A WORK ORDER
112 - CHANGE THE QUANTITY ON A WORK ORDER
113 - CHANGE A WORK ORDER DUE DATE
109 - CHANGE QUANTITY COMMITTED FOR A PART
123 - LIST ALL PARTS WITH QCOM GREATER THAN QOH
125 - WORK ORDER LISTING
140 - KIT PICKING LIST

     An additional field, quantity committed, has been added to each
part's information.  Its use is as follows:

1.  Whenever a work order is issued, the parts required to complete the
work order are considered to be committed, and each of these parts' QCOM
is incremented accordingly.
2.  Whenever a work order is kitted (command 135) the required parts are
withdrawn from the quantity on hand and from each part's quantity
committed, and the work order is identified as having been kitted.
3.  Parts may also be committed by a user for other reasons.  This may
be done with command 109 - change quantity committed for a part.


* COMMAND 103 - ENTER A WORK ORDER
----------------------------------

     This command is used to record the issuance of a work order to
produce a specified quantity of a specified assembly on a specified
date.  The work order is merely recorded - the parts required in the
work order must be removed from inventory using command 135.  The
interactive format for command 103 is:

COMMAND? 103                                enter a work order
PART? 123-456-78                            part number

W.O.#,QTY,DUE DATE(MMDDYY)? 34,100,121575   work order #,qty,date

     The file or tape format is:

100 103,123-456-78,34,100,121575  line# 103,part,w.o.#,qty,due date



                                                                PAGE  14



* COMMAND 135 - KIT A WORK ORDER
----------------------------------

     This command is used to indicate that all the assemblies (or piece
parts) required to complete a work order should be removed from
inventory.  For the indicated work order, all the next lower level parts
necessary to build the quantity of the assembly on the work order are
removed from inventory, and the work order is identified as being
kitted.  On input, the system will request the part number of the
assembly to be built, the work order to build the assembly, and the
quantity to be built.  All three fields must agree with the original
work order entered by command 103 or the command will be rejected.  The
interactive format is:

COMMAND? 135               kit a work order
BOM? 123-456-78            assembly to be built
W.O.#,QTY? 456,33          work order number, quantity on W.O.

     The file format is:

100 135,123-456-78,456,33     line# 135,assembly,work order#,quantity


* COMMAND 104 - RECEIVE PARTS ON A WORK ORDER
---------------------------------------------

     This command is used to indicate completion of an entered work
order.  The interactive format is:

COMMAND? 104                  receive parts on a work order
PART?  111-222-33             part number
    
W.O.#,QTY? 243,100            work order number, quantity received

If the indicated work order has not yet been kitted, MANMAN will
respond:

***WORK ORDER # 243 HAS NOT YET BEEN KITTED.  COMPLETE ANYWAY?

A negative response will reject the transaction, whereas a positive
response will cause the indicated number of parts to be added to
inventory.  If the work order is not completed, and command 104 is
executed once again for the same work order, MANMAN will once again
indicated that the work order has not been kitted.
     The file format for this command is:

100 104,111-222-33,243,100        line#  104,part ,W.O.#,quantity



                                                           PAGE 15
 


* COMMAND 105 - KIT AND COMPLETE A WORK ORDER
---------------------------------------------

     This command combines commands 135 and 104.  It is possible to use
this command with a partial work order quantity.
     Interactively, MANMAN will print:

PART?
W.O.#,QTY?

     Format from a file:

100 105,200-00101,WO-1,100             line # 105,part,w.o.  #,qty


* COMMAND 110 - DECOMMIT AND DELETE AN UNKITTED WORK ORDER
----------------------------------------------------------

     This command will reduce the quantity committed of all components
on a work order.  It will also delete the work order.  Interactively,
MANMAN will print:

PART?
W.O.  #?

     From a file:

100 110,200-00101,WO-1              line # 110,part,work order number

* COMMAND 112 - CHANGE THE QUANTITY ON A WORK ORDER
---------------------------------------------------

     The interactive format for this transaction is:

COMMAND? 112                       change quantity on a work order
PART?123-456-43                    part number

W.O.#,NEW QTY? 453,322             work order number, new quantity

     For file or tape input, the format is:

100 112,123-456-43,453,322           line number  112,part#,w.o.#,qty


* COMMAND 113 - CHANGE A WORK ORDER DUE DATE
--------------------------------------------

     The interactive format for running this command is:

COMMAND? 113                        change a work order due date
PART? 111-222-33                     part number

W.O.#,NEW DUE DATE(MMDDYY)? 123,111175     work order #,due date

From a file, the format is:

100 113,111-222-33,123,111175     line#  113,part#,quantity,new due date


* COMMAND 125 - WORK ORDER LISTING
----------------------------------

     This command produces a report of all open work orders.  Sorted by
part number, the information reported is part number, quantity in
process, work order number, status (K for a kitted job, U for an
unkitted work order) and due date.  The file format for this command is:

100 125,N                    for terminal output

          or

100 125,Y,WOLIST,Y          line# 125,Y,filename,Y





* INCREASED LINE NUMBER RANGE FOR FILE OR TAPE INPUT
----------------------------------------------------

     When using file or tape input to MANMAN, the maximum permissible
line number has been increased to 9999 (versus 1500 in previous
versions.)

                                                                PAGE  17



* TRANSACTION LISTING NOW OPTIONAL
----------------------------------

     When using file input or tape input to MANMAN, a complete
line-by-line listing of transactions as they are processed is now
optional.  After entering the file name (when running from a file) or
after reading in the tape (when input is from tape) MANMAN will ask:

DO YOU WANT ALL INPUT LINES PRINTED AS THEY ARE PROCESSED?

     A YES response will produce the complete list of transactions as
they are processed.  A NO response will suppress this listing.  MANMAN
will then print error and warning messages only, and the input lines to
which they refer.


* PAGING OF OUTPUT
------------------

     A variable paging option is also available.  Before entering MANMAN
command level, the system asks:

DO YOU WANT REPORTS PAGED?

     If YES is entered, MANMAN will then ask:

HOW MANY LINES PER PAGE?

The first three lines and the last three lines of each report page will
be left blank as a top and bottom margin, respectively.  If your file is
to be printed on standard 8 1/2" by 11" paper, specify   66  lines per
page.
     If no paging is requested, each report will be printed with
headings at the start of the report only.


* DATA FILE SECURITY
--------------------

     MANMAN includes a sophisticated file protection system to prevent
damage to your files.  The first time a transaction is entered which
will modify your files, MANMAN will 'unlock' them, printing:

***PLEASE WAIT WHILE MANMAN OPENS FILES FOR TRANSACTIONS...

There will be a pause while the files are being opened.  When this is
complete, MANMAN will print:

                                                           FILES OPEN***
