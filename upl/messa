  8.  THE ERROR FUNCTION FORMULATION OF "SEO" AND "SMO" HAVE BEEN 
      CHANGED BY SEPARATING THE REAL AND IMAGINARY PARTS OF THE INPUT 
      IMPEDANCE.  PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY PROBLEM
      WHEN USING THESE FUNCTIONS. 
 .
 THESE ADDITIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAILS IN OUR NEW "APPENDIX VII",
 AVAILABLE FROM OUR OFFICE AT NO CHARGE.  A SUMMARY OF THE UPDATE 
 IS GIVEN BELOW.
 .
 TWO SHORT COURSES WILL BE GIVEN ON MICROWAVE CIRCUIT DESIGN.  A
 TWO-DAY COURSE WILL BE HELD ON OCTOBER 13-14 AT KINGS' GRANT MOTOR 
 INN AT PLAINVIEW, N.Y.  THE FEE IS $170, DISCOUNTS ARE GIVEN 
 FOR ADDITIONAL ATTENDEES FROM THE SAME COMPANY.  THIS COURSE IS
 FOCUSED ON ACTIVE CIRCUIT DESIGN, USING COMPUTER-AIDED SYNTHESIS AND 
 OPTIMIZATION.
 THE SECOND COURSE IS AT UCLA, FROM OCTOBER 24 TO 28 (FIVE DAYS). 
 THIS COURSE WILL INCLUDE MICROWAVE FILTERS AND COUPLERS BESIDES THE
 ACTIVE CIRCUITS.  THE FEE IS $475. 
 ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED FOR BOTH COURSES AND WE RECOMMEND 
 EARLY REGISTRATION SINCE THE ATTENDANCES ARE LIMITED.

 .
 VERSION 4.7 UPDATE:
 .
 ===MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS=== 
 THIS STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE CAN BE REQUESTED BY TYPING OPTION 
 CODE "7", FOLLOWING THE NAME OF THE DATA FILE. 
 THIS OPTION WILL ALLOW USERS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF TOLERANCES 
 ON THEIR CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE AND GATHER STATISTICAL INFORMATION
 UPON THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE VARIATIONS.  THE ACCURACY OF THE RANDOM
 PREDICTION DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF "TRIALS" (SPECIFIED BY THE USER).
 WE RECOMMEND AT LEAST 150-250 TRIALS TO GAIN A REASONABLE STATISTICAL
 EVALUATION OF THE CIRCUIT. 
 LIMITS MAY BE PLACED ON (UP TO) ALL 15 VARIABLES THAT COMPACT
 CURRENTLY ACCEPTS. 
  THE VARIABLES ARE INDICATED WITH NEGATIVE SIGNS (JUST AS FOR AN 
  OPTIMIZATION) AND THE RANGE OR TOLARENCES MUST FOLLOW BETWEEN TWO 
  PARANTHESES, AS SHOWN BELOW 
 .
     RES AA SE -50(40,60)   OR   RES AA SE -50(10,15,%)
 .
 THE FIRST EXAMPLE SHOWS A 50 OHM RESISTOR,HAVING A TOLERANCE 
 RANGE OF 40 TO 60 OHMS, THE SECOND CASE SHOWS AN ALTERNATIVE INPUT 
 FORM WHERE THE TWO NUMBERS IN THE PARANTHESES ARE THE MINUS AND PLUS 
 PRECENTAGE LIMITS (-10 AND +15).  NOTE THAT THIS SECOND FORM REQUIRES
 A PRECENTAGE (%) SIGN AFTER THE LIMITS. IN BOTH CASES, THE LIMITS MUST
 FOLLOW DIRECTLY BEHIND THE NOMINAL VALUE OF THE VARIABLE.  THE USER IS 
 ALLOWED MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE PER DATA FILE LINE, BUT ONLY ALLOWED
 ONE TOLERANCE PAIR PER VARIABLE. 
   THE PRINTOUT WILL SHOW AN ANALYSIS OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT REFLECTION
 COEFFICIENTS AND THE GAIN IN DB. AT PRESENT, THE TOLERANCE RANGE SPECIFIED 
 IS DIVIDED UP INTO 20 EQUAL PARTS FOR THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
 THE S11, AND S22 ARE PRINTED OUT AS CONFIDENCE LEVEL CIRCLES.
 FOR EXAMPLE: 
   FREQ       (NOM VALUE)     99%     95%     90%     75%     50%    SIGMA 
     200       .262  -24.     .17     .13     .11     .08     .05    .65
 MEANS THAT AT 200 MHZ, THE NOMINAL VALUE IS .262 AT -24 DEGREES: AND 
 THE TOLERANCES CAUSE CIRCLES AROUND THE NOMINAL POINT AS FOLLOWS:
         99% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .17
         95% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .13
         90% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .11
         75% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .08
         50% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .05
    THE SIGMA IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION ASSUMING A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. 
 THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FOR THE CIRCUIT PARAMETERS. 
 THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING ANY VALUE IN THE TOLERANCE RANGE IS CONSTANT. 
    THE PRINTOUT FORMAT OF THE DB GAIN (S21 OR VOLTAGE) IS DIFFERENT: 
   FREQ      (NOM VALUE)    99%     95%     90%     75%     50%     SIGMA
    200        15.07 DB+   1.44    1.08     .91     .64     .39  .553 
                       -   1.37    1.03     .87     .61     .37  .526 
   THIS INDICATES THE DB GAIN LIMITS: 
          99% OF UNITS FALL BETWEEN +1.44 AND -1.37 DB OF NOMINAL
          95% OF UNITS FALL BETWEEN +1.08 AND -1.03 DB OF NOMINAL
   AND SO ON... 
   A SIMILIAR FORM IS AVAILABLE FOR THE OTHER PRINTOUT OPTIONS
      THE S-PARAMETERS FOR THE TWO-PORTS (OR TRANSISTORS FROM THE DATA- 
 BANK) MAY BE TOLERANCED BY ANSWERING THE QUESTION 'ENTER TOLERANCE ON
 S-PARAMETERS ' BY ENTERING FOUR NUMBERS, REPRESENTING THE TOLERANCE
 PLUS AND MINUS FOR EACH S-PARAMETER  IN THE ORDER S11,S21,S12,S22. 
 THE TOLERANCE IS APPLIED ON THE S-PARAMETERS FOR ALL FREQUENCIES,
 IN MAGNITUE ONLY, NOT ON THE PHASE.
 .
 ===CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION=== 
    THE VARIABLES CAN NOW BE KEPT WITHIN SPECIFIED BOUNDRIES.  THE
 LIMITS MUST BE PLACED IN PARANTHESES, DIRECTLY AFTER THE VARIABLE, 
 SAME AS FOR THE MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS (SEE ABOVE).
 THE SEARCH CONVERGENCE IS SLOWER IF ONE OF THE VARIABLES HITS A
 BOUNDARY, BUT ONLY IF IT HITS A BOUNDARY.  THEREFORE, THERE IS NO
 EFFECT FROM THE LIMITS UNTIL ONE OF THE VARIABLES EXCEEDS ITS
 UNDER TEST, AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.  THE "TRUE OPTIMUM" OF
 THE CIRCUIT MAY NOT BE FOUND USING THE CONSTRAINED SEARCH. 
 .
 ===LOSSY NOISE FIGURE CALCULATIONS===
   THE NOISE FIGURE COMPUTATIONS WILL NOW INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF 
 LOSSY ELEMENTS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF
 DATA FILE FOR TWO-STAGE AMPLIFIERS (ONLY WHEN NOISE IS SPECIFIED 
 FOR BOTH TRANSISTORS), AND THE REFERENCE PLANE OF THE PRINTED OPTI-
 MUM NOISE SOURCE IS NOW DEFINED AT THE INPUT OF THE CIRCUIT. 
 PREVIOUSLY, THE REFERENCE PLANE WAS AT THE INPUT OF THE FIRST TRAN-
 SISTOR, AS SHOWN IN EXAMPLE 12 IN THE USER MANUAL. 
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE DATA FILE OF A TWO-STAGE AMPLIFIER IS THE FOLLOWING:
      PREVIOUS METHOD                      NEW METHOD 
      TRL AA SE ...                        TRL AA SE ...
      SST BB PA ...                        SST BB PA ...
      CAX AA BB                            CAX AA BB
      NOF AA RN 50                         NOF AA RN 50 
      TWO BB S1 50                         TWO BB S1 50 
      TRL CC SE ...                        TRL CC SE ...
      .          (INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT)      .
      .                                    .
      IND GG SE ...                        IND GG SE ...
 ---> CAX AA GG                       ---> CAX CC GG
 ---> NOF AA RN 50                    ---> NOF CC RN 50 
 ---> TWO BB S1 50                    ---> TWO DD S1 50 
 ---> TRL CC SE ...                   ---> TRL EE SE ...
      REST OF DATA FILE                    REST OF DATA FILE IS SAME
                                           EXCEPT THE SECOND "TWO"
                                           ELEMENT IS NOW "DD"
. 
  NOTE THAT THE CHANGE ONLY AFFECTS THE SECOND STAGE PART OF THE
 CIRCUIT.  PREVIOUSLY, THE CIRCUIT WAS CASCADED UP TO THE INPUT OF
 THE SECOND TRANSISTOR BEFORE THE SECOND "NOF" CALL WAS PLACED.  NOW, 
 THE INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT MUST BE CASCADED WITHOUT THE FIRST TRANSISTOR 
 (CAX CC GG) BEFORE THE SECOND "NOF" CALL.
 THE ACTUAL NOISE FIGURE OF THE CIRCUIT.
 .
 ===VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS=== 
 VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS ARE AVAILABLE FOR CASCADING INTO
 CIRCUITS, WHICH HAVE NO EFFECT UPON MATCH, ONLY UPON THE GAIN OR PHASE 
 OF S21 AND S12.  THE CODING IS THE FOLLOWING:
      VGB AA PO G1 SP SN F1 F2         VPB BB NE P1 P2 P3 F3 F4 
 WHERE FOR THE VGB CODE:
      G1 IS FLAT GAIN ACROSS THE FREQUENCY RANGE
      (PO IN COLUMN THREE INDICATES G1 IS POSITIVE DB OF GAIN)
      (NE WOULD INDICATE IN COLUMN THREE THAT G1 IS IN MINUS DB)
      SP IS UPSLOPE IN DB/OCTAVE STARTING AT FREQUENCY F1 IN MHZ
         (SP HAS NO EFFECT BELOW F1)
      SN IS DOWNSLOPE WITH FREQUENCY(MINUS DBS) IN DB/OCTAVE STARTING AT F2 
 FOR VPB: 
      NE INDICATES THAT P1 IS NEGATIVE PHASE
      P1 IS FLAT PHASE ACROSS THE FREQ. RANGE IN DEGREES OF PHASE 
      P2 IS ADDITIVE PHASE WITH FREQUENCY IN DEG/OCTAVE START AT F3 IN MHZ
      P3 IS MINUS PHASE IH DEG/OCTAVE STARTING AT F4 IN MHZ 
 SEVERAL VGB AND VPB BLOCKS MAY BE CASCADED TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED FORM. 
 EXAMPLE: 
      VGB AA NE 10 6 6 100 200
 WOULD INDICATE A -10 DB FLAT GAIN, WITH AN UPSLOPE OF 6 DB/OCT STARTING
 AT 100 MHZ, AND THEN FLAT GAIN AGAIN OF -4 DB STARTING AT 200 MHZ. 
 A TYPICAL APPLICATION OF THE VARIABLE GAIN BLOCK IS THE OPTIMIZATION 
 OF AN AMPLIFIER WHERE THE TARGET IS MAXIMUM GAIN FLATNESS REGARD-
 LESS OF THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE GAIN.  IN THIS CASE, WE CASCADE
 A VARIABLE GAIN BLOCK TO THE AMPLIFIER AND SET ITS GAIN TO A VARIABLE
 QUANTITY.  WE SPECIFY THE DESIRED OVERALL FLAT GAIN FOR THE CASCADE
 COMBINATION.  DURING THE OPTIMIZATION, THE GAIN OF "VGB" WILL BE SET 
 TO THE OPTIMUM VALUE AND THE NET GAIN OF THE AMPLIFIER WILL BE THE 
 FINAL OVERALL GAIN LESS THE GAIN OF "VGB".  FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HAVE
 OUR AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT DEFINED BY TWO-PORT BLOCKS AA THROUGH FF, AND
 WE DEFINE THE GG BLOCK FOR VGB 
 ...... 
 VGB GG PO -10 0 0 0 0           (+10DB VARIABLE GAIN FOR GG) 
 CAX AA GG                      (WE CASCADE VGB TO THE OUTPUT)
 PRI AA S1 50 
 END
 100 500 100
 END
 .001 
 1 1 1 20 
 END
 .
 AND WE ARE ASKING FOR A 20 FLAT GAIN FOR THE OVERALL CIRCUIT.
 WHEN THE OPTIMIZATION CONVERGED (ENDED), WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FINAL
 GAIN OF VGB.  LET'S ASSUME IT IS 7.22 DB.  THEN, THE NET GAIN OF 
 THE AMPLIFIER IS 20-7.22=12.78 DB. 
 NOTE THAT THE VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS MAY ALSO BE USED
 WITH THE CONSTRAINED SEARCH DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO KEEP THE OVERALL 
 GAIN OF THE AMPLIFIER WITHIN DESIRED LIMITS. 
 S11 AND S22 OF VGB ARE ALWAYS SET TO THE IMPEDANCE SPECIFIED ON THE
 PRINT (PRI) LINE AND THE S21*S12 PRODUCT IS SET TO 1.0 INTERNALLY. 
 THIS WILL ASSURE A "SEE-THROUGH" CONDITION FOR THE IMPEDANCES, 
 WHICH MEANS THAT WE SHALL GET THE TRUE S22 OF THE AMPLIFIER EVEN THOUGH
 WE CASCADED VGB TO ITS OUTPUT. 
 ANOTHER POSSIBLE APPLICATION IS AN EQUALIZER DESIGN (MAGNITUDE 
 AND/OR PHASE). 
 .
 WE MODIFIED THE COMPUTATIONS OF THE CIRCULAR STUB (CST) ELEMENT. 
 PREVIOUSLY, THE THIRD COLUMN CODE WAS ALWAYS "PA".  NOW, THE 
 USER HAS AN OPTION OF SPECIFYING MICROSTRIP OR STRIPLINE (MS OR SL)
 MODES.  A WORD OF CAUTION: THE EXPRESSIONS INVOLVED ARE BASED ON 
 APPROXIMATIONS RATHER THAN EXACT CALCULATIONS. 
 .
 WHEN AN EDITED OR OPTIMIZED FILE IS SAVED, COMPACT CAN ONLY HANDLE 
 SIX NUMERICAL ENTRIES ON EACH LINE OF THE CIRCUIT DEFINITION SECTION 
 OF THE DATA FILE.  THIS MEANS THAT IF LIMITS ARE PLACED ON MORE THAN 
 ONE VARIABLE FOR A COMPLEX ELEMENT (CPL, GEN, VGB, ETC.) THAT REQUIRES 
 FOUR OR MORE ENTRIES, THE FILE CAN NOT BE SAVED FROM COMPACT.  AN ERROR
 MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS.  OF COURSE, THE
 EXECUTION IS NOT AFFECTED, ONLY THE STORAGE PROCEDURE IS HALTED. 
 .
NEWS OF JULY 21, 1977:
A NEW ALGORITHM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE -SEO- CODE.  THIS SHOULD
IMPROVE THE CONVERGENCE AND OPERATION OF THE CODE.
NEWS OF JUNE 13, 1977:
A PROBLEM WAS FIXED WITH THE S2/S4 PRINT OPTION WHEN USING MORE
THAN ONE PRI COMMAND IN A SINGLE DATA FILE.  ERRONEOUS NUMBERS WERE
PRINTED OUT FOR THE STABILITY RESULTS.  
A CORRECTION WAS MADE FOR ELECTRICAL LENGTH CALCULATIONS IN
.
COMPACT NOW OFFERS TWO-STAGE NOISE FIGURE CALCULATION AND
OPTIMIZATION.  THE USE OF THIS CALULATION FOLLOWS THE NORMAL
USAGE THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE MANUAL (EAMPLE #12), EXCEPT THAT
NOW UP TO TWO #NOF# CODES MAY BE DEFINED IN A DATA FILE. FIRST, STAGE
1 INPUT CIRCUIT IS DEFINED AND INTERCONNECTED. AT THAT POINT, THE
#NOF# CODE IS USED, FOLLOWED BY THE TWO-PORT AND THE REST OF THE
INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT.  THEN, AFTER INTERCONNECTION, THE SECOND
NOF CODE IS USED, FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE CIRCUIT AND THEN
INTERCONNECTED.  (SINGLE STAGE APPLICATIONS AND THE #NOS#
OR #NOP# CODES ARE NOT AFFECTED ).
.
MICROSTRIP AND STRIPLINE MODES FOR COUPLED LINES.
NEWS OF APRIL 21, 1977:
THE FILE HANDLING OF THE COMPACT DATABANK HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVED.  USERS SHOULD NOTICE REDUCED TRU COST WHEN USING THE DATABANK.
.
SMITH CHART PLOTTING OF S11 OR S22 IS NOW AVAILABLE.  THE CHART PRINTS 
AS POINTS, WHICH ARE MAJOR LINE INTERSECTIONS ON A 7 INCH SMITH CHART.
 A TRANSPARENT OVERLAY CAN BE MADE AND USED WITH THE CHART.
THE CHART IS ACCESSED WITH THE "PLO" COMMAND, AND AN ADDITIONAL
QUESTION IS ASKED TO ACCESS THE SMITH CHART . THE DATA IS REPRESENTED
BY THE ALPHABET, WITH "A" REPRESENTING THE FIRST FREQUENCY POINT, "B"
REPRESENTING THE SECOND DATA POINT, AND SO ON.  (THE SEQUENCE REPEATS
AFTER 26 FREQUENCIES).  IF TWO DATA POINTS OCCUR IN THE SAME
CHARACTER LOCATION, THIS IS REPRESENTED BY A "#".
.
NEW TRANSISTORS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE DATABANK BY HP, NEC,AND TRW.
PLEASE RUN THE CATALOG USING THE TRXINFO COMMAND.
.
PLEASE CHANGE THE FOLLOWING IN THE COMPACT MANUAL UPDATE SHEETS IN
APPENDIX IV, PAGE 1:
IN THE DATA FILE DEFINITIONS OF TRL, OST,SST, AND CPL ELEMENTS(MS AND SL MODES ONLY) THE RELATIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT, K(R), IS
MISSING. INSERT "K(R)" BETWEEN "F(0)" AND "H" EVERY PLACE WHERE THE
LINE IS DEFINED BY ELECTRICAL LENGTH. THERE ARE FOUR CHANGES IN
APPENDIX IV. ALSO, ON PAGE IV-1, "H" IS MISSING FROM THE DEFINITION
OF "OST" IN THE "SL" MODE. "H" SHOULD PRECEDE THE LOSS TERM, THE SAME
WAY AS IT DOES FOR THE "TRL" ELEMENT IN THE "MS" MODE. IN THIS SAME
LINE, CHANGE THE ZO TO W, SINCE THE FOURTH DATA COLUMN REPRESENTS
THE WIDTH OF THE LINE.
.
A CORRECTION WAS MADE ON COMPACT TO STORE THE OPTIMIZATION DATA OF AN
EDITED FILE, EVEN IF THE OPTIMIZATION WAS NOT REQUESTED (OPTION 1, ETC)
.
A NEW VOLTAGE GAIN DEFINITION IS NOW AVAILABLE (INSERTION VOLTAGE GAIN.)
THE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED GAIN WAS DEFINED AS V(OUT)/V(S) FOR ANY SPECIFIED
RESISTIVE TERMINATIONS.  THE NEW OPTION IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE
OUTPUT VOLTAGES WITH AND WITHOUT THE TWO-PORT IN THE CIRCUIT. THIS NEW
FORM IS TYPICALLY USED IN FILTER DESIGN.
THE PRINT FORMAT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH OPTIONS (PRI AA VG RS RL).  THE
PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER TO SPECIFY THE DESIRED FORM, DURING THE
EXECUTION.
.
A NEW FOUR-PORT GENERALIZED DEPENDENT SOURCE, GEN, HAS BEEN ADDED TO
THE ELEMENT LIBRARY.  THIS COMPONENT MUST BE USED THROUGH THE NODAL
INTERCONNECTION SCHEME.  A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN IN THE NEW
UPDATE PACKAGE (BEING PRINTED)  IN EXAMPLE 18.  IF YOU NEED THE 
DESCRIPTION NOW, CALL OUR OFFICE (415-968-7025), OR CONTACT YOUR LOCAL
TYMSHARE REP.
