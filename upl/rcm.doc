                        Prototype RCM
                        -------------
            Restricted-Command-Mode Command Processor
            -----------------------------------------


With the advent of Project-Code-Verification and Restricted-Command-Mode
features in the Tymshare PDP-10 Monitor P031, the need for a user-level
command processor has arisen.  Such a processor must be able to 
tailor itself to the command-subset needs of specific users.  The
following describes a prototype command dispatcher package;  for ease
of reference it will be called RCM.

The RCM prototype package consists of two distinct phases/programs.  The
first phase is called RCMB (for "RCM Builder").  RCMB constructs an RCM
tailored to the needs of a specific user or set of users.  The second
phase is RCM which is the user's "Restricted Command Mode File".  RCMB is
used once by the account supervisor or marketing representative to create
the RCM to be used during all subsequent logins.  Both RCMB and
RCM are constructed from code modules developed by the MAGNUM project.


RCMB reads a disk file (RCMLST.DAT) containing project-codes and their
associated set of allowed commands.  The set of allowed commands for any
given project-code may be empty (however it is advisable to always
include at least one of LOGOUT, BYE, EXIT or KJOB).  Each project-code may
be assigned a set of commands independently -- not all project-codes need
have the same command set.  A set of commands (possibly empty) to be
allowed when the user's current project-code is not one of the listed
project-codes is also included in this data file:  this set of commands will 
be called the "default" command set in later discussion.  After reading
the entire data file, RCMB creates a BLISS source code file containing all of
the project-code::command-set assignments and a set of values representing
the union of all command sets.  This BLISS source code file is then used
to create an RCM in which only the code required for the union of
all command-sets (described in the data file) is incorporated into the
final core image of the RCM program.


RCM is called directly by the monitor to process (almost) all commands
entered at the exec-level prompt if the user is in restricted command 
mode.  RCM first searches the list of project-codes (in-core table) to
find the allowed set of commands for the user's current project-code.
If the project-code is not found, the default command set is used.  After
determining the correct command-set, RCM checks that the command entered
is allowed.  If the command is allowed, RCM dispatches to the apropriate
processor.  If the command is not allowed, RCM prints  ?verb?  (in the same
manner as an unrecognized command) and then prompts for a new command.


The method for creating an RCM for a user is as follows:

A)  Create the input data file RCMLST.DAT, eg:
 -CREATE RCMLST.DAT
 *APPEND
 ;
 LOGOUT
 PROJECT
 ;P.C.1
 MAGNUM
 CREATE
 MODIFY
 LOGOUT
 ;UPDATE.CLERK
 MAGNUM
 LOGOUT
 *EXIT
 RCMLST.DAT
 85 CHARS
 -

 where the semicolon indicates entry of a project-code whose allowed
 command set follows.  The first semicolon (without any project code) is
 always required to appear as the first line.  The list of commands which
 follows this first semicolon is the set of default commands.  Each command
 verb must appear on a line by itself, there must be no blank lines.  Project-
 codes must be proper identifiers: begin with an upper-case alpha, 
 remaining characters must be upper-case alpha, numbers and dot only.

B)  Run RCMB to process the RCMLST.DAT data file to create the RMCLST.BLI
    BLISS source code file:

-RUN (UPL)RCMB



C)  Construct RCM:

-DELETE RCMP2T.REL
-LOAD @(UPL)RCMPKG/SSAVE:RCM


D) Cause the Project-Code-Verification program or user's INIT program
   to set Restricted-Command-Mode and RCM.SHR to be the "Restricted-
   Command-Mode-File".



This prototype RCM has certain limitations due to the monitor and processor
environment in which it must work.  Certain monitor executed commands (eg:
SAVE, GET, ...) may not be used.  Certain processors do not take an 
initial command from a TMPCOR/.TMP file as an alternative to their
normal RESCAN entry.  These processors (eg: SYSTAT, MAGNUM) have been
accustomed to being called directly by the monitor.  (Provisions have
been made to invoke both MAGNUM and SYSTAT, however the user will
currently be required to re-enter portions of his original command.)  These
limitations are expected to be removed when the Tymshare PDP-10
monitor supports gating.
