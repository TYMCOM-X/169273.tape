-----------------------------------------------------------------------


All Tymshare employees are now eligible to participate in the
McDonnell Douglas Foundation Matching Gifts Program.  Tymshare
personnel who contribute to colleges and universities can now
have those gifts matched, dollar for dollar, by the Foundation,
the philanthropic arm of MDC.

Under the Program, any regular full-time employee with at least
one year of service can contribute from a minimum of $25 to a
maximum of $5,000 annually, and have that gift matched by the
Foundation.  The Program applies to contributions made beginning
May 18, 1984.

Schools eligible to receive matching funds must be fully accredited
by a national, regional or professional accrediting association,
and recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as a tax-exempt
institution.  Schools can be private or tax-supported colleges and
junior colleges offering an accredited program of post-secondary
courses leading to an associate degree or higher.  The program
also applies to graduate schools, professional schools and technical
institutes.  Eligible colleges or universities include those
located in the United States and its possessions, Canada and other
countries of the Free World.

Contributions made by MDC personnel must be paid gifts, not pledges.
                                                                Page  2

Payments may be made in cash, by check or in securities.  Employees
need not have attended the school and can contribute to as many
schools as they wish, provided the total amount given by the employee
to be matched does not exceed $5,000 in any year.  There is no
limit to the amount paid by the foundation to any one school, when
matching all the contributions made by company personnel.

To have their contributions matched by the Foundation, employee
donors can fill out a Matching Gifts Program form and send it along
with their contribution to the school.  (For donations made between
May 18 and today's date, the employee can forward the form with a
letter of explanation to the school).  The forms are available
from Jackie Lewis, 314/232-2321 or McAir Dept: 27, Bldg 294,
P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO  63166.

After the school has received the employee gift, it will return the
form to the Foundation.  The matching contribution will then
be made and the employee will be notified.

Questions about the Program can be directed to Michael Witunski,
314/232-5595.
