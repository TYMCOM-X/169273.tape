SUBJECT>   PLACEMENT, ADVANCEMENT, COUNSELING AND TRAINING (PACT) PROGRAM


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The purpose of this bulletin is to re-emphasize some points covered in
the PACT Management Guidelines and to remind managers that PACT can be
an effective tool when used to address changing (growing as well as
declining) business needs.

A basic premise of the PACT program is that it provides an opportunity
for continued employment and growth for employees who have demonstrated
good performance.  Employees with a history of poor performance are not
accepted into the PACT Program.

Summarized below are the major thrusts of PACT.  Please refer to the
PACT Management Guide for detailed procedures.

  1)  Redeployment of Underutilized Employees: Management may submit
      good performers whose specific skills and experience are no
      longer required in their departments.  Paperwork should be
      submitted and acceptance into the program determined prior to
      advising the employee.

  2)  Training:  Curricula and entry requirements are developed by PACT
      and Management to address specific business needs.  Training is
      administered by PACT, and associated costs, including trainees
      salaries, are absorbed by PACT.  Classes include underutilized
      employees, management nominees and volunteers.  Trainees transfer
                                                                Page  2

      into their new departments at the end of the training period.
      Training may include OJT as well as classroom instruction.

  3)  Volunteering for Transfer:  PACT, working with Human Resources,
      administers the internal placement function.  Employees seeking
      a transfer may contact PACT.  Discussions are confidential until
      interest is expressed by a receiving area.

Each division within the Blue Sector has been assigned a PACT coordinator
to assist in utilizing the PACT program.  All submittals for PACT should
be made through your coordinator as identified below.

CIMTEK                    -R. Baldridge         International   -T. Schwab

our business needs and to clarify any questions you may have.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Executive Board of ISG believes we can increase our visibility
in selected major cities by consolidating the facilities of some
or all of our organizations doing business in them.  In these
consolidations we would expect to enhance customer training and
demonstration capability and to reduce costs through streamlining
landlord functions.

Before a plan to implement selected facility consolidations can be
developed, a number of complex tasks need to be accomplished.  We
must review the 490 domestic facilities, understand the unique
requirements of each of the business units, and evaluate all the
existing lease commitments.  To manage this process and be respon-
sible for implementation, Richard B. Miskell is hereby appointed
to the position of Director-ISG Field Facilities.

Dick Miskell has over ten years' experience in field sales manage-
ment and administrative responsibilities for McAuto.  Because of
his background and experience, he brings an understanding of field
management requirements and concerns to this assignment.  Dick will
report to the ISG Executive Board through Gary E. Liebl, who will
provide business guidance, and to C. A. Gaskill, Staff Vice
President, Properties and Facilities, in the Corporate Office for
functional guidance.  Dick's office will be located in the MDC HQ
                                                                Page  2

Building.

ISG Field Facilities will interface with existing ISG component
facility organizations to utilize their ideas, information, and
resources to assist in the planning and implementation of this
program.

Properly managed, this program will free up line management time
currently spent in landlord functions and make the ISG activities
in the selected cities more competitive.  Please give your support
and cooperation to Dick Miskell so that he can fulfill the mission
he has been assigned by the Executive Board.

The ISG Executive Board has decided to establish a centralized
office to organize, coordinate, and oversee the sales activities of
our various ISG units with a number of strategically important
customer accounts.  This should enable us to enhance our capability
to serve the needs of these critical customers now being separately
serviced by two or more of our business units.

To lead this new effort, Charles N. Dignan has been promoted to
the position of Director, Corporate Accounts Program, reporting
through me to the ISG Executive Board.  Charlie has been with MDC
for 23 years, during which he has successfully undertaken numerous
assignments, most recently directing McAuto's International
Operations.  His experience in working with many of our units, as well as a 
wide variety of customer situations, has prepared Charlie well for
this new position.

The success of the ISG Corporate Accounts Program is vital if we
are to have the dramatic impact on our strategic accounts that the
ISG goals require.  Please give your support and cooperation to
Charlie Dignan as he performs this important assignment.

operation.

These individuals bring with them an impressive track record in both
International and Domestic Sales with McAuto.  Their experience in
International will, of course, be of particular value to them in these
positions of increased responsibility.

Congratulations to both with wishes for their continued success.

     Have you every wondered what someone's Ontyme name was?  How often
     have you had to call long-distance to try to find this information?
     How often have you ended up by playing "telephone tag" when you would
     have preferred just to have sent an Ontyme message?
 
     Did you know that over 20 Ontyme Account Supervisors have cooperated
     on an ongoing basis to contribute to an alphabetical Ontyme Directory
     which currently contains the preferred and alternate Ontyme names of
     over 2,300 Tymnet/Tymshare/McDonnell-Douglas employees?  This list is
     distributed monthly to all cooperating Ontyme Account Supervisors,
     who then determine the final distribution for their own Ontyme
     account.
 
     If you use any one of certain Tymcom-370 hosts (40, 47, 48, 49, or
     51), did you know that you can find anyone's Ontyme name within five
     seconds?  You don't even have to know the exact spelling of the per-
     son's name, in most cases!  (One condition:  the person you're check-
     ing for must appear in one of the standardised directories mentioned
     above.)
 
     If this interests you, please join Lois Squires and Peter Haas on
     Tuesday morning, November 20th, at 9:00 in the Tymshare Training Room
     (VG2-A) on Valley Green Drive in Cupertino to find out how you can

For General Ontyme Users
 
 
     make use of these and other on-line Ontyme aids.  The course is
     expected to run for two to three hours.
 
     If you are not yet familiar with Tymcom-370 ("IBM mainframe CMS")
     operations but you can "borrow" a username from someone in your group
     for the morning, there will be an introduction to CMS and 370 editing
     on the previous morning, Monday, November 19th, same hour and place.
     (370 editing is much like editing on Ontyme, except it's significant-
     ly faster and you don't get "timed-out".)
 
     Please look over the attached course outlines to see whether you
     should plan on attending both mornings or just the second morning.
 
     Both mornings are intended for employees with no more "programming"
     knowledge than it takes to work in Ontyme.  All Ontyme Account Super-
     visors are especially encouraged to come, regardless of whether their
     own Ontyme Account is presently included in the on-line directory.
 
     To optimise the presentation, let us know what model of terminal or
     PC you intend to use for your daily work when you call in register to
     participate.  Registration deadline is Monday, November 12th.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The attendees at the Professional Achievement Symposium in 
New Orleans can attest to its being a worthwhile and significant
event. Plans for the next Professional Achievement Symposium
to be held at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
promise that it will be just as exciting. The dates are Tuesday,
21 May, through Friday, 24 May 1985. Ground rules are as follows:

Eligibility
___________

    Employees must have been on board with MDC or an acquired
    company prior to 1 September 1982.

    On 1 February 1985, allocations based on the total
    number of eligible personnel on board as of January 1985
    will be given to each organizational unit reporting directly
    to R.A. Fischer. Specific allocations will be made
    for each of the following:

                 Nonexempt
                 Exempt below manager level
                 Manager level and above

    Personnel eligible for the Tymshare ACES program also will
    attend the Professional Achievement Symposium based on
                                                                Page  2

    qualification under ground rules previously established
    for that program.

    Attendees must be employed by MDC at the time of the meeting.

    Sales personel who are eligible for the Marketing Achievement
    Club cannot attend the Symposium.

Selection
_________

    Selection will be based on sustained superior performance
    and contribution to the success of the business units in 
    the Blue Sector during the past year.

    Selection is the responsibility of management and is not 
    to be based on popularity, drawings or vote of peers.

    All eligible personnel will be considered; there is no
    disqualification due to other awards or selection for the
    previous Symposium.

    Every effort should be made to insure that personnel are
    selected from all levels.

    Names of selected attendees will be submitted to L.D. Grissom
    no later than 15 March 1985.

    If an individual who has been selected declines to attend
    for any reason, no alternate will be allowed and the position
    will remain unfilled.

Spouses
_______

    Spouses will not be included in this program and are 
    strongly discouraged from being present during the meeting
    dates. All attendees are expected to attend all events.



The Blue Sector and ISG have committed to ambitious goals that
will challenge us individually and collectively in the months
ahead, and I'm depending on all of you to contribute
significantly. I look forward to seeing our 
outstanding contributors in San Juan May, 1985.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective 1 January 1985, MDC is forming McDonnell Douglas
Information Systems International (MDISI) , which will
manage Information Systems Group (ISG) marketing outside 
the U.S. and Canada. Jeremy J. (Jerry) Causley will be Senior
Vice President-General Manager of MDISI. Jerry is currently Microdata's
Senior Vice President-European Marketing, Sales, and Service, located
in Hemel Hempstead, England. In his new position Jerry will remain
in England and report to the ISG Executive Board through Gary Liebl.

Between now and 1 January, Jerry will spend time with people in
international activities throughout ISG to assess 
opportunities and develop organizational details. Within major
countries there typically will be MDISI marketing units representing
our major business units and resource units providing field service,
product modifications, and design tailoring for our product lines 
in international markets.

Initially reporting to Jerry will be country managers, primarily
in major European countries where we have direct sales forces,
and regional managers for other areas of the world where we will sell
primarily through distributors.

                                                                Page  2

MDISI will have primary responsibility for pursuit of all business
within the international markets. Secondary responsibility will
reside with the head of the affected business units in the 
United States. MDISI, a business unit and profit center, will
buy products from other ISG business units for resale in the
international markets.

Jerry Causley joined CMC in England in January 1970 as a district
sales manager. CMC was acquired by Microdata in 1977. After a series
of promotions, Jerry was named Managing Director of Microdata
Information Systems Limited in 1980, responsible for all
Microdata sales and service activities in the U.K., Middle East,
and Africa. Early this year he became Senior Vice President of
Microdata Corporation with responsibility for all of
Europe. In his positions of increasing responsibility, Jerry has built
strong teams and achieved outstanding results.

The formation of MDISI and the appointment of Jerry Causley to head
it are major steps in positioning our Information Systems Group to
expand its international operations in the most systematic, efficient,
and aggressive manner possible. I am sure that you will join me in 
giving Jerry our wholehearted cooperation and support.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS BECOMES SOLE WORLDWIDE MARKETER
OF METRO-MARK TRANSLATOR SOFTWARE

     BALTIMORE, Maryland, Nov. 28, 1984 -- McDonnell Douglas
Corporation and Metro-Mark Integrated Systems, Inc. have signed
a contract giving McDonnell Douglas exclusive worldwide marketing
rights to Metro-Marks's Translator(tm) software.

     The announcement was made here today at the Transportation
Data Coordinating Committee (TDCC) annual forum.

     The Translator software, which provides full electronic data
interchange (EDI) translation, is designed to enable users of most
IBM mini microcomputers to transact business electronically.
Metro-Mark in 1982 pioneered electronic data interchange software
for the IBM System/34 and has since developed EDI software for
the IBM Systems/36 and 38, PC XT and AT.  These software packages
give the users of IBM minis and micros the same capabilities
available only to the IBM mainframe users before.

     In a joint statement with Metro-Mark, David Lonsdale,
general manager of EDI services for McDonnell Douglas, said, "The
                                                                Page  2

agreement combines the strengths of both partners--McDonnell
Douglas's substantial resources, its TYMNET(R) data communications
network and EDI-NET services, and Metro-Marks's advanced, proven
EDI software--to provide customers with a total EDI solution
package."

     McDonnell Douglas's EDI-NET service applies electronic data
interchange technology to provide direct computer-to-computer
transmission of business documents between different companies with
dissimilar computers and document formats.  The service integrates
the use of TYMNET with a collection of processing capabilities
to identify, process and deliver documents electronically.

     Metro-Mark Integrated Systems, Inc., New York City, was
established in 1975 to provide management and consulting services
to the grocery industry, especially in computer technology.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS DEVOTES INCREASED RESOURCES
TO DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING OF EDI-NET SERVICES

     BALTIMORE, Maryland, Nov. 28, 1984 -- McDonnell Douglas
Corporation announced here today that it has substantially
increased support for the development and marketing of its
value-added data communications service called EDI-NET(tm).

     Making the announcement at the annual forum of the
Transportation Data Coordinating Committee (TDCC), David
Lonsdale, general manager of EDI (electronic data interchange)
services for the Information Systems Group of McDonnell
Douglas, said the company has about 65 marketing, sales,
development and support people dedicated to the services.

     McDonnell Douglas began strengthening the support of
EDI-NET after the company acquired the product with its
purchase of Tymshare, Inc. earlier this year.  Tymshare
introduced EDI-NET at the TDCC Forum in Washington, D.C.
last year.  Lonsdale said that by the end of the first
quarter of 1985, McDonnell Douglas expects to increase the
EDI-NET staff to about 75, more than triple what it was a
                                                                Page  2

year ago.

     Lonsdale added that EDI-NET services are being used by
more than 50 companies, among them are Hewlett-Packard,
Dow Chemical and Super Valu stores.

     The EDI-NET service, which applies more than 15 years of
industry development in electronic data interchange technology,
allows direct computer-to-computer transmission of business
documents between different companies with dissimilar
computers and document formats.  EDI-NET service integrates
use of McDonnell Douglas's public packet data communications
network, TYMNET(R), with a collection of processing
capabilities to identify, process and deliver documents
electronically.

     Going beyond electronic mail, electronic data interchange
delivers a highly formatted message that can be directly
processed by the recipient's computer, thereby eliminating
data entry.  Although any data can be sent via EDI-NET,
attention so far has been given to purchase orders, invoices
and physical distribution documents.

     For an organization capable of generating a standard
message, EDI-NET provides a store-and-forward service for
message distribution.  The service is capable of handling
any standard message, including the Uniform Communication
Standard (UCS) widely used by the grocery industry, and the
more generic American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12
standard.  Hardware linked to the system includes IBM, DEC,
Burroughs, Honeywell, Univac and Wang equipment.

     EDI-NET provides for a variety of delivery options: the
store-and-retrieve option permits a user to dial the McDonnell
Douglas host to send and receive from disk storage using an
electronic mailbox; in another option, the host dials a
customer's computer system directly to initiate data exchange.
Also included in the service is store-and-forward delivery.

     A purchase order sent electronically arrives, generally,
four to five days sooner than one sent by existing mail delivery.
For a buyer, the result is a reduction in inventory costs and
closer inventory control.  For vendors, computer-to-computer
transmission eliminates data entry, reduces errors and permits
improved customer service.

     For organizations unable to generate or process an
industry standard message, EDI-NET service translates to or
from a user format to produce compatible formats.  It also
translates across standards to communicate with the electronic
purchase order systems now used by large retailers.

     McDonnell Douglas provides communications testing,
operations support, backup, security, extensive audit trails
and statistics in support of its EDI-NET users.  The system
is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

TWO NEW UNIVERSAL DISK HEAD TESTERS AVAILABLE FROM TYMSHARE

     CUPERTINO, Calif., January 11, 1985 -- Tymshare's Computer
Systems and Support (CSS) division has developed two new universal
disk head testers that provide significant cost savings to users
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, and
by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.

     Developed by the Depot Repair Group in Westlake Village,
Calif., the new products are models 4060P, a portable device for
use in the field, and 4060D, a stationary unit.  Both are
designed for the testing and certification of 100, 200 and 300
megabyte removeable read/write disk heads for most original
equipment manufacturers, including Ampex, Control Data, Cal Comp,
Century Data and Memorex.

     Test data includes reading at highest and lowest write
frequencies, resolution percentage and overwrite in decibels.

     Testing is done on inner and outer tracks with surface
range adjustable.  Test data is available in both CRT display
and hard copy.

                                                                Page  2

     Prices of the testers currently start at $19,500 and
include a CRT, printer and 8-hour training class.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field
maintenance, equipment staging and field engineer training for
the computer industry.  It is part of the Information Systems
Group of McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

SUBJECT>   MCDONNELL DOUGLAS REPORTS 1984 EARNINGS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


ST. LOUIS, Jan. 25, 1985 -- McDonnell Douglas Corporation earned
$325.3 million or $8.10 per share on sales of $9,662.6 million in
1984.  Earnings in 1983 were $274.9 million or $6.91 per share on
sales of $8,111.0 million.

Fourth quarter 1984 earnings were $91.7 million or $2.28 per
share on sales of $2,624.4 million.  In 1983's fourth quarter
earnings were $82.6 million or $2.07 per share on sales of $2,063.2
million.

Hughes Helicopters, Inc., and Computer Sharing Services, Inc.,
which were acquired by McDonnell Douglas early in 1984, are included
in the results for the entire year.  Tymshare, Inc., a computer
services and value-added networking company acquired on March 30, is
included in results for the final three quarters.

Sales in 1984 were higher than 1983's in all product lines
except space systems and missiles, where they remained essentially
unchanged.  The gain was especially strong in combat aircraft and
information systems, but in both cases it resulted primarily from
acquisitions.

Pre-tax earnings in the corporation's combat aircraft line of
                                                                Page  2

business were $483.0 million in 1984, compared with $372.9 million
in 1983, and were achieved despite provision for costs involved in
strengthening the tail sections of previously delivered F/A-18s.
The transport aircraft segment's pre-tax earnings of $56.7 million
compared with a loss of $51.9 million in 1983.  In both combat
aircraft and transport aircraft, the increases resulted largely from
cost reduction initiatives.

The information systems line of business posted a pre-tax loss
of $45.3 million for 1984, compared with a $18.9 million loss the
previous year.  Results for 1984 include a charge of $46.4 million
for amortization resulting from the revaluation of assets purchased
in the corporation's Tymshare and Computer Sharing Services
acquisitions.

Pre-tax earnings in the space systems and missiles segment were
$36.2 million in 1984, compared with $100.7 million in 1983.  Most
of this decline was caused by two previously reported developments:
costs of investigating problems with the Payload Assist Module, and
high proposal costs incurred in bidding on new programs.

Interest costs were higher in 1984 than in 1983, primarily
because of increased borrowings required to complete the acquistions
of Hughes Helicopters, Tymshare and Computer Sharing Services.

Firm backlog on December 31, 1984 was $14,967.8 million,
compared with $10,733.9 million at the end of 1983.  This backlog
excludes orders not yet funded to the corporation, orders being
negotiated as continuations of authorized programs, and commercial
orders subject to contingencies.

Total backlog, including these additional amounts but excluding
options and aircraft being built for short-term lease, was
approximately $22,460.2 million on December 31, 1984, compared with
approximately $17,337.9 million a year earlier.

Employment at the end of 1984 was 88,391 compared with 74,466 at
the end of 1983.

MD-80 program status as of December 31 included 131 firm orders,
6 aircraft being built for lease to airlines by McDonnell Douglas or
other lessors, 170 conditional orders and options and 195 deliveries
for a total of 502 aircraft.

MDC Standards (IRM Standards Section 3.6, dated 7 Sept 84) provides a
list of preferred hardware and software standards that include office
automation and personal computers.  For ISG Blue Sector use, we are
continuing with only the IBM Personal Computer, IBM Personal Computer
XT and IBM Displaywriter for Word Processing as the Desktop Computers
and Word Processing devices approved for automated office systems.

IBM Displaywriter is the standard system for word processing.  User
Support Centers (USC) will provide support for all installed Wang
Systems, but expansion of Wang Systems, which require procurement of
hardware or software, is not authorized.

Configurations have been modified to add additional productivity
software, a letter quality printer and a math coprocessor to the IBM
PC, eliminate the DEC PR0350 configuration, and add asynchronous
communications capability to the Displaywriter.

The User Support Centers are available to provide information and
assistance for configurations and ordering.  USC phone number are:

     St. Louis - 314/233-5116

The ordering of supplies from Stationery in MDISG St. Louis will be
handled as follows:

     -- MDISG will provide Stationery items, MDC and ACF Forms to all 
        Blue Sector offices of the former Tymshare organization.

     -- MDISG St. Louis will provide the Tymshare Gold Sector with only
        the MDC and ACF forms.  Any other stationery and supplies
        required by the Gold Sector locations should be obtained from
        the normal Tymshare sources until further notice.

Requesters should understand that all efforts are being made to
acquire sufficient supplies to meet their needs.  Most of our supplies
are obtained via the MCAIR organization and the quantities being
requested are exceeding planned levels of support.

Effective 4 March 1985, the complete cost for all meals for clients,
guests and their hosts in Guest Dining will be charged to the 
department making the reservation.  This will make the experience
less institutional by eliminating the need to ask the guest to check
a box and have an employee sign for the meal.  Internal meal events
will now be treated the same as business meals taken at a local
restaurant.

Each place setting will have the buffet menu, printed on a 
single-sided card, for information only.  The waitress will
take beverage and dessert orders.

If there are any questions on how this will be administered, please
call Al Schikore at (314) 232-2745 or Shirley Meyer at
(314) 233-5196.

SUBJECT>   SPOUSE TRAVEL POLICY


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


MDC policy regarding spouse travel is as follows:  "Any married
salaried employee whose duties require frequent trips for MDC may
be accompanied by spouse, at MDC expense, on a business trip when the
presence of the spouse is considered to be appropriate to the 
business purpose of the trip."  The approval presently required is
a component head with no delegations allowed.

A recent corporatewide audit of this subject revealed that it is
working effectively; however, there is some confusion within several
MDC components over who is the appropriate approval authority.

To clarify this within ISG, John McDonnell has delegated approval
authority for spouse travel to R. A. Fischer (Blue Sector) and
G. E. Liebl (Gold Sector).  No further delegations are authorized
at this time.

SUBJECT>   ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective Feb. 19, 1985, I am establishing a new organization called Advanced
Products Development, combining the Computer Technology Group originating
in Tymshare and the GEMSTONE Group from Microdata.  Historically, both
of these organizations have been commissioned with the responsibility
of investigating and developing state-of-the-art operating systems, office
automation capabilities, and fourth-generation tools.

The individual responsible for this new organization will be Mr. Frank
J. Reinhart, who will have the title Vice President, Advanced Products
Development.  Frank has functioned over the past year as a Vice President
of Microdata and has worked with me on ISG projects involving both
Tymshare and Microdata activities.  Prior to this special assignment,
Mr. Reinhart was Vice President, U.S. Engineering, for Microdata
Corporation.

Mr. Laszlo L. Rakoczi, Group Vice President, Computer Technology Group,
has resigned that role and will function as a consultant to ISG on 
special assignments and projects designated by me.  I would like to
acknowledge the contributions Laz has made to Tymshare over the years
and, subsequently, to ISG.  I look forward to taking maximum advantage
of Laz's unique experience and capability in this new role.

During the transitional phase integrating GEMSTONE and Computer
Technology, Frank Reinhart will be accountable to Paul W. Wiedenmann
                                                                Page  2

with regard to the GEMSTONE project and to me for Computer Technology
activities.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these 
organizational changes.  Also, please join me in wishing both Frank
and Laz the best of luck in their new assignments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I am pleased to announce the following re-assignments with regard
to law support for the Gold Sector.

     Henry G. Kohlmann will now function as Chief Counsel for the
     Gold Sector businesses and will be accountable directly to me.

     As before, he will also function as Chief Counsel for McDonnell
     Douglas Computer Systems Company and will be accountable directly
     to Paul W. Wiedenmann, its Executive Vice President, in that role.

     Arthur Cohen will be the new Deputy Chief Counsel of McDonnell
     Douglas Computer Systems Company.  He will report to Henry
     Kohlmann in that role.  In addition, Cohen will function as Deputy
     Chief Counsel for the Gold Sector businesses whenever Kohlmann is
     absent.

     Charles Faubion will function as Deputy Chief Counsel
     for Tymnet and will be the senior ISG lawyer for the ISG 
     Cupertino/San Jose area.  While he will functionally report
     directly to Kohlmann with regard to the law function, he will
     report administratively to Warren Prince in providing legal services
     to Tymnet.  To the extent that his department in Cupertino
     supports Blue Sector personnel, he and his staff will coordinate
     closely with Stan Bjurstrom, Blue Sector Chief Counsel.

                                                                Page  2

     Kohlmann will function as Chief Counsel of Tymnet.

     We are currently in the process of identifying a suitable Chief
     Counsel for McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International.
     When that individual is announced, he or she will report 
     administratively to Jerry Causley of MDISI and functionally to the
     office of the Vice President-General Counsel of MDC.  In the
     interim, Kohlmann's organization, in combination with Tom Bottini
     in St. Louis, will support Jerry Causley and MDISI as required.

I would like to congratulate each of the individuals referenced in
this memo on his new assignment and ask your cooperation in assisting
them in their transitions and new roles.  Please feel free to contact
John Sant, Hank Kohlmann, or me if you have any questions.

I am pleased to announce the promotion of Jenny Preston to Manager,
Library Services, effective 11 February 1985.

Since joining McAuto in May of 1980, Jenny has worked to develop the
Library, its staff and services into the strong service-oriented
organization that it is today.  Jenny's academic training (a Master's
Degree in Library Science) and her considerable previous experience
have served her well in this task.  Initially appointed to develop a
library for McAuto, she has established a major collection on the
information industry where none existed before.  Under her management,
the Library has expanded its services to meet the needs of a growing
number of patrons throughout MDC in locations across the country.

In her new position, Jenny will continue to be responsible for the
Library in St. Louis.  She will also be responsible for a branch of
that facility to be opened at McDonnell Douglas Communications
Industry Services Company in Denver in April.  Please join me in
extending congratulations to Jenny on this much-deserved promotion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To improve OnTyme's availability and responsiveness to users in the
'TYM' OnTyme account, it has become necessary to bring up another
OnTyme system and spin off two groups of users into new accounts.
They are:

   TYMOPS     Tymnet Operatons - personnel reporting thru Bob Tomasi
   TYMNFE     Tymnet Field Engineering - personnel reporting thru Curt Miller

These new IDs are valid now - so you should address all correspondene
as appropriate to these IDs.

For a complete listing of personnel in these two new accounts, and
those who remain in the TYM account, read:

           *** DIRECT.TYM
           *** DIRECT.TYMNFE
           *** DIRECT.TYMOPS

Please reflect these changes in any distribution lists you may be using.
Those now valid in TYMOPS and TYMNFE will be having their TYM ids
deleted on March 22.

Also, due to the chargeback system now in place for computer resources,
we will begin deleting all TYM ids belonging to persons in organizations
which have their own OnTyme accounts.  For example, FIN, INTL, ACS,
PMTS, etc.

Since inter-OnTyme allows us to communicate across systems, there is no
justification for people outside of Tymnet to have TYM ids any more.

If you are not valid in your own division (or department's) OnTyme account
or know of anyone, please be sure to get (them) validated immediately
in the proper account.

We will be notifying 'non-Tymnet' 'TYM' users later in the month
as to when these IDs will be cancelled.

For now, however, remember to message Tymnt Operations and Field
Engineering personnel at their NEW IDs.

Thank you.

    in a brief case." Remote computer access becomes as easy as using a
    telephone. 
 
    Applications 
 
    Typical applications for the Model 130 teleprinter include timesharing,
    data base access, and electronic mail and messages. Accessing real
    estate multiple listisngs or insurance quotes and coverages are just two
    applications for which the model 130 proves ideal. 
 
    Benefits and Key Selling Points 
 
    * It has all the functions needed for doing business in or out of the
    office. 
 
    * Weighing only 5.9 pounds, it's easy to carry, and the price is easy on
    your pocketbook. 
     
    * The direct connect feature gets your computer online for fast
    answers.

    to have phone booth access to your computer.

             PROMOTION OF DAVID M. LONSDALE





I am pleased to announce the promotion of David M. Lonsdale to Director of 
McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange Systems Company.

the effort to structure and package the service offering, as well as 
significantly improving the overall quality of service.

Please join me in congratulating David on his promotion.  Your continued 
cooperation with him will be appreciated.

I am very pleased to announce the appointment of Bernard "Bernie"
Hathaway to the position of Vice President, Productivity for the
Gold Sector of the Information Systems Group.  In this position,
Bernie will report directly to me and will be responsible for
the introduction of formal productivity and performance improvement
programs throughout the Gold Sector as well as coordination with
McDonnell Doulgas Corporate Productivity Council.

Bernie's three years of experience as Microdata/McDonnell Douglas
Computer Systems Company's Senior Vice President of Manufacturing
coupled with his two years of service on the Corporate Productivity
Council have prepared him well for this assignment.  We have few
higher priorities than productivity improvement and the talent and
experience that Bernie will provide is necessary support for this
effort.

Please join me in congratulating Bernie on his new assignment
and providing your support to him as we more actively strive to
improve our productivity posture.

                         ************************
 
 
    DSC is anouncing a Product CHANGE to an already existing Product--The
    Model 130 Portable KSR Teleprinter. 
 
    Until now, the Model 130 has been available as a standard Portable KSR
    Terminal with several options. It is now being made available in four
    configurations which include various combinations of options. So when
    ordering Portable KSR Printers, be sure and use the new Model Numbers. 
 
 
 
    Product Position 
 
    The Model 130 is a product whose time has definitely come. No matter
    what your customer or prospect is selling, they can now carry the
    solution with them. Its small (11"x8"x2") size enables "portability
    in a brief case." Remote computer access becomes as easy as using a
    telephone. 
 
    Applications 
 
    Typical applications for the Model 130 teleprinter include timesharing,
    data base access, and electronic mail and messages. Accessing real
    estate multiple listisngs or insurance quotes and coverages are just two
    applications for which the model 130 proves ideal. 
 
    Benefits and Key Selling Points 
 
    * It has all the functions needed for doing business in or out of the
    office. 
 
    * Weighing only 5.9 pounds, it's easy to carry, and the price is easy on
    your pocketbook. 
     
    * The direct connect feature gets your computer online for fast
    answers. 
 
    * The Model 130's built-in battery pack and acoustic coupler enable you
    to have phone booth access to your computer.

From time-to-time the OnTyme system has been used to recruit
internal candidates for vacant positions.  While this worked
effectively in a smaller organizational setting, it is now       
deemed to be an inappropriate means of announcing internal 
opportunities.  
 
Tymshare's job posting program is coordinated by Marlene Page          
in Cupertino (408/446-7451) who you should contact if you wish         
to post a job internally.  Your cooperation in observing this
request to not use OnTyme for job posting purposes is             
appreciated.

        SUBJECT:  TTE'S JULY - DECEMBER SCHEDULE OF CLASSES 
     
        Attached is TTE's Class Schedule for July through December, 1985.  
     
        The schedule is in chart form.  The dates shown across the top of the   
        chart are the Monday dates for each week.  The numbers down the first   
        column indicate the TTE course by its number.  
     
        An entry is made in the appropriate row/column for each scheduled  
        class.  Entries consist of a number and one or more letters.  The  
        number indicates how many days the class will meet.  The letters   
        specify which weekday will be the first day of class.  Weekdays are
        represented as follows:    
     
           M  = Monday   
           T  = Tuesday  
           W  = Wednesday
           TH = Thursday 
           F  = Friday   
     
        An * entry represents the carry-over of an ongoing class into its  
        second week.
     
        Advanced registration is required for all courses.  All requests for    
        registration must be received by TTE a minimum of thirty (30) days 
        prior to the class.  See the TTE 1985 brochure for instructions on 
        how to register. 
     
        There have been some changes to the TTE curriculum since the 1985  
        brochure was published.  These changes, reflected in the attached  
        schedule, will be described in an Addendum to the 1985 brochure,   
        which will be available shortly.  If you need further information, 
        contact Laura Lutz at (408) 435-0239, Ext. 501.
     
        July through December classes will be held in the new TTE facility 
        located at 2665 North First Street, Suite 150, San Jose, California.

It is a pleasure to announce the promotion of Judith K. Hill to 
Section Manager-Human Resources, effective 29 March 1985.  Judy 
will be responsible for the West Coast-Cypress Human Resources 
function as MDAIS separates.

Judy has held a variety of positions of increasing responsibility, 
both in St. Louis and on the West Coast, during her tenure at 
McDonnell Douglas.  She was most recently Administrator-Human 
Resources and was instrumental in the design of the new 
Performance Appraisal System.

Your support of Judy in her new position will be greatly 
appreciated.

Subject: IBM Value Added Dealer Arrangement 

 
 
    MCDONNELL DOUGLAS 
    DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS COMPANY 
    MEMORANDUM 
    3240-JMG-0002 
    8 MAY 1985 
 
 
    TO:       All ISG Sales Offices and Business Unites 
 
 
    FROM:     Jan Giordano 
              Product Manager 
 
 
    RE:       IBM Value Added Dealer Arrangement 
 
 
    1.   Through  McDonnell Douglas Distributed Systems Company's 
         Value Added Dealer (VAD) arrangement with IBM,  all  ISG 
         sales  representative's  and  business  units  have  the 
         opportunity to remarket the IBM PC product line. 
          
    2.   A  Value  Added Dealer adds significant value  to  these 
         products before offering them to customers.   Typically, 
         this  added value takes the form of a total  application 
         solution,  and  may also include the integration of non-
         IBM hardware and software with the IBM system. 
          
    3.   As a McDonnell Douglas sales rep, you have available one 
         of the broadest IBM VAD arrangements.   According to our 
         agreement  with IBM,  you can sell an IBM PC in a  value 
         added  application  as  long as it  is  CONFIGURED  WITH 
         COMMUNICATION  SOFTWARE  AND HARDWARE AND  IS  CONNECTED 
         THROUGH THE NETWORK (TYMNET) TO A HOST COMPUTER. 
          
    4.   Every IBM PC product distributed by Distributed  Systems 
         is   already  configured  with  communication   software 
         (TYMCOMM) and hardware (Hayes 1200 baud modem).  All you 
         need   to   supply  is  an  application  that   includes 
         connection through Tymnet to a host computer.  There are 
         no  stipulations  to the amount of time the PC  must  be 
         connected to the network.  
          
    5.   A NOTE ON VALUE ADDED APPLICATIONS. 
     
         A typical value added application would be to use the PC 
         off  line to collect and validate transactions and  then 
         connect  to the host at the end of the day to  send  the 
         batch of transactions. 
 
         The  emphasis  of  the  sale  must  be  on  the  network 
         application and NOT ON THE HARDWARE. 
 
         For example: The annual cost for a networked application 
         is $12,000 and the cost of an IBM PC/XT is $8,000.   The 
         customer  is  sold  a SOLUTION to fill his needs  for  a 
         first year cost of $20,000.   The SOLUTION you presented 
         includes delivery on an IBM PC. 

 
 
    6.   WHAT  HAPPENS  IF  THE SALE DOES NOT MEET  THE  IBM  VAD 
         REQUIREMENTS? 
 
         Fear not, there are choices available: 
 
 
         a. First,  IBM gives encouragement to VADs to apply  for 
            incremental  application  approval.    This  involves 
            giving   IBM   a  business  plan  for  the   proposed 
            additional application. 
               
         b. Second,  if the application is not approved or is not 
            of  sufficient  quantity,  a call to  the  IBM  sales 
            office or a local IBM retailer to supply the hardware 
            may save the computing services sales. 
               
         c. Third,  also  available  to  you to  market  to  your 
            customers  is the Texas Instruments Professional  PC. 
            There  are no application restrictions in selling the 
            TI product line.   A list of TI PC's are found in *** 
            DSD.TIPRICE. 
               
    7.   I M P O R T A N T ! ! ! 
 
         Every  order received by Distributed Systems for an  IBM 
         PC  Product  must include a short  memo  describing  the 
         application  including  how  the PC fits  into  the  VAD 
         requirements (i.e.,  connection through TYMNET to host).  
         Subsequent  orders for the same application to the  same 
         customer   only   require   a  copy   of   the   orginal 
         justification memo. 
          
    8.   For  a  list of the IBM PC products available to you  to 
         include  in an integrated application,  see  the  Ontyme 
         public file:  *** DSD.IBMPRICE. 
          
    If  you  have any questions,  please contact Jan Giordano  at 
    (408)446-6478 or via Ontyme at DSD.J/GIORDANO.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Please be aware that the former 'TTMS' account no longer
exists.  The new account name has changed to 'TNAD', Tymnet
Network Applications Division.

Starting Saturday (5-11), you must - in place of TTMS - 
preface a former TTMS userid with TNAD.  For instance, former
TTMS.A/RICHARDSON is now TNAD.A/RICHARDSON.  

A new directory is available for your review:  *** DIRECT.TNAD.
However, ALL userids are the same, aside from the account.
(For example, TNAD = ACCOUNT, A/RICHARDSON = USERID).

There will be more account changes to come, as Information
Services Group reorganizes and changes names.  Thanks for
your patience as our OnTyme Support Group continues to 
rename accounts in order to accurately reflect each   
organization.  We will keep you advised of all modifications.

APPROXIMATELY 150,000 AUTHORIZATIONS MONTHLY IN A 24 HOUR OPERATION.

INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW TELECHECK OFFICE.

AFTER SIX MONTHS IN HIS ALBANY ASSIGNMENT, BERNIE TRANSFERRED TO SAN

To:    MDC Employees Who Were Formerly Tymshare Employees
 
From:  C. H. Ridings
 
 
McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) has for many years 
supported charitable and community service activities 
through the MDC Employee Charity & Community Services (ECCS) 
program.  The primary source of the funds for the MDC ECCS 
program has been MDC employee contributions.
 
In the near future MDC employees who were formerly Tymshare 
employees will be contacted regarding their individual 
participation in the MDC ECCS program.  MDC ECCS uses 
employee contributions to support charitable and community 
services in the employee's local geographic area.
 
An example of local support is the following letter that I 
recently sent along with an MDC ECCS $1,000 contribution to 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa Clara County, 
Santa Clara, California:
 
     Ms. Nancy J. Wolff
     National Multiple Sclerosis Society
     Santa Clara County Chapter
     1765 Scott Boulevard, Suite 101
     Santa Clara, California 95050
 
     Dear Ms. Wolff:
 
     Pursuant to our telephone conversation of today, 
     McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC) is pleased to 
     enclose MDC's Employee Charity & Community Services 
     check number 207302 totalling $l,000.
 
     The enclosed check is a contribution to the operating 
     funds of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Santa 
     Clara County, Santa Clara, California.  Please use the 
     contribution to continue the fine work your organiza
     tion is doing on a local and national basis.
 
     Please contact me at (408) 446-6405 if you have any 
     questions regarding the above.
 
 
Please be generous with your contributions when you are 
contacted for participation in the MDC ECCS program.

SUBJECT:  Fixed Asset Policies and Procedures
 
 
Following  is  a  brief summary of current Fixed  Asset  policies  and 
procedures  for McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems (headed 
by  Warren Prince) and specifically those locations whose  assets  are 
tracked  in  Cupertino,  CA.   Detail information can be found in  the 
Tymshare Policies and Procedures manual,  of which all managers should 
have a copy.   Current policies and procedures are being reviewed, and 
updated  versions will be released during the third quarter.   If  you 
have any questions, feel free to call me at (408) 446-6516.
 
1.   Capitalization Policy
 
     A.   The  requestor must complete the standard  Requisition  form 
          and the Authorization for Capital Expenditure (AFCE) for any 
          capital  item  of $1000 or more having a useful life  of  at 
          least  one  year.   This is an increase from the $400  limit 
          stated in the current Policies and Procedures manual.
 
     B.   When  determining  whether or not an item  meets  the  $1000 
          criteria,  you should take into account all elements of cost 
          including taxes,  freight,  installation costs and any other 
          charges incurred in preparing the item for service.
 
     C.   Completed  Requisition/AFCE packages should be submitted to: 
          McDonnell Douglas ISG, Fixed Asset Dept., 20705 Valley Green 
          Drive, Cupertino, CA  95014.
 
2.   Internal Transfer of Fixed Assets
 
     A.   A  new department is being established called Asset  Control 
          whose  responsibility  it will be to track the  movement  of 
          assets throughout the company.  The Asset Control department 
          must be notified of any physical movement of capital  assets 
          between cost centers and locations on an accurate and timely 
          basis.
     
     B.   Notification  must  be  made using the  Fixed  Asset  Change 
          Notice, a copy of which can be found in the current Policies 
          and  Procedures manual.   Completed forms should be sent  to 
          the attention of Peggy Bollinger at:  McDonnell Douglas ISG, 
          Asset Control Dept., 20705 Valley Green Drive, Cupertino, CA  
          95014.
 
     C.   Note:   Asset Control must also be notified when offices are 
          relocated.
 
3.   Lost or Stolen Assets 
 
     A.   Any  fixed assets which are lost or stolen must be  reported 
          to  the  Fixed Asset department for removal from  the  Fixed 
          Asset  System  (PIMS).   A  Lost  Equipment  Form  is  being 
          designed; in the meantime, please use the Fixed Asset Change 
          Notice discussed in the previous section.
 
     B.   Notification  of stolen assets must be accompanied by a copy 
          of the related police report.
 
     C.   Notification  should  be sent to:   McDonnell  Douglas  ISG, 
          Fixed Asset Dept.,  20705 Valley Green Drive,  Cupertino, CA  
          95014.
 
4.   Disposal of Fixed Assets
 
     A.   If  you have any equipment which you are no longer using  or 
          that needs to be disposed of,  contact Bobbie Hynes, Section 
          Manager of Equipment Disposition and  Sales,  at:  McDonnell 
          Douglas,  Equipment Disposition & Sales, 7300 Anacunda Ave., 
          Garden  Grove,  CA  92641 - phone:  (714) 952-6555.   Bobbie 
          will determine whether anyone else in the organization has a 
          use  for the equipment,  or will dispose of it for the  best 
          possible price.  You can also contact her if you are in need 
          of a particular piece of equipment.
 
5.   Fixed Asset Reports
 
     A.   Reports  are available from Fixed Assets per  your  request.  
          If  you  would  like  to receive a report or  be  put  on  a 
          distribution  list,  please  contact  Barbara  McIntyre  via 
          Ontyme  at  FIN.FIXEDASSETS.    Please  include  information 
          desired,  cost center(s), and the time period needed for the 
          report.
 
6.   Tagging New Assets
 
     A.   In  order to maintain and control accurate  asset  tracking 
          procedures,  it  is important that new capital equipment  be 
          tagged in an accurate and timely manner.
 
 
 
 
     B.   Only  equipment identified as capital (fixed) assets  should 
          be tagged.   Check the account number coding on the purchase 
          order  or requisition to make sure that the items have  been 
          approved as capital equipment.
 
     C.   Upon receipt,  place a tag on the equipment and fill out the 
          Asset  Control  Log.   The  Asset  Control  Logs  should  be 
          submitted  on  a  monthly  basis  to  Peggy  Bollinger   at: 
          McDonnell  Douglas ISG,  Asset Control Dept.,  20705  Valley 
          Green  Drive,  Cupertino,  CA  95014.   You can also contact 
          Peggy  at (408) 446-7760 if you have any questions  or  need 
          more tags.

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
 
A number of changes to payroll input and personnel record keeping 
will be necessitated by the implementation of the ISG Benefit 
Plans on September 30, l985.  Some of these changes are:
 
   .  New payroll attendance reporting system utilizing new
      format of absence reporting for all employees.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled shift.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' schedule work
      week.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled hours.
      Note:  ISG full benefit eligibility is based on full time
      status (40 hrs/week).  Partial benefit eligibility is based 
      on part-time scheduled to work 20 - but less than
      40 hrs/wk.  Employees scheduled to work less than
      20 hrs/week are not eligible.
 
   .  Check stub will indicate the balance of vacation days
      remaining.
 
   .  There will be no borrowed vacation days under the ISG
      Benefit Plan.
 
Due to the above changes during the week of September 23, all 
managers will need to submit the following information for each 
of their employees via a prompt program:
 
  1)  Scheduled Shift
 
  2)  Scheduled Work Week
 
  3)  Scheduled Hours Per Week

field personnel.
 
At this time, we need to have you provide us with the name of the

controlling   inventory  procedures  at  your   location.    This 
information  must  be  sent  via  Ontym  to   FIN.FIXEDASSETS  by

          previously tagged
 
Preliminary  inventory instruction will be distributed via  Ontym 
by September 6, 1985 for field review.  Any questions or comments 
should  be  directed to Peggy Bollinger at (408) 446-7760 or  Bob

center will be mailed to contact personnel by September 13, 1985.  
If  you do not receive this information by Friday,  September 20, 
1985  please  contact either Peggy or Bob at  the  above  numbers 
immediately.

The OnTyme Account, CPC, Commercial Processing Center, will be 
renamed this Saturday, 9-14, to IPC, Information Processing 
Center.  What does this mean to you??  Please take special note 
of the following:
 
     *  The only change involved in this rename is a change in 
the account code, from CPC to IPC.  The usernames (after the 
period), will not alter.  For instance:
 
          Bev Martin, (also CPC.SUP), has a personal userid, 
          CPC.B/MARTIN.  Only her account code is changing, the 
          username remains the same.  Starting Monday, her new 
          userid is IPC.B/MARTIN.  All other CPC userids are 
          affected in the same manner.
          
     *  Withhold any messages you wish to send to any CPC users 
from Thursday 1700 PDT (9-12) until Sunday 1700 PDT (9-15).  Send 
these messages Monday (9-16) to the new IPC userid.
 
     *  If you have any distribution lists which currently 
include CPC userids, remember to change CPC to IPC.
 
     *  If you wish to verify a userid, read *** DIRECT.IPC for 
an entire listing of userids under IPC.

                                                                Page  2

 
 3)  For questions regarding vacation schedules and advances, call
     (314) 233-2974.
 
 4)  As a backup to the above OnTyme procedure, vacation schedules 
     can be called in to ISG Human Resources at (314) 232-7490.
 
 5)  It will be the responsibility of the office managers to 
     satisfy internal approvals before the schedule is transmitted 
     to PPS II for input.  This can be accomplished through the 
     use of MDC form #4006-2 which, when approved, would be 
     retained by department supervision.
 
 6)  Cancellations will be processed in the same manner.  Include 
     the same information along with the message "cancel 
     vacation".
 
 7)  Vacation advances will be made in 5 day increments only.
     NOTE: No vacation advance will be issued for schedules
           which include unearned and therefore borrowed days
           under the "Accelerated Vacation Policy". Vacations
           consisting partly or totaly of borrowed days will 
           not be pre-scheduled as outlined above rather they
           are to be reported throught the payroll attendance 
           system at the time the vacation is taken.
 
 8)  Vacation schedules for less than 5 days will not be advanced.  
     No schedule is to be reported to PPS II.  These days will be 
     reported through the weekly attendance collection system.
 
 9)  Vacation advance checks will be issued the Friday prior to 
     the first day of vacation.
 
10)  This procedure will become effective with vacations beginning
     on or after 10-14-85.  Approved vacation schedules for that 
     date or later should be submitted at your earliest       
     convenience to insure advance pay.
 
11)  Direct your questions to the writer via OnTyme HRD.TOSH.

1.  In addition to the information which you are being asked
    to supply Sept 24-26 regarding vacation days taken in 1985, 
    you will be asked to identify the number of days vacation
    taken between August 26 and September 29.  This information
    is needed to accurately comply with the requirements of the
    ISG Accelerated Vacation Policy.
 
2.  When logged into the Payroll Data Collection system September
    24, 25 or 26, you will first be prompted to input the number
    of vacation days taken in 1985 which were earned after
    January 1, 1985. (Vacation time taken against 1984 carryover is
    not to be included.)

    days taken since August 26, 1985 through September 29.  This

SUBJECT>   NEW PROCEDURES - CHANGES TO HRD ONTYME FILES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the Benefit Conversion and the new Payroll Attendance 
System, Human Resources has found it necessary to make some
changes to the *** HRD exec files on Ontyme.  The ONTYME 
programs will be revised effective September 30. All prior formats
after that date cannot be accepted, due to these changes.
 
 *  NEW HIRES, REHIRES AND CHANGES FROM TEMP TO PERM
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.NEWEMPLOYEE
 
We have added scheduled shift, hours and work week.  These items must be
entered for all employees. For part time employees also note that 
weekly/annual base pay is to be calculated on a 40 hour work week.  
All appropriate paperwork must continue to be sent to Human Resources and
your Personnel Coordinator if applicable.
 
Assigned shift times are as follows:
     
 1st Shift:  If start time is between  4:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon
 2nd Shift:  If start time is between 12:00 noon and  8:00 p.m.
 3rd Shift:  If start time is between  8:00 p.m. and  4:00 a.m.
 
 *  TERMINATIONS
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.TERMINATION
                                                                Page  2

 
Since vacation time will be tracked on PPS II we have deleted accrued
and carryover vacation from this exec.
 
 
 *  JOB STATUS AND PERSONAL STATUS CHANGES
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.CHANGES
 
This  exec has been added to,  due to the benefit  changes.   Use 
this exec to report and change to scheduled shift, scheduled work
week (days off), or scheduled work hours.  A memo from Dan Tosh
dated  Aug  15 is attached,  that clearly defines  these  fields. 
  
Leaves of abscences will also be reported on this exec, for all
absences  more than 5 consecutive days,  employees must be placed 
on leave.  All leaves must include the type of leave and the
projected date of return.
 
If you have any questions or problems you may contact me at
408/446-7756 or via ONTYME at HRD.PERSONNEL 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE: THESE CHANGES WILL BE SEEN ON THESE FILES MONDAY,
             SEPTEMBER 30.

SUBJECT>   ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
                                                                Page  3

     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
  
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
 
   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.

       MATERIAL AND LOGISTICS DIVISION
 
 
*****************************************************************
 
 
After  a 2 day meeting with the major logistics functions of  the 

three  Field Service organizations,  Microdata,  Computer Systems 
and Support (CSS),  and Tymnet,  an organizational structure  was 

identified.   The  structure utilizes the best talents within the 
organizations and will focus on combining assets to integrate the 

operations and at the same time be transparent to our customers.
 
The results will offer greater capability to improve our  support 

of  the  new  Field  Operations Division and  for  the  McDonnell 
Douglas customer.  We feel confident that our abilities, combined 

with the assets available will help make us successful in support 
of our company's customer service effort.
 
With  quality  in  the main focus and with  the  best  individual 

effort  by  our  employees,  we will make  a  major  contribution 
towards  the  Field Service Company not only meeting it's  goals, 

but  exceeding  them.   Good performance will breed  success  and 
allow opportunity for growth to individuals who contribute  their 

best.
 
The  new  organization  was effective June 17,  1985  and  is  as 

follows.
 
Quality Control - Manager - Larry Keniston
------------------------------------------
 
Larry has been the Quality Control Manager at CSS Agoura for five 

years.    Prior  to  that,  Larry  was  either  in  manufacturing 
supervision  or in quality control with Douglas Manufacturing  or 

North  American  for  about  30  years.    Larry  brings   needed 
experience  to  MDFSC in all areas of quality  control  including 

complete  knowledge  of quality control as specified by the  U.S. 
Government.
 
Larry  will  relocate  to  the Field  Service  Depot  at  Irvine, 

California,  after the Agoura facility is relocated.  This should 
be  some  time in September of 1985.   As manager of our  quality 

control operations,  Larry will be responsible for inspection  of 
repair  and refurb work done in our depots.   Larry will  install 

procedures,  guidelines  and  systems that will  standardize  our 

Quality  Control  operations  at the existing depots in  King  of 
Prussia, Atlanta, Irvine, Fremont, and Chatsworth.
 
Please refer quality problems or questions to Larry.   Larry will 

be  working closely with the Material Support,  Test  Engineering 
and  Depot  Repair functions in our division to  deliver  quality 

spare parts.
 
Test Engineering - Manager - George Turner
------------------------------------------
 
George  has  been  the  Manager of Repair  and  Test  Support  at 

Microdata's  Field Service Depot  in  Irvine,  California,  since 
1979.   Prior to that,  George had a long career with the Navy in 

electronics  and  testing.   George  specializes  in  electronics 
testing  and automatic test engineering (ATE),  his strengths are 

in  the  use of analytical methods to define  problems  and  find 
solutions.
 
Under  George's  direction,  ATE standards and problems  will  be 

developed   and   ATE  hardware  will  be  deployed  to   enhance 
productivity and quality of repair in the repair depots.  Failure 

analysis will be a key responsibility to establish priorities  in 
attacking  failures in hardware serviced by our Field  Operations 

Divison.
 
Material Support - Director - Jerry Bowman
------------------------------------------
 
Jerry has been the Director of Logistics Operations at  Microdata 

since  1982.   Prior  to  that,  Jerry put together 22  years  of 
professional experience in logistics.  Jerry has spent 9 years in 

administration  and  management and 13 years  in  supervision  of 
various  logistics operations.   Jerry was previously employed by 

Tymshare  for  5  plus years and is familiar  with  the  Tymshare 
business and products prior to McDonnell Douglas.   Jerry will be 

responsible for integrating the material support functions of the 
three former organizations and their various  locations.   Please 

refer  any  material supply questions or needs to Jerry.   I  can 
assure you that Jerry will be more than happy to respond  quickly 

in the most professional manner as he has in support of Microdata.  
 
Depot Repair - Director - Virginia Buhr
---------------------------------------
 
Virginia  has  been the Director of Microdata's repair depots  in 

Irvine,  California,  and Atlanta,  Georgia.   Virginia has  been 
employed  by  Microdata  since 1976 and has  been  a  significant 

factor  in  the  high quality and quantity of parts  supplied  in 
support  of  the field operations  activity.   Virginia  will  be 

responsible  for  integrating  the  repair depots  of  the  three 
organizations along with their various locations.   In the  event 

that  McDonnell Douglas ventures into any 3rd Party Depot Repair, 
Virginia  will also support that activity.   I am sure all of  us 

are  looking  forward  to working with Virginia  and  her  proven 

ability to organize and work effectively with  people.   Virginia 
brings  20  plus  years of logistics support  experience  to  our 

division  which  provides a valuable source to draw from for  the 
challenges ahead.
 
Material and Logistics Planning - Manager - Anver Meghji
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Anver  has  been the Manager of Worldwide Parts for Tymnet  Field 

Engineering  and was first employed by Tymshare in  1973.   Anver 
has a successful track record in project management, implementing 

such projects as Dialnet,  Bofanet and Marsplus along with  video 
banking  development.   Anver  resides in the Bay Area  and  will 

remain here for the near term.  The first priority for Anver will 
be  to play the major role for our divison in project  monitoring 

and  system specification for the management systems that will be 
used  for our logistics efforts.   This is a major  effort  since 

none   of   the  three  organizations  have  systems   that   are 
integrateable.  Anver's business background and education will be 

a   great   asset  in  the  management  system  development   and 
implementation.
 
Chatsworth Depot - Manager - Jay Webb
-------------------------------------
 
Jay  Webb  has agreed to manage the depot and inventory  for  the 

Chatsworth,  California operations.   Jay has been involved  with 
management  of  the Chatsworth operation for over 10  years.   We 

intend to keep this operation separated from other operations  at 
this  time  as  it is a 3rd Party Service Depot for  very  mature 

Ampex and CalComp products.   Inventory sales and remanufacturing 
are  the  main focus of business with 50% of sales  to  the  U.S. 

Government  and 50% to the commercial markets.   The sales effort 
will remain with our sales division.   Jay will work closely with 

Sales to meet all delivery dates.  
 
I am sure that all of you,  like myself,  are looking forward  to 

the  integration  of the different organizations and the  various 
synergies.   There are great opportunities ahead for our division 

in  support of the various business units.   We feel we have  the 
ability  and  capacity to keep pace with  the  various  marketing 

efforts and support the Field Service needs of our customer base.  
The  combining of the different organizations make us one of  the 

largest field service organizations in operation.   A major focus 
is now upon us and we welcome the challenge.

                    Subject:  Company Property, dated 15 December 
                    1983.
 
 
Effective Tuesday, 23 April 1985, security guards have been 
posted in VG l, 2 and 3 between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 
8:00 A.M. Monday through Friday and 24 hours per day Saturday, 
Sunday and holidays.  The presence of a security guard during 
non-working hours will help assist in the control of McDonnell 
Douglas property and will create a safer working environment for 
employees who work after normal working hours.
 
The security guards are employees of California Plant Protection, 
Inc., (CPP) and will be uniformed in a blazer and slacks with the 
CPP emblem on their blazer pocket.  These guards have been hired 
to control MDC's assets leaving these three buildings and to 
provide security to employees working at night and/or on the 
weekend.
 
Reference (a) will be strictly enforced by the security guards to 
control all MDC property leaving VG l, 2 and 3.  A copy of the 
Property Removal and Return Authorization Form must be left with 
the guard or the receptionist in the lobby of the building from 
which the MDC asset is being removed.  No property may be removed 
through any other exits except the lobbies in VG l, 2 and 3.
 
Please disseminate the above information to all your managers and 
supervisors as soon as possible.  The security guards will 
enforce the control of assets, and no property will be permitted 
to leave VG l, 2 or 3 without proper authorization in writing in 
accordance with Reference (a).  Copies of the Property Removal 
and Return Authorization Form are available from Barbara McIntyre,
Ext. 6777, Fixed Asset Accounting.
 
Please call me at Ext. 6548 if you have any questions regarding 
the above.

    effective in VG1 and 2:

    a.  MDC ID Badges must be shown to the Security Guard /
        Receptionist for admittance to the buildings.

    b.  Wearing of the badge while in the building is optional but
        encouraged.

    c.  The only entrances/exits to the buildings are:  Lobby VG1,
        Lobby VG2 and the rear door by the mail room in VG1.  These
        entrances/exits will be manned by a Receptionist/Security
        Guard to check ID Badges and to control MDC property 
        removal.  The Lobby VG2 and the back door of VG1 will be
        opened 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, the lobby of VG1 
        will be opened from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM Monday thru Friday
        only.  All other doors will be locked from the outside and
        alarmed but can be used as emergency exits.

    
2.  A fence is planned for the rear of the court yard when this fence
    is built the doors that exit into the courtyard will be left
    unlocked during working hours for the convenience of the employees
    but until that time these doors will remain locked and alarmed.

3.  The above new security procedures are being taken to increase
    security to MDC employees and to stop the unauthorized removal 
    of MDC property .

4.  Your observance of these new security procedures will be appreciated.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

=================================================================
 
 
EFFECTIVE  JANUARY  1,  1986,  DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS  COMPANY  WILL 
OFFICIALLY BE OUT OF THE EQUIPMENT LEASING BUSINESS.  IN THE PAST 
OUR DIVISION HAS HANDLED THE LEASING OF TERMINALS,  PRINTERS  AND 
MODEMS    TO   "TYMSHARE"   CUSTOMERS.     THIS   INCLUDED;   THE 
ADMINISTRATION, BILLING OF NEW LEASES, RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS 
AND PURCHASE CONVERSIONS.  
 
 
AS OF JANUARY 1, ALL OF THE ASSETS WILL TRANSFER OUT OF DSC FIXED 
ASSETS INTO THE COST CENTER OF THE BUSINESS  UNIT   RECEIVING THE 
MONTHLY  REVENUE  FROM THE CUSTOMER LEASING THE  EQUIPMENT.   THE 
BUSINESS UNIT NOW WILL BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  ASSETS.   THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY  INVOLVES  TAKING BACK THE EQUIPMENT,  SHOULD  THE 
CUSTOMER CANCEL.  DSC WILL NO LONGER:
 
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE PICK UP
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING TO BE DISCONTINUED
 
                 o  RECEIVE THE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR WAREHOUSE
 
 
ANY EQUIPMENT THAT CANCELLED PRIOR TO DECEMBER 1, WILL BE  PICKED 
UP AND RETURNED  TO  OUR  WAREHOUSE.   ANY  CANCELLATION  LETTERS 
RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER 2, WILL BE SENT TO THE CUSTOMERS'BUSINESS 
UNIT.
 
 
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE FOR THE BUSINESS UNITS THAT LACK  STORAGE 
AREA.   IF  YOU  DO  NOT WANT OR NEED  YOUR  CUSTOMER'S  RETURNED 
EQUIPMENT YOU MAY CONTACT BOBBIE HINES AT  714/952-6555.   BOBBIE 
IS MANAGER OF  THE EQUIPMENT DISPOSITION AND SALES DEPARTMENT FOR 
ISG. SHE CAN HELP YOU DISPOSE OF YOUR ASSET AT FAIR MARKET VALUE.
 
 
NORTHERN  AIR  FREIGHT  HAS  HANDLED THE  PICK  UP  OF  CANCELLED 
EQUIPMENT FOR  SEVERAL YEARS.  THEY WILL GO TO THE CUSTOMER SITE; 
PACK  AND BOX THE EQUIPMENT AND SHIP TO YOUR DESIGNATED LOCATION.
THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (800/426-5962) WILL 
HANDLE  ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

 
CURRENTLY,  MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT OUT ON LEASE HAS BEEN THERE FOR 
MORE  THAN  2 YEARS AND IS FULLY DEPRECIATED OR  HAS A  VERY  LOW 
BOOK  VALUE.   IT IS OUR SUGGESTION THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO GET  YOUR 
CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE THIS LEASED EQUIPMENT AT A LOW  COST.   THIS 
PURCHASE  WOULD  RESULT  IN  REVENUE FOR  YOUR  OFFICE  AND  YOUR 
CUSTOMER  COULD  SIGN  UP FOR A MAINTENANCE  AGREEMENT  WITH  THE 
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FIELD SERVICE COMPANY.  THIS WOULD PREVENT YOUR 
OFFICE FROM EVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE RETURN.
 
 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS NEW POLICY YOU CAN  CALL 
YOUR COMPANY CONTROLLER OR ONTYME DAN SAENZ DSD.D/SAENZ.

RE:       PROMOTION


I'm pleased to officially announce the promotion of Cindy Adams
(formerly McLarty) from Account Representative to Sales Representa-
tive, Mid-Atlantic District.

After working in Customer Support for one year, Cindy supported Key
Accounts for 1-1/2 years as our District Account Representative.

In order to get a running start for 1986, Cindy began her transition
to sales in September.

To date, Cindy has closed 3 New Name Accounts and successfully made the
account transition to Bell Atlantic.

Good luck to a strong team player!

                        A T & T   MICROCOMPUTERS

QUESTION: 
 
     Why is DSC offering another micro????????? 
 
 
ANSWER: 
 
     While DSC is still very much committed to distributing IBM 
     micros under the MDC VAD agreements, there are 5 very 
     good REASONS for adding the AT&T microcomputer product line..... 
 
 
1.   IBM COMPATIBILITY. 
 
     o    AT&T PC's run most of the IBM software including 
          Symphony, Lotus, dBase III and Wordstar. 
 
2.   BRAND-NAME RECOGNITION. 
 
     o    With a name like AT&T you don't have to worry about the 
          company being around tomorrow--other clones are not as 
          fortunate. 

3.   NO RESTRICTIONS ON PLACEMENT. 
 
     o    With the IBM VAD agreements, placement of an IBM PC must 
          conform to approved applications. 
 
     o    No restrictions on placement of AT&T machines. 
 
4.   PERFORMANCE. 
 
     Although tests may vary, some tests have shown: 
 
     o    AT&T PC6300 is 150% faster than IBM XT. 
 
     o    AT&T PC6300 Plus is 125% faster than IBM AT. 
 
5.   PRICE !  PRICE !  PRICE !  PRICE !  PRICE ! 
 
     Through hardware integration, DSC is able to offer AT&T 
     microcomputers at substantial discounts off list.... 
 
       **  38% to 57% discount off list for quantity 1 **
          
     DSC provides fully loaded configurations so you never 
     have to worry about upgrades in the future, for example: 
 
     Configuration 1:  AT&T PC 6300, 640K of memory, two 360KB 
     floppy drives, serial & parallel ports, clock/calendar with 
     battery back-up, built-in graphics for both mono and color, 
     choice of monochrome or color display, DOS and BASIC, option
     of including 1200 baud modem. 
 
          DSC's price for this configuration with a monochrome 
          display is $1,876 (quantity 1), Suggested List is $3,410. 
          (45% discount to business unit.) 
 
     Configuration 2:  AT&T PC 6300, 640K of memory, 1 360KB 
     floppy drive and one 20MB (20MB not 10MB!) fixed drive, 
     serial & parallel ports, clock/calendar with battery 
     back-up, built-in graphics for both mono and color, choice 
     of monochrome or color display, DOS and BASIC, option of 
     including 1200 baud modem. 
 
          DSC's price for this configuration with a monochrome 
          display is $2,294 (quantity 1), Suggested List is $5,250. 
          (56% discount to business unit.) 
 
     Configuration 3:  AT&T PC 6300 Plus, 1MB of memory, 1.2MB 
     floppy drive, 1 20MB fixed drive, serial and parallel ports, 
     clock/calendar with battery back-up, built-in graphics for 
     both mono and color, DOS and BASIC, option of including a 
     1200 baud modem. 
 
          DSC's price for this configuration with a monochrome 
          display is $4,142 (quantity 1), Suggested List is $6,680. 
          (38% discount to business unit.) 
 
     DSC'S PRICES FOR AT&T MICROS AVERAGE 30% LESS THAN COMPARABLE 
     IBM XT CONFIGURATIONS. 
 
                             ************** 
 
A complete price list of AT&T micros will be available online after
January 20 in DSC's information file:

                       PLEASE TAKE NOTE...
                               
ONTYME MARKETING (formerly in ACS), ONTYME DEVELOPMENT (formerly 
in NTD), and FRENCH TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY (formerly FTCC) 
have folded into the new McDonnell-Douglas Company, Electronic 
Messaging Systems, MDEMS.  All users in the aforementioned 
accounts will now become part of the new OnTyme account, MDEMS.
 
Monday, January 28 is the date to remember.  Starting then, you 
must send OnTymes to the new account, MDEMS.  Any distribution 
lists which contain those users migrating to MDEMS should be 
modified to reflect the new account code as well.  
 
Both accounts, ACS and NTD will remain -- but the users now a 
part of MDEMS will no longer be valid in the 'old' accounts.  
FTCC will completely fold into the MDEMS account, so it will be 
removed in its entirety.
 
For simplicity sake, I have provided a list of those individuals 
who WERE NOT in the FTCC account.  (Just remember that all of 
FTCC will be MDEMS).  A complete directory can be pulled at your 
convenience, *** DIRECT.MDEMS.
 
Thanking you in advance for paying special attention to this 
announcement - we look forward to working with you in `86.

TO:       All Employees VG1 & 2


1.  It has been brought to our attention that a number of
    employees have left their car lights on and at the end of
    the workday have found their batteries dead.

2.  To provide a service, Security will notify car 
    owners that left their cr lights on, if the employee has
    recorded with Security his/her license plate number
    and office phone number.  Providing Security with your 
    license plate number is strictly voluntary but without it we
    will not know who to contact.

3.  Employees noting cars with lights on in our parking lot can
    phone Security at 7075 with the license plate number.

     o    No restrictions on placement of AT&T machines.

     o    AT&T PC6300 is 150% faster than IBM XT. 
 
     o    AT&T PC6300 Plus is 125% faster than IBM AT.

     Through hardware integration, DSC is able to offer AT&T 
     microcomputers at substantial discounts off list.... 
 
       **  38% to 57% discount off list for quantity 1 **
          
     DSC provides fully loaded configurations so you never 
     have to worry about upgrades in the future, for example: 
 
     Configuration 1:  AT&T PC 6300, 640K of memory, two 360KB 
     floppy drives, serial & parallel ports, clock/calendar with 
     battery back-up, built-in graphics for both mono and color, 
     choice of monochrome or color display, DOS and BASIC, option
     of including 1200 baud modem. 
 
          DSC's price for this configuration with a monochrome

Subject: Property Removal System 

DATE:  30 January 1986

SUBJECT:  Property Removal System

TO:    MDC-ISG San Francisco Bay Area

From:  Ron Birdsong-Manager, Security Control


1.  There have been some questions directed to the Security
Department concerning the new property removal system
controlling property that is brought in or taken out of
MDC-ISG facilities.  The following should help clarify any
further questions that arise.

    a.  GENERAL

        (1)  Any items, excluding documents, viewgraphs and
             Automatic Data Processing products, handcarried
             from company premises which are not readily
             identified as personal property of the bearer,
             or are not being removed in accordance with an
             approved control procedure, (authorized for
             movement by a properly authenticated shipping
             document) must be accompanied by an authorized
             Property Removal Pass, or removal must
             be authorized by the Security Department.

        (2)  Authorizing property to be removed by the 
             CHARGE-OUT AND REMOVAL PASS or the
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS issued to an employee
             is the responsibility of management level
             personnel.

    b.  PROPERTY REMOVAL PASSES

        (1)  There are two types of passes which are utilized
             for property movement, they are the 
             CONTINUOUS REMOVAL PASS and the CHARGE-OUT AND
             REMOVAL PASS.  The primary purpose of the passes
             is to provide a means by which an employee may
             move property from one MDC-ISG location to another
             within the Bay area.  Removal of personal property
             of an employee, vendor or visitor, not readily
             identifiable as personal property, must be
             authorized by a AND REMOVAL PASS.
             Recognizable personal property of employees,
             visitors or vendors will not require a pass.

             (a)  Continuous Removal PASS

                  -  The Continuous Removal Pass will be issued to
                     an employee who has a frequent need to move
                     specific types of property or supplies from
                     one MDC-ISG building to another within the
                     Bay area.  (NOTE:  This pass does not
                     authorize removal of the property by the
                     bearer for personal use).

                  -  Request for Continuous Removal Passes should
                     be in writing directed to the Security
                     Department giving the name of the employee,
                     employee number, department number, building
                     location and a description of the property
                     that will be removed to include serial
                     numbers and/or ISG tag numbers if possible.
                     The written request must be signed by
                     managemet level personnel.

                  _  The Continuous Removal Pass will have an
                     expiration date one year from date of issue.
                     Any employee neeeding to have a new Continuous
                     Removal reissued will have to submit a new
                     written request to the Security Department.

           (b)  Charge-Out and Removal Pass

                -  The Charge-Out and Removal Pass will be issued to
                   personnel for handcarried removal of specific 
                   items of company property, and/or for removing
                   personal proprty of employees, visitors and
                   vendors that cannot readily be identified as
                   personal popety.

                -  The pass will be filled out completely and signed
                    by management level personnel prior to the
                   employee handcarrying the property.

                -  A supply of the Charge-Out and Removal Passes can
                   be obtained from the Security Department by
                   management level personnel.

                -  Each receptionist and security officer has a
                   supply of these forms for use by visitors or vendors
                   only.  All employees needing a Charge-Out and 
                   Removal Pass should contact their management level
                   personnel.

                -  When describing the MDC-ISG property on this pass
                   it is very important to include any serial numbers
                   and/or ISG tag numbers.  Failure to do so will 
                   only slow down the removal of the property as the
                   security officer or receptionist will have to
                   complete the pass with this information.

2.  Your compliance with these procedures will be appreciated.
