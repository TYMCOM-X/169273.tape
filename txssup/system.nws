  Carl,
 
  I have been testing a P034/N on one  of our 2020's for several days, and
  it seems to run without any pbs.
 
  What surprised me however, is that  it seems, (from SYSTAT output), that
  the monitor uses 479 p. of physical  memory, which on a 2020 leaves only
  545 p. for users.  ( The latest /K only took up around  200 p.). Is this
  normal ?
 
  The monitor  used was  the S1034N.SAV I  found on  SSINSTALL:930 earlier
  this month.  I changed it's CONFIG  to have it  run on S264 where  it is
  still running now.
 
  Thank you and regards,
 
  Peter.

Peter,
  In response to Peter Stratman's query about P034/N taking more space
than the previous monitors...
 
  The reason for this is that the new monitor attempts to utilize all
of the first 256K (512 pages) for monitor table space, free core etc.
In the interest of reducing the monitor size, we need to determine the
amount of free core needed by the applications running on the 2020's
and specify this directly in the system configuration files.  This will
significantly reduce the monitor size and increase the user available
memory to something close to the current levels.
 
  I will contact you later by telephone to go over the details.
 
  Please pass on the information to Peter Stratman.
 
/Carl

                      November 1, 1984

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following outlines the current status of Tymshare CMS Focus release
4.5.3.  If you have additional problems or comments, please contact Val
Emery at 408-446-7160, or send an ONTYME to ACS.PCFOCUS.  It is 
imperative to begin testing all systems in this release due to the large
number of problems we are currently experiencing with 4.0.14.  It is our
intention to roll production Focus very quickly and when this occurs, 4.0.14 
will be REMOVED entirely from all systems.  This will ensure our clients
receive the most current features available in Focus.  This will also
quarantee a more timely response by IBI when we do encounter problems.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FIXES to 4.5.3
______________

REBUILD  - The filedef problem with 4.5.3 has been fixed.  But remember if
           you rebuild a file in this release with NEW INDEX type (highly
           recommended!) you will not be able to go back to earlier releases.

? TRU    - This has been fixed , now working correctly.


-CRTFORM - We think we have it fixed!!!! The corrected module will be 
           copied to all systems tonight (11/1/84).
     
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

UPWARD COMPATIBILITY ISSUE
_____________________

ALL focexecs MUST have a LRECL of 80, a format of F in releases
AFTER 4.0.13.  Many strange errors will result if Variable length focexecs
are used in newer releases.  Variable length focexecs were NOT ever
officially supported.  (Reason for their failure is due to the addition
of compiled modifys.)

Please note that when you move focexecs from the PC to the mainframe, the
default LRECL will be V, based on the PC file structure.  Issue a
mainframe filedef of F, or copy all moved files with LRECL & RECFM F options. 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OUTSTANDING 4.5.3 PROBLEMS:
__________________________

TABLETALK     - We have uncovered a partial workaround for the problem.  If
                you type TABLETALK FILE filename, where filename is that of
                a Focus database, you will be able to create your table 
                requests for that file specifically.  We are working with IBI
                to correct the more global TABLETALK problem.

                                                                Page  2

FOCUS NEWS UPDATE

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


WITHIN       - We have narrowed down the rounding problem to occurring only
               in integer fields.  Other numeric formats work correctly.  We
               will keep you posted when completely corrected.


-QUIT FOCUS (n) - Still not working.  Will keep you posted.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

BUGS - IRN NUMBERS - With WORKAROUNDS
_________________________________


IRN # E6950 - Problem with column heading allignment when you have
              a Table request that sums an I2 field across an I3 field.

  Workaround: Change the I2 field to an I3 field and problem goes away.


IRN # E7043 - Problem with field substitution in a heading when you have a
              row-total , and across statement in the report request.

  Workaround: Use a COMPUTE instead of Row-Total and the problem goes away.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NEW REPORTED PROBLEMS: (not verified as 'bug's)
_____________________

FOCSORT FOCTEMP - Possible problem with the Focsort Foctemp file being 
                written to the A disk, even if TEMP DISK  has been set to
                write Focus temporary files to another mdisk.  If anyone else
                has had this problem, please let us know.


CURSOR/A12    - We have examples of this new feature working in one focexec
                yet failing in another.  We are trying to isolate when and why
                this might occur.



ON NEXT CRTFORM - A problem has been reported with the use of this command.
                It seems that in this particular case logic modify program,
                On Next Crtform does not retrieve the first occurance of the
                segment being nexted.  It only seems to fail in this one 
                program.  If you have problems, please report them so we can
                narrow in on the problem.!

We are going to begin re-assigning old host numbers which are
not being used or are not reserved for future use.  Any host numbers
which were assigned prior to 1984, and which were not inserted into the
NETWORK PROFILE DATABASE, are subject to re-assignment.  (Beginning in
January 1984 host numbers were assigned by the database.)  A list of old host
numbers which are subject to re-assignment is in the following file: 

     (TYMNET:23,25,37,70,56,54,33)OLDHOS

If there are any host numbers on this list, or you know of any other host 
numbers that are not in the database, and which you do not want to be
re-assigned, please let us know immediately, so that we can insert them into
the database, thus preventing them from being re-assigned.

If we are not notified about any such host numbers by 11/12/84, we will
begin re-assigning such numbers.

If you have any questions, please contact us as follows:

Subject: Old Host numbers -- Reassignment

Due to restrictions in various supported products on the PDP-10's it
has been a standing "rule" that whenever possible, new PDP-10 hosts
running TYMCOM-X would be given 2 digit host numbers, (i.e. #1 to #99).

Since hosts numbers #21, 53, 58, 62, 64, 67, 68, 77, 87, 91 and 95 which
are listed for re-assignment, fall into this range, I ask that these host
numbers and any others less than 100 be restricted to re-assignment only
to internal hosts and those new hosts which are running TYMCOM-X system
software.

Subject: OPPS move to system 34

Jenny,
  While I'm thinking about this.... whatever system OPPS is moved to,
everyone at Tymshare who has a status password will need to log into
that system to change their password.  That is another reason why it
might be a good idea to keep the host number C33 around... it seems to
me that we'd be making a lot of work for Validations to move just about
every internal user, since almost every internal user has some status?

(I may be wrong about the percentage that has status, but in any case
there's a lot of usernames involved if you consider the entire OPER
status tree...)

Not really a bug... but I'm really tired of typing "D nnn" and having it
come back and say ?command "D" is ambiguous among the following:
                     DAYTIME  &  DELETE

I realize it's a scanner/parser problem, but some commands should ought
to be able to be abbreviated....  would a macro "D" for "DELETE" work?
if so, then I'll be happy...

Yes, macros require exact matches, but
  SET MACRO D DELETE
will do what you want (PROFILE makes it stick).  Also note ^K
deletes what you just read and does a NEXT.

Library tapes still remain on system 33 that belong to users who
were removed from this system on February 8th.  To obtain this list
of tapes, please read the file *** CPC.C33TAPES (about 5 pages long).
Any tapes that belong to you or your group should either be trans-
ferred to another system or be released and scratched from the tape
library by March 22, 1985.  This can be done by entering a batch 
request on any Cupertino system.  Please state the TID and TRP num-
bers and what you would like done with the tape(s).  If you are not
valid on a Cupertino system, please send an ontyme to CPC.WCO with the
same information as  a batch request. Any tapes in ths list that still 
remain on system 33 after March 22nd will be automatically released
and scratched from the library.

If there are any questions, please call (214)637-7324 or ontyme CPC.JENNY.

     The Valley Forge Data Center will cease to exist by the second quarter
of 1985. We request that all District offices evaluate the number of tapes
that are located in the Data Center. Please determine which tapes may be
returned to scratch, other offices, users, etc. To obtain a current
TAPELIST for your username(s), log on to the system in question and request  the
operator to give you a TAPELIST. The system's in question would be V48, V44, V43..

 
     Operations is hoping that with your help, we may make the
transportation of our customer loads to other centers as smooth and

as uncomplicated as possible.

 
Thanks very much for your cooperation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
     
     
     THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHEN THE VALLEY FORGE DATA   
 CENTER WILL BE CLOSING.  INITIALLY IT WAS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE DURING THE   
 THIRD QUARTER.  WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT CLOSED BY THE SECOND QUARTER.    
 THUS, SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES ARE BEGINNING APRIL 19, 1985.  THE TENTATIVE    
 PLAN IS TO MOVE THE 370 SYSTEMS TO THE DALLAS CENTER AND DIVIDE THE  
 PDP-10'S BETWEEN FREMONT AND CUPERTINO CENTERS.  
     
     ALL BUSINESS UNITS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE VALLEY FORGE SHUTDOWN.   
 SOME SPECIAL CONTRACTS OR PROCESSING AGREEMENTS FOR CLIENTS MAY EXIST
 THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF.  IF YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIAL AGREEMENTS
 FOR CUSTOMERS PLEASE LET YOUR BUSINESS UNIT OR RPM KNOW.  GIVEN THE START 
 DATE OF APRIL 19, 1985 WE WOULD APPRECIATE NOTIFICATION BY NEXT WEEK,
 MARCH 25, 1985.    
     
     WE REALIZE THIS IS NOT ALLOWING MUCH TIME TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A   
 COLOSSAL TASK BUT THE BENEFITS WILL BE A GREAT COST SAVINGS FOR ISG. 
     
     I CAN BE REACHED AT (408)446-6870 OR VIA ONTYME AT CPC.L/MORRIS.

Dennis,
  your message from Shirley was at best confusing...  what is the problem
with SYSMAINT on system 1051 ?  (or have they changed the system number to
system 32 or something?)  If SYSMAINT was already valid, it was probably
the original one setup by Lois Lindley.

  in any case, cancel SYSMAINT.2 since it is unnecessary.  let me know and
I will check SYSMAINT on Ranier bank's system... Ok.

/Carl
PS: Please CC: to TXSSUP, actually send to CARL or TXS.C/Baltrunas more
    directly.  Thank you.

All billable and non-billable usernames will be relocated to system D27,   
C29, C34, or D54 on April 19, 1985 beginning at 17:00 CST.  All files 
and tapes will be transferred to the new system by RPM at this time. The   
billable users and their support users assign to District 38, 70, 72, 
74, 79, and username TYMACS will be relocated to system D27. The bill-
able users and their support users assign to District 51, 52, 86, 92, 93,  
95, 96, 182, and 251 will be relocated to system C29. The billable users

to Dallas Operations, RPM, Operations Maintenance, and Software support    
will not be transferred during this move.  If there are any files that
need to be saved, please have them transferred by someone within the  
group.

SUBJECT:       NETWORK SECURITY POLICY
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The security and integrity of our corporate information and 
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the    
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.
 
We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:   Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,  
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This   committee   developed  this  policy  for 
my endorsement.  I strongly support it and the need for 
attention and vigilance in insuring that it is implemented.  
We  will be following this policy with appropriate procedure  
and auditing activities.  In particular the Personnel Security
Agreement for employees will be forthcoming in the near 
future.  There is much you can do at department level to insure
compliance with the policy.
 
Remember, safeguarding corporate assets is part of everyone's
job.
 
Questions about this policy should be directed to Wayne Bartlett,
Director, Data Security, at Orchard Parkway, San Jose.
Telephone: (408)942-5019

                        NETWORK SECURITY
               
               GENERAL POLICY ON NETWORK SECURITY
 
 
  I.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this policy is to provide safe-
      guards for the security and integrity of corporate informa-
      tion and customer information in our custody.  This policy
      is to be implemented by management and employees through
      appropriate administrative procedures and safeguards.
 
      For clarity, this policy will be separated into the 
      following categories:      
 
                    A.  NETWORK SECURITY
                    B.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES FOR CUSTOMER DATA
                    C.  PERSONNEL POLICY
 
 II.  POLICIES REFERENCED:  None 
 
III.  SCOPE:  This policy applies to our information and
      data and our customers'data that is stored and trans-
      mitted by TYMNET.
 
 IV.  A.  NETWORK SECURITY:
      
      Data security and network integrity are vital to our 
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.
 
      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.
 
      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:
 
          1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES
 
          2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
               COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS
 
          3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
               CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
               CHARACTER
 
 
          
 
     
          4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
               OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
               ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
               OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
               EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

          5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
               TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION
 
      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.
 
      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used 
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.
 
      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:
 
      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.
 
      Customers are required to use network security features 
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.
 
      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:
 
               1.  They are using the available features and
                   controls
               2.  They are committed to prosecute violators 
 
      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.
     
 
 
      C.  PERSONNEL
 
      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.  The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the
      procedures required to safeguard information.
 
      Computer access and privileges for each employee will be
      limited to those necessary for his/her job function.
 
      Maintaining the security of corporate assets is a part of
      everyone's responsibility, and execution of that 
      responsibility will be considered part of everyone's job
      performance.

Subject: System 59, Accounting data fixup

Peter,

  Verison %30(4) of CHKPNT should never have been distributed to any
system, let alone any of your 2020s.  It is in an interim state and
someone probably copied it from system 930 accidently.

  In any case, I have a program which condenses the huge files created
by version %30(4) to their proper size.  I took the liberty of running
my program on system 59 prior to sending this message, so that you could
run your accounting for MAY without any further holdup.

  I also concatenated the "good" .DAT and .SAT files with the condensed
files and replaced your .DAT and .SAT files with the rebuilt files.  The
files concerned were:

    (SYS)052885.DAT condensed                 replaced (SYS)052885.DAT
    (SYS)052985.BAD condensed (SYS)052985.DAT replaced (SYS)052985.DAT
    (UN1)052885.BAD condensed                 replaced (UN1)052885.SAT
    (UN1)052985.BAD condensed (UN1)052985.SAT replaced (UN1)052985.SAT

  With these "rebuilt" files, you should NOT lose ANY accounting
information for the 28 May or the 29 May.  The .BAD files contained
all the accounting information as usual.  CHKPNT %30(4) mistakenly
wrote 256 empty block between each good data block.

  Sorry for the mixup.  We will continue to investigate how the wrong
CHKPNT was installed.

                                        Sincerely...  /Carl

                     SOFTWARE PACKAGES OVERVIEW

     The following represents a listing of packages and the programs
that are included in the packages.  This listing represents the initial
phase of the updates, which tries to include all the monitor utility
programs.  Later phases will update other groups of programs, such as
the language compilers.  This initial phase includes about one-third of
the programs which will be checked and updated.  We plan to finish in 2
or 3 more months with this first phase.  As we finish a particular
package, we will contact you to inform you of our intentions and the
effects of the upgrade, and to allow you to inform us of any objections
by Mallinkrodt to the upgrades, before we contact the Software
Transmittal Group to install a particular package on their system.  (I
realize this may mean a steady trickle of changes, but the alternative
might be a flood.  I believe and hope that the improvements in security,
efficiency, and supportability make this a worthwhile effort.)

     Disclaimer:  This list is not exhaustive, and there will probably
be many changes as we work our way through the list.  But we will
let you know of any changes.
     
     If there are any questions or information we can supply, please
call us or send an OnTyme.  Thanks for your help....Michael Chinn

SUBJ:	Packages

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	In order to provide better support of the operating system,
languages and utilities for systems running Tymcom-X, we are currently
organizing our software into groups of related programs called "packages".
These packages are designed to integrate the most current versions of 
each of their component programs, so that the installation of the package
will insure each host is kept up to date with new software releases.

	On 14-June-85 the current release of the FILOPS package
(version 001) will be distributed to all Tymcom-X systems.  This package
includes the following programs:
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Name: DIRIT  
Current Version:  33
New Version:  33.1

Comments:  Minor code change to delete a bug.  No visible change to any
users.  Has been on at least one other system for 3 years without
problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Name:  UNDELE

Comments:  We would like to install this program and provide the
documentation which is currently available to other users.  This program
has been used in its two versions for more than 3 years (second version
released Mar 1984).

     I am enclosing a copy of the file UNDELE.DOC which is the file
which explains the use of this command, and is installed in the system
to provide user documentation.  The user may also type the /HELP switch while
using the command UNDELETE to receive information on possible options.
-------
                           "UNDELETING" FILES

     The UNDELETE command will restore a file that has been deleted
during the current login or gfd session, if the UNDELETE ability has
been enabled. 

     The general form of the UNDELETE command is

   -UNDELETE [file identifier1,file identifier2...] [switches]

file identifier    Specify the file(s) to be restored.  The usual wild
                   cards can be used (#, *, "ALL").

     If no file identifier is specified, all files deleted during the
present login or gfd session are restored.  

     When UNDELETE is enabled, all files that are deleted can be
recovered until the user either logs out or gfd's to another directory.
UNDELETE is enabled by giving the command

   -UNDELETE/ENABLE

and disabled by the command

   -UNDELETE/DISABLE

Both enabling and disabling remain in effect until they are changed,
and do not need to be typed at the beginning of each session.

     The UNDELETE command switches are:

  Switch                        Function

/LIST               List all files that have been deleted.

/RECOVER            Recover specified files, or all.  (default)

/PURGE              Expunge specified files; they cannot then be restored.

/SELECT             Select action to take for a list of files,
                    or rename a single specified file.

/ENABLE             Enable UNDELETE capability.

/DISABLE            Disable UNDELETE capability.

/BEGIN              Enter UNDELETE program.

/FAST               List only filename, extension and success message.

/?                  Type the on-line help message.


     If a user attempts to recover a file when another file by the
same name exists, UNDELETE will give the error message 

    "**ALREADY EXISTING FILE!**"

If this occurs the user can then use the /SELECT switch to rename the
file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the new name for the file.

     /SELECT can be used with a list of files to select the action to
take for each file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the action to take.
Responses, and their results are:

  Response               Action

  Control-R          Recover this file with the old name.
   <CR>              Skip this file, do not recover.
  Control-D          Expunge this file; it cannot then be recovered.
  name Control-R     Recover this file and rename it to "name".
  name <CR>          Recover this file and rename it to "name".
***end of undele.doc***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Name:  CHKPNT
Current Version: 30.2
New Version:  30.3
Comments:  A fairly minor change which insures that accounting data
will be written even when the "debug" switch is set.  This could prevent 
the loss of revenue information in the event of a crash.  There
would be no apparent changes to users.

Changes between versions:  The following is the programmer's infor-
mation log which records the changes between versions.

30.3    /TODD  10-21-82: Previous versions of CHKPNT did not write 
        records because debug switch was on.  Fixed this so that we 
        can charge for interrupted sessions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Please note that earlier versions of the above programs will no
longer be supported.  If you have any questions or problems regarding
the distribution or installation of this package, please contact the
indicated member of the Packaging group listed below.

Thank you.

	First item:
Craig agrees that we do the following to save unnecessary redundancy,
especially when transmitting software to the domestic, customer 2020's.

We check the current copy of the executable binary file of the program
on the "production location hosts" (as they are called on the
transmittal form) to determine if they are identical with the executable
binary file created by our reconstruction of the file from the archived
source files.  This checking is done in this way:
	1.)  Determine the version number of the file built from the
sources and of the files on the production hosts.
	2.)  Determine the checksum of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts.
	3.)  If the production host's file has the same version number
and checksum as the file built from sources, telecopy this executable
binary file from the production host to another file name on the host
with the executable binary file rebuilt from sources.  Check for any
differences between the two files with the 'differences' command (which
runs the FILCOM program).

If the executable binary file from the production host is identical to
the executable binary file built from sources, transmittal of the
executable binary file to the production host is unnecessary.  This
transmittal should definitely NOT be done if the host is a customer host
(such as a domestic 2020).

	Second item:
The names of the packages that Craig suggested for the transmittal data
base, TRABAS, (and thus for everyone's access to the packages in
archives) is a 6 character mnemonic name, such as the filename part of
the file-id in the .DOC file in the archive FDM file, with ".PKG" as the
last four of the 10 characters allowed in the TRABAS and ARCHIV data
bases.  E.g.: the COMMAND package will be called "COMMAN.PKG" on the
"Software name" line of the transmittal form.

Since this name will be the name by which the package will be known
henceforth, we should be careful about what we choose for the first six
characters.  Coordination of this naming is recommended if you have any
questions.

	Third item:

Re. retransmittals of previously released packages:  If the package has
been transmitted, the "production" hosts' software has been installed,
and no changes to these installed files are to be made, then the new
transmittal should be marked "Archive only".

Every package transmitted should be re-transmitted with the following
changes, and these changes should be implemented for every new package
transmitted.:
	1.)  Package name should follow the new convention of
"<6-character name>.PKG".
	2.)  Version number(s) for packages should reflect the new
convention, including the manner in which the FDM file's name is
affected by the version numbering scheme.  Package file name format:

	"<4-char pkg name abbrev.>n[A|T].mmm"
(where:  n = digit 0 thru 9, reflecting the host class;
	 "A" or "T" = code reflecting Archive or Transmittal file; and
	 mmm = package version number, starting with 001.)

	3.)  The transmittals should include the following additional
information about EACH included program and instructions to Software
Distribution to enter this information into the TRABAS data base:  
	    a.)  System number:  packaging host number;
	    b.)  Program name:  name of individual program, as in last
transmittal of individual program;
	    c.)  Transmittal number:  (numbering method to be
determined); 
	    d.)  Version number:  version number of the individual
program;
	    e.)  Programmer name:  name of programmer who wrote the
current version of the individual program;
	    f.)  File name:  name of the package's current archive FDM
file; 
	    g.)  File extension:  extension of the package's current
archive FDM file.

If you have any questions, please ask,
Dennis

Duuuh!  So that's what happened to my WF!  . . .  I guess I'm a creature of
habit, I'd forgotten all about NEEDWF!  Maybe I need a vacation.

Q:  Is there any problem with host 184 not having a SPOOL directory?  It
looks like they don't use SPOOL on that host, from what I've seen
tonight:  When I tried to TELECOPY to SPOOL:184, I got "no FD for
(SPOOL:184)."

Everybody, including 930 (but excluding 184 and the domestic 2020's) has
been given the new NODPRI.

SEE you tomorrow!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The file (SPOOL)NODPRI has been updated on all CEGI hosts, including 90
(except host 184, which does not have a SPOOL directory).  The update
was completed by 5 am, GMT, 25 Jun 85.  The association of node numbers
with printer locations is now consistent with the information currently
entered into the data base on host 8 by System's Resource Allocation.

The delay in responding to your request for this update was due to the
need to correct errors in the file and confirm the contained
information.  Procedures and policies are being established to effect
the updating on a monthly basis, so the current problem should not
re-occur.

I hope and believe that all is now correct.  If host 184 should have the
NODPRI file for SPOOL, please let me know where it should be.  If the
node to printer correspondence is in error, please let SRA and me know.

     The memo you received from Ingrid should be disregarded.  It was
sent due to a mixup on our end.  These programs of NONAME, PROJEC,
LPASSW, and LVALID will not be transmitted at this time.  (They were
actually the same versions already on 370.)

     We will be meeting with Ingrid on Monday to discuss this project,
including the best method of transmitting program revisions.  We will
let you know what happens.

     The programs SETOPS, OPPS, and TITO have not been installed.  It
appears that the version of CHKPNT (and not the monitor) you have is not
able support these newer versions of SETOPS and OPPS.  So after a new
CHKPNT, then some new programs can follow.

     Sorry for the mixup...feel free to contact us about these matters.
Thank you.

        BOOTS.KL   (YAWCAW)   WA     ALL RUN NO

I have updated TRABAS as indicated on the MONPRC.PKG, LDCPLX.PKG, and
SESSIO.PKG transmittals; however, I entered system 38 instead of 26
because TRABAS interprets 26 to be a 940.  All three archive files
from these packages have been transferred via ARCHIVE to QALIBSYM:38.
            
P.S....I went back and re-entered the information from the DSKTAP.PKG
into TRABAS because the system number entered was 26.  It now reads 38.

Subject: [mail waiting] ? algorithm 

Instead of deciding who to send/set the mail-waiting bit for, what if...

When a message is sent, set the MAIL-WAITING bit for all jobs logged in
under that username, thus programs like PEAK,VUE,TUMS,etc. can look for
the bit and let the user know s/he has mail.

When the user runs TUMS,RDMAIL or some mail reading process, then that
process should look to see if any other frames are logged-in under the
particular username still awaiting the MAIL-WAITING typout by COMCON and
clear it for all such frames.

Thus, if an individual program sees the flag and wants to clear it, it
may without consequence, and it may also detect that some other process
cleared it, and notify the user that the previous "mail" had been read.

A new UUO or even a new privilage would not be too bad an idea... privs
needed to clear it on any frame but your own, (maybe JL or WF is all?),
and anyone may set or clear it on their own frame.

What do you think?

SUBJ:  SPOOL's current limitation to Tymsat node numbers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in our telephone conversation, the SPOOL program on the
SDS-940's and the PDP-10's cannot cope with Tymsat numbers greater than
3776 <octal>.  If a user logs in to his host from a Tymsat with a node
number greater than this limit and attempts to have a file listing
printed on a fast line printer through use of the SPOOL program, the
program cannot associate his logged-in Tymsat with a printer location.

This limitation is historically due to the binary word size of the
Tymcom-IX hosts.  These hosts have a 24-bit word size.  The file used by
the SPOOL program on both types of hosts associates the Tymsat number in
one half-word with the printer location number in the other half of the
word.  This limits the Tymcom-IX's to a maximum of 11 bits (3776 octal)
to encode node numbers, since the last bit is used to differentiate
in-house users from customer users.

The SPOOL program on the Tymcom-X hosts was written assuming that this
limit would not ever cause a problem, and thus did not leave memory bits
in the program available for expanding the range of node numbers.  One
bit in the Tymcom-X hosts' program can be "scrounged" to increase the
range of node numbers available to SPOOL to a maximum of 7776 <octal>.
Doing so would make Tymcom-IX SPOOL unable to directly assign a printer
for users of these nodes, would require re-writing some of Tymcom-X
SPOOL and re-formatting its data file (initially about 1 week's work),
and would regular manual updating of the data file on the Tymcom-X's
which associates node numbers with the line printers.

The updating of this data file is currently done by SRA, using a program
on host 8 (a 940) then distributed to all IX's and X's by the PJ system,
who's driver is on host 8.  Migrating this updating program to a Tymcom-
X would require about two weeks' work.  The automated distribution of
this file to all Tymcom-X's would require migrating the PJ system's
driver program to a Tymcom-X host:  about one month's work.

There is a "kludge" around this problem:  the current limitation can be
side-stepped with a little effort on the part of the user.  Any time his
logged-in Tymsat is not in the list of Tymsats associated with line
printer locations, he can run the program SPNODE (1) which gives a list
of node numbers associated with each printer location.  When he submits
a SPOOL request, he then provides SPOOL with the number of a node
associated with the line printer of choice, over-riding the default to
his logged-in Tymsat as the node number which the SPOOL program uses to
choose the printer.

Another "patch" around this problem is swapping node numbers so that
each Tymsat to be associated with a printer location has a node number
less than 3777.

As of our conversation, this node number limit has not been a problem.

Peter,

I understand from Peter Haas that you are familiar with the process of
transferring files from a Tymcom-X host to a VAX system.  I have
received a request from a customer to support them in transferring
character type files from a Tymcom-X host to their VAX-11/780 system.
They tried using MAGCON to create the tapes for transporting the files,
but the tapes were unreadable by the VAX system in the format in which
the tapes were written, with the tape-read parameters they tried.

I would greatly appreciate your sharing with me your experience and
knowledge on this subject.

Thank you!

Subject: suggested utility (support for SPOOL) 

SPOOL has a current maximum for the network node numbers which can be
automatically associated with spool 'remote' sights.  The largest node
number that can be accepted is 3776.  Tymnet currently has node numbers
ranging as high as 6000+.  The user can bypass this limitation by
specifying a node number which he knows is in the valid Tymsat list.

Allowing users access to the SPNODE program (currently in SPPOPER) would
provide a service to users of SPOOL.  If their attempt to use SPOOL from
a Tymsat not in the list fails, and they do not already know the number
of a node which is assigned to the printer location they desire, they
have a potential problem.  Being able to run SPNODE from the SYS
directory would allow them to easily learn a node number to give the
SPOOL program to get their desired results.

I recommend that we place SPNODE in the SYS directory, with protection
to allow all users to run it, and license to allow the program to read
the NODPRI and PRIDAR files in the SPOOL directory.

Please let me know if I should do this.

As you know, Tymnet is in the process of converting the international
accounting programs from system 56 to 58.  During this conversion, two
command files were inadvertently written to tape and not restored to 
system 58.  This created an error of "CANNOT READ FILE" when processing
May or June's data.  This problem has been corrected and all programs
should be back to normal.

There was some concern that the necessary constant files may also be
written to tape.  This will not happen.  Files such as the PTT.CHG
files will remain in your directories.  Only the actual files which 
contain accounting data previous to May 1985 will be written to tape.
The May and June accounting files will remain on-line.

Tymnet intends to always keep the previous two months accounting files
on-line for processing.

Tymnet regrets any inconvenience or mis-understanding which may have 
occured during this change.

Peter,

We will be making PEAK available to your customers.  I assume that you
know that the documentation available for it is definitely not true
'user documentation', but is written for knowledgeable in-house users.

This is the only documentation available.  We do not have the resources

not guarantee that it will not damage users files.

This lack of resources is regrettable:  PEAK is potentially a very good
program, but it currently in the field test stage of development, and
will remain at this level of development for the forseeable future.  It
is most important that the customers understand this.

The changes necessary to make PEAK available to customers will prevent
its being made available to customers for some while.  We will need more
information about the customer use of the program, so I will be
requesting this information in the near future.  I will probably not be
in touch with you before August 5, as I will be out of the office next
week.

  Dennis and Carl,
 
  I have now tried out the INITIA you have provided me with on host 443.
 
  I am afraid that the result is not positive. The system gets to the fol-
  lowing point :
 
    512K OF MEMORY ONLINE.
 
    System in auto-restart, running INITIA
 
  .. and then seems to hang forever.
 
  Could you please investigate further into this problem ?
 
  Thank you, and have a good weekend, Peter.

Subject: ? Deletion ? 

Oh well...   I thought that that might get your attention... give me a
call (work or home) to talk about this in more detail.

We've been working on this PERP-replacement project for a little while
and it seems that we have some duplication of effort...

  PERP  (runs on a 940) controls up to 10 jobs at a time and puts the
        logfile back out on the user's directory on the system it was
        run on.  Sends mail from PERPOPER about completion.  Will put
        a job in it's queue and reschedule it for another run date if
        the job is "periodic", otherwise it is deleted when completed

  PAM   (runs under (PJ) on most systems) controls up to 10 jobs and
        runs them as high-segments from a single job with periods that
        range from 15 minutes to 150 minutes.

  XEXEC (runs on some PDP-10s) schedules single line commands to run a
        particular program or a PCOM command file at periodic intervals
        of one or more hours.  The period may be offset by "n" hours as
        well, so that jobs do not all run at midnight.

  INITIA (runs on PDP-10s at startup) schedules a series of jobs which
        must be run in sequence (DSKCLN first) in order to bring the
        system up for general timesharing service.  Other jobs include
        CHKPNT, COPYCR, XEXEC (mentioned above), and KMCLOD.

  PCOM  (runs on all our PDP-10s) reads a command file and interprets
        the commands a la PERP by creating another frame and typing the
        commands to it.  If run in DETACH mode, it creates an extra
        detached frame to control the processing frame.

Well....
  As you can see there are a lot of similar programs lying in wait to do
the same kind of things.  PERP works in days, PAM in minutes, XEXEC in
hours (and at startup), INITIA at startup and PCOM once per invocation.

  I doubt that all things can be simplified into 1 (ONE) program, but
there seems to be a lot that can be eliminated with a perp-replacement
that understands date-time expressions down to the minute level.  Please
excuse the length of this message, but I will continue with a description
of what we intend to do in the near future:

1)  System startup.
    Force a .DSKCLN command on TTY0 to run DSKCLN
    Force a .INITIA command on TTY? (0 or 1) to run INITIA

2)  INITIA starts what it must ( CHKPNT, XEXEC ) or maybe just XEXEC
    and disappears altogether.  If run LOGGED-IN it runs your init file.

3)  XEXEC is the perp-replacement program/scheduler that I'm nearing the
    preliminarly completion on... description later...
    XEXEC starts up the jobs scheduled to run at system-startup:
          CHKPNT, COPYCR, KMCLOD, PAM (?), FREE, ....
    XEXEC hangs around and runs jobs which need to be run periodically:
          (PJ)TRUCTL, other PJ jobs, (MAIL)MAILER, other MAIL functions,
          anything else that any user may have put into the queue.

4)  CHKPNT is made responsible for un-shutting the system and saying:
    "initialization completed" since INITIA only chews up resources looking
    to see if CHKPNT got the date and time yet.  Since CHKPNT is already
    responsible for shutting the system if accounting dies, why not?

The system is now up, open, and operational... PERP is >dead< / >replaced<
(ding dong the [sic] PERP is dead, the PERP is dead, the PERP is dead, ...)


My new XEXEC, name chosen since no changes need be made to INITIA to make
it work, would replace your XEXEC program and provide the same services
via a more accessible queue.  It is basically a PCOM derivative that does
what PCOM used to do for up to "n" jobs at a time, instead of just one!

I've got it working now such that it reads a specially formatted queue-file
which is manipulated by a co-operating program called SUBMIT which replaces
the PDP-10 PERP/DEFER programs.  My current version makes an ordered list
in memory and then runs the jobs one at a time.  By the end of this week, I
hope to have all the bugs shaken out and have it run the jobs one by one at
their scheduled time (or as close as possible thereafter).  By the end of
next week, I hope to have a preliminary version which runs "n" jobs at a
time (as necessary) presuming I don't run out of channels for reading the
input files.

We should discuss the security aspect, license passing, etc pretty soon
before I cast it in concrete...  how about lunch sometime this week???

Call me at home (408) 945-4321, or after 1;pm at the office 116-2515 or
(415)794-2515 direct.   Talk to you then.  This message is already MUCH
MUCH too long.

Jenny,
  As to my understanding for how the TYMCOM-X and Software-Distribution
groups provide support to any PDP-10 running TYMCOM-X, I find it difficult
to see any difference between a "Tymshare" and a "Tymnet Public Net" host.
In that regard, I would ask that any GAN 3 accounts be left "as is" on the
new system 54 username list.

  In particular, there are 2 or three lists of GAN 3 accounts which are
critical for system operation, crucial for maintaining tools, crucial for
maintaining TYMCOM-X operations and crucial for software distribution.
It also sems that some of the usernames on your list were really in GAN
11447 instead of GAN 3...

  Anyway I have no complaints if you remove the following accounts:

    GBLOOD, DMOULTON, *2TRR, XFINDEV, XFINTEST

  If Lee Corbin has no complaints, then you may also remove:

    SSARCHB, SSARCHD

  All the rest (in this list) do have some function, albeit the usernames
are really only needed for support and some should contain no files.

- needed for system operation-
    SYS, FTSYS, IMPORT, MAIL, XEXEC, TYMGRIPE, M33, CRASH
- needed for operating system tool support libraries -
    M33, OSU, OSNF, MPL, SPL, XEXEC
- needed for system language support subsystems -
    PUB, SAILIB, SAILTEST, NDT, TBAUSPS, ZONNIE, TBATLIB, FTTBA,
    SYSNEWS, *6NEWS, SYSDOC, FTSYSDOC, QASYS
- needed for spool/batch/perp support subsystems -
    SPPOPER, SPPARCH, SYSMAINT, SSPRINT, SSPERP, SPOOLRM, SSPAMBIN
- needed for system support & software distribution -
    CARL, OSMAN, JMS, SYSMAINT, MPL, SPL, XEXEC, 
    SSINSTALL, SSBACKUP, QASYS, QALIBSYM
- needed for system tools support & backup support -
    FLETCHERC, MATOKA, KEN, MCH, ZONNIE, CHERIE, SALLY, HELGEM,
    DENCOFF, TSUCOOP
- needed for royalty accounting -
    ACTRTY, UAS, ACT10, BILLING10, UN1
- needed for validations programs -
    SSVALSUP, CUD10


Note to Lee:  We need to get together sometime to make up a definitive
	      list of usernames and who is responsible for them and what
	      they are for, as far as a list of system-critical users.
	      This list is needed so that we can create a LUD.SYS with
	      all the critical users, and whenever Jenny (or anyone else
	      in resources) brings up a "clean" system, we can put it
	      out there without all this "fuss" about which usernames to
	      "keep" on the new system.

Well, Jenny... the above list is by no means COMPLETE.. I merely took the
list you sent me and re-arranged all the ones I knew something about and
added a few to make sure they did NOT get removed (if they are even still
there on system 54).  If you have any more questions about any of the
names on this list Please ONTYME me @ TXS.SUP and TXS.C/Baltrunas

Also, please ONTYME me "BEFORE" you delete "ANY" GAN 3 or cost code 4011
usernames.  We have some critical sources out on some systems even though
the user who maintained those sources is no longer with the company.  As
we consolidate the sources, we have been removing the usernames... we do
not however, want them to just "disappear" in any of the global sweeps that
have been taking place within the last year.  We've already "lost" one or
two sets of compiler & runtime sources.  Thanks an awful lot.

THE TYMNET-1 ELIMINATION SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY DECEMBER 1 HAS BEEN DELAYED.

A SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION WILL BE PUBLISHED ON MONDAY DECEMBER 2


THIS DELAY IS DUE TO UNRESOLVED SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE
FINAL STAGES OF CONVERSION.  SINCE EVERYONE IS PREPARED FOR THIS CONVERSION,
ADVANCE NOTICE COMPLETION WILL BE SHORT.  I EXPECT ABOUT TWO DAYS NOTICE
WILL BE SUFFICIENT.

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

          2. CRASH FROM 6C63

I HOPE I HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE KNOWN PROBLEMS.  IF THERE ARE ANY NEW

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

Subject: BIONIC rewrite status 

Greg,

  I've completed a version of BIONIC which handles both ASCII and KATAKANA
in the normal non-HSA mode.  I have been unable to do any testing using an
HSA so I cannot confirm whether it works properly or not.

  My new version implements the "fix" that P. Spies, D. Smith and I agreed
on last week.  However, I have heard conflicting reports about whether the
"fixed" version of BIONIC actually works with the new HSA code.  I haven't
connected with P. Spies to discuss these reports in the past 3 days, so if
you can send me an ONTYME to TXS.C/BALTRUNAS requesting a copy of the new
BIONIC and a "test" directory or system to try it on, I'll be happy to
prepare a pre-release version.

The ASCII file mode writes 7-bit characters 5 per word.  The KATAKANA file
mode writes 9-bit characters (8 bits from the BLOCK I/O buffer and the 9th
is always 0) 4 per word.  If this is NOT what you expect, please inform me
prior to requesting the test version.

Thank you all for your patience.

/Carl

I also notice 25 is configured for 107 jobs.. For a KL this should be 127.
I didn't check the ports, but it should be 128 real ports.  Contact the
folks at SRA to have a new monitor made.  -Bill

The following was recieved from Ken BeDell.  Paragraph 1 refers to items that
we (Carl & I) have been supporting Ken and Eric on.  I have given an interim
answer to Ken, but decision is needed re. their access to 930.

             A16297 dated 07-FEB-86 from IOD.CUPERTINO

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when weing for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.


      Regards,
      Dennis
