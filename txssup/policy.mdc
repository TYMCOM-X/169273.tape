Subject:     ISG EXECUTIVE BOARD DECISIONS ON STRATEGIC TASK FORCE 
             RECOMMENDATIONS


We are happy to announce our decisions regarding three of the four 
vertical industry markets under study by Strategic Task Forces.  
The attached set of Administrative Bulletins details those 
decisions.  Next month we will hear recommendations from our 
Communications Industry Task Force, and will decide on a long-term 
strategy for the McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
Company.

We are convinced the course we have chosen is consistent with the 
ISG Vision, and with our objective of operating the ISG as a 
dynamic partnership of vertical and horizontal/resource 
businesses.  We are announcing these decisions well ahead of our 
1 July deadline, and are hopeful that we can have the new 
businesses operating by that date.

Along with these new vertical business decisions, the Executive 
Board has made two additional decisions that affect existing ISG 
organizations:

     1)  In order to more appropriately describe the mission of 
         the organization recently formed by combining 
         McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company with the 
         North American Sales force of the McDonnell Douglas 
         Computer Systems Company, this combined organization has 
         been renamed the McDonnell Douglas Business and Network 
         Systems Company.  Warren Prince will continue to head 
         this organization under the new title of 
         President - McDonnell Douglas Business and Network 
         Systems Company.  As before, Warren will report to the 
         ISG Executive Board through Gary Liebl.

     2)  In order to bring the name and status of the Commercial 
         Processing Centers (CPC) organization into line with the 
         other ISG companies, this organization has been 
         designated the McDonnell Douglas Information Processing 
         Company.  Ted Bellan will continue to head this 
         organization under the new title of President - McDonnell 
         Douglas Information Processing Company.  As before, Ted 
         will report to the ISG Executive Board through Bob 
         Fischer.






By midyear the ISG's basic structure will be complete.  That 
structure will consist of the following businesses:

serving our customers and attaining our revenue and earnings 
objectives.

Subject:     FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS MANUFACTURING AND 
             ENGINEERING SYSTEMS COMPANY



After carefully considering the recommendations of the Strategic 
Task Force on Discrete Manufacturing, the ISG Executive Board has 
decided to form the McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering 
Systems Company.

The company's mission will be to give the ISG worldwide penetration 
of the manufacturing and the architectural, engineering and 
construction markets by developing and marketing a strong line of 
graphics-based products to those markets.

McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company 
will have an objective of generating 1990 revenues of $1.3 billion, 
and after-tax profits of $100 million (in 1983 dollars).

In pursuit of those goals, the company's initial strategy will be:

  1)  To exploit the ISG's strong position in CAD/CAM and to focus 
      our efforts in the Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) 
      products field.

  2)  To emphasize development and marketing of Computer-Aided 
      Engineering (CAE) products.

  3)  To realize the technology-sharing and marketing advantages of 
      a combined CAE and CAD/CAM thrust.

The Executive Board does not plan to proceed, at least for the 
present, with applications in manufacturing resource planning and 
in automated material handling which were recommended by the Task 
Force.  Instead, the management of McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing 
and Engineering Systems Company will review the Task Force 
recommendations and propose what additional areas of endeavor they 
believe will be necessary to make the company a strong, long-term 
competitor in the fields of CIM and CAE.






The McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company 
will be headquartered in St. Louis.  It will operate as two 
business units--the Manufacturing Industry Systems Company and the 
Architectural, Engineering and Construction Information Systems 
Company.  The latter business unit will include the newly acquired 
Applied Research of Cambridge, Ltd.

The new company will be headed by John Clancy, who is promoted to 
President - McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering Systems 
Company.  He will report to the ISG Executive Board through 
Bob Fischer.  George Meister continues as Senior Vice President and 
General Manager - McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems 
Company.  Paul Scholten is promoted to Vice President - Strategic 
Planning and Technology for the McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and 
Engineering Systems Company. Further appointments will be announced 
later.

John Clancy will head a team to develop a business plan and a plan 
to fill out the company's organizational structure.  The company is 
expected to be in operation effective 1 July 1985.

Subject:      FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FINANCIAL TRANSACTION 
              SYSTEMS COMPANY

After carefully considering the recommendations of the Strategic 
Task Force on Financial Services, the ISG Executive Board has 
decided to form the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction 
Systems Company.

The company's mission will be to build a major vertical industry 
business based on electronic point-of-sale services to retailers, 
financial institutions and service establishments.

The McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company will 
have an objective of generating 1990 revenues of $0.5 billion, and 
after-tax profits of $40 million (in 1983 dollars).

The company's strategy for achieving those goals is:

    1)   To more aggressively market our TeleCheck check 
         acceptance service across a broad range of retail 
         establishments.

    2)   To introduce a proprietary system to electronically 
         authorize checks and market that system to high-volume 
         retail establishments.

    3)   To market computer and communications services to credit 
         and debit card companies.

    4)   To pursue opportunities in the area of Automated Clearing 
         House (ACH) services.

In addition, the company will continue to evaluate several 
proposed strategies, including electronic bill payment, credit 
reporting and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) services.

The McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company will 
include the current McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  
The two other business units within the ISG's Financial Services 
Organization - McDonnell Douglas Banking Systems Company and 
McDonnell Douglas International Banking and Investment Systems 
Company - will transfer to McDonnell Douglas Diversified 
Information Systems Company.  This move will make the sales 
organization of the McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
Systems Company available to these companies and will concentrate 
in one place the industry-dedicated products the ISG sells to 
banks





The McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company will 
report to the ISG Executive Board through Bob Fischer.  It is 
planned that the President of the McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company will be recruited externally.  Until 
this position is filled, Alden Heintz, who is appointed President 
- McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company, will report to 
Bob Fischer, who will serve as acting President of the McDonnell 
Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company.

John Mazzola, former Project Director of the Financial Services 
Strategic Task Force, along with Jeff Baer and David Jung, members 
of that Task Force, will form a team to develop a business plan 
and a plan to fill out the new company's organizational 
structure.  McDonnell Douglas Financial Transactions System 
Company is expected to be in operation effective 1 July 1985.

             COMPANY


After carefully considering the recommendations of the Strategic 
Task Force on Wholesale/Retail Distribution, the ISG Executive 
Board has decided to form the McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
Systems Company.

The company's mission will be to establish a strong ISG presence in 
the retail industry by providing information solutions to a full 
range of businesses involved in all phases of distribution, from 
manufacturers and suppliers through brokers and wholesalers to 
retail stores and chains.

McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company will have an 
objective of generating 1990 revenues of $0.4 billion and after-tax 
profits of $30 million (in 1983 dollars).

The company's strategy for reaching those goals will be:

    1)   To provide distribution management systems.

    2)   To provide integrated in-store systems such as inventory 
         control and automated ordering systems linked to laser 
         scanners and electronic cash registers.

    3)   To provide electronic data interchange (EDI) systems that 
         interconnect a full range of businesses involved in 
         distribution.

    4)   To provide electronic marketing services that allow 
         retailers to focus their marketing efforts by means of 
         in-store systems that display product information to 
         customers.

The company will focus initially on the supermarket industry.  
Additional lines of trade to be developed later include chain 
drugstores, discount stores and "do-it-yourself" home supply 
centers.  Eventually, the company will address such soft goods and 
fashion merchandise markets as department stores and specialty 
stores.

The McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company, headquartered 
in the southern California area, will combine the current 





McDonnell Douglas Distribution Information Systems Company and the 
McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange Company.  The new 
company will include some of the distribution industry capabilities 
currently in the McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

The new company will be headed by Otis Brinkley, who is promoted to 
President - McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company.  He 
will report to the ISG Executive Board through Gary Liebl.  Further 
appointments will be announced later.

A team has been formed to develop a business plan and a plan to 
fill out the company's organizational structure.  The company is 
expected to be in operation effective 1 July 1985.

Subject:      RESTRUCTURING OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS DIVERSIFIED 
              INFORMATION SYSTEMS COMPANY

The formation of new ISG companies serving the Financial 
Transaction, Distribution, and Manufacturing and Engineering 
markets has resulted in a restructuring of the McDonnell Douglas 
Diversified Information Systems Company.  The following changes 
take effect 1 July 1985:

  1)  Rich Calvert is promoted to Senior Vice President and 
      General Manager - McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
      Systems Company.  Rich replaces Otis Brinkley, who is 
      promoted to President of the newly formed McDonnell Douglas 
      Distribution Systems Company.

  2)  The McDonnell Douglas Architectural, Engineering and 
      Construction Information Systems Company is transferred to 
      the McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering Systems 
      Company.  This change will align compatible CAD offerings 
      under one vertical industry company.

  3)  The McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange Systems 
      Company, under David Lonsdale, and the McDonnell Douglas 
      Distribution Information Systems Company, headed by 
      Eric Loken, transfer to the newly formed McDonnell Douglas 
      Distribution Systems Company.  These organizations form the 
      nucleus of this new vertical industry company organized along 
      retail lines of trade.

  4)  The McDonnell Douglas International Banking and Investment 
      Systems Company, headed by Adnan Elassad, and the 
      McDonnell Douglas Banking Systems Company, under 
      Dick Langford, transfer into the McDonnell Douglas 
      Diversified Information Systems Company, enhancing this 
      company's offerings to Banking and Financial institutions.

The above changes now position the McDonnell Douglas Diversified 
Information Systems Company along two lines:

  1)  The sales force will sell systems and services directly to 
      corporations that are not part of the customer and prospect 
      classifications specifically assigned to vertical industry 
      companies.







  2)  The following businesses will sell their products through 
      both the McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
      Company sales force and other ISG vertical companies where

Subject:      REORGANIZATION OF BLUE SECTOR CORPORATE MARKETING



The Blue Sector Corporate Marketing organization has been 
instrumental in providing support services to the various business 
units and to the Blue Sector management team.  As the needs of the 
ISG have changed, however, it has become necessary to restructure 
this organization.  The following changes are effective 
immediately

    1    Dave Rousseau is appointed Staff Vice President - 
         Marketing, ISG, and will report to Jim Donovan, Vice 
         President - ISG Marketing and Planning.

    2)   Acquisitions, Communications, Marketing Policy and 
         Research, and Recognition and Special Events become the 
         responsibility of the ISG Marketing and Planning 
         organization.  Full details of the ISG Marketing and 
         Planning organization will be provided in a concurrent AB 
         from Jim Donovan.

    3)   Dick Schenk, Director of Market Planning, will continue 
         to be responsible for Blue Sector planning activities and 
         will report to me.

    4)   Marketing Publications and Telemarketing will now report 
         to the McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
         Company.  Similarly, Exhibits will now report to the 
         McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems 
         Company.  These organizations have been assigned to the 
         business units for whom they have provided the greatest 
         amount of support.  The acquiring business units 
         recognize the need for continued cost-effective support 
         services to other business units.  All business units are 
         encouraged to continue to use these resources.

    5)   Library and Guest Services have become part of a 
         St. Louis Metropolitan Services organization reporting to 
         Ed Hamilton, Director - Special Projects.

This restructuring represents a major step toward our goal of a 
small, efficient ISG staff.  Please bear with the members of these 
organizations as they adjust to this new structure.

Subject:      ISG CORPORATE ACCOUNTS PROGRAM - MISSION, ROLE AND 
              INITIAL STAFFING


1.  The mission of the ISG Corporate Accounts Program as described 
    by John McDonnell in his AB of 3 October, 1984, is to provide 
    a . . . "centralized office to organize, coordinate and 
    oversee the sales activities of the various ISG units with a 
    number of strategically important customer accounts . . . now 
    being separately serviced by two or more business units."  The 
    overall objective of the program is to have a positive impact 
    on the revenue, sales productivity and consequent profit from 
    the designated ISG Corporate Accounts.

2.  In order to carry out this program a new position has been 
    formed, namely the ISG Corporate Account Executive.  The role 
    of the ISG Corporate Account Executive is to coordinate and 
    facilitate the sales process with various ISG business units 
    to certain assigned accounts.  In this role the ISG Corporate 
    Account Executive will work with our sales forces and the 
    executive managements of our customers and ISG business units. 
    In addition, they will be developing account management 
    systems ad programs such as an ISG Account Planning System, an 
    ISG Assigned Executive Program and a number of Special 
    Services designed to enhance our presence and relationship 
    with these important customers.  Initially, the systems and  
    programs will be implemented with the ISG Corporate Accounts 
    and later, if appropriate, proliferated to other sales 
    activities.

3.  I am pleased to announce the appointment of the following ISG 
    Corporate Account Executives:

    C. Fred Spurlock

    Fred is a former Vice President of Tymshare with extensive 
    experience in sales and sales management.  Fred's principal 
    assignment is the Communications industry.  In addition, Fred 
    will be developing the ISG Account Planning System.

    Ann E. Trampas

    Ann is a former District Manager for Tymnet and prior to that 
    she was a Regional Manager with the American Express Gold Card 
    Division.  Ann's principal assignment is the Financial 
    industry.  In addition, she will be developing the ISG 
    Assigned Executive Program.





    Paul E. Pearson

    Paul is a former Branch Manager for McDonnell Douglas 
    Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Prior to that he 
    worked for McAuto in the U.K. and in Minnesota, where he was 
    instrumental in developing the 3M account, now the largest 
    user of our Unigraphics system.  Paul's principal assignment 
    is the Major Industrials.  In addition, he will be developing 
    the Special Customer Services programs.

4.  Each of the above individuals has an established record in 
    sales and sales management.  Your support and cooperation with 
    them as they undertake their new assignments will be greatly 
    appreciated.

     Subject:      ISG Top Management Appointments



     1.  I am very pleased to announce effective immediately the 
         appointments of Bob Fischer and Gary Liebl as the Information 
         Systems Group Executive Officer and the Group Operating 
         Officer, respectively.  As such they will constitute the 
         headquarters of ISG and will have all business units and group 
         staffs reporting to them.  They will operate as a team with 
         Bob performing the chief executive duties, such as strategic 
         planning, policy formulation and coordination, 
         acquisitions/divestitures, corporate interface, group 
         organizational matters, and supervision of the group staff.  
         Reporting to Bob, Gary will perform the chief operating 
         duties, including overseeing the operation of all the business 
         units, operating plans, productivity programs, and business 
         unit organizational matters.  Both Bob and Gary will continue 
         as MDC officers with the title of Corporate Vice President.

     2.  The breadth and depth of the capabilities spread across our 
         business units offers ISG a unique opportunity.  Bob and Gary 
         will share responsibility for fostering intercomponent 
         relationships to maximize the benefits of this strength.  
         Strategy implementation and strategic and operating results 
         will also be shared responsibilities.

     3.  Temporarily continuing to report to Bob will be McDonnell 
         Douglas Financial Transaction Systems, McDonnell Douglas 
         Information Processing, Dynatax, Unitax and MSGI.  Most of 
         these should be transitioned to Gary by the end of this year.

     4.  I am very enthusiastic about the new ISG headquarters 
         structure and especially about the two new executives who 
         constitute the headquarters team.  Both are seasoned 
         executives with outstanding records, both are highly 
         action-oriented, both know the business intimately, both have 
         strong marketing backgrounds, both are strong advocates of our 
         new culture, both have contributed greatly to the ISG vision 
         and organizational structure as it has evolved, both are team 
         builders, both are outstanding, demanding leaders.   They also 
         represent a good balance in that Bob has extensive large 
         company experience, will continue to be located in St. Louis, 
         and is especially strong in strategic vision and in broad 
         communications/team building.  Gary on the other hand has 
         extensive smaller company experience, will continue to be 
         located in Southern California, and is especially strong in 
         tight operating control and in executive team building.


     5.  Needless to say, the Blue and Gold Sectors are hereby 
         dissolved, as promised.  With essentially all the business 
         units reporting to Gary, ISG will now be run as one integrated 
         group.

     6.  For now there will be a centralized finance support center in 
         St. Louis to provide financial support for those business 
         units which do not yet have fully functional financial 
         organizations.  The goal will be to achieve business unit 
         independence and have the people in this organization placed 
         within those business units no later than the end of 1986.  In 
         addition, decisions on how business units will continue to 
         obtain human resources and law support will be announced soon.

     7.  Concurrent with Bob's and Gary's promotions, Rich Calvert, 
         Jerry Causley, and Vern Smith are promoted to the positions of 
         President of McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
         Systems, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International, 
         and McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, respectively.

     8.  With these actions the top level organizational structure of 
         ISG is complete with the one exception of the communications 
         industry business unit.  That awaits the completion of the 
         study by the communications industry strategic task force.  
         That should be accomplished by the end of June.

     9.  With the implementation of this organizational structure my 
         active role in ISG will be complete, and I shall return to my 
         other role as President of MDC.  I can do that with great 
         peace of mind and confidence that ISG is in the hands of an 
         outstanding leadership team.

     Committee.  Its members are:

                     Mike Becker                     Gary Liebl
                     Jerry Causley                   Leo Mirowitz

                     Bob Fischer                     Paul Wiedenmann


     This group will meet monthly to make participative decisions on 
     important ISG matters.

     A second new group, the ISG Management Council, will meet in 
     conjunction with each Quarterly Review.  The Council's members 
     are:

                     Mike Becker                     Vern Hart
                     Ted Bellan                      Gene Horn

                     Jim Donovan                     Paul Wiedenmann
                     Bob Fischer                     Buck Yoder

     The Management Council will provide feedback on a full range of 
     business unit and staff activities.  Together, these groups 
     constitute a valuable communications and participative management 
     tool that can go far to enhance and support ISG's short-term and 
     long-term strategies.

          our recent top management changes.

     To:          MDC-HQ and Corporate Office Lists A-D

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION 
                  ORGANIZATION


     I am pleased to announce, effective immediately, the formation 
     of the ISG Finance and Administration Organization and 
     appointments to key positions in that organization.

     D. J. (Woody) Garrity is appointed Staff Vice President - 
     Administration for ISG.  Based in St. Louis, Woody will be 
     responsible for policy formulation and coordination of ISG 
     consolidated reporting and other special tasks in the areas of 
     management information systems, policy management, facilities, 
     procurement, and export control.  In addition, he will continue 
     to direct the centralized administrative support activities in 
     St. Louis.  These activities will not become part of the Group 
     staff; it is our intention to transfer substantially all of the 
     operations aspects of the centralized administration support 
     activities to the business units, while creating a lean policy 
     formulation and coordination staff at the Group level during 
     the next two months.  In the case of Information Resource 
     Management, however, this transfer will be timed with the 
     establishment of fully functional financial systems and 
     organizations in the business units.

     Ray A. Mundloch is appointed Controller for ISG.  Ray will be 
     based in St. Louis and will be responsible for establishing 
     accounting policy, reporting calendars and formats, and for 
     preparation of the monthly Group financial statements.  In 
     addition, he will monitor compliance with generally accepted 
     accounting principles, with ISG and Corporate accounting 
     policies and practices, and with the system of internal 
     accounting controls in each ISG business unit.  He will also 
     serve as the Corporate interface for historical financial 
     data.  Ray will continue to be responsible for the centralized 
     finance support center in St. Louis.  As with the centralized 
     administrative activities, these functions will not become part 
     of the Group staff.  As previously announced, the goal is to 
     achieve business unit independence and to have the people in 
     this centralized organization placed within those business 
     units no later than the end of 1986.

     I will function, on an acting basis, as Staff Vice President - 
     Financial Planning and Analysis for the Group.  The 
     responsibilities of this position are forward-looking in nature 
     and include working with each of the ISG business units on the 
     annual operating plan, forecasts and outlooks, and on reviews 
     of special financial studies and proposals.  This function will 
     also prepare and publish forward-looking consolidated ISG 
     financial information and will serve as the Corporate interface 
     for this information.







     A. J. (Arnie) Hyde is appointed to the position of Director - 
     International Financial Planning and Analysis.  In this capacity, 
     Arnie will be located in Hemel Hempstead, England, and work with 
     both the Staff Vice President - Financial Planning and Analysis 
     and with the Group Controller on financial matters pertaining to 
     McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company - UK and 
     McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International Company.  
     Additionally, he will serve as the Finance Director of McDonnell 
     Douglas UK Ltd. (MDUKL), with special emphasis on UK tax and cash 
     coordination activities for ISG and for McDonnell Douglas.

     Woody and Ray will soon be publishing additional administrative 
     bulletins describing their functions in more detail and 
     announcing appointments.

     Subject:     FORMATION OF ISG HUMAN RESOURCES ORGANIZATION



     Effective immediately, Mike Becker is appointed Staff 
     Vice President - Human Resources for the ISG.  In his new 
     position, Mike will report to me and will be responsible for 
     Group Human Resource activities which include:

          -   Policy Formulation and Coordination

          -   Compensation and Benefits

          -   Human Resource Management

          -   Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action

          -   Employee Attitude Surveys

          -   Human Resource support for Group staff organizations

     Mike is also responsible for coordinating activities among the 
     Human Resource organizations within the business units.

     In addition, two important programs that require consistent 
     administration across all of ISG will report to Mike:

          -   Management and Professional Development, under 
              Ken Best.  (Other training activities, including 
              technical, sales, and product- or job-specific skills 
              training will be the responsibility of the individual 
              business units.)

          -   Placement, Advancement, Counseling and Training (PACT), 
              under Jerry Sexauer.

     Both of these programs benefit the entire ISG and are most 
     appropriately administered at the Group level.

     One of the ISG's most important goals is to achieve business 
     unit independence and to decentralize as many staff functions as 
     possible by no later than the end of 1986.  In the meantime, we 
     will use regional support centers to provide staff support for 
     those business units that are not yet self-sufficient.  In the 
     area of Human Resources, this approach will be carried out as 
     follows:



          -   Wylie Taylor is responsible for Human Resource support 
              for McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  He 
              will have a parallel responsibility for companies in 
              the West which do not have their own Human Resource 
              functions.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company

              -   Group Staff organizations located on the West Coast

              Wylie reports to Vern Smith, President, 
              McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

          -   In the East, a position for managing Human Resource 
              support, yet to be filled, will report to me.  Until an 
              appropriate individual is named to this position, 
              Mike Becker will have acting responsibility to provide 
              Human Resource support for the following companies:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing and Engineering 
                  Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Processing Company

              -   MSGI, Dynatax and Unitax

          -   Human Resource organizations that already exist within 
              business units will continue to support their 
              individual business units.  Those organizations are:

              -   McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
                  Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company

              -   McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International 
                  Company

     ISG now has an efficient Human Resource framework.  Further 
     announcements will be made in the coming months as staffing 
     decisions are made at the Group and business unit level.  In the 
     meantime, I urge you to cooperate with all Human Resource staffs 
     as they work to provide us with effective and responsive Human 
     Resource support.

     Effective immediately, Bernie Hathaway is appointed Vice 
     President - Productivity for ISG, reporting to me.  In this 
     position, Bernie will be responsible for championing 
     productivity programs for all ISG business units and will work 
     with the business units to develop effective productivity 
     improvement activities that are consistent with both ISG and MDC 
     standards and objectives.

     To facilitate this process, productivity executives representing 
     each business unit will report to Bernie on a dotted line basis 
     as they implement productivity activities appropriate to their 
     respective business units.

     Bernie's first order of business will be to assimilate all 
     former Blue Sector productivity efforts and integrate them with

     Subject:     CHANGES IN FORMER BLUE/GOLD SECTOR STAFF FUNCTIONS



     Dissolution of the ISG sectors has required us to reassign 
     several staff activities, including the following:

         -    Library Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility 
              of Ted Bellan, President - McDonnell Douglas 
              Information Processing Company.

         -    Guest Services (St. Louis) is now the responsibility of 
              Dave Rousseau, Staff Vice President - ISG Marketing.  
              This function currently provides an executive briefing 
              suite for use by all ISG businesses.  As budgets 
              permit, ISG  executive briefing facilities will be 
              opened in additional locations.

         -    Dick Schenk, formerly Director of Planning - ISG Blue 
              Sector, will, along with his organization, report to 
              Gary Liebl.  As Director - Operating Planning for ISG, 
              Dick will assist Gary in developing, analyzing, and 
              managing ISG business unit operating plans, for which 
              Gary is now responsible as Group Operating Officer.

         -    Alan Griffiths, formerly Director - Strategic Planning 
              for the Gold Sector, will now report to Wayne Hudgins, 
              Director of Planning - ISG, to consolidate ISG-wide 
              planning within the Group Marketing and Planning 
              function.  Alan brings a depth of experience in 
              technology consulting that will be invaluable to ISG's 
              strategic planning.

     Other steps involved in our transition to a unified ISG are 
     outlined in other ISG Administrative Bulletins.

     - Corporate Accounts, will report to me.  Charlie formerly 
     reported to John McDonnell, Chairman of the ISG Executive Board.

     Charlie will continue his efforts to ensure that ISG appropriately 
     coordinates its sales activities within our very largest accounts 
     and prospects.

     I am counting on you to give Charlie your support as he works with 
     us to ensure that ISG provides the best possible customer service 
     and that we identify all the business opportunities that our 
     biggest customers represent.

Subject:      MCDONNELL DOUGLAS COMPUTER SYSTEMS COMPANY 
              MANUFACTURING OPERATION, REDEFINITION OF 
              RESPONSIBILITIES


The reorganization of the Gold Sector Manufacturing Operation 
was announced by Gary E. Liebl, ISG Executive Board Member, 
in his Administrative Bulletin 85-031, dated March 18, 1985.  
The reorganization announced at that time was in response to 
the recommendation made by the Special Task Force formed in 
1984 with the purpose of determining how the capabilities of 
all the manufacturing and procurement resources within ISG 
could best be utilized strategically and tactically.

As the needs of the Computer Systems Company and the 
Information Systems Group increase requiring more of my time 
and attention, I find it necessary at this time to remove 
myself from the acting position of Senior Vice President, 
Manufacturing.

Greg Lawson will continue to function with the title of Vice 
President, Manufacturing for the McDonnell Douglas Computer 
Systems Company.  In addition, however, as an expansion and 
redefinition of his responsiblities, Greg will assume full 
direction of the worldwide manufacturing operations of the 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.  Greg's 
additional responsibilities become effective June 10, 1985.

Reporting directly to Greg will be the people with 
manufacturing responsibilities formerly reporting to me.  
They are:  Barrie Laver, Director & General Manager, 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Limited;  Willie Jones, 
Managing Director, Microdata - Limited, Barbados;  John Lee, 
Director, Manufacturing Control;  Bob Smith, Director, 
Product Assurance;  Jim Ball, Vice President - General 
Manager, Distributed Systems Company and Thom Kelley, 
Director, Tymnet Manufacturing.

Your support of Greg in his expanded role, his direct reports 
and all engaged in the manufacturing process, will be 
sincerely appreciated.

     1.  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce the 
         appointment of A. Ann Lazerus to the position of 
         Director, Production Services - St. Louis, within MDIPC 
         Data Center Operations.  She is replacing Dave D. Borlin 
         who has accepted a key position within the Corporate IRM 
         Staff function.

     2.  Ann will be responsible for St. Louis based data 
         processing services that support ISG shared processing 
         and dedicated processing.  Such services include IBM and 
         CDC based mainframe services, Data Entry, Data Control 
         and Data Output operations and all associated Production 
         Support processes such as Storage Management, Scheduling 
         and Quality Control.

     3.  Ann's career in data processing began in 1962 with System 
         Development Corporation and has continued to progress 
         within and outside of McDonnell Douglas Corporation with 
         increasing technical and managerial responsibilities.  
         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the 
         University of California at Berkeley in 1974.

     4.  Her most recent assignment is that of a chair position in 
         ISG's Professional and Managerial Development Program.  
         Ann was among the first group accepted into this vital 
         ISG program.  Her previous position was Manager, 
         Production Audit, within the McDonnell Douglas Health 
         Information Systems Group.









     5.  Concurrent with this promotion of Ann, we send our 
         heartfelt appreciation and best wishes to Dave Borlin as 
         he moves into his new role.

     6.  Your cooperation and support of Ann in this position that 
         is so vital to customer satisfaction will be appreciated.

As many of you know, we are remodeling our St. Louis Executive 
Briefing Center in Bldg. 300.  The remodeled area will provide us 
with a facility in which we will be proud to host our customers 
and visitors.

Currently, the entrance to the area has a large display of 
photographs from the Missouri Botanical Garden, which were taken 
by Jack Jennings, Director of Sales in the Diversified Information 
Systems Company.  We think it would be fun to use photographs 
taken by other employees throughout the area.  If you are 
interested in having your work displayed, please submit your 
entries to Al Schikore, Dept. I018, Bldg. 301, Level 2W, Post A5, 
no later than 15 July 1985.  Photographs will be selected for 
display by a panel of distinguished ISG judges.  In order to be 
considered, entries must meet the following guidelines:

     -   All photos must be the original work and property of the
         submitting ISG employees or their families.

     -   Entries should be submitted as prints or slides along 
         with the name, address and title of the submitter as well 
         as a brief description of the subject.  (We will attempt 
         to return all materials submitted, but you should not 
         submit your only copy of a treasured photo or slide.)

If a photo is selected for exhibition, it will be enlarged (if 
appropriate), matted, framed and displayed in the area, with 
credit given to the artist.  As photos are rotated out of the 
exhibition, the artists will receive their photos, as they were 
displayed, for their own personal use.

I want to wish all entrants the best of luck.  I am really looking 
forward to seeing the results of the event.

             TRANSACTION SYSTEMS COMPANY




As you may recall, the Administrative Bulletin that announced the 
formation of the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems 
Company (AB ISG-85-61, 3 May 1985) indicated that I would act as 
President of that organization until a permanent president is 
selected.  In the meantime, however, we have a lot of work to do.  
We must develop a business plan to introduce the new product lines 
recommended by the Strategic Task Force and agreed upon by the ISG 
Executive Board.  In addition, such opportunities as credit 
reporting and loan authorization demand further study.        

To ensure that this work continues to progress, I am announcing an 
interim organization that will permit us to function in an orderly 
manner until a new president is named and can participate in 
building a permanent organization.  Effective immediately, the 
following people report directly to me:

David Jung, as Vice President-Credit Reporting Development.  David 
was Tymshare's Vice President of Strategic Planning before 
becoming a member of the Financial Services Task Force.  He is 
responsible for the continued exploration of credit reporting and 
loan authorization opportunities.

John Mazzola, as Vice President-Check Card Development.  Before he 
became Chairman of the Financial Services Task Force, John was 
Director of Corporate Marketing in the former McAuto.  He assumes 
responsibility for planning and initiating developmental and pilot 
activities in those product lines approved by the Executive Board, 
including debit cards and electronic check-cashing cards.

Jeff Baer, as Executive Assistant to the President.  Under my 
direction,  Jeff will perform many of the tasks of a full-time 
president, given that I am involved in many other ISG activities.  
Jeff was most recently a member of the Strategic Task Force.  
Prior to that, he was a Tymshare Vice President, responsible for 
the Payment Services Company.








Alden Heintz will continue to report to me as President of 
McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company, the organization within 
the McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company that 
is doing all of our current business in this area.  Alden will be 
involved in deliberations on all major McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company issues, but his primary focus will be 
on the continued growth and profitability of our existing 
businesses.

We intend in the near future to have McDonnell Douglas Financial 
Transaction Systems Company fully operational, with an integrated 
organizational structure and multiple business lines.  In the 
meantime, please give your full support to David, John, Jeff and 
Alden, as they set out to shape ISG's future in the financial 
transaction systems marketplace.

These are tough times for all of us in ISG.  But, keeping it all 
in perspective, there are people in our communities who have it 
a lot tougher.

As you may know, McDonnell Douglas offers you an opportunity to 
help our less fortunate neighbors by means of two community 
services funds -- Employee Charity and Community Services (ECCS) 
and Personnel Community Services (PCS).  Your contribution to 
either fund is made through payroll deduction and the money 
stays within the community in which you live.  As a matter of 
fact, one in three of those who contribute will benefit directly 
from one of the many organizations supported by ECCS/PCS.

"I Care, I Share" is the theme of this year's ECCS/PCS 
me in mind when a company 
representative calls upon you.  Please show how much you care by 
sharing generously.

1.  MDC Standards, Ref (a), provides a list of preferred 
    hardware and software standards for office automation.  For 
    ISG use, we are continuing with only the IBM Personal 
    Computer and IBM Personal Computer XT devices for automated 
    office systems.  Encl (1) provides the current standard 
    configurations for these systems.

2.  IBM Displaywriter has been removed from the standard.  The 
    IBM PC and IBM PC/XT with MultiMate are the standard systems 
    for word processing.  User Support Centers will provide 
    support for all installed Wang and Displaywriter systems, 
    but expansion of these systems, which require procurement of 
    hardware or software, is not authorized.

3.  Configurations in Encl (1) were modified to add Lotus 1-2-3 
    productivity aids, high speed hard disk backup capability 
    and graphics software.

4.  The User Support Centers are available to provide 
    information and assistance for configurations and ordering.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

         COMPANY               BULLETIN        DATE: 17 Sep 85



Subject:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION NATIONAL CAR RENTAL 
          CORPORATE-WIDE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

To:       McDonnell Douglas Corporation Plant Lists A-H; Post 
          Bulletin Boards



1.  McDonnell Douglas Corporation has again signed an exclusive 
    supplier agreement with National Car Rental system, Inc. 
    beginning 01 October 1985 through 30 September 1986.  This 
    agreement replaces the previous National contract which 
    expires on 30 September 1985.  National Car Rental is to be 
    used by all reservation functions and by any individual MDC 
    traveler on company business with or without advance 
    reservations.  All car rentals should be made through 
    National, even for the few locations which have no National 
    services (since National will reimburse the rate 
    differences).  MCAIR Travel Services in St. Louis has been 
    assigned responsibility by MDC Corporate Office to 
    administer this agreement for all MDC locations.

2.  With the new agreement, unlimited mileage daily rates for 
    compact size vehicles ("B" size) returned to the same rental 
    location range for $26.00/day in St. Louis, Los Angeles, 
    Phoenix and Long Beach to $27.00/day throughout the 
    remainder of the United States.  Domestic weekly rates are 
    five times the daily rate and monthly rates are three times 
    the weekly rate.  The agreement also provides for Canadian 
    and international discounts.  One-way rentals are charged a 
    reduced time and mileage rate.  National should be notified 
    of the one-way rental at the time of reservation booking to 
    prevent a drop charge.

3.  The same Corporate rates have again been extended to MDC 
    employees for personal travel.  To obtain the Corporate rate 
    for personal rentals, employees should identify themselves 
    as MDC employees when they call National Car Rental at 
    1-800-328-4567 for their reservation.  The Human Resources 
    Office and Recreation Department have National Car 
    Identification cards which should be used with the 
    employees' MDC badges to obtain the MDC rate for personal 
    travel.

4.  All Corporate and personal domestic rentals include full 
    insurance coverage [Collision Damage Waiver, (CDW)].  
    International rates do not include insurance and must be 
    obtained at the time of rental.  On personal rentals, for 
    insurance coverage beyond the free CDW, any necessary 
    personal credit reference and driver's license requirements 
    remain the responsibility of the employee.



5.  If National Car Rental fails to provide a vehicle that has 
    been confirmed within 45 minutes after the traveler arrives 
    at their counter, a written notice along with a copy of the 
    car rental agreement should be sent to MCAIR Travel 
    Services, Dept. 028, Bldg. 275, in St. Louis.  The delay 
    will result in a $25.00 credit rental certificate.  If 
    National fails to comply with the preceding within one (1) 
    hour of the employees' arrival at the rental counter, 
    National will be responsible for a $100.00 penalty.  All 
    penalty certificates are payable to MDC, and will be used to 
    reduce the applicable component's monthly car rental cost.

6.  Where possible, the MDC Huntington Beach, Long Beach or 
    St. Louis Travel Departments should be utilized for making 
    business trip car rental reservations.  MDC receives a 
    commission on any car reservations made through these 
    departments which will help to hold down the Corporation's 
    ever-increasing travel expenditures.

7.  Please route this AB to all personnel in your organization 
    to notify travelers or reservation functions prior to 
    01 October 1985.  Any questions on this agreement should be 
    referred to Travel Services at 314/234-6666 in St. Louis; 
    714/896-2872 in Huntington Beach and 213/593-7565 in Long

Subject:  Five Keys to Self Renewal; Special Assignment - 
          J. H. MacDonald



1.  Over the past four years, we have introduced the Five Keys 
    to Self Renewal; Strategic Management, Participative 
    Management, Human Resource Management, Productivity 
    Improvement and Ethical Decision Making.  Each of these 
    initiatives are interrelated and are necessary at MDC to 
    improve our competitive business position and ensure our 
    long-term survival.  It's our assessment that we are well 
    into what might be called the "awareness-informational- 
    experimental" phase of these Five Keys.  The big task ahead 
    of us is to guarantee that the Keys become fully implemented 
    and integrated into each of our jobs.  The Keys can't be 
    something we do in addition to our daily jobs but instead 
    must be literally built into the way we each carry out our 
    work.

2.  Because of the importance we place on this, we have asked 
    Jim MacDonald, Corporate Vice President - Human Resources, 
    to spend 90% of his time and effort over the next year on 
    ensuring that the Five Keys become fully implemented and 
    integrated into every function throughout the Corporation as 
    announced separately in Administrative Bulletin 85-74.

3.  The two of us will also be giving this Five Keys activity a 
    great deal of personal management direction.

To:       ISG Lists A - D

Subject:  ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETINS (AB's)



1.  The following guidelines are established regarding the use 
    of AB's within ISG:

          Administrative Bulletins (AB's) will be used 
          throughout ISG as the means of announcing organization 
          changes, promotions, new or revised policies requiring 
          immediate implementation and other administrative 
          matters of substantial importance.  Two types of AB's 
          will be used:

          -   ISG AB's - Issued by ISG HQ/Group Staff

          -   ISG Company AB's -  Issued by ISG Business 
                                  Units/Organizations reporting 
                                  directly to the Group 
                                  Executive Officer or the Group 
                                  Operating Officer.

          All AB's should be drafted on the appropriate AB form, 
          signed by a Director or higher level and ready for 
          issuance (excluding AB number and date) and forwarded 
          to the issuing organization.  All ISG AB's involving 
          policy will require ISG-HQ signature.  All company 
          AB's involving policy will require signature of 
          Company Head.  AB's which identify newly assigned or 
          revised reporting relationships should include the 
          signature of the principal to whom these personnel 
          will report.

          The issuing organization will assure that all position 
          titles used in the AB are correct and will verify with 
          Human Resources that all announcements of promotions 
          or other title changes have been approved prior to 
          release of the AB.

          AB distribution should be customized whenever feasible 
          to include the specific Management Levels and 
          combination of ISG and other MDC organizations that 
          are impacted by the information being communicated.  
          Examples:  (1) For organization change in a Company 
          Fiscal area, Dist.--Company Levels A-E; (2) For change 
          in Cafeteria hours ISG Campus, Dist.--ISG and 
          MDAIS-St. Louis, Levels A-H; (3) For new Director 
          appointment ISG Group, Dist.--All ISG levels A-D.



          An ISG AB is required:

          -   when an ISG company announcement includes 
              concurrence signature(s) of ISG HQ or ISG Group 
              Staff principals,

          -   for all announcements of a policy nature which 
              materially impact any ISG company other than the 
              issuing organization,

          -   for all announcements of Vice President or higher 
              level promotion (distribution to include MDC 
              levels A through D).


          ISG AB's

          Responsibility for issuance is assigned to ISG Policy 
          Management.

          These AB's will be issued on ISG AB stationery. The AB 
          number will consist of a prefix - "ISG" followed by 
          the year (2 digits) and a single consecutive number, 
          i.e. - ISG-85-XXX.  (All numbers to be assigned by ISG 
          Policy Management.)


          ISG Company AB's

          Responsibility for issuance is assigned to each 
          applicable ISG Company head, reporting directly to the 
          Group Executive Officer or the Group Operating 
          Officer, or their appointed representative.  Each 
          company shall inform ISG Policy Management of the 
          individual assigned this responsibility.  It is 
          recommended that this be the same individual 
          responsible for handling policy coordination for each 
          ISG Company.

          These AB's will be issued on ISG Company AB 
          stationery.  The AB number will consist of the 
          specific company appreviation as a prefix followed by 
          the year (2 digits) and a single consecutive number, 
          i.e. - For "Health Systems", HS-85-XX.  Each ISG 
          Company shall include ISG Policy Management in the 
          distribution of their AB's.



2.  Please assure that communication of AB type information 
    within your area of concern is accomplished by an AB and is 
    prepared in accordance with the requirements as stated 
    above.  All ISG AB's should be forwarded to ISG Policy 
    Management-St. Louis, Dept. L089, Bldg. 301 for issuance and 
    a copy of each ISG company AB should be sent to them for 
    information.  Please call Ext. 36113 if you have any 
    questions on this subject.

Subject:  FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ELECTRONIC MESSAGING 
          SYSTEMS COMPANY



I am pleased to announce the formation of the McDonnell Douglas 
Electronic Messaging Systems Company.  MDEMS combines two 
existing businesses, FTCC and OnTyme, to aggressively pursue a 
larger share of the Electronic Messaging Market.  Combined 
revenue of FTCC and OnTyme in 1985 is $30 Million and the 
planned 1986 revenue goal for MDEMS is $40 Million.  This new 
unit will be a product organization and will rely on other ISG 
business units for the distribution of its products.

One key element of the 1986 MDEMS sales plan is to encourage all 
ISG business units to sell these messaging products.  At the 
present time, the bulk of the messaging revenue originates from 
the Diversified Systems Company and FTC Communications.  These 
organizations will continue to aggressively sell these products, 
but MDEMS will begin working with the other business units to 
adapt the products to their markets.

During the remainder of 1985, the MDEMS organization structure, 
business plan and 1986 financial operating plan will be 
developed to enable us to implement our messaging business 
strategy.

MDEMS will be managed by Terry Donaher, Vice President of 
Network Applications for the business and Network Systems 
Company and will report to Warren Prince, President of McDonnell 
Douglas Business and Network Systems Company.

Subject:  San Jose/Santa Clara, California Hotel Accommodations



1.  Information Systems Group has obtained special accommodation 
    rates with the Marriott Hotel, Santa Clara and the Embassy 
    Suites, Santa Clara for MDC employees.

2.  The Marriott Hotel is located at Highway 101 and Great 
    American Parkway (telephone (408) 988-1500); special MDC 
    rate for a hotel sleeping room is seventy-nine dollars 
    ($79.00) per night, single or double, Monday-Sunday.  The 
    rate is net/non-commissionable and applicable tax is not 
    included.  Reservations should be made by the MDC Authorized 
    Agency or individual directly with the Hotel Reservation 
    Department.  Reference to the special MDC rate should be 
    made when making reservations.  Billing procedures (paid for 
    individually upon check-out or billed to MDC) will be 
    established at the time the reservation is being made.  This 
    special rate is not a guaranteed space agreement and 
    therefore accommodations are subject to availability.

3.  The Embassy Suites location is 2885 Lakeside Drive (Highway 
    101 and Bowers) (telephone (408) 496-6400) special MDC rate 
    is eighty dollars ($80.00) single, ninety dollars ($90.00) 
    double, Monday thru Thursday per night, and sixty-nine 
    dollars ($69.00) up to four (4) people Friday thru Sunday 
    per night.  The rate is net/non-commissionable and 
    applicable tax is not included.  These rates include the 
    standard amenities of a two (2) room suite, complimentary 
    made-to-order breakfast every morning, complimentary 
    refreshments each evening, complimentary limousine service 
    to and from San Jose, California airport and a 'no tipping' 
    policy.  Reservations should be made by the MDC Authorized 
    Agency or individual directly with the Embassy Suites 
    Reservation Department.  Reference to the MDC special rate 
    should be made when making reservations.  Billing procedures 
    will be established at the time the reservation is being 
    made.  These special rates are not guaranteed space 
    agreements and therefore accommodations are based on 
    availability.



4.  These special rates are effective through 31 December 1985 
    at which time volume will be assessed and we may be in a 
    position to make the commitment necessary to get lower rates 
    in 1986.  These agreements provide excellent accommodations 
    in two (2) of the finer hotels in the San Jose airport 
    vicinity.  However, if you find any kind of problem with the 
    service you receive while staying at the hotels, a call to 
    Mike Tipton, McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company, 
    (408) 435-7606, Purchasing Department, will be all that is 
    required for us to follow-up with hotel administration.

5.  All MDC personnel are encouraged to take full advantage of 
    these offers while in the San Jose/Santa Clara area.

I sincerely regret to announce the resignation of Gary E. Liebl, 
currently the Group Operating Officer of the Information Systems 
Group, effective Thursday, October 17, 1985.

Gary has accepted an appointment as President, Chief Operating 
Officer and member of the Board of Cipher Data Products, Inc., 
of San Diego, California, a leading supplier of magnetic tape 
peripherals and controllers.

During the time we worked together as ISG executive board 
members and, since June, as the team leading the ISG, I have 
developed great respect for his capabilities and for him as a 
person.  He will be greatly missed, and I am sure we all wish 
him much success in the future.

Prior to his present ISG position, Gary was President of 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company and President of 
Microdata Corporation.  Gary was also appointed a Corporate Vice 
President of MDC in July 1983.

Gary's departure makes necessary some alterations in the senior 
management structure of ISG; those changes will be announced in 
a few days.

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.



*Chart not transmitted via OnTyme



ISG-85-162
Page 2


    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162
Page 3


Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.

Personal  property  items  and  equipment may be contributed to a

that  have  been  determined  to  be  surplus  to MDC needs.  MDC
Policy  #4,  and  ISG  Management Directive #101, as contained in
the   ISG   Management   Handbook,   indicates  specific  advance
coordination/approvals to authorize such contributions:

    o  All   contributions   of   property  having  and  original
       acquisition  cost  of  $1000  or  less  per  item  require
       approval  of  the  applicable  ISG Company Head (Component
       Head).

    o  All   contributions   of   property   having  an  original
       acquisition  cost  of  more  than  $1000  per item require
       approval  of  the  applicable  ISG Company Head (Component
       Head),  coordination  with  the Corporate Vice President -
       ISG  Finance,  and  the  approval  of  the  Corporate Vice
       President - Civic Affairs.

To   assure   consistent   control  and  accurate  accounting  of
contributions  of  this  nature,  these items are to be listed on
the  applicable  property  disposition  authority document by the
disposing  company's  property  inventory  control  manager  with
concurrence of the company controller.

For  those items having an original acquisition cost of more than
$1000,  the  property  disposition authority document bearing the
approval  of  the  disposing  Company  Head is to be submitted to
Inventory  and  Data Control in ISG Procurement.  This department
will  coordinate  the request with the Corporate Vice President -
ISG  Finance,  and  submit  it  to the Corporate Vice President -
Civic  Affairs  for  approval.    Inventory and Data Control will
return the approved document to the originating company.

Please  assure  that any property contributions initiated by your
organizations are handled in this manner.

I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  formation  of  the Information
Systems  Group  Procurement  organizations  consisting of a Group
Procurement  Office  located  in  St.  Louis  and  three Regional
Material Support Centers effective immediately.

Donald  J.  (Don)  Boland  is  appointed Manager, ISG Procurement
reporting  to  the  writer.  Don has over 30 years of procurement
related  experience  with  MDC.    The  Information Systems Group
Procurement  office  is responsible for Information Systems Group
procurement  policy  and  standards  and for directing group wide
purchasing,  inventory  issues, equipment leasing and procurement
planning.   The Group Procurement staff of seven individuals will
obtain  economies  of  scale  through group wide consolidation of
requirements,  establishing  common  communications and equipment
transfers,  and  administering  and originating third party lease
arrangements.

The  Regional  Organizations were developed using the Information
Systems    Group/Regional   Organizations   Concept   which   has
management  acceptance.   These Regional Material Support Centers
will  report  to  "Host"  Business  Units  in St. Louis, Southern
California  and  Northern  California.    Each  Center will offer
procurement  services  to  ISG  businesses and functions in their
region  including their "Host" organizations.  Business Units can
provide their own procurement support if they choose.

Karen  Gedera  is  assigned  responsibility  for  the  St.  Louis
Regional  Material  Support  Center  reporting  to  Rich Calvert,
President   Diversified   Information  Systems  Company  (DISCO).
These  new  duties  will  be in addition to her responsibility as
Director,  Marketing  for  DISCO.    Karen  has  over 17 years of
experience  with MDC including staff, marketing and business unit
management positions.

Robert  (Bob)  Mason  is assigned responsibility for the Southern
California   Regional   Material   Support  Center  reporting  to
Greg   Lawson,  Vice  President  Manufacturing  Computer  Systems
Company  (CSCO).    These  new  duties will be in addition to his
responsibility  as  Director, Material Operations and Procurement
for  CSCO.    Bob  has over 20 years of procurement experience in
the  computer  industry  which includes the past eight years with
Microdata and ISG.

Coy  Smith is assigned responsibility for the Northern California
Regional  Material  Support  Center  reporting  to  John  Elbert,
Controller,  Network Systems Company (NSCO).  His new duties will
be  in  addition  to  his  responsibility  as Director, Financial
Control  for  NSCO.    Coy has over 30 years of Fiscal experience
with MDC.

The  Procurement  groups  have  reduced  staffs  significantly in
response  to  ISG's  performance improvement program.  In concert
with  ISG's  performance  improvement  program  and moratorium on
promotions,  these  organizations  are being put in place with no
increase in headcount and no promotions.

Information   Systems   Group  purchases  currently  exceed  $300
million  per year and represent a sustaining opportunity for cost
and  quality  optimization.    Don,  Bob, Coy and Karen and their
staffs  are  dedicated  to  obtaining maximum value for every ISG
purchase  dollar.    Please  give them your full support in their
efforts.

In  addition  to  the  direct  line  reporting  relationship to a

Subject:  MANAGEMENT  AND  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PHASES - 1986
          POLICY   CHANGES   ON   TRAVEL  EXPENSES,  TUITION  AND
          CANCELLATION



The  Management  and Professional Development organization (M&PD)
has  scheduled  a  full  complement  of  Phase  programs in 1986.
These  residential  Phases will again be held in St. Louis at the
Doubletree    Hotel   and   Conference   Center   (Formerly   the
Breckenridge).

In  1984  and  1985,  the Phase program costs were not charged to
the  attendees department or business unit.  The only direct cost
was  travel  to  St.  Louis  for  out-of-town attendees.  Several
policy  changes  have  been  adopted by ISG Senior Management for
1986.

In summary they include the following:

    -  A  $500  tuition fee will be paid for each Phase attendee.
       (This  charge  will  be  distributed  within each business
       unit according to that unit's policy.)

    -  Each  business  unit has committed to a specific number of
       attendees  to  each  Phase.    Participant space that goes
       unfilled   through:     unscheduled  attendees,  scheduled
       attendee  cancellation,  or  no  shows  will incur a $1500
       charge  to  the  appropriate  business  unit or attendee's
       department.

    -  The  allowable  travel expenses associated with attendance
       at the Phase will be charged to M&PD.

Allowable  travel  expenses  chargeable  to M&PD include lodging,
all  meals,  lowest  available  air  fare  and  other  incidental
expenses  such  as  mileage  to  and  from  the  airport, airport
parking  and  baggage  fees.    It  will not include rental cars,
additional days per diem or higher fare airline routing.

To   accommodate  the  flexibility  to  schedule  extra  days  in
St.  Louis  or  other  itinerary changes for appropriate business
purposes,  the  attendees'  TR's  and Travel Expense reports will
still  be  issued  and  approved  by  the  appropriate department
manager.    The  traveler will receive with his airline ticket an
invoice  copy  showing  the  allowable  air  fare  and actual air
fare.  (Allowable and actual air fare will be the same if the



-2-
ISG-85-191
13 Dec 85


traveler  uses  the  scheduled routing.)  M&PD will reimburse the
traveler's  department  budget, through a cost transfer activity,
for  the  allowable  air  fare  cost.    Any  additional air fare
expense  due  to  a  different routing will remain charged to the
traveler's department.

Upon  registration  for  Phase  attendance,  M&PD  will  make the
attendee's  airline  reservation through McDonnell Douglas Travel
Company  at  the  lowest  available  fare.    This  may require a
connection  or intermediate stop routing.  (e.g., 11/22/85 LAX to
STL  to LAX non-stop round trip fare is $800.  Connecting through
Salt  Lake  City  adds  1 1/2 hours each way and reduces the fare
45%  to  $438  round  trip.)   Attendees may change their airline
reservations.   However, any additional cost associated with such
changes  will  remain  charged  to their department.  The program
and  information  packet  sent  to  attendees  upon  registration
contains  instructions  for  confirming  flight  arrangements and
receiving their tickets.

Since  air  fare  is cost transferred and hotel lodging, all meal
and  program  expenses  are  directly  billed  items to M&PD, the
traveler's  out-of-pocket  expense should be fairly minor.  These
expenses  would  include reasonable charges for transportation to
and  from  the originating airport, parking, baggage fees and the
like.   In order to reimburse the traveler's department for these
incidental    travel   expenses   without   creating   additional
administrative  cost  and  effort,  M&PD  will  transfer  to each
out-of-town  attendee's  department  travel  budget an additional
$40  allowance regardless of actual incidental expenses.  The net
effect  of  this  policy should be to eliminate all business unit
travel expenses for most Phase attendees.

Subject:  NEW PRODUCT COORDINATION WITH FIELD SERVICE COMPANY



We  all  share  an  interest  in the need to provide high quality
field  service  to  ISG customers.  Coordinating for new products
(especially  a  potentially  large  number  of  them)  is a major
challenge.    Field  Service  Company is dedicated to provide the
support  required.    To  do so, we must function within ISG on a
true teammate basis.

To  help  achieve  successful coordination of service preparation
by  the  various  service  divisions,  Steven  E. Adams, Manager,
Product    Introduction    Support,   has   been   assigned   the
responsibility  for  new  product  control.  In this capacity, he
will  be  a  focal point for new product information within Field
Service Company.

The  numerous  activities  required to prepare for the successful
introduction  of service on new products will be coordinated in a
project  schedule and calendar which Steve will administer.  Once
a  new product is accepted for service, Steve will require inputs
from   involved   product  developers,  account  managers,  sales
directors,   technical  experts,  training  providers,  logistics
coordinators, etc. on a timely basis.

This  assignment  is  intended to provide a simplified version of
what has succeeded in the past as follows:

    .  A  common single point of consolidated information for all
       involved service groups;

    .  A  thorough  list  of  service  preparation  projects  for
       consolidation in a timely manner;

    .  Help  to  ensure  that  new product support needs of Field
       Service   personnel   will  be  complete,  consistent  and
       available;

    .  Systematic  tools  to simplify the tracking of new product
       milestones, commitments and results;

    .  Improved   provisions  for  a  total  projects  management
       service    to    promote    intergroup    awareness    and
       collaboration.

We  expect  this new approach will benefit all our ISG customers.
It  is  not  intended  to  add bureaucracy or dilute any existing
authority  for  duties  or  interactions.  To achieve the desired
results,   your   support,   cooperation  and  participation  are
requested and will be appreciated.

                                               Enclosure (1) to
                                               AB# ISG-86-4

                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE

SUMMARY:

A  leave  of absence is a management-approved absence authorizing
full-time  employees  an  absence  from  the  Company for reasons
considered  satisfactory  to  the  Company  provided the employee
definitely  plans  to  return  to  work at the Company or is on a
disability leave.

APPLICABLE TO:

All  full-time employees covered by McDonnell Douglas Information
Systems Group Benefits.

DEFINITION:

A  Leave of Absence is an authorized absence granted to employees
who  will be absent from work for 6 or more consecutive scheduled
work days.

REGULATIONS:

A.  General

    An  approved  Leave  of  Absence  Authorization  (LOAA)  form
signed  by  the  supervisor  and  next  management  level must be
submitted   to   Human   Resources.      Attach   any   pertinent
documentation  justifying the leave.  Leaves may be approved when
substantiated  with  reasons  acceptable to the Company.  Maximum
leave  durations  and  extensions for various types of leaves are
specified in Appendix 1.

    Extension  of  a  leave will require the supervisor to submit
an  additional LOAA form to Human Resources with the new expected
return  date  of  the employee.  When a requested leave extension
will  result  in  a total leave period which exceeds the "maximum
leave   duration"  specified  in  Appendix  1,  approval  of  the
Business  Unit Head, Business Unit/Regional Human Resources Head,
and Manager Benefits - ISG.

    An  employee  planning  to  return to work on expiration of a
leave  is  requested  to  give  supervision  at  least one week's
notice  of  this intent, if possible.  Upon the employee's return
to  work  the supervisor must inform Human Resources of the date,
thus, terminating the leave of absence.

    Employees  failing  to  return to work at the expiration of a
leave will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.



    An  employee  will  not be granted a leave of absence for the
purpose  of  seeking or taking employment elsewhere, or operating
a private business.

B.  Types of Authorized Leaves:

    1.  Disability

    Leaves  of absence for personal illness, injury, maternity or
other  physical  disability  will  be granted when an employee is
absent from work 6 or more consecutive days.

    If   a   doctor's   statement   has  not  been  submitted  to
supervision  at  the  beginning  of  the  absence, due to medical
reasons   or   emergency,   the   supervisor  will  notify  Human
Resources,  who will send the employee a letter explaining that a
doctor's  note is required in order for sick leave payments to be
continued.    If  Human  Resources  does not receive the doctor's
verification  of  disability within two weeks or Human Resources'
letter  to  the  employee, the employee will have assumed to have
voluntarily terminated.

    During  an  absence  due  to  disability,  the  employee will
receive  disability pay as specified in the Short Term Disability
Policy  for  up  to  26 weeks.  At the end of the maximum 26 week
paid  leave  period,  the  employee  will  be placed on an unpaid
leave.    The  employee  should  file for benefits under the Long
Term  Disability Plan for leaves that extend beyond 26 continuous
weeks.

    Employees  on  an  approved  disability leave may continue to
participate  in their current health care benefits and group life
insurance  plans  through  payroll deductions for up to 26 weeks.
On  leaves  accrued  beyond this period, payroll will deduct from
employee's  earning,  appropriate  insurance premiums upon return
to work.

    Except  for  long  term  leaves  (i.e.  leaves  longer than 6
months),   employees   continue  to  accrue  service  credit  and
vacation.

    It  is the employee's responsibility to notify supervision if
an  extension of disability leave is needed at least five working
days  prior  to  the  original  expected  return  date  to  work.
Employee  must  submit  a  statement from the attending physician
indicating  the  complications which require additional leave and
must specify the new expected return date.

    Prior  to  return  to  work after disability leave, a medical
release  must  be  submitted  to Human Resources in situations as
described under the Short Term Disability Policy.



    An  employee  who becomes pregnant will notify her supervisor
of  her  pregnancy.   The employee may continue working until the
date  established  by  the  employee's doctor that work should be
discontinued.    The  employee  must  furnish  a  letter from her
attending  physician  attesting  to  her  good health and stating
probable  date  of delivery.  Leave will commence when it becomes
necessary  for her to discontinue work as a result of information
provided by her physician.

    2.  Military Leave

    Employee  must  have  one  or  more years of credited service
with   the  Corporation  to  qualify  for  paid  military  leave.
Differential  pay  is  provided  for  up  to  two  (2)  weeks per
calendar  year  for short term active duty of 30 calendar days or
less,  including  annual  training  duty, as a member of the U.S.
Military  Reserves  or  National  Guard.  Differential pay is the
difference  between  the employee's base military pay and regular
rate  of  pay.    Military pay includes all military earnings and
allowances except for rations, quarters, subsistence and travel.

    The  employee informs management of requirement to report for
annual  military reserve training and arranges for time off up to
a  maximum  of  30  calendar  days.  If required to be absent for
more  than  ten (10) working days, the employee may elect to take
vacation or unpaid personal leave.

    On  completion  of  duty,  the  employee  should  submit  the
following to Payroll:

    a.  Pay  voucher  showing all military earnings for the total
        period of absence,
    b.  Military orders,
    c.  "Statement of Earnings for Paid Military Absence" form.

    On  receipt  of  the  above documentation, Payroll will issue
the  pay  differential  between  employee's  military pay and the
employee's  regular  rate  of  pay, for normal five-day workweek,
the pay period after the documentation is received.

    If  an  employee enlists or is drafted into any branch of the
U.S.  Armed  Services  for more than 30 calendar days, employment
will  be  terminated to enter military service.  Supervision must
submit  to  Human  Resources  a termination notice accompanied by
military  orders.    Employee's reinstatement will be governed by
Military Selective Service Act, as amended.



    3.  Civic Service

    Leaves  may  be  granted to permit employees to serve initial
terms  in  full-time municipal, county, state, or federal office,
whether  elected or appointed, provided any conflicts of interest
can  be  resolved  before  a leave is granted.  Extensions may be
granted  in  accordance  with  Appendix 1.  Leaves of absence for
civic  service  requires  the  approval of the Business Unit Head
and  Business  Unit/Regional  Human  Resources  Head.  This is an
unpaid   leave   of   absence   and   all  company  benefits  are
discontinued, including service credit and vacation accrual.

    4.  Jury Duty

    Full  pay  to employees is provided for up to 20 working days
for  jury duty or duty as a subpoenaed witness.  Employee retains
any  court compensation for service in addition to receiving full
pay.

    In  instances  where  an  employee's  absence  would  have an
adverse  influence  upon  the  work  schedule, or when a critical
work  skill  is  involved,  the  Company  may  request  that  the
employee  be  excused from jury duty.  Such requests, prepared by
the  Human  Resources Head, will be held to a minimum and require
approval of the Business Unit Head.

    Employees  called  for  jury  or witness duty will present to
their  supervisor,  in  advance,  official  evidence  that  their
service is required.

    An  employee  is  required  to  report for work if excused or
dismissed  from  jury  or  witness  service before the end of the
working   day  (of  shift)  provided  there  is  sufficient  time
remaining before the end of the employee's regular shift.

    If  a  shift  employee  serves  on  jury duty or as a witness
during  the  day and is scheduled for work on the second or third
shift,  the  supervisor  determines  whether  the  employee  must
report  for work on the scheduled shift.  All hours worked on the
scheduled  shift will be compensated by the Company in the normal
manner.

    Time  spent on jury or witness duty applies toward employee's
regular work schedule.

    While  on  jury duty, the employee will submit to supervision
at  the  end  of  each week a Jury Attendance Report, signed by a
court official, to be eligible for compensation.



    5.  Personal

    An  employee  may be granted a personal leave of absence upon
approval  by  the  immediate  supervisor  and  the  next level of
management  up, to a maximum of four (4) weeks.  Current business
conditions,   job   performance,  attendance  and  necessity  for
requesting  the  personal leave will be taken into consideration.
Based  on  these factors, leave may be paid or unpaid.  Extension
beyond four (4) weeks require approval as shown in Appendix 1.

    Company  benefits  will  continue  during  this  period.  For
unpaid  leaves,  payroll  will  deduct  from employee's earnings,
upon   return   to   work,  insurance  premiums  which  may  have
accumulated during leave.

    If  the  employee  should  terminate while on Personal Leave,
the  effective  date  of  the  termination  will  be the last day
worked.

    6.  Educational

    Employees  may  be  granted  an  educational leave of absence
without  pay  to  satisfy  residence  requirements  leading to an
approved  Doctorate  degree.   Such a leave requires the approval
of   the   Business   Unit  Head,  Business  Unit/Regional  Human
Resources  Head,  and Manager Benefits - ISG.  Employee must have
6   months   active   Company  service  to  be  eligible  for  an
educational  leave.    Maximum duration and extension is shown in
Appendix 1.

    Company  benefits  will continue during this period.  Payroll
will  deduct  from  employee's  earnings,  upon  return  to work,
insurance premiums which may have accumulated during the leave.

    If  the  employee  should  terminate  while on an educational
leave,  the  effective  date  of the termination will be the last
day worked.

    7.  Peace Corps/VISTA

    Employees  volunteering  for  either  Peace  Corps  or  VISTA
activity  may  be  granted  an  unpaid leave for the full term of
their  enlistment in accordance with Appendix 1.  Approval of the
Business Unit Head and Human Resources Head is required.

    Company   benefits   and  group  insurance  coverage  is  not
continued during this leave of absence.

                      SHORT TERM DISABILITY


SUMMARY:

The   Short   Term  Disability  benefit  provides  protection  to
employees   against  loss  of  compensation  due  to  illness  or
disability.    Paid  disability leave, to the extent specified in
this  directive,  is  provided when employees must be absent from
work  due to illness, injury or pregnancy.  Short Term Disability
is not to be used for any other time-off purposes.

APPLICABLE TO:

All  full-time employees covered by McDonnell Douglas Information
Systems Group Benefits.

DEFINITIONS:

Service  Date:    The employee's hire date or most recent re-hire
date.    Adjustments are made to the service date for all periods
of absence in excess of 26 consecutive weeks.

REGULATIONS:

    1.  Eligibility  for  this  benefit  is based on the original
        hire  date  or  the most recent re-hire date.  The amount
        and  duration  of  disability  leave  payments depends on
        length of service.

    2.  The   Short   Term  Disability  benefit  schedule  is  as
        follows:

        Length of                Weeks at            Weeks at
         Service                100% of Pay         70% of Pay

        0-1 Year                  4 Weeks            22 Weeks
        Over 1 Year              26 Weeks               --

        The  percentage  and  amount of disability leave payments
        are  based  on  a  cumulative  total  for  each  year  of
        continuous service.

    3.  Short  Term  Disability  payments  are  coordinated  with
        State   Disability   Income  Benefits  and/or  any  other
        Company   paid   disability   benefit  such  as  Workers'
        Compensation.    (NOTE:  Some states have mandatory state
        disability  programs whereby the amount of the benefit is
        dependent  on  the  length of time the contributions were
        made   to  the  state  fund  and  the  employee's  salary
        level.)   Employees who are eligible for State Disability
        or  Workers'  Compensation  are  responsible  for  filing
        their own claims for benefits.



                      SHORT TERM DISABILITY
                           (Continued)


     4.  Each   anniversary   of   the  employee's  service  date
         re-establishes   a   26   week   Short  Term  Disability
         eligibility  unless  employee  is on Leave of Absence on
         the  anniversary  date.    In this event eligibility for
         maximum   disability  benefits  will  be  restored  upon
         return to work.

     5.  If  the  disability  exceeds  26  continuous  weeks, the
         employee  is  eligible to apply for Long Term Disability
         as  described  in  the  Summary  Plan  Description.  The
         Human   Resources   Department  must  be  contacted  for
         processing of the claim.

     6.  Disability   leave   hours   must  be  recorded  on  the
         employee's time sheet and approved by supervision.

     7.  For   absences  of  six  (6)  or  more  working  days  a
         statement  from  the attending physician may be required
         which  specifies  the date of disability, diagnosis, and
         expected  date  of  return.  All absences of ten (10) or
         more  days  require  a  physician's statement certifying
         the  need  for  the  absence.  Employees must keep their
         supervisors   advised   of   their   status  during  the
         disability.

     8.  Employees  who  are on a disability leave for six (6) or
         more  consecutive  days  will  be  placed  on  Leave  of
         Absence.    Human  Resources must be notified.  Requests
         for  medical  documentation and other forms will be sent
         to  the  employee  as outlined in the Policy on Leave of
         Absence.

     9.  Vacation  accrual  will  continue  for employees on paid
         disability  leave  status  up  to  26 weeks, after which
         vacation   accrual   will   be  discontinued.    Accrued
         vacation  may  be  paid to the employee at any time upon
         request by the employee.

    10.  Prior  to  return  to  work  from  a disability leave, a
         medical  release  from  the employee's physician will be
         required in cases of:

         a.  An  absence  due  to occupational injury, contagious
             disease, surgery, broken bones, or hospitalization.
         b.  An  absence where treatment results in corrective or
             prosthetic  devices  required  to  be  worn  by  the
             employee.
         c.  Other  absences due to sickness or disability of six
             (6)  or  more consecutive working days may require a
             medical release.



                      SHORT TERM DISABILITY
                           (Continued)


    11.  In   the   case  of  a  pregnant  employee,  a  doctor's
         statement  is  required  indicating the date after which
         the  employee  cannot  work and the expected due date of
         the child.

1.  Effective  immediately,  R.  J. Luetkemeyer, Director, Client
    Services  is assigned responsibility for the Network Services
    function within MDIPC.

2.  It  is the intent that this function, as appropriate, arrange
    for  the  use  of  the  services  of  TYMNET,  MDAIS  Network
    Services  and,  in  limited  cases,  external  communications
    organizations.

3.  In  this  capacity,  it  will  be  Dick's  responsibility  to
    establish  a  function  within  MDIPC which will serve as the
    focal  point for providing the appropriate network connection
    to  the  MDIPC  processors  in  support  of the business unit
    requirements for computing and processing services.

4.  To accomplish the above, Dick will:

    4.1   Identify  and arrange for the separation of ISG network
          equipment and costs from the MDAIS pools.

    4.2   Establish  the appropriate accounting controls and cost
          distribution   to   assure  proper  management  of  the
          service.

    4.3   Identify  those services which should be purchased from
          MDAIS   rather   than   duplicated  and  establish  the
          appropriate forecast and budget to meet these needs.

    4.4   Establish  an  interface  relationship with the Network
          Services  Company  to  assure that appropriate services
          of  TYMNET are used in conjunction with the services of
          MDIPC.

    4.5   Identify  costs  which  are  uniquely related to only a
          specific   business   and   develop   a   process   for
          "unbundling"  so  that  only  benefiting units bear the
          costs.

5.  Since  the  primary  purpose of this function is to provide a
    necessary   service,   Dick   will  use  existing  functional
    organizations   where   appropriate  to  avoid  duplicity  in
    function.    Further  announcements will be published under a
    separate AB.

6.  Your  continued  support  of  Dick  in  his  expanded role of
    responsibility will be appreciated.

                                               Enclosure (1) to
                                               AB# ISG-86-4

                        LEAVE OF ABSENCE

SUMMARY:

A  leave  of absence is a management-approved absence authorizing
full-time  employees  an  absence  from  the  Company for reasons
considered  satisfactory  to  the  Company  provided the employee
definitely  plans  to  return  to  work at the Company or is on a
disability leave.

APPLICABLE TO:

All  full-time employees covered by McDonnell Douglas Information
Systems Group Benefits.

DEFINITION:

A  Leave of Absence is an authorized absence granted to employees
who  will be absent from work for 6 or more consecutive scheduled
work days.

REGULATIONS:

A.  General

    An  approved  Leave  of  Absence  Authorization  (LOAA)  form
signed  by  the  supervisor  and  next  management  level must be
submitted   to   Human   Resources.      Attach   any   pertinent
documentation  justifying the leave.  Leaves may be approved when
substantiated  with  reasons  acceptable to the Company.  Maximum
leave  durations  and  extensions for various types of leaves are
specified in Appendix 1.

    Extension  of  a  leave will require the supervisor to submit
an  additional LOAA form to Human Resources with the new expected
return  date  of  the employee.  When a requested leave extension
will  result  in  a total leave period which exceeds the "maximum
leave   duration"  specified  in  Appendix  1,  approval  of  the
Business  Unit Head, Business Unit/Regional Human Resources Head,
and Manager Benefits - ISG.

    An  employee  planning  to  return to work on expiration of a
leave  is  requested  to  give  supervision  at  least one week's
notice  of  this intent, if possible.  Upon the employee's return
to  work  the supervisor must inform Human Resources of the date,
thus, terminating the leave of absence.

    Employees  failing  to  return to work at the expiration of a
leave will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.



    An  employee  will  not be granted a leave of absence for the
purpose  of  seeking or taking employment elsewhere, or operating
a private business.

B.  Types of Authorized Leaves:

    1.  Disability

    Leaves  of absence for personal illness, injury, maternity or
other  physical  disability  will  be granted when an employee is
absent from work 6 or more consecutive days.

    If   a   doctor's   statement   has  not  been  submitted  to
supervision  at  the  beginning  of  the  absence, due to medical
reasons   or   emergency,   the   supervisor  will  notify  Human
Resources,  who will send the employee a letter explaining that a
doctor's  note is required in order for sick leave payments to be
continued.    If  Human  Resources  does not receive the doctor's
verification  of  disability within two weeks or Human Resources'
letter  to  the  employee, the employee will have assumed to have
voluntarily terminated.

    During  an  absence  due  to  disability,  the  employee will
receive  disability pay as specified in the Short Term Disability
Policy  for  up  to  26 weeks.  At the end of the maximum 26 week
paid  leave  period,  the  employee  will  be placed on an unpaid
leave.    The  employee  should  file for benefits under the Long
Term  Disability Plan for leaves that extend beyond 26 continuous
weeks.

    Employees  on  an  approved  disability leave may continue to
participate  in their current health care benefits and group life
insurance  plans  through  payroll deductions for up to 26 weeks.
On  leaves  accrued  beyond this period, payroll will deduct from
employee's  earning,  appropriate  insurance premiums upon return
to work.

    Except  for  long  term  leaves  (i.e.  leaves  longer than 6
months),   employees   continue  to  accrue  service  credit  and
vacation.

    It  is the employee's responsibility to notify supervision if
an  extension of disability leave is needed at least five working
days  prior  to  the  original  expected  return  date  to  work.
Employee  must  submit  a  statement from the attending physician
indicating  the  complications which require additional leave and
must specify the new expected return date.

    Prior  to  return  to  work after disability leave, a medical
release  must  be  submitted  to Human Resources in situations as
described under the Short Term Disability Policy.



    An  employee  who becomes pregnant will notify her supervisor
of  her  pregnancy.   The employee may continue working until the
date  established  by  the  employee's doctor that work should be
discontinued.    The  employee  must  furnish  a  letter from her
attending  physician  attesting  to  her  good health and stating
probable  date  of delivery.  Leave will commence when it becomes
necessary  for her to discontinue work as a result of information
provided by her physician.

    2.  Military Leave

    Employee  must  have  one  or  more years of credited service
with   the  Corporation  to  qualify  for  paid  military  leave.
Differential  pay  is  provided  for  up  to  two  (2)  weeks per
calendar  year  for short term active duty of 30 calendar days or
less,  including  annual  training  duty, as a member of the U.S.
Military  Reserves  or  National  Guard.  Differential pay is the
difference  between  the employee's base military pay and regular
rate  of  pay.    Military pay includes all military earnings and
allowances except for rations, quarters, subsistence and travel.

    The  employee informs management of requirement to report for
annual  military reserve training and arranges for time off up to
a  maximum  of  30  calendar  days.  If required to be absent for
more  than  ten (10) working days, the employee may elect to take
vacation or unpaid personal leave.

    On  completion  of  duty,  the  employee  should  submit  the
following to Payroll:

    a.  Pay  voucher  showing all military earnings for the total
        period of absence,
    b.  Military orders,
    c.  "Statement of Earnings for Paid Military Absence" form.

    On  receipt  of  the  above documentation, Payroll will issue
the  pay  differential  between  employee's  military pay and the
employee's  regular  rate  of  pay, for normal five-day workweek,
the pay period after the documentation is received.

    If  an  employee enlists or is drafted into any branch of the
U.S.  Armed  Services  for more than 30 calendar days, employment
will  be  terminated to enter military service.  Supervision must
submit  to  Human  Resources  a termination notice accompanied by
military  orders.    Employee's reinstatement will be governed by
Military Selective Service Act, as amended.



    3.  Civic Service

    Leaves  may  be  granted to permit employees to serve initial
terms  in  full-time municipal, county, state, or federal office,
whether  elected or appointed, provided any conflicts of interest
can  be  resolved  before  a leave is granted.  Extensions may be
granted  in  accordance  with  Appendix 1.  Leaves of absence for
civic  service  requires  the  approval of the Business Unit Head
and  Business  Unit/Regional  Human  Resources  Head.  This is an
unpaid   leave   of   absence   and   all  company  benefits  are
discontinued, including service credit and vacation accrual.

    4.  Jury Duty

    Full  pay  to employees is provided for up to 20 working days
for  jury duty or duty as a subpoenaed witness.  Employee retains
any  court compensation for service in addition to receiving full
pay.

    In  instances  where  an  employee's  absence  would  have an
adverse  influence  upon  the  work  schedule, or when a critical
work  skill  is  involved,  the  Company  may  request  that  the
employee  be  excused from jury duty.  Such requests, prepared by
the  Human  Resources Head, will be held to a minimum and require
approval of the Business Unit Head.

    Employees  called  for  jury  or witness duty will present to
their  supervisor,  in  advance,  official  evidence  that  their
service is required.

    An  employee  is  required  to  report for work if excused or
dismissed  from  jury  or  witness  service before the end of the
working   day  (of  shift)  provided  there  is  sufficient  time
remaining before the end of the employee's regular shift.

    If  a  shift  employee  serves  on  jury duty or as a witness
during  the  day and is scheduled for work on the second or third
shift,  the  supervisor  determines  whether  the  employee  must
report  for work on the scheduled shift.  All hours worked on the
scheduled  shift will be compensated by the Company in the normal
manner.

    Time  spent on jury or witness duty applies toward employee's
regular work schedule.

    While  on  jury duty, the employee will submit to supervision
at  the  end  of  each week a Jury Attendance Report, signed by a
court official, to be eligible for compensation.



    5.  Personal

    An  employee  may be granted a personal leave of absence upon
approval  by  the  immediate  supervisor  and  the  next level of
management  up, to a maximum of four (4) weeks.  Current business
conditions,   job   performance,  attendance  and  necessity  for
requesting  the  personal leave will be taken into consideration.
Based  on  these factors, leave may be paid or unpaid.  Extension
beyond four (4) weeks require approval as shown in Appendix 1.

    Company  benefits  will  continue  during  this  period.  For
unpaid  leaves,  payroll  will  deduct  from employee's earnings,
upon   return   to   work,  insurance  premiums  which  may  have
accumulated during leave.

    If  the  employee  should  terminate while on Personal Leave,
the  effective  date  of  the  termination  will  be the last day
worked.

    6.  Educational

    Employees  may  be  granted  an  educational leave of absence
without  pay  to  satisfy  residence  requirements  leading to an
approved  Doctorate  degree.   Such a leave requires the approval
of   the   Business   Unit  Head,  Business  Unit/Regional  Human
Resources  Head,  and Manager Benefits - ISG.  Employee must have
6   months   active   Company  service  to  be  eligible  for  an
educational  leave.    Maximum duration and extension is shown in
Appendix 1.

    Company  benefits  will continue during this period.  Payroll
will  deduct  from  employee's  earnings,  upon  return  to work,
insurance premiums which may have accumulated during the leave.

    If  the  employee  should  terminate  while on an educational
leave,  the  effective  date  of the termination will be the last
day worked.

    7.  Peace Corps/VISTA

    Employees  volunteering  for  either  Peace  Corps  or  VISTA
activity  may  be  granted  an  unpaid leave for the full term of
their  enlistment in accordance with Appendix 1.  Approval of the
Business Unit Head and Human Resources Head is required.

    Company   benefits   and  group  insurance  coverage  is  not
continued during this leave of absence.

work  due to illness, injury or pregnancy.  Short Term Disability
is not to be used for any other time-off purposes.

Systems Group Benefits.

DEFINITIONS:

Service  Date:    The employee's hire date or most recent re-hire
date.    Adjustments are made to the service date for all periods
of absence in excess of 26 consecutive weeks.

REGULATIONS:

    1.  Eligibility  for  this  benefit  is based on the original
        hire  date  or  the most recent re-hire date.  The amount
        and  duration  of  disability  leave  payments depends on
        length of service.

    2.  The   Short   Term  Disability  benefit  schedule  is  as
        follows:

        Length of                Weeks at            Weeks at
         Service                100% of Pay         70% of Pay

        Over 1 Year              26 Weeks               --

        The  percentage  and  amount of disability leave payments
        are  based  on  a  cumulative  total  for  each  year  of
        continuous service.

    3.  Short  Term  Disability  payments  are  coordinated  with
        State   Disability   Income  Benefits  and/or  any  other
        Company   paid   disability   benefit  such  as  Workers'
        Compensation.    (NOTE:  Some states have mandatory state
        disability  programs whereby the amount of the benefit is
        dependent  on  the  length of time the contributions were
        made   to  the  state  fund  and  the  employee's  salary
        level.)   Employees who are eligible for State Disability
        or  Workers'  Compensation  are  responsible  for  filing
        their own claims for benefits.



                      SHORT TERM DISABILITY
                           (Continued)


     4.  Each   anniversary   of   the  employee's  service  date
         re-establishes   a   26   week   Short  Term  Disability
         eligibility  unless  employee  is on Leave of Absence on
         the  anniversary  date.    In this event eligibility for
         maximum   disability  benefits  will  be  restored  upon
         return to work.

     5.  If  the  disability  exceeds  26  continuous  weeks, the
         employee  is  eligible to apply for Long Term Disability
         as  described  in  the  Summary  Plan  Description.  The
         Human   Resources   Department  must  be  contacted  for
         processing of the claim.

     6.  Disability   leave   hours   must  be  recorded  on  the
         employee's time sheet and approved by supervision.

     7.  For   absences  of  six  (6)  or  more  working  days  a
         statement  from  the attending physician may be required
         which  specifies  the date of disability, diagnosis, and
         expected  date  of  return.  All absences of ten (10) or
         more  days  require  a  physician's statement certifying
         the  need  for  the  absence.  Employees must keep their
         supervisors   advised   of   their   status  during  the
         disability.

     8.  Employees  who  are on a disability leave for six (6) or
         more  consecutive  days  will  be  placed  on  Leave  of
         Absence.    Human  Resources must be notified.  Requests
         for  medical  documentation and other forms will be sent
         to  the  employee  as outlined in the Policy on Leave of
         Absence.

     9.  Vacation  accrual  will  continue  for employees on paid
         disability  leave  status  up  to  26 weeks, after which
         vacation   accrual   will   be  discontinued.    Accrued
         vacation  may  be  paid to the employee at any time upon
         request by the employee.

    10.  Prior  to  return  to  work  from  a disability leave, a
         medical  release  from  the employee's physician will be
         required in cases of:

         a.  An  absence  due  to occupational injury, contagious
             disease, surgery, broken bones, or hospitalization.
         b.  An  absence where treatment results in corrective or
             prosthetic  devices  required  to  be  worn  by  the
             employee.
         c.  Other  absences due to sickness or disability of six
             (6)  or  more consecutive working days may require a
             medical release.



                      SHORT TERM DISABILITY
                           (Continued)


    11.  In   the   case  of  a  pregnant  employee,  a  doctor's
         statement  is  required  indicating the date after which
         the  employee  cannot  work and the expected due date of
         the child.

Subject:  MDIPC NETWORK SERVICES



1.  Effective  immediately,  R.  J. Luetkemeyer, Director, Client
    Services  is assigned responsibility for the Network Services
    function within MDIPC.

2.  It  is the intent that this function, as appropriate, arrange
    for  the  use  of  the  services  of  TYMNET,  MDAIS  Network
    Services  and,  in  limited  cases,  external  communications
    organizations.

3.  In  this  capacity,  it  will  be  Dick's  responsibility  to
    establish  a  function  within  MDIPC which will serve as the
    focal  point for providing the appropriate network connection
    to  the  MDIPC  processors  in  support  of the business unit
    requirements for computing and processing services.

4.  To accomplish the above, Dick will:

    4.1   Identify  and arrange for the separation of ISG network
          equipment and costs from the MDAIS pools.

    4.2   Establish  the appropriate accounting controls and cost
          distribution   to   assure  proper  management  of  the
          service.

    4.3   Identify  those services which should be purchased from
          MDAIS   rather   than   duplicated  and  establish  the
          appropriate forecast and budget to meet these needs.

    4.4   Establish  an  interface  relationship with the Network
          Services  Company  to  assure that appropriate services
          of  TYMNET are used in conjunction with the services of
          MDIPC.

    4.5   Identify  costs  which  are  uniquely related to only a
          specific   business   and   develop   a   process   for
          "unbundling"  so  that  only  benefiting units bear the
          costs.

    organizations   where   appropriate  to  avoid  duplicity  in
    function.    Further  announcements will be published under a
    separate AB.

6.  Your  continued  support  of  Dick  in  his  expanded role of
    responsibility will be appreciated.

I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  formalization of the ISG Media
Relations  function,  headquartered in Newport Beach, California,
and  reporting  to James R. Donovan, ISG Vice President-Marketing
and Planning.

Effective  immediately,  Peter  E. McGuirk, formerly ISG Director
of  Communications-West,  is  appointed Director-Media Relations.
Peter  has  over  20  years'  experience  in communication.  This
experience    includes    television   writing   and   commercial
production,   as   well  as  national  and  international  public
relations  responsibilities.    In  his  new  capacity,  he  will
establish  policy  for and coordinate all ISG media relations and
will  have  direct  responsibility  for Information Systems Group
press releases.

Major   emphasis   will   be  placed  on  those  media  relations
activities  that  can  raise  awareness  of ISG within our target
markets  while  highlighting  the  interrelationships  that exist
within  ISG.    Toward  that end, the responsible media relations
manager  in  each  of  our  companies  will  have  a  dotted-line
reporting relationship to Peter.

Ford  R.  Phillips  will  continue as Director-ISG Communications
and  will  assume responsibility for all marketing communications
activities  on  a  worldwide  basis,  including  those previously
handled   by   Peter  McGuirk.    Ford,  as  before,  reports  to
David  M.  Rousseau,  ISG  Staff Vice President-Marketing, and is
responsible  for  Information Systems Group advertising, employee
communications,   marketing   communications  and  organizational
identity activities.

Peter   and   Ford   will   be   jointly   responsible   for  the
Communications Councils which have been established within ISG.

Subject:  Interim Review and Approval Procedure for Government
          Contracts

Reference:(1) J.G.Judy's Government Contracts Survey, dated 09
          January, 1986

    1. Contracting and subcontracting with federal, state, local 
and foreign governments is a complex process governed by many 
statutes and regulations.  With respect to the federal 
acquisition process alone, the Office of Federal Procurement 
Policy recently estimated that there are over 4,000 federal 
statutes that affect the procurement of goods and services.  In 
this complex arena misdeeds or perceived misdeeds on U. S. 
Government contracts, including inadverent failures to comply 
with these requirements within the ISG could have severe 
consequences for ISG and for all of MDC.

    2. We are currently reviewing the ISG Government acquisition 
market base to determine the business approach to take with 
respect to this dynamic and complex market.  In order to make 
this determination, it is necessary to survey the ISG'S current 
participation in Government acquisition at the federal, state, 
local and foreign levels.

    3. To assist in this review and determination process, 
J.G.Judy, Corporate Counsel for Government Programs, is chairing 
an ISG Government Project Group that includes J. G. McDaniel and 
M. D. Wolf.  This group has been established as a permanent 
committee to serve as an ISG resource for information, guidance, 
and assistance concerning the legal, financial, and management 
aspects of Government contracts.

    4. The project group is conducting a survey of ISG's current 
participation in Government acquisitions and based on its 
findings will make recommendations responsive to a number of 
issues, including:
    a. should the ISG accept cost-reimbursement or flexibly
       priced Government contracts and subcontracts on other
       than an exceptional basis?
    b. should Government acquisition be centralized within the
       ISG as an additional group or remain decentralized but
       subject to an internal ISG contract by contract review
       process?
    c. what initial and follow on training is necessary and 
       appropriate for ISG personnel involved in the Government 
       acquisition process?


-2-

ISG-86-10
21 Jan 86



    5. The Reference 1 memorandum from the Project Group that I 
have directed initiates the Government contracting survey.  It 
is requested that you expedite your responses to the survey and 
cooperate with the Project Group in this effort.

    6. Pending a final determination of the business approach 
that will be taken by the ISG with respect to Government 
acquisitions, all federal, state, local and foreign contracts, 
subcontracts and proposals with a cumulative or anticipated 
value of $100,000 or more shall be submitted in advance to the 
ISG Government Projects Group for review and approval.  The 
group will shortly issue guidance and details concerning the 
review and approval process.  In the interim, any questions 
should be addressed to J.G.Judy, ext. 22756, J.G.McDaniel, ext. 
36103, or M.D.Wolf, ext. 35066.

    7. Please disseminate this AB to anyone in your area who may 
be involved in doing business with the Government 
(federal,state,local or foreign).

Subect:   Export Control And Compliance


1.  ISG is applying for a single ISG-wide Distribution License 
from the U.S. Dept. of Commerce.  This single license will allow a 
great deal of flexibility for international shipments by all the 
ISG business units.  This Distribution License overcomes the 
requirement to obtain individuad  validated  licenses on most of 
the products we ship.


2.  Since the Dept. of Commerce does not approve individual 
shipments when we have a Distribution License, they do insist that 
we have an internal control program to assure compliance with 
their regulations.


3.  Guidelines for compliance have been prepared by the Export 
Administration Dept. and will be distributed throughout ISG along

l.  Incidents  involving terrorist actions have increased in number

2.  The  new  Corporate  American  Express  Card will have the same
    account  number  as  the  card the employee is currently using.
    Therefore,  when  the new card is received, the card containing
    the company's name should be destroyed.

3.  The  new  Corporate American Express Card is still considered a
    corporate  card  and  all  rules and regulations governing such
    card is still in effect.

4.  The  reissuing  of all cards should be completed by 1 April 86.
    If  you  have  not  received your new card by that date, please
    contact Glenda Goodman in St. Louis at (314) 234-6898.

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.
