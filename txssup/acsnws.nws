There has been a reported problem in the latest fieldtest
version of EXPRESS, E.89Q, concerning the terminal command.

We have notified MDS of this problem, and they are sending
us some files that were missing from the tape.

With any luck at all, we should get this from MDS by Friday,
and have the files loaded on all systems that day.

Sorry about the inconvenience, 

Regards,

Diane

Although we encourage individuals to change passwords from
time to time for security purposes, unfortunately users
cannot remember the new password.  This has resulted in an
increase of calls to Operations, which is not policy.

Please make a notation of this policy...

Should an OnTyme Account Sup forget his/her password, phone
me at x8060.  Should one of the users in your account forget
his/her password, please imitate the user and change the
password.

And, if at all possible, I encourage you and your users to
try and remember the new password!  This would alleviate the
problem entirely.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best Regards.

Subject: "The following is a list of general"...

The following is a list of general and release specific information on
the use of Focus on Tymshare.


If you have further questions, or items that need to be added to this list,
please contact Val Emery at 408-446-7160 or 7161 , or ontyme ACS.PCFOCUS or
ACS.FOCTEC.


GENERAL NOTES:
_____________

As a result of IBI incorporating extensive use of Dialogue Manager into 
their new bag of tools, we have found a problem in the use of -CRTFORM.
As some of you have already found out, when this command is used to generate
a screen for user input, the sequence of events that follow the depressing
of the 'ENTER' key cause strange, but consistent results.  This ONLY
occurs on Tymshare's Focus.

We believe that it can be isolated to a CP modification Tymshare has made in
the Console I/O.  We have someone working on the problem, and hope to have it
corrected as soon as possible.   In the meantime, you should avoid the use of
-CRTFORM and continue to use -TYPE and -PROMPT until which time we have 
a solution.

Along the same lines, if you are using such commands as -CRTCLEAR, make sure
that you do not SPOOL CONS START .  Because these dialogue manager
commands are directed to console i/o, you will encounter problems or failure.

As far as the IBI provided toolkit, avoid the use of WRKBENCH, and AUTOMOD.
As of today, TABLETALK is not in our version of 4.5.3.  FILETALK is, and
works great!

It has also been noted that each time we have a new release, there is a problem
in REBUILD.  This problem occurs when Focus attempts to issue a filedef that
has a filemode of '4' instead of 'A4'.  An abend which exits you from
Focus will occur.  We hope to isolate why this happens and insure that it
does not continue.  This problem DOES occur in 4.5.3. , so do NOT use
REBUILD in this release at this time.

? TRU is causing an addressing exception in releases 4.0.14 and 4.5.3!!  It
will abend you to CMS level.  We will notify you when it's fixed.

Also, 4.5.3 Focus temporary work files are defaulting to 'A' disk, not the
one with the most available space.  If you use Temp Cyls, you will need to issue
the following command :  SET TEMP=D  , then work files will go to 'd' disk.
We will notify you when it is fixed.



RELEASE 4.5.3:
_____________

The following new features have been tested in release 4.5.3 (currently on sys. 
44) and found to be either slightly different than the documentation, or
inoperable on Tymshare.

SUBJECT                 DESCRIPTION OF FEATURE
_______                  _______________________

AUTOMOD    -  This focexec is designed to implement some new features of Focus
              which allow automatic modification of a simple Focus database,
              using crtform without having to know the names of the keys, or
              database fields.

PROBLEM:      Unfortunately, part of it was written using -CRTFORM, to create
              the 'Welcome' and 'Option' menus.  As stated in the
              'General Notes' section, this command currently fails on Tymshare.
              The second problem is a result of the program assuming data is 
              coming from a real 3270 type terminal. (i.e., DATA, instead of
              DATA VIA FI3270 or FIDEL).

WORKAROUND:   You could copy AUTOMOD FOCEXEC B to your A disk and modify the
              commands that are failing.  Change -CRTFORM to -TYPEs and
              -PROMPTs and the DATA to DATA VIA FI3270 or FIDEL (depending on
              your terminal input).

ESTIMATED 
FIX DATE:     Probably will need to create our own AUTOMOD FOCEXEC at the time
              we install each new release.








WITHIN   -    Allows you to create a sub-matrix report.  All arithmetic 
              operations apply only to the set of values defined by the within.

    syntax:   sum pct.sales within country
              by country by car

PROBLEM:      According to the documentation, all percentages (in our example,
              within each country) should add up to 100.  However, all testing
              to date indicates its always 99.

WORKAROUND:   Go back to multiple sentence reports and computes.

ESTIMATED
FIX DATE:     Unknown at this time.

_____________________

SUBJECT                    DESCRIPTION OF FEATURE
________                  _________________________

-QUIT FOCUS (n) - Used to cause an immediate exit from Focus allowing you
                 specify a different return code based on an error encountered.
                 This return code can then be tested with a CMS EXEC using
                 &retcode.

PROBLEM:         No matter what you attempt to set the return code to, it is
                 always defaulting to 0.

WORKAROUND:      None at this time.

ESTIMATED
FIX DATE:        Unknown at this time.




SET EXTTERM=ON - Allows FIDEL support of extended terminal characteristics 
                such as those available on a 3279. (color, blinking etc.)

PROBLEM:        There is no support in the current 3270 emulation software
                beyond the three basics:
           
                        HIGHLIGHT  (H)
                        CLEAR      (C)
                        NODISPLAY  (N)

WORKAROUND:     None at this time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Announcing a new standard in demographics and market segmentation:
 
                       **  SUPERSITE  **
 
    SUPERSITE, the most advanced geographic information retrieval
system ever built, contains three segments:
 
    SITE DEMOGRAPHICS - detailed information from the 1970 and 1980
    Census:  population, households, families, age and racial
    distributions, employment, and much more.
 
    SITE-POTENTIAL - measures the expenditures of consumers living
    in the defined area on 143 lines of merchandise offered by 16
    retail store types and three financial institutions.
 
    ACORN - A Classification Of Residential Neighborhoods - allows your
    client to target advertising, direct mail, media, and other
    promotions with the highest degree of accuracy.  Similar neighbor-
    hoods attract people with similar purchasing, consumption,
    and attitudinal patterns; ACORN puts this invaluable data at
    your customer's fingertips by classifying small block groups or
    enumeration districts into 44 unique clusters based on the
    demographic, geographic, and socioecomonic characteristics
    of the residents.
 
    SUPERSITE contains 1984 updates and five-year (through 1989)
forecasts for all key demographic variables.  SUPERSITE now
replaces SITE-II.
 
 
         ** SPECIAL INTRODUCTORY PRICE FOR LICENSE CUSTOMERS **
 
    Through December 31, 1984, your customers can enjoy CONSIDERABLE
SAVINGS when signing up for a SUPERSITE unlimited use license, whether

3)  License customers may receive DORIS at no additional charge.
 
      **  THIS INTRODUCTORY OFFER EXPIRES DECEMBER 31, 1984  **
 
 
              Pricing Options and Considerations
 
1)  License customers enjoy the added benefits of:
    - unlimited data use
    - unlimited access to all improvements and enhancements during
      the term of the license
    - a toll-free user support telephone number direct to vendor
 
2)  License pricing does not include telephone costs, connect
    time, storage, or auxiliary services.
 
3)  Transaction-based users are charged on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis.
    There is a $25 access charge per session to access SITE.
    Cost estimates per report are displayed before the report is
    run when using any of the SITE products.
 
4)  Transaction-based users may convert to an unlimited use
    agreement (license) at any time, with an attractive
    conversion/credit package available.  Please call for details.
 
5)  With either a license agreement or a transaction-based agreement,
    access to SUPERSITE includes access to SITE DEMOGRAPHICS,
    SITE-POTENTIAL, and ACORN.

           System S51 - November 16th
 
   It is recommended that release memos be read.  Documentation for
   version 33K of CMS is available via the 'DOC CMSDOC' command on all
   Tymcom 370's and documentation for version 34D of CMS is available
   via the 'DOC FTCMS' command on all Tymcom 370's. The following is a
   brief synopsis of the new features in production and field test CMS:
 
    TYMCOM/370 CMS Version 33K contains bug fixes for CMS version 33G.
    A brief description of these changes are:
        1. The VSAM/CIDAS interface routine TYMSAM has been modified to
           pick up the key length from the AMD control block instead of
           the RPL.
        2. TAPE has been modified to provide a specific return code for
           DUMPing a bad disk file.
        3. Tymscreen has been modified to support smart ASCII terminals.
        4. An error in updating the "FREE LIST" will no longer corrupt
           a user's CIDAS file.
        5. The CIDAS/ISAM interface routine TYMSOP and CIDAS/VSAM
           routine TYMSOV have been modified to allow the opening of a
           file containing more than 65,535 physical records.
        6. The console read routine will now find data stacked by an
           exec, using the &STACK command, while being run in
           disconnected mode.
        7. Inclusion of certain options in the FCOMPARE plist will no
           longer terminate option scanning prematurely.
        8. The tape I/O buffer is now calculated correctly.  Therefore,
           an overlay of the Contents Directory Queue or CMS Nucleus
           should no longer occur.
        9. When responding to the "COPYT" command, TAPEUTIL will now
           disable interrupts while doing tape I/O and will enable the
           interrupts after the tape I/O has ended.
 
    TYMCOM/370 CMS  Version 34D  is IBM's  VM/SP CMS  Release 3  (PTF
    8401), with Tymshare modifications and enhancements corresponding
    to CMS Version 2.01.33I.  Users will notice significant changes in
    this new field test version.  A brief description of these changes
    are:
        1. SP3 CMS will no longer support Tymshare-format (TFS) disks.
           All users using TFS disks within FTCMS must reformat their
           disks to IBM-format disks prior to their system's FTCMS roll.
        2. The default for FASTSVC is now OFF.
        3. XEDIT behavior has somewhat changed:
           a. The default case setting for filetypes EXEC and XEDIT
              is MIXED RESPECT instead of UPPER IGNORE,
           b. The prefix area subcommands must start and end with
              characters different from those being overtyped,
           c. The XEDIT message line will no longer appear in the command
              input are when CMDLINE is set to TOP,
           d. Stacking COMMAND QUIT in an XEDIT macro is no longer necesary
              to exit to CMS.
           e. FILE and SAVE are no longer unconditional.
        4. The I/O handler and the I/O interrupt handler have been
           modified to support the VMCF dispatcher.
      
    
                                                                  PAGE 3
 
        5. DDR has been fixed to include the CONTINUE option.
 
   Please remember that OLDCMS is not intended for routine use: it
   should be used only if a new version of CMS breaks existing
   software.  If anyone is using the current OLDCMS (32T), contact
   me immediately at (408) 446-7042 or send an Ontyme to ACS.DBAMAIL.
 
   Please note : To use a version of CMS other than the default CMS
                 version, set your Y-disk via the commands
                 SET YDISK FTCMS, SET YDISK CMS, and SET YDISK OLDCMS,
                 depending on which version you would like to use.

TECH MEMO   # 001         (ACS.PCFOCUS or ACS.FOCTECH)     November 5, 1984     

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FOCEXECS:
________

      !!! REMINDER !!!   Variable length focexecs are NOT supported
                         after release 4.0.13.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

FILEDEFS:
________

     A proper Filedef should include the LRECL, RECFM and BLKSIZE.
     (NOTE:  BLKSIZE is imperative when you are using tapes!)

     If you are working with Focus temporary files and wish to control 
     their write destination (the default is to that MDISK with the
     most available space), you MUST issue a filedef AND SET TEMP = X.


EXAMPLE:   You wish to create a hold file with the AS ddname option.
           You want this file to be written to your C disk.  You also have
           a D disk which has more available space than C.

            ON TABLE HOLD AS MYHOLD
           Your filedef would be as follows:

           CMS FI HOLD DISK MYHOLD DATA C

           This says the hold file will be placed on the C disk.  You must
           also type:  SET TEMP = C


           (NOTE:  By ommitting the LRECL & RECFM option of the filedef,
           you allow FOCUS to fill them in correctly)


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

PHANTOM FILES - ATTACHED R/O MDISKS:
___________________________________

      There is an unusual problem that can occur with Focus which will
      cause the writing of a "Phantom" Focus database.  The situation
      will occur when the following conditions are present:

      1 - You have attached an Mdisk with a Focus database, as a R/O
          extension of your A disk.  (With the ATTACH command.)

      2 - The Focus database on the attached mdisk has CROSS-REFERENCE file(s).
          They are defined in the master as KU.

      3 - A change to the Index table for the Cross Reference file has occurred.
          (This could be an addition or deletion.)

      4 - You enter Focus and perform a TABLE request that references the 
          Index.

EXPLANATION:  

     If all items, 1-4 have taken place a Focus database will be written to
     your A disk.  It will not necessarily be a valid, or complete file.  The
     write of this database occurs as a result of POINTER RESOLUTION.

WHAT IS POINTER RESOLUTION?

     When you have declared a segment KU, Focus actually reserves 4
     bytes next to the field you use to get to the CRFILE.  These 4 bytes
     contain the address of the record in the CRFILE.  Focus will always 
     use the Index table unless there has been a change detected.  (An
     addition or deletion of an indexed value in the host or Crfile .)


     When a change is noted, Focus needs to update the 4 byte address in the
     Host file.  Because it is almost impossible for Focus to know that 
     the Focus database is on a R/O extension of the A disk, it starts
     writing out the updated database on your A disk.

WORKAROUND:

     There are a couple of ways to get around this problem.

     1 - Declare the segment as DKU in your master.

     2 - Instead of using the Attach command, LINK and ACCESS the
         required Mdisk, R/O, BUT not as an extension of your A.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


FOCUS release 4.0.14 will be removed from all systems around December 15'th.

Release 4.0.14 has many severe problems which will not be fixed.  Because
of this, a decision has been made to go directly to release 4.5.3.

Please move your applications to Release 4.5.3.  If you encounter problems,
return to 4.0.13 (OLD) and notify FOCUS SUPPORT (ACS.PCFOCUS).

If you feel you must run in release 4.0.14 (cannot run in either 4.0.13
or 4.5.3) notify us immediately.

Again, release 4.0.14 will be REMOVED from the system by mid-December.

Thanks for your cooperation.

I seem to have missed a few steps in defining a way to reformat
Tymshare-format (TFS) disks to IBM format disks in my previous memo.
A tape should be rewinded before dumping files to it and also before
loading files from it.  The following procedure should contain all the
steps to reformat disks with the missed steps highlighted:
 
   1. IPL CMS
        Get into production CMS.
   2. M OP PLS PLEASE MOUNT A SCRATCH TAPE AS 181 W/RING ON 6250 DRIVE. THANKS.
        Ask the operator for a scratch tape.
** 3. TAPE REW
        Rewind the tape.
   4. TAPE DUMP * * <FILEMODE>
        Put all of your files from the disk you specified on the
        tape.
   5. TAPE WTM 10
        Write a tape mark to specify END-OF-TAPE.
** 6. TAPE REW
        Rewind the tape.
   7. FORMAT <CUU> <MODE> ( BLK <BLOCK SIZE>
        Format the disk specifying the device address and the filemode,
        e.g. 191 A.  The BLK option is optional.  The default for
        BLOCK SIZE is 1K.  If you have very large files, a 2K or 4K
        blocking factor may be appropriate.
   8. TAPE LOAD * * <FILEMODE>
        Download the files from tape back onto the disk you specified
        earlier.
   9. TAPE RUN
         Rewind the tape.
  10. Q 181
        Find the filemode for 181.
    
 
 
 
 
                                                                  PAGE 2
 
 
 
  11. M OP FINISHED WITH TAPE ON <MODE>.  THANKS.
        Tell the operator you have finished with the tape specifying
        the filemode which 181 was attached as.
  12. DET 181
        Detach 181.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Please use the prompted routine created for updating
purposes, called *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE when you
request updates to your directories (ie, *** DIRECT.ACS).
This makes it possible for Catherine Derby, OnTyme Marketing
Secretary and ACS.SUP, to obtain all the necessary data
she needs to update your directory.

To initiate the routine, type ':EXEC *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE',
and answer all prompts.  This information will automatically
forward to both Catherine and I, where one of us will fulfill
your request at the earliest convenience.

If anyone has questions to this procedure, please feel free
to OnTyme me directly at ACS.L/METOUR, as any update request
not sent via this form will be returned.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

SUBJECT>   Updating Directories & Internal Hosts


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Please note:  All requests for updates to your *** DIRECT.XXX,
where 'XXX' refers to 'ACS', 'TTMS', 'FIN', etc. must
be made via the exec called *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE.  The
procedure is as follows:

1.  Update/edit your directory.
2.  File the text in a private or shared file.
3.  Type :EXEC *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE, answering
    each prompt.  This exec provides OnTyme Marketing with
    all the necessary info we need to update your directory
    to public status.  It will automatically send to both 
    Catherine Derby and I.
4.  We will send you a confirmation once your directory has
    been updated to all three internal hosts.*


Since internal usage has increased dramatically in the past
several months, a new OnTyme host - 7148, now exists.  If you 
are uncertain of the host your account resides on, or are
interested in knowing where each internal account is homed,
please read *** DIRECT.INTERNALOTHOSTS.

Thank you for your cooperation when requesting a public update.

* My apologies for delays in updating directories the
  past two weeks.  I received your requests and will
  update as soon as possible.  Thanks for your patience.

SUBJECT>   Deployment of New OnTyme Software to Customer Hosts


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As promised, OnTyme is forging ahead in development!  

We will be loading a new version of OnTyme software on customer hosts
per the attached deployment schedule.

Immediately following the code load, a banner will be placed on each
host, asking users to access a public (***) file which will contain
details of the changes in effect.  A copy of that announcement is also
attached for your information.

One of the major benefits of this new code is that it will increase the
number of simultaneous users to 50 per system (currently, customer
hosts have about 42 ports).  And, more importantly, it will enable
us to provide inter-OnTyme connectivity where necessary.

Which brings me to an explanation of how and when we will interconnect
accounts.

As some of you may recall from an earlier memo, in order for OnTyme
systems to communicate with one another, we must update special tables
on each system.  These tables will dictate what other hosts and what
accounts on those hosts, a given OnTyme system may talk to.  And BOTH
sides must be looking back at eachother for the link to be complete.
For example:  in order for an ACS user (832) to talk with a CUST user
(1304), we must

a)  update the lists on 832 to include host number 1304 and account
    CUST

b)  update the lists on 1304 to include host number 832 and account
    ACS

Several weeks after the initial code loads, we will begin turning on
inter-OnTyme on a limited basis - to enable customers to message 
their McDonnell Douglas support personnel.  The first MDC accounts to
be included will be:  ACS, CNS, MDCSS, TYM, FTCC and INTL and other 
                                                                Page  2

affiliate accounts (KTL, TUK, TT, CT).

If you have customers on OnTyme systems, and are not in one of the above
listed accounts, please notify us immediately by sending an ontyme to
ACS.ONTYME.  Tell us who the customer(s) is and what OnTyme host(s) 
are involved.

Shortly after these initial connections are made, we will begin
removing all duplicate TYM and INSD accounts from customer systems.
You will be given one week's notice prior to each cancellation to
enable you to move files and/or advise your customers of your ID change.

That next brings us to how we will handle requests from customers
wishing to connect up with OnTyme customers on different hosts.

Since we do not consider Ontyme to be a 'public system' like the MCIMAILs
or the telephone company, we feel we should have some measures in place
which will ensure the confidentiality of our customers and protect us
from allegations of breaching security.

With this in mind, the following will be required to enable
inter-system messaging between OnTyme customers on different OnTyme hosts.

     A letter, on their company letterhead, must be sent to

                  Applied Communications Systems Co.
                  20705 Valley Green Drive
                  Cupertino, CA  95014
                  ATTN:  Inter-Systems Messaging

     This letter must contain the following information:

                  Their OnTyme host number and
                  account code(s)

                  The name of each customer they
                  wish to be linked to, and
                  that customer's host and
                  account code(s).

     One letter from EACH customer involved in this inter-system
     messaging request must be received before we will 'turn on'
     the capability.  (Turning on the capability takes about an
     hour and can be done as soon as all letters have been
     received.)

NOTE:  OnTyme Support and the Customer Service Center WILL NOT divulge to
any callers the account codes or host locations of any OnTyme customers.
This information must be provided by the customers in question to one
another.


We hope you agree that these measures are in the best interests of your
customers and McDonnell Douglas.

This has been a rather broad overview, and you can expect to receive
'reminders' as we move from  one phase to the next of this project.
Hopefully this information will enable you to give informed

answers to any questions which might be raised by your customers.

We thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

Dear OnTyme User:

This OnTyme system was just upgraded to provide the following enhancements.
We hope you will find these changes beneficial.


     1.  During the network login (Please Log In), you may
         now use a Control-Q (ctrl-Q) to edit a mistyped
         username or password.  (Note - the ctrl-Q must be
         used prior to hitting the carriage return and
         is for use at the Network Level of your login
         process.  The ctrl-Q will not work with your
         ID or KEY.)

     2.  A new OnTyme command (:SCREEN x) enables you to
         have your output automatically freeze (halt) after
         a pre-defined number of lines.

         The command syntax is:

                        :SCREEN x (where x is the number
                                    of lines)
                        
                        :SCREEN OFF

         For example, by issuing the command :SCREEN 20,
         after 20 lines of text had printed on your
         screen (or printer), the screen would freeze -
         thus allowing you to read the screen in a more
         leisurely manner.  Then, by following the
         instructions which would appear just below
         the last line of text, you may continue reading
         one line at a time - or the next group of 20
         lines.

         The command remains in effect until you either
         log off - or issue the command :SCREEN OFF.


                 ***** COMING - SPRING OF 1985 *****

     An online HELP facility - a way for you to ask OnTyme
     for an explanation of any OnTyme command, or system (error)
     message.

     WATCH FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT!
