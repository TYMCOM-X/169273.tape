-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Please be aware that there is a problem stemming from making
simultaneous modifications to an account:  For example, I am adding
two userids to the SUP account from two separate terminals.  This
interaction causes the ** ACCTUSERS file to diminish.

     Until further notice, do not use the commands listed below
simultaneously:

     :UPDATE user MOD username

     :UPDATE user REMOVE username

     :UPDATE user ADD username

     :ALIAS ADD aliasid username

     :ALIAS DEL aliasid

     All of these commands access/replace the ** acctusers file.  Thank 
you in advance for your cooperation in observing this change until the
problem can be corrected.

On January 14, 1985, system C33 will no longer be used as a Tymshare
Internal system.  All usernames will be removed from this system except
for users supporting the system (Operations, RPM, software support and
a few Accounting usernames).

Anyone with a username on this system MUST transfer their files and 
library tapes to another PDP-10 host.  If a username is valid only 
on system C33 please let me know immediately. Please send an ontyme
(or call) with your username on C33, also include a phone number, I 
will then proceed to set your username up on another host.  All 
files must be transferred to the new host by January 13.  Removal of 
usernames will begin on January 14.  All library tapes must be 
transferred to another host or released and scratched from the tape
library by January 27. Any tapes remaining after this day will be 
released and scratched.

I have been receiving several ontymes concerning the PDP-10 status name
database (OPPS), if it will be moved. We have decided that this program
will be moved to system 34.  This move is in process and should be completed
hopefully sometime today. I know that everyone has been concerned about 
where this program would reside. I am sorry that I did not get back to
everyone who were concerned about this move. 

If you happen to use this program to change your status password please
let me know your login username and I will make sure that your username 
is set up on system 34.

Thank you
Jenny Guerrero

The following is a list of usernames under GAN 3 and those requested by    
Dennis Coffey to remain on system 33.  Could you please look these user-   
names over and determine who should remain on this system.  I have talked  
with Gary Walker about the fact that the Software Group needed a little    
more time to determine what should remain on system 33.  He feels that
that there is no problem with this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On Friday, February 8, 1985, I will begin the REMOVAL  of all unnecessary
usernames from system 33.  To obtain a list of users who will REMAIN on
this system, please read *** DIRECT.C33REMAIN .  The users who are not 
on this list should have already transferred their files to another
system.

The OPPS and SETOP programs are now on system 34.  Please DO NOT use
system 33 to change your operator password.  These programs will be
removed from system 33 very soon.

If there are any questions, please call me at (214)637-7324 or ontyme

There seems to be problems with the OPPS and SETOP programs on system
34.  Password changes made in OPPS are not being transferred to other
hosts. Users are getting question marks (?) after entering their status
name in SETOP. There is a software programmer looking at these problems
and we hope to have these problems fixed very soon. Please be patient
with us and do not make any changes (unless absolutely necessary) until
the programs have been fixed.  I will sent out another ontyme when all
problems have been fixed.

Thank you

SUBJECT:  CLOSING OF THE VALLEY FORGE DATA CENTER
 
 
 
 
The  Valley  Forge Data Center will be closing during  the  third 
quarter  of  1985.   Planning is currently underway to  move  all 
users off of the host computers in this center.
 
Mr.  Brett  Fairchild  has been assigned as  Project  Manager  to 
assure that the center is closed in a smooth and timely manner.
 
Effective immediately, Ms. Roberta (Robbie) Berosh will take over 
as  acting  manager of the data center.   Robbie has been  a  key 
person at this center for 10 years and we can be assured she will 
keep it running efficiently until the last user is moved out.
 
Please  contact either Brett or Robbie if you have  any  concerns 
about  customers being serviced by this center or if you have job 
openings for any of the talented personnel in Valley Forge.
