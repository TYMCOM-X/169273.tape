Vida,

    The four of us who support the Tymcom-X monitor and utilities need access
to outdial network hosts, in order to support Tymcom-X systems which are not
on the public network.  The need is not frequent, but when the need arises the
need is urgent.

    I have spoken with Paul Hidy about our need.  He indicated that he would
be informing you of his approval of our request.

    The usernames needing vlaidation in Group 44 are:
        DENCOFF
        CARL
        JMS
        OSMAN

    If there are any questions or problems with this request, please call me
at X2588 (415/794-2588), or Ontyme TXS.D/COFFEY.


                                                Thanks,
                                                Dennis Coffey

Subject: New phone numbers for Bldg. C former occupants. 

The folks from Bldg.  C, including the Resource Planning & Management unit and
the Software Distribution & Installation unit, have moved to Solar Way, so
they have new phone numbers.

On top of this, the tie line between here and Solar Way has been taken out.
Because of this, you have to get out of the old Tymshare telephone network
into the public phone network, then dial the exchange and the whole 4-digit
extension number to reach anyone over there.  This is also true of the PDP-10
operators, and Lenny.


the numbers are:

Ed Roop				415/498-2562
Julian Minh			415/498-2560
Vivian Hyatt			415/498-2563

Khanh Nguyn			415/498-2559

I'm sure there are others, but these are the only ones I can think of whom we
would need to know.

Implementation  of  personal  computers in ISG offices must adhere to
ISG-published   standards   and   use   only  approved  hardware  and
software.    This  policy  seeks to minimize redundant efforts, focus
evolutionary   activities,   exclude   substandard  products,  reduce
support costs and promote communication/integration.

Field  Service  Company  has been designated as the provider of these
standard   systems   including  hardware  and  software  acquisition,
installation,  and  on-going  maintenance.    Purchases  of  standard
hardware  and  software  are  to  be  processed through Field Service
Company.    Purchase  of  this  equipment  through sources other than
Field  Service  is  prohibited.  Maintenance has been established for
all   existing  standard  personal  computers  and  is  automatically
established   for  new  standard  systems  for  all  business  units.
Business  units  may  elect  to  contract  for maintenance with Field
Service   for  hardware  components  not  covered  by  this  standard
service.

For  the  past  several  months,  requirements for personal computers
have  been  filled  from  existing  inventories.  The decision to use
these   inventories  was  based  on  critical  ISG  business  issues.
Business  Units or Group Staff personnel are not authorized to obtain
substitution   parts   for  these  systems  without  obtaining  prior
approval from the Director, Information Services - ISG.

All  Business  Units  and  Group  Staff are required to implement the
above  and  ensure  that appropriate procedures are in place to carry
out  these  policies.    Questions  about  the maintenance program or
current  standard  configurations  should  be  directed to Bob Greco,
(314) 233-5042.

I am pleased to announce the promotion of Michael Meyer to 
Controller - FHSD, effective November 3, 1986.  In his new 
position, Mike will report directly to me.

Since joining McDonnell Douglas in July, 1967, Mike has served as 
Manager of Accounting Practices - MDC and Manager of Financial 
Reporting - MDC.  In addition to general accounting experience, he 
brings with him extensive knowledge of United States Government 
Accounting Rules and Regulations.

It is also my pleasure to annouce the promotion of Michael Wolf as 
Manager of Accounting - FHSD, reporting to Mike Meyer.  Since 
June, 1979 Mike Wolf has worked in MDC Corporate Accounting, 
McDonnell Douglas Services, Inc., McDonnell Douglas Astronautics 
Company - Titusville, and most recently, ISG Group.

Also reporting to Mike Meyer is Tom Harman who manages Contracts 
and Pricing for FHSD.  Tom has been highly instrumental in 
bringing us to where we are today as a finalist in the competition 
for the Composite Health Care System for the Department of 
Defense.

I am confident you will support the above individuals in 
performing their assignments which are vital to the success of 
FHSD.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------




The TTE curriculum is highly structured with each course assuming completion
of prerequisites.  Only students who have the prerequisite knowledge are
able to get the full benefit of the course.  We cannot permit students
without prerequisites to enroll in courses because this is not fair to them
or to the other students.  However, we do recognize that employees may have
gained the required knowledge in ways other than completing the pererquisite
TTE class (i.e. outside courses, experience).
 
In our continuing drive to make TTE Training relevant to each students' job
requirements, we are revising and reemphasizing the procedure for students to
demonstrate mastery of course material without taking the TTE course.
 
We are developing challange tests for each of the major prerequisite
courses.  If the student passes the exam, his/her transcript is updated to
show that the course was passed by exam.  The procedure to challenge a
course is as follows:
 
 	Step 1 					Responsibility
       ________                        		________________
 
                                                                Page  2

 
1.  Determine course content and 		Student and Student's
    objectives by seeing the course             Manager
    description in the catalog or
    EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
2.  Request a test fron the TTE Registrar       Student's Manager
    via Ontyme EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
    or phone 408/942-5042
3.  Send test and instructions to the           TTE Registrar
    student's manager and record the request
4.  Administer test to the student              Student's Manager
5.  Return test to TTE Registrar at             Student's Manager
    2665 North First Street,
    San Jose, CA  95134
    Test must be returned to TTE within 2
    weeks or the test will not be accepted
6.  Grade the test                              TTE Instructor
7.  Notify student's manager of results and     TTE Registrar
    update transcript
 
For example suppose an employee wants to take TTE 400 Introduction to ISIS
but has not taken the prerequisite course TTE 100, 101, and 102 yet feels
that he knows the material.  The manager should contact the TTE registrar for
the TTE 100 challenge test, administer the test following the instructions, and
return the test to TTE.  If the student passed, the manager can request the
TTE 101 challenge exam.  After the student has passes all prerequisite
course by exam his enrollment in the TTE 400 will be confirmed.
 
This process will take time so you need to plan ahead.  TTE will respond to
requests for tests within 24 hours and will send the test via ontyme if
there are no graphics or by mail.
 
The returned test must be mailed and must indicate both the student's and
manager's signatures.  We will notify you of the results within 1 business
day receipt of the completed test.
 
Challenge tests are currently available for the following courses:
		TTE 100
		TTE 101
		TTE 102
		TTE 110
		TTE 200
		TTE 210
		TTE 220
		TTE 300
		TTE 400
 
There will be a $50.00 fee for each test administered.
 
Each student may take only 1 test at a time.  Each challenge test will be
administered to the same student only once.  If the student fails, he must
satisify the requirement by attending class.
