Implementation  of  personal  computers in ISG offices must adhere to
ISG-published   standards   and   use   only  approved  hardware  and
software.    This  policy  seeks to minimize redundant efforts, focus
evolutionary   activities,   exclude   substandard  products,  reduce
support costs and promote communication/integration.

Field  Service  Company  has been designated as the provider of these
standard   systems   including  hardware  and  software  acquisition,
installation,  and  on-going  maintenance.    Purchases  of  standard
hardware  and  software  are  to  be  processed through Field Service
Company.    Purchase  of  this  equipment  through sources other than
Field  Service  is  prohibited.  Maintenance has been established for
all   existing  standard  personal  computers  and  is  automatically
established   for  new  standard  systems  for  all  business  units.
Business  units  may  elect  to  contract  for maintenance with Field
Service   for  hardware  components  not  covered  by  this  standard
service.

For  the  past  several  months,  requirements for personal computers
have  been  filled  from  existing  inventories.  The decision to use
these   inventories  was  based  on  critical  ISG  business  issues.
Business  Units or Group Staff personnel are not authorized to obtain
substitution   parts   for  these  systems  without  obtaining  prior
approval from the Director, Information Services - ISG.

All  Business  Units  and  Group  Staff are required to implement the
above  and  ensure  that appropriate procedures are in place to carry
out  these  policies.    Questions  about  the maintenance program or
current  standard  configurations  should  be  directed to Bob Greco,
(314) 233-5042.

I am pleased to announce the promotion of Michael Meyer to 
Controller - FHSD, effective November 3, 1986.  In his new 
position, Mike will report directly to me.

Since joining McDonnell Douglas in July, 1967, Mike has served as 
Manager of Accounting Practices - MDC and Manager of Financial 
Reporting - MDC.  In addition to general accounting experience, he 
brings with him extensive knowledge of United States Government 
Accounting Rules and Regulations.

It is also my pleasure to annouce the promotion of Michael Wolf as 
Manager of Accounting - FHSD, reporting to Mike Meyer.  Since 
June, 1979 Mike Wolf has worked in MDC Corporate Accounting, 
McDonnell Douglas Services, Inc., McDonnell Douglas Astronautics 
Company - Titusville, and most recently, ISG Group.

Also reporting to Mike Meyer is Tom Harman who manages Contracts 
and Pricing for FHSD.  Tom has been highly instrumental in 
bringing us to where we are today as a finalist in the competition 
for the Composite Health Care System for the Department of 
Defense.

I am confident you will support the above individuals in 
performing their assignments which are vital to the success of 
FHSD.

SUBJECT>    TTE Challenge Test Procedure


-----------------------------------------------------------------------




The TTE curriculum is highly structured with each course assuming completion
of prerequisites.  Only students who have the prerequisite knowledge are
able to get the full benefit of the course.  We cannot permit students
without prerequisites to enroll in courses because this is not fair to them
or to the other students.  However, we do recognize that employees may have
gained the required knowledge in ways other than completing the pererquisite
TTE class (i.e. outside courses, experience).
 
In our continuing drive to make TTE Training relevant to each students' job
requirements, we are revising and reemphasizing the procedure for students to
demonstrate mastery of course material without taking the TTE course.
 
We are developing challange tests for each of the major prerequisite
courses.  If the student passes the exam, his/her transcript is updated to
show that the course was passed by exam.  The procedure to challenge a
course is as follows:
 
 	Step 1 					Responsibility
       ________                        		________________
 
                                                                Page  2

 
1.  Determine course content and 		Student and Student's
    objectives by seeing the course             Manager
    description in the catalog or
    EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
2.  Request a test fron the TTE Registrar       Student's Manager
    via Ontyme EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
    or phone 408/942-5042
3.  Send test and instructions to the           TTE Registrar
    student's manager and record the request
4.  Administer test to the student              Student's Manager
5.  Return test to TTE Registrar at             Student's Manager
    2665 North First Street,
    San Jose, CA  95134
    Test must be returned to TTE within 2
    weeks or the test will not be accepted
6.  Grade the test                              TTE Instructor
7.  Notify student's manager of results and     TTE Registrar
    update transcript
 
For example suppose an employee wants to take TTE 400 Introduction to ISIS
but has not taken the prerequisite course TTE 100, 101, and 102 yet feels
that he knows the material.  The manager should contact the TTE registrar for
the TTE 100 challenge test, administer the test following the instructions, and
return the test to TTE.  If the student passed, the manager can request the
TTE 101 challenge exam.  After the student has passes all prerequisite
course by exam his enrollment in the TTE 400 will be confirmed.
 
This process will take time so you need to plan ahead.  TTE will respond to
requests for tests within 24 hours and will send the test via ontyme if
there are no graphics or by mail.
 
The returned test must be mailed and must indicate both the student's and
manager's signatures.  We will notify you of the results within 1 business
day receipt of the completed test.
 
Challenge tests are currently available for the following courses:
		TTE 100
		TTE 101
		TTE 102
		TTE 110
		TTE 200
		TTE 210
		TTE 220
		TTE 300
		TTE 400
 
There will be a $50.00 fee for each test administered.
 
Each student may take only 1 test at a time.  Each challenge test will be
administered to the same student only once.  If the student fails, he must
satisify the requirement by attending class.

SUBJECT:    PROMOTION OF W. E. POTTER

I  am  pleased  to  announce  the  promotion  of Dr. W. E. (Skip)
Potter to the position of Director, Development at Vitek.

Skip  joined  Vitek in April 1978 as a Senior Research Scientist.
Since  then,  he  has held positions of increasing responsibility
in Development including the management of several key projects.

With   the   reorganization   of  our  Research  and  Development
activiities  in late 1985, Skip became Manager of the Development
Division,   reporting   to   me.     Under  his  leadership,  the
Development  group has responded to a series of customer needs in
a  manner  that  has  helped  us  consolidate  our  leadership in
automated microbiology on a worldwide basis.

Please  join  me  in  congratulating  Skip  on this well-deserved
promotion.

            get personally involved in many key sales situations.  He
            and his contributions will be missed!
            
            Please join me in extending best wished to Dennis in his new
            opportunity.

                   MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

                      ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETIN


No. MDC-86-104                                    31 December 1986


To:           MDC Plant Lists A - H

Subject:      FREQUENT FLYER BONUS PROGRAM


1.  The airlines' frequent flyer programs, which offer free or 
    reduced-cost tickets and other privileges in return for 
    specified amounts of paid travel, seemed when they were 
    introduced to be a temporary sales incentive.  Now, however, 
    they appear to have become a permanent feature of the travel 
    industry.

2.  In response to this development we have reviewed MDC's 
    handling of frequent flyer benefits.  We concluded that such 
    benefits should logically be regarded as discounts which make 
    possible increased travel at a given level of expense.  And 
    that they must, when they result from business travel, be 
    regarded as the property of the corporation rather than of 
    individuals.

3.  Such a position is consistent with our policy that valuable 
    gifts received by MDC teammates in the course of their work 
    should be turned over to the corporation.  It is also 
    consistent with our efforts to enhance MDC's competitiveness 
    by reducing costs.  Because MDC currently spends more than $50 
    million annually for airline tickets, the savings to be 
    achieved from handling frequent flyer benefits as corporate 
    property is potentially very significant.  Furthermore, we 
    must be responsive to our principal customer, the U.S. 
    Department of Defense, which has asked us to change our 
    current policy.

4.  Questions of ethics and fairness were given careful attention 
    during our review.  The change will be fairer than our current 
    approach, which in effect creates an additional source of 
    compensation not under MDC's control, but limits that source 
    to teammates whose duties happen to involve travel.  Also, it 
    will eliminate any temptation for the traveler to modify 
    travel plans for personal gain.

5.  Therefore, effective 1 January 1987, all of us must 
    participate in frequent flyer programs when traveling on 
    business and must use the bonuses received from this travel to 
    reduce the cost of future business trips.  All bonuses 
    received for business flights before 1 January 1987 -- and, of 
    course, any received for personal travel -- may be used for 
    personal travel.




Administrative Bulletin No. MDC-86-104
Page 2


6.  Implementing the new approach is the responsibility of 
    individual MDC travelers and their supervisors.  An extensive 
    administrative system will not be set up, but internal 
    auditing will conduct periodic reviews to guard against abuse 
    or neglect.  Guidelines for submitting coupons to the 
    McDonnell Douglas Travel Company (MDTC), or whatever travel 
    company serves you, are on the reverse side of this bulletin.

7.  I am aware of, and I appreciate, the sacrifices made by every 
    teammate who travels frequently.  We will continue to seek to 
    recognize and minimize those sacrifices and be open to 
    suggestions.



John F. McDonnell
President



        GUIDELINES FOR FREQUENT FLYER BONUS ADMINISTRATION


1.  Employees should join an airline's frequent flyer program, if 
    not already a member, the first time he/she flies on a given 
    carrier if it appears that such registration will be cost 
    effective.

2.  If there is a membership fee for joining (as with Pan 
    American), employees should use a personal check and submit a 
    petty cash voucher or other appropriate means of 
    reimbursement.

3.  Each traveler will be responsible for administering his/her 
    frequent flyer membership; affixing identification stickers to 
    tickets, maintaining a tally of business mileage vs. personal 
    mileage, determining when to send for a bonus award coupon, 
    etc.

4.  Frequent flyer awards should be allowed to accumulate until a 
    free ticket is earned.  When eligible for a free ticket due to 
    business travel, the traveler shoudl request a coupon.  When 
    the coupon is returned, the traveler should retain the coupon 
    pending a business trip which will achieve the greatest 
    benefit for the company.

5.  When calling MDTC or other travel agent for reservations, the 
    traveler must advise the reservationist that he/she will be 
    traveling on a frequent flyer bonus coupon for the applicable 
    airline.  Normally there will be an identifying series of 
    numbers on the coupon which must be given to the 
    reservationist at the time of booking.



Administrative Bulletin No. MDC-86-104
Page 3


6.  The coupon must then be sent to the travel agent (in the case 
    of MDTC to the local office in care of Ticketing) as payment 
    for the ticket.  It is essential that the travel agent receive 
    the coupon by the time the ticket is printed.

7.  Each component may elect to issue more specific guidelines for 
    the redemption of air travel bonuses as they pertain to its 
    unique business requirements.

Subject:   Personal Computer Software Licensing Agreements



1.  Copying of ISG-purchased personal computer software and its 
    documentation, for other than archive and backup purposed, is 
    strictly progibited and considered to be in direct violation 
    of MDC Policy 6, point 5, in the ISG Management Handbook.  
    Violators are subject to company disciplinary action, up to 
    and including dismissal and prosecution.

2.  Authorized software is the purchased copy of the personal 
    computer software and it documentation.  Also included under 
    the authorized designation is the back-up copy and hard disk 
    installation, as defined in the licensing agreement 
    accompanying most personal computer softare packages.  Any 
    other use of personal computer software is considered 
    unauthorized.  All employees using personal computers are 
    required to be familiar with the terms of the licensing 
    agreements and must comply with them.

3.  MDC Policy 6, point 5, in the ISG Management Handbook calls 
    for prevention of infrengement on copyrights owned by others 
    and places responsibility for controls within the scope of the 
    MDC Law guidelines.

4.  Failure to adhere to the software copyrights ofo thers, places 
    both the individual employee responsible for the unauthorized 
    use and ISG in violation of Federal law.  Such violations may 
    lead to litigation against one or the other or both parties by 
    the software manufacturer and result in fines and penalties 
    against those involved.  Software manufacturers have recently 
    been much more agressive in pursuing violators of their 
    licensing agreements.

5.  Please communicate this information to all employees in your 
    organization.  Contact your User Support Center if you require 
    further clarification of authorized personal computer software 
    usage.

William "Bill" Schrader, currently Vice President of U.S. 
Engineering, has announced his resignation from that position, 
effective as of the date a replacement can be named.  A 13-year 
employee of McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company/Microdata, 
Bill was promoted to his current position in May of 1984.  He has 
been associated with the Engineering Department since he joined 
the company.

In support of Bill's career interest, he has accepted a position 
of U.S. Manufacturing as Director of Manufacturing Technical 
Services, reporting directly to Greg Lawson.

In the Computer Company's strategic plan, Manufacturing Services 
is a Strategic Business Unit in which the capabilities of the 
company's manufacturing resources are made avaliable to ISG and 
MDC business units for production of products which they design.  
In 1986, this SBU accounted for nearly $20 million of intercompany 
revenue.  Current customers include Network Systems Company, 
McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, and the Vitek and 
Physicians Systems segments of Health Information Systems.

Please join us in welcoming Bill to his new position.  We are 
confident that he can and will play a vital role in the growth of 
our company in 1987 and beyond.

In order to help meet the MDHS goals of increased earnings in 
1987 and beyond, it has been decided after considerable 
planning, to consolidate the VAD PC operations in Dallas with 
the Equipment Management function in St. Louis.  Accordingly, 
the following actions are effective immediately.

1.  All warehousing, traffic, and distribution operations 
    formerly provided by MCAIR staff from facilities in Earth 
    City will be transferred to the Equipment Management 
    Organization and operated from a newly leased ISG facility 
    off Dorsett Road in St. Louis.

2.  The IBM PC Value Added Dealer (VAD) in Dallas will be moved 
    to St. Louis and be operated from the same Dorsett Road 
    facilities.

3.  Terry Conner is appointed Manager of Equipment Management 
    and VAD operations reporting directly to me.  Terry has been 
    the manager of those functions from nothing to their present 
    successful and highly effective operating formats.  Terry 
    will be challenged to achieve the highest possible 
    productivity and quality in distributing this large and 
    growing part of the MDHS revenue stream.  Terry along with 
    the Equipment Management Group and Purchasing will relocate 
    to the Dorsett Road Facility in the first quarter.

    Systems is the subject of a concurrent AB from the Vice

    through the last three years and has achieved unprecedented 
    responsiveness in meeting the need of MDHS equipment sales.  
    Recognition and sincere appreciation for his outstanding 
    work in that role is to be noted.  I want to extend to him 
    our best wishes for success and cooperation in meeting the 
    challenges of his new endeavor.

The move of both operations to the new Dorsett Road facility is

This consolidation of equipment and staff is expected to have a 
positive impact on earnings in 1987.  Please give Terry and Bob 
your cooperation in meeting the challenges of their new 
assignments.

Ashton-Tate  has  discontinued  shipping  dBase  III  and  is now
shipping  dBase  III  Plus.   Upgrade kits are now available at a
cost  of  $75  each  from  the  User  Support  Centers (USCs) for
current  dBase  III  users.    This  upgrade is not available for
dBase  II  users.  If you choose to upgrade your dBase III to the
new   Plus   version,   contact   the   USC   to  obtain  upgrade
authorization  forms.  Return the form to the USC along with your
original dBase III system diskettes.

The  major  benefit  of  this  upgrade  is  the  removal  of copy
protection.    Assist menus and documentation have been improved.
Additional   commands,   functions   and   capabilities  are  now
available.    Indexing and sorting performance has been improved.
Applications  written  in  dBase  III  require no file or program
conversions.


The USCs can be contacted at:

A message from Jerry Causley to all ISG employees. . .

    When I reported to you on ISG's third-quarter 1986 results, 
I said that if all of us could give the remaining months of 1986 
our best shot we would "prove to the world that ISG is back on 
track."  It is clear now that you did indeed give ISG your best 
shot.  Thanks in large part to an excellent fourth quarter, we 
finished 1986 with a solid profit at the performance earnings 
level -- that is, before the write-off of acquisition costs -- 
and we achieved revenue growth in line with the industry 
average.

    In the fourth quarter, we achieved performance earnings of 
$29.2 million, as compared with a $2.6 million profit in the 
same quarter of 1985.  This quarterly performance -- our best 
ever -- capped off a year of steady, quarter-by-quarter earnings 
improvement and brought us to a yearend profit of $2.5 million 
at the performance earnings level, compared to a 1985 loss of 
$42.0 million.

    As you know, performance earnings are the basis upon which 
MDC measures our performance.  Our bottom-line results in 1986 
will include $67.9 million to cover the cost of acquisition 
write-offs, compared with $66.3 million in 1985.  Even so, we 
produced an improvement of $44.5 million, and that is something 
of which we can be very, very proud.

    As I noted above, we produced this improvement while 
maintaining a competitive rate of revenue growth within an 
industry that is still suffering a serious recession.   Our 
fourth-quarter revenue of $326.8 million brought our 1986 
revenue to $1.2 billion.  When we adjust this figure to account 
for the divestiture of Dynatax Systems, our revenue grew 8.0 
percent over 1985.  We expect that to be consistent with the 
average growth of the industry as a whole.  (Both the revenue 
and earnings figures I have given here are as we report them to 
MDC; they do not reflect certain consolidating adjustments MDC 
makes for public segment reporting.)

    Yes, your efforts did pay off in 1986.  What is more, your 
good work over the past few months has given us a strong start 
on 1987.  From this point on, it is crucial that we continue to 
build the momentum we generated in 1986.  We must do that to 
make good on our commitment to an ambitious 1987 operating plan, 
not to mention the further commitments we will all be making as 
part of the Significant Business Issue process.

    I will be sharing more of my thoughts with you in an 
upcoming issue of the ISG Spectrum newspaper.  For now, please 
accept my congratulations and thanks for a job well-done, and my 
best wishes as you go forward to meet the challenges of 1987.

SUBJECT:  SEXUAL HARASSMENT


The topic of sexual harassment continues to command the 
attention of the business community, the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, the news media and, most recently, the 
Supreme Court.  It is the policy of the McDonnell Douglas 
Information Systems Group to provide a work environment in which 
no person is subjected to harassment of any kind, including 
sexually offensive conduct.

The EEOC has established the following three (3) guidelines for 
determining whether an action constitutes sexual harassment:

    1)   Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or 
         implicitly a term or condition of an individual's 
         employment,

    2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an 
         individual is used as the basis for employment 
         decisions affecting such individual, or 

    3)   Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably 
         interfering with an individual's work performance or 
         creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working 
         environment.

Recent court decisions have expanded the law to include the 
following points:

    o    Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual 
         advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal 
         or physical conduct of a sexual nature.  Victims do not 
         have to show a concrete economic injury.  Victims need 
         only show that the harassment unreasonably interfered 
         with their work or created a harmful or offensive 
         environment.

    o    Employers may be strictly liable for acts of sexual 
         harassment by their supervisory employees and agents, 
         regardless of whether the acts in question were 
         forbidden by the employer or whether the employer knew 
         or should have known of their occurrence.  The 
         liability is not limited to line supervisors with 
         authority to hire, fire or promote.  There is no 
         requirement that the employee complain of or report the 
         sexual harassment, or actually submit to the advances 
         of the supervisor.


    o    With respect to conduct between fellow employees, an 
         employer may be responsible for acts of sexual 
         harassment in the workplace where the employer, its 
         agents or supervisory employees, knows of the alleged 
         harassment.  The conduct of the co-worker must be 
         severe or persuasive enough to alter the term, 
         condition or privilege of employment.

ISG will not tolerate sexual harassment in any form.  
Disciplinary action may be imposed on those individuals found to 
be engaging in such harassment.

Employees with questions pertaining to sexual harassment are 
encouraged to bring them to the attention of their management or 
to contact the Equal Opportunity Programs Coordinator located 
within the Human Resources function.

Please be advised, to those of you who have dealings with and 
involvement with ADP Comtrend, note that we have recently transitioned 
this account from Mike Hanna in the Connecticut office to Rosemary 
Karlsson in the Vienna, Virginia office.  This transition has been 
finalized as of approximately two weeks ago.
 
I would ask those of you as department heads, particularly Pat 
Diamond, to notify the appropriate people within your organizations of 
this change.  Rosemary is now handling this account as the assigned 
Communications Specialist in the same capacity that Mike Hanna had 
done in the past.  Any correspondence or concerns for the account from 
a software perspective should be coordinated through her.  Her number 
here is (703)827-9110.
 
Again, please insure that all of the appropriate parties dealing with 
ADP are made aware of this.
 
Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter.
 
Sincerely,

The Remote Computing Services Organization cordially invites you to
attend a presentation by Information Builders, Inc. (IBI) on FOCUS,
the most widely user 4th Generation Language/Data Base Management
System in the industry.  You may already be familiar with FOCUS, but
FOCUS has been improved and expanded in function, capability, perfor-
mance and portability, meaning that this might be a good reason to
take another look or to introduce yourself to the industry standard
4th Generation Language software.  Consider just a few of the improve-
ments IBI have made:
   - EFFICIENCY:  CPU utilization has been reduced by up to fifty
     __________
     percent.  Faster I/O performance has been achieved through improved
     data access strategies and buffer management, and data transfer
     speed of our micro/mainframe link has more than doubled.

   - POWERFUL LANGUAGE:  Powerful new commands have been added, enabling
     _________________
     the building of transaction processing applications more easily,
     replacing COBOL and similar languages.

   - EXTENSION:  New, FOCUS can be used to build data management
     _________
     applications for non-FOCUS databases such as SQL/DS, DB2 and VSAM
     files.

   - DECISION SUPPORT:  FOCMAM, our new integrated project management
     ________________
     system, and FOCCALC, the first 4th generation spreadsheet for micro
     and mainframe use, highlight two of our latest facilities for DSS.

   - LEADING EDGE TECHNOLOGY:  FOCUS Vision allows the capture and
     _______________________
     integration of video images and data in the same FOCUS database,
     promising to open a whole new range of applications.

     Our seminar will be held in the McDonnell Douglas Executive Briefing
     Center, Room 215, on March 10, 1987 from 8:30 to 12:00.  IB Technical
     Representatives will be available after lunch to answer questions.
     Space is limited, so please call Cheryl Schroeder at (314) 234-6776
     to confirm your attendance.  We are looking forward to seeing you on
     March 10.

forces.  Bob has been with McDonnell Douglas for fifteen years and has
held increasing levels of responsibility during that time.  Most recently
he has been Branch Manager of Custom Contracts in Atlanta.  As a result,
he brings valued hands-on field experience to his new job.

I am also pleased to announce that Dave Steep will be assuming Bob's old
position as the Atlanta Branch Manager for Custom Contracts.  Dave has
been with McDonnell Douglas for nine years and has established an
excellent track record.  His most recent assignment has been as Section
Manager, responsible for Quality Assurance and Key Account Management in
the St. Louis branch.  Dave will, therefore, take valuable large account
management experience to the field.

These changes result from Doug Gross accepting a position within the
Finance and Insurance organization.

These assignments were effective 05 January.  Congratulations and
continued success to Bob, Dave and Doug.
