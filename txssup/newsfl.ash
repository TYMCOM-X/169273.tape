 . . JUNE PROFILE:  INTEGRATED APPLICATIONS AND CONSULTING SERVICES . .

CONSULTING SERVICES                Diane Bateman, Karen Bregar, Steven

TERRY FUJIMOTO'S SECRETARY         Debbie Jones
 
THEIR MISSION . . . .
 
The organization's mission, according to Terry, is to bring business
in the door and to keep the business we already have.
 
THEIR LOCATIONS . . . .
 
The ACs and RCMs (Regional Consulting Managers) in thirteen field
offices are strategically located to provide local support to the
field sales force.  They also serve as contacts for clients who need
technical help.
 
THEIR FUNCTION . . . .
 
The function of the ACs has always been to provide presales and
postsales support and customer training, and to do small development
projects.  Within the new organization, ACs will continue to do all of
these things.  But they will be directing more of their efforts toward
presales support.  The hotline will take over some of their postsales
support duties, SDS will do more of the development work, and Terry
expects to see more of the training taken over by other ACS
organizations.  The ACs will then have more time for strategizing with
the sales people to sign new business.
 
CONSULTING SERVICES . . . .
 
The people in the Consulting Services group are the ACs' ACs.  Their
depth of experience enables them to help the ACs with the
opportunities that are larger and/or more technically complicated.
 
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT . . . .
 
To do their job, the Consulting Services people need to know where to
get answers to their own questions and those of the ACs, and they need
people in key areas who can answer their questions quickly.  That's
the function of the people in Program Management and Support.  Each
has an area of specific expertise that the Consulting Services people
may not necessarily have.  They provide program management support to
make sure we deliver what has been promised, can bill according to the
sales agreement, and can meet customer deadlines.
 
According to Terry, the IACS organization is positioned as the primary
ACS contact for all sales organizations, key customer accounts, and
other McDonnell Douglas business units.  On the average, each member
is responsible for more than $1 million in annual revenue.  "We intend
to invest in this group to accomplish our part in 'Building the
Vision'.  I believe we have the necessary critical mass, the right
people, and the management support", says Terry.




                                                        Page 5

 
IACS will also act as a focal point for anyone who needs ACS
information or services.  If you don't know who to contact with your
technical or marketing questions, send an OnTyme to ACS.HELP.

Chicago's recent ACS Seminar was a success, thanks to Jeff Lauer.
Jeff invited 14 attendees and identified four good prospects.
 
The schedule at press time is

ACS Seminar coordinator Nancy Browning is exploring new ways of
helping the branches organize seminars.  She has asked other ISG sales
groups (for example, Manufacturing, MDCIS, and Banking) to invite
customers.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . A NEW ACS STRATEGIC PLANNING GROUP . . . . . . . . .
 
Strategic Marketing Development (SMD), managed by Kathy Donigan, is an
exciting addition to ACS.  Kathy and key marketing and technical
people plan to suggest four to six new ACS products and services by
the end of the year.
 
"This year SMD plans to package capabilities that we are currently
using," reports Kathy.  "This means defining each product and its
customer base and preparing sales brochures and pricing schemes."
 
Kathy's SMD team identified two product sources:  TYMNET-based
products used by ACS clients, and successful integrated applications.
These integrated applications would be generalized from a particular
client to an entire industry.  The SMD team also pinpointed some
additional technologies needed by ACS development and will propose a
long-term plan.
 
Kathleen Farley, Lynne Edwards, Thomas Olt, and Bruce Watkins have
been appointed as SMD Product Managers.  Their first job is to develop
preliminary business plans for proposed products, and to determine
staffing needs.
 
 
 . . . . . . . . . . CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER NEWS . . . . . . . . . .
 
In early August, the Customer Service Center (CSC) will handle ACS
customer validations on the TYMCOM-370 and TYMCOM-X.  (Watch OnTyme
for details.)  CSC needs information for all customers entered into
the CSC customer profile data base by then.

VALLEY FORGE DATA CENTER CLOSES . . . .
 
The Valley Forge Data Center recently closed, and ACS customers were
transferred onto two new IBM 3083s in Dallas.  "The 3083 is a more
cost-effective machine than the 3033 [which Valley Forge had], and has
a processing speed that provides almost twice the throughput," says
Terry.  "Everything that worked on the smaller machine works on the
3083, so the transfer is transparent to our customers."  The transfer
should result in over half a million dollars in savings for ISG this
year.

 . . . . . . . JULY PROFILE:  INTEGRATED SYSTEMS MARKETING . . . . . . .
 
Integrated Systems Marketing (ISM), promotes communications-based
systems that utilize multiple technologies.  It also offers mainframe
and micro-based tools for creating these systems.  Manager Scott
Holiman describes ISM's mandate:  ISM is to "make ACS the clear leader
in the delivery of integrated systems.
 
"There is a tremendous market for integrated systems," says Holiman.
"Our competitors are moving in this direction in a big way.  We have
the lead, but we must take advantage of our window of opportunity.
Our organization wants to support the sales force in exploiting that
lead."
 
ISM helps the branches identify new customers and develop sales
strategies.  It educates sales reps about integrated systems and
provides them with sales aids.  ISM also manages the ACS Customer
Service Center (CSC).
 
ACTIVITIES . . . .
 
The major ISM activity currently is The ACS Seminar, which explains to
potential customers the concept of integrated systems and describes
the successful Computerland application.  For more information on
seminar locations, times, invitations, and support, contact
ACS.N/BROWNING.
 
Other activities in the works include the release of a new version of
Tym/COMM in mid-September and brochures, data sheets, success stories,
and a sales kit.  If anyone knows of an integrated system that would
make a good success story, send an OnTyme to ACS.N/BROWNING.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . ACS SEMINAR NEWS . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 
The ACS Seminar is proving to be an effective way to guarantee ACS
leads.  St. Louis Diversified Sales representatives put together an
extensive prospect list with the assistance of ISM, mailed 300
invitations, did phone follow up on the majority of prospects,
confirmed 38 attendees, and identified seven solid leads, two of which
could close and bill by year-end.
 
"The credit really goes to Hank Spencer and his fellow sales reps,"
says Nancy Browning.
 
According to Hank, representatives from 18 different St. Louis
companies attended the seminar.  "The seminar solidified relationships
with two current prospects, both of which will be proceeding with
pilot programs."  Five other opportunities were "uncovered."
 
Hank thanks the "ACS organization, and especially St. Louis consultant
Carol Burkett and Houston consultant D'Juanna Beer, who did an
outstanding job in their presentations and demonstrations of ACS
products."
 
San Francisco just completed its seminar with similar results.
 
Says Nancy, "If you commit yourself and follow up, you'll get a
handsome payoff."  At press time, the schedule for future seminars is

 . . . . . . . . . . NEWS FROM ACS FEDERAL PROGRAMS . . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Federal Programs expanded OnTyme and installed a local area
network (LAN) communications interface for the Army Corps of
Engineers.  "The number of Army Corps of Engineers staff using OnTyme
will increase from 2,000 to 10,000 in the next two months as a result
of a new contract," reports Russ Service, Manager of ACS Federal
Programs.
 
The Federal Programs organization markets ACS systems to the U. S.
Government here and abroad, and provides a 22-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
hotline service to federal users.  In addition, the organization
provides pre- and post-sales technical support to commercial ACS
accounts in the Washington, DC area.
 
OnTyme training is one of the organization's strengths.  Using their
own hands-on training program, the Federal Programs staff has trained
1200 federal users of OnTyme worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 4
 
Federal Programs also provides ongoing support for Army Corps of
Engineers applications installed on the Tymcomm 370.  These
applications are accessed by users in the U. S., Europe, Korea, Japan,
Philippines, Panama, and other international locations.
 
Currently Russ's organization is installing micro engines at Army
Corps of Engineers sites in Washington, DC and Germany to interface
LANs with TYMNET.
 
If you have questions about federal contract procedures or want to
exchange information about LAN communications interfaces, contact Russ
Service at ACS.GOVMAIL.
 
 
 . . . . SEPTEMBER PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES, PART II . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon.  These units are responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers) and marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets,
  and various other sales aids)
* Sales and training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Building administration in VG-3
 
Last month's Newsflash profiled Marketing Publications, Production
Services, and Marketing Promotions.  This month, we focus on Training
Services, Building Administration, and Course Development.  These
three units are responsible for
 
* sales and professional development training and course development
* building administration in ACS headquarters
 
TRAINING SERVICES . . . .
 
At first, Training Services might sound quite a bit like Course
Development -- until you look at the primary purposes of the two.
Course Development develops; Training Services administers.  Carlota
Santa Cruz, Manager of Training Services, sees the function of the
department more as the developer of a career training path rather than
particular technical courses.  Training Services programs include
 
- ACS Product School
- AC Exchange Week
- Presentation Skills
- Selling ACS Workshop
 
The courses that happen to lie along this path can come from a variety
of sources - Deltak, Xerox, internal development, or other sources.
 
To develop career training paths, Carlota evaluates all the available
courses and arranges them into a logical sequence.  When holes appear
in this sequence either she or Course Developer Sarah Chamlee Kinkel
develop the needed material.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 5
 
Valerie Minder, Training Support Specialist, has just begun to
facilitate the FOCUS Data Base Management class.  Additionally, she
checks for proper registration forms and tracks each student along the
proper training paths.
 
Training Services usually doesn't deal with technological concepts.
Training Services emphasizes the "how to sell" aspect of education;
for example, the "How to Sell ACS Products" Seminar deals primarily
with the consultative sale rather than the product sale.
 
The future should see more regional training schedules, including
workshops, facilitated by Carlota and Valerie or by ACS employees
trained in course facilitation by Carlota and Valerie.  For the
present, the training schedule is available on *** ACS.TRAININGSCHED.
Descriptions of the available courses are referenced from that file.
 
COURSE DEVELOPMENT . . . .
 
Course Development, in the words of Course Developer Sarah Chamlee
Kinkel, is responsible for developing courses not already covered by
Training Services or other packaged sources.
 
Course Development projects come from various sources:  ACS
consultants, product managers, or the training group itself.  Two
current projects originated with Terry Fujimoto and Shirley Macemon -
a Data Communications course called Bisynchronous Connections to the
Network, section one of four that will be delivered under the title
ACS Technologies Solutions Training.
 
Sarah manages the development projects from inception to completion.
This includes developing objectives, mustering resources to provide
technical input, writing handout and support materials, training
initial facilitators, and distributing packaged materials.
 
BUILDING ADMINISTRATION . . . .
 
A pleasant environment to do your work in is mandatory if you expect
to do good work.  Lighting has to be adequate, heating/air
conditioning has to work properly, telephones have to ring when
they're supposed to, and hardwires need to connect to the correct
equipment.  Even the colors need to soothe.  All of these working
condition concerns are in the care of Diane Gordon.
 
Her position as Building Administrator put her in the critical role of
supporting ACS while it supports you:  with security services,
maintenance, telecommunications, space planning, and construction.
Primarily, in her words, her job is to make sure ACS "gets its needed
services easily and quickly."

 . . . . . . . . AUGUST PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon that work together to provide the sales support materials
necessary to sell ACS products and services.  These units are
responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers)
* Marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets, and various
  other sales aids)
* Sales and customer training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Market research for product managers
* Building administration in VG-3.
 
During the past year, Shirley has worked with her section managers to
 
* Develop a better understanding of what training and support
  materials we can provide the sales force to help sell ACS products
* Develop effective public relations and advertising campaigns and
  materials, and marketing support materials such as data sheets,
  sales lists, and slide presentations
* Assign an "Opportunity Coordinator" to each product manager who

MARKETING PUBLICATIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Publications produces a wide variety of written materials
for ACS.  According to Larry Tolbert, Marketing Publications Manager,
the group's task is to "make ACS products easier to understand and
use, and to assist in image-making and sales support for these
products."
 
Marketing Publications no longer produces only technical and training
manuals.  The group has taken an exciting new direction and now
provides a wide range of promotional materials, such as data sheets,
success stories, advertising copy, and scripted slide shows for sales
presentations.
 
For example, Marketing Publications recently completed six OnTyme
technical publications, ten data sheets, a case study for Forbes
magazine, and support materials for the ACS Seminar.  In September
they will release the Tym/COMM User's Guide, and in October three
stories for the ACS Success Story series.  They wrote Tym/COMM and ACS
Seminar ad copy for ISM.  And, they are working closely with Bill
Sarnoff to develop the ACS company brochure.
 
For a detailed list of publications produced by Marketing
Publications, see OnTyme Publications and ISM Publications in this
NEWSFLASH.  Or consult the OnTyme file *** ACS.PUBLICATIONS.

PRODUCTION SERVICES . . . .
 
Production Services, a subunit of Marketing Publications, provides
editing services, coordinates printing and production, and ensures
that ACS printed materials project a highly professional image to
customers and to other MDC groups.  Production Services supervisor Bob
Raymond joined the group on August 5.  He is a former Tymshare
employee and brings years of production expertise and knowledge back
to ACS.

MARKETING PROMOTIONS . . . .
 
Marketing Promotions Specialist Bill Sarnoff coordinates all
promotional activities for ACS.  Bill works closely with other
Marketing Services units to ensure that ACS publications project a
uniform image.  He also coordinates our advertising and public
relations activities.  He is currently working with the PR firm of
Dudly-Anderson-Yutzy (DAY) to present ACS products, services, and key
personalities to the business community through the trade press.  For
example, Bill is coordinating Phil Marson's upcoming PR tour.  He is
also working with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency of Chicago
on an ACS advertising campaign planned for January 1986.

Mainframe Product Marketing (MPM) is a recently formed organization within ACS
(Applied Communications Systems).  We provide marketing and technical
support for EXPRESS, EXPRESS-mate/link, FOCUS, PC/FOCUS, and the databases.

The NEWSFLASH will be sent via OnTyme around the 15th of each month and will
also be available as public file *** ACS.NEWSFLASH.  The NEWSFLASH will
contain a variety of ACS-related news and product information, and is just
one of the ways we will be communicating ACS information to you.

ACCOLADES to the New York, Stamford and New York Financial Branches for their
SUCCESS in the creation and presentation of a seminar on "ACS."  The seminar
was held in New York on November 30 (and is planned again December 17), and
was attended by over 40 clients and prospects (with about 30 more expected for
the December presentation).

The central theme behind the seminar was the idea that most companies today
demand information systems that will facilitate the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of time-sensitive information; yet, today's information
marketplace is a vast universe of INCOMPLETE SOLUTIONS.  The McDonnell Douglas
answer to this need, the need for integrated solutions that bring together 
the various technologies necessary to satisfy different information needs,
is the unique approach called "APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS - ACS."

Some of the folks behind this effort included: Neil Schappert and Ted Herman,
who created ACS brochures for the seminar; Karen Bregar, Michele Vitaliano,
and Ed Christian - who created a demo incorporating a variety of ACS products/
technologies; Ken Holcomb - who presented some real-life applications; all the
related branch personnel who worked long and hard to pull this off; and
finally, a HUGE APPLAUSE, please, for the monumental efforts of all the
administrative staff from the various offices!!!

ACS CONGRATULATES and THANKS all of the personnel involved in this effort...
we see this example of creatively presenting the ACS concept as one of the
real SUCCESS STORIES of the month!

RAVE REVIEWS are STILL POURING in on the premiere ACS BASIC PRODUCT SCHOOL, 
held February 4-8 at the Santa Clara Marriott.

HIGHLIGHTS of the one-week course included:  PRESENTATIONS on each of the
"pieces" of an ACS Integrated Application;  An excercise where attendees 
"Put It All Together" by developing and presenting their own ACS integrated
solution;  A HEATED TRIVIAL PURSUIT CONTEST - testing attendees on their more
"trivial" knowledge of ACS;  A Field Trip to  ACS Headquarters - where
participants "broke bread" with members of the entire ACS organization; 
AND LOTS of in-depth training on ALL aspects of ACS.

The course is planned for a REPEAT performance March 18-22, and is also
tentatively planned for sometime in mid-April.  The March class is ALREADY
full - although enrollments will continue to be accepted on a first-come first-
serve basis to fill any last-minute cancellations.

For prerequisite and enrollment information, see public file *** BPS.OVERVIEW 
or CONTACT Sarah Chamlee Kinkle, Course Development (ACS.S/CHAMLEE or X 6469),
or Madeleine Ayer, Training Support Specialist (ACS.TRAINMAIL or X 6184).

*****A very SPECIAL CONGRATULATIONS (and THANK YOU) to Sarah and Madeleine,
by the way, for a Beautifully organized school.  And, THANK YOU to all of the
ACS Folks who participated...your well-spent energies were APPRECIATED!!*****

Get it while its HOT!!!  The New HOTLINE NUMBER for the CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTER
(CSC) is...got a pencil?...

                           800-435-8880
          Operating Hours: Mon-Fri, 8-5 (Pacific Std. Time)

                                or
                            CSC.HOTLINE

The Customer Service Center's INITIAL ROLE will be as a first line of
SUPPORT for ONTYME CUSTOMERS.  They will provide immediate response to a
customer's CRY FOR HELP...and will provide useful feedback to the
particular sales representative or applications consultant regarding
that customer's SUPPORT NEEDS.




In addition to OnTyme Customer Support (and Internal Support) the
HOTLINE will also act as a REFERRAL point for calls regarding other
ACS products, and in the future, the CUSTOMER SUPPORT CENTER hopes to
be able to actually SUPPORT all of ACS' products.

The HOTLINE is for CUSTOMERS only, but sales representatives and applications
consultants NEED NOT FEAR...ACS continues to offer a variety of support 
mechanisms for YOU!!  For an up-to-date listing of Product Support Contacts 
within ACS, check the ACS PRODUCT SUPPORT REFERENCE GUIDE on System 49!
Just type " SUPPORT " at the CMS prompt.  This on-line Information Guide was
UPDATED THIS MONTH, so it's time to run off a copy for your VERY own!

As the "MOST PROLIFIC TRIVIAL PURSUER" in ACS (an award achieved by creating
the BEST trivial pursuit questions for use in a recently held Basic Product
School contest), PAM FARRELL wins the highly coveted and VERY prestigious
HONOR of being FEATURED ...up close and personal... in this month's
ACS NEWSFLASH!

Pam recently joined the MPM Support Group to take over the Support
responsibilities for EXPRESS and our mainframe-based Graphics products.
She is a self-avowed EXPRESS GURU, and believes that the product can do
practically anything...except maybe Ski!

But that's where Pam comes in.  An avid skier (she lives in Denver, and skies
at Vail...), Pam extends an open invitation to any of her fellow ACS'rs who
may make it to Denver - to JOIN her for a "run down the back bowls of Vail."
When not on the slopes, Pam is sometimes 37,000 feet above sea level - commuting
between Denver and Cupertino.  Such a tiring commute can have its
advantages - it enables her to visit her nearby sister and nephew on
occasion; BUT it also means that her 3 FELINE FRIENDS (Max, Miles and Leo)
at home have to "wing it" ("paw it?") on their own.

WHY did Pam know so much TRIVIAL TRIVIA about MDC and ACS?  Well, she was
born and bred in St. Louis...and comes to ACS from MDCSS...and has worked
for Tymshare for almost 3 years.

WHAT is the most trivial thing ABOUT PAM?  She wouldn't tell me, but YOU
can try to find out by OnTyming ACS.EXPRESS !

     The Monthly Newsletter of the APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY
     from ACS MARKETING PUBLICATIONS, Cupertino, CA . . . October 15, 1985
     =================================================================
     
           . . . . . . . . CNS MARKETING REP TESTIFIES TO THE SUCCESS
                           OF AN ACS SOLUTION:  TWRA . . . . . . . .
     
     "Extraordinary cooperation and effort between ACS and CNS lead to an
     extraordinary success in closing TWRA (Transpacific Westbound Rate As-
     sociation), an association of 19 shipping lines," said Brigitte Long,
     Western Region CNS Senior Marketing Rep, in her presentation recently
     to ACS Director Phil Marson and his staff.  "First contact with the
     client occurred mid-February.  The sales team gave a presentation
     March 1 and closed the business a week later."
     
     At the meeting, Brigitte presented ACS consultants Jeri Mearns and
     Warren Tang with a plaque recognizing their efforts "above and beyond
     the call of duty."  The ACS Customer Service Center staff received the
     Western Region's "Who Said It Couldn't Be Done?" award, a star per-
     former traveling trophy.  Brigitte also recognized Phil Marson and
     Larry Legate, Western Region CNS Director, for their "hands-on manage-
     ment style," directly supporting the sale from lead to implementation.
     All the persons above, as well as Terry Fujimoto, Nancy Shelton, Bryan
     Louviere, Nick Chrimes, Steven Eng, and Jo An Couche, received hats
     that read "TWRA MASH TEAM."
     
     "Without this great CNS/ACS cooperative spirit, we would never have
     closed the account so quickly, got the system implemented and billing
     significantly, and have walked away with a happy client and reference-
     able account," said Brigitte.  "As a result of our success at TWRA, we
     have another significant opportunity with a similar organization,
     ANERA."
     
     CSC SUPPORT INSTRUMENTAL IN TWRA CLOSE . . . .
     
     In order to be successful in offering post sales support, the Customer
     Service Center needs extensive information from CNS about each ac-
     count.  This includes a customer profile as well as documentation and
     training materials relating to each account.  Customer Support Repre-
     sentatives will travel to attend customer training classes.  For exam-
     ple, Naji Mourad attended the TWRA customer training class and briefed
     other Customer Support Representatives on the account.
     
     Customer Service Center representatives have handled 99% of post sales
     calls from TWRA users.  Robert Levrini, Manager of the Customer Ser-
     vice Center, credits this success to communication and cooperation
     between the Customer Service Center and the Western Region field con-
     sulting group.  Robert emphasizes that the TWRA success exemplifies
     his message to other field consulting groups.  "The more information
     we have about a customer, the fewer calls we have to refer to the
     field.  This frees field support people to work on presales qualifica-
     tion of prospects.
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     The Customer Service Center exists to provide post sales support.
     With information on each account, Customer Service Center repre-
     sentatives say they can provide this support.  The proof is their
     success with TWRA.
     
     
      . . . . . . . OCTOBER PROFILE:  DEVELOPMENT SERVICES . . . . . .
     
     The ACS groups formerly called Product Development (in Cupertino) and
     Software Development Services (in New York, Houston, and Mountain
     View) have been merged into a new ACS organization called Development
     Services.  Managed by Lyndon Evans, Development Services (DS) manages,
     develops, installs, and maintains all ACS integrated systems and
     products.
     
     Although all the DS groups perform software development functions,
     some division of labor exists.  DS Cupertino does primarily large-
     scale, structured product development; DS New York, DS Houston, and DS
     Mountain View develop customized integrated systems for ACS customers.
     
     STAFF . . . .
     
     Lyndon Evans is based in Houston and travels frequently to the other
     DS offices to manage his staff of 46.  Lyndon spends about half of his
     time at the Cupertino office.
     
     The DS offices' managers are Karen Quattrocchi (acting manager,
     Cupertino), Ed Murray (New York), Elizabeth McClintock (Houston), and
     Debin Benish (Mt. View).
     
     CURRENT PROJECTS . . . .
     
     A major DS emphasis for the rest of this year is to develop tools
     needed for the new products being identified by the Strategic Market-
     ing Development (SMD) task force.  In 1986, DS will be utilizing these
     tools to develop the products.  In addition, DS staff are working on a
     wide range of other projects, such as
     
     * OrderXchange - DS New York is now working on a data
       exchange tool for the new sales order entry product being put
       together by SMD's Kathleen Farley.  Using this tool, DS Houston
       will develop the prototype product.
     
     * OnTyme Connection - DS Cupertino has developed this IBM PC/XT/AT-
       based product so users can create, read, and file messages offline
       and then send and receive messages via OnTyme.  The product is now
       in beta test and will be released soon.
     
     * Nichols Institute - DS Mountain View with DS Houston and DS
       Cupertino developed this system for the rapid distribution of
       medical test results to numerous remote sites.  Nichols is now using
       the system, which was described in Forbes magazine on September 23,
       1985.  Enhancements are currently under development.
     
     * IDP - In July, DS New York installed the system for the Inter-
       national Data Processing Company (IDP) that enables its clients--in-
       dependent insurance companies--to share health claim information.
       Using the system, clients can identify cases where individuals have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       made fraudulent overlapping claims to multiple carriers.  This five
       man-year development effort incorporates all of the technologies of
       an integrated system and required almost 1,000 pages of
       documentation.
     
     * TICOR - DS Mountain View with DS Houston just installed a system for
       TICOR that collects and distributes information about available
       investments in the secondary mortgage market.
     
     For more information on the activities of Development Services, con-
     tact Lyndon Evans at (408)446-7205 (his Cupertino number) or via
     OnTyme at ACS.DSHDQRS.
     
     
         . . . . . . DIVISIONAL COOPERATION LEADS TO ACS SALE . . . . .
     
     Peter Lonsdale, CNS Western Region, has closed an account with Clorox.
     The lead came from an EDI sales rep.  "This close is exciting because
     Clorox has applicability across the entire food processing industry,"
     says Nancy Browning.  "As a matter of fact, Peter has already
     uncovered a similar need at Del Monte."
     
     Nancy advises sales reps to become aware of EDI efforts because
     prospects that don't meet EDI standards could become easy sales for
     ACS.  Since the Clorox application can be moved into other
     organizations within the food processing industry, the Integrated
     Systems Marketing group is putting together a sales strategy.  Any
     sales reps who have food processing companies as clients should con-
     tact Nancy at (408)446-8043 or ACS.N/BROWNING for prerelease informa-
     tion on this strategy.
     
     
               . . . NEWS FROM INTEGRATED SYSTEMS MARKETING . . .
     
     A new updated Tymquote information sheet is available through OnTyme
     (*** INFO.TYMQUOTE) and on the TYMCOM-370 System 43.  (From the CMS
     prompt, C>, on any System 43 userid, type ATT DBAPRINT and then UWSC
     TQINFO.)
     
     The new 3083 TYMSLICE price schedule should be making its way to each
     office by U.S. mail.  See the "ACS PUBLICATIONS" list for additional
     information.  A new TYMSLICE contract addendum for 4341, 3033, and
     3083 slices (Pubs #182) is now available: it replaces Pubs numbers 658
     and 666, which covered 4341 and 3033 slices, respectively.
     
     The demographic database DORIS is no longer offered by McDonnell
     Douglas.  And by December 1, 1985, SUPERSITE will also be removed from
     the list of available databases.  All your customers currently using
     the latter should have been notified already, but please double check.
     
     TYM/COMM GOING STRONG . . . .
     
     Tym/COMM 3.0 is selling well -- 62 sales in the week after the release
     of the product.  Several major opportunities are being pursued.
     Training is available for interested ACs through Rose Hayden
     (ACS.R/HAYDEN).  X.PC protocol will be supported by Tym/COMM during
     the first quarter '86.
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     CSC BRIEFS . . . .
     
     The Customer Service Center (CSC) is still collecting customer profile
     information necessary for issuing mainframe IDs to ACS customers.  The
     Center maintains a database on each ACS customer.
     
     The Customer Service Center is open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific
     Time.  Contact CSC at 800-435-8880, CSC.HOTLINE, or CSC.SUP.
     
     ACS CONFERENCING SYSTEM . . . .
     
     A data sheet is now available for the ACS ON-LINE CONFERENCING SYSTEM.
     To obtain a copy, contact Lynne Edwards (ACS.L/EDWARDS) or Terry
     Griffin (ACS.T/GRIFFIN).
     
     The McDonnell Douglas ACS ON-LINE CONFERENCING SYSTEM is a software
     tool that enables a group of people to maintain an ongoing discussion
     on any topic of mutual interest.  Like an electronic mail system, the
     computer conferencing system transmits information over a data network
     to eliminate telephone tag and time zone mismatch and to facilitate
     communication between people who are geographically separated.  The
     computer conferencing system also includes capabilities that organize
     the information and facilitate group discussions.
     
     If an application calls for a method of handling many-to-many communi-
     cations (as opposed to one-to-one or one-to-many communication), the
     ACS ON-LINE CONFERENCING SYSTEM may be the tool you are looking for.
     
     If you would like to try the ACS ON-LINE CONFERENCING SYSTEM for
     yourself, simply log in to the TYMCOM-370 System 40.  At the CMS
     prompt, C>, type CONFER ACSTECH, and you will be prompted for in-
     formation to validate yourself as a conference user.  When the system
     displays its prompt (a number followed by >), type MENU to display the
     main menu.  To leave the system, return to the main menu (press Return
     several times if all else fails), and type LOG.
     
     FREE SCREEN PAINTER FOR PC/FOCUS . . . .
     
     Internal users and customers who originally purchased EMS (extended
     enhancement and maintenance service contract) with PC/FOCUS can now
     receive Screen Painters at no additional charge.
     
     Contact IBI's Kevin Quinn at (212)736-4433 to receive your copy.  You
     will need to supply him with your activator diskette serial number.
     With Screen Painter, PC/FOCUS users may create FIDEL screens in a
     full-screen editing environment by drawing the screen as it will
     appear when executed as a FIDEL procedure.
     
     EMS RENEWAL TIME IS HERE! . . . .
     
     EMS (PC/FOCUS Extended Enhancement & Maintenance Service Contract)
     renewal registration cards will be sent this month to all PC/FOCUS
     users who originally purchased EMS with the software.
     
     ACS strongly recommends that all PC/FOCUS users renew their EMS
     contracts, which provides another year's worth of upgrades and
     enhancements (one of which, Release 2.0, is targeted by IBI for
     release sometime in the spring of 1986).

         . . . . ACS FEATURED AT ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS SYMPOSIUM . . .
     
     During the third week of September, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
     (AEC) held their First Annual Technical Symposium at the Infomart in
     Dallas, Texas.  Major vendors to the Corps were invited to participate
     in the week-long expo and to make presentations on their current
     contracts with the Corps. More than 600 people attended the Symposium,
     which was organized and coordinated by Maj. General N.G. Delbridge.
     
     The ACS Federal Programs organization and AEC joined forces to provide
     a presentation of McDonnell Douglas's products and expertise.  ACS
     demonstrations included OnTyme, OnTyme Connection, Binary File
     Transfer, X.PC, PAX, and other products and services.  AEC put
     together a slide and tape show depicting their products, such as
     BDS/GDS.
     
     Overall, the Symposium gave ACS the opportunity to obtain a better
     understanding of the Army Corps and an ever-important platform to
     discuss ACS's wares in a highly fertile marketplace.
     
     Special thanks to ACS staff Ben Russell, Dave Lyle, and Charlie Davis
     for their efforts at the Symposium.  For more information on ACS's
     work with AEC, call Russ Service at (703)556-7932 or send an OnTyme to
     ACS.GOVMAIL.

              CHICAGO DIVERSIFIED CLOSES IDEAL ONTYME APPLICATION
     
     Rob McLaughlin's  recent close  of Cotter  and Company,  franchiser of
     True Value hardware stores, "points out again that franchise or retail
     operations are  excellent candidates  for ACS  services,"  says  Nancy
     Browning, ACS  Business Development  Manager.   "It's an  ideal OnTyme
     application and  adds to the list of ACS solutions to similar business
     needs--existing  applications   like   ComputerLand,   Florafax,   and
     Hallmark."
     
     Cotter was  confronted with the need to pass time-critical pricing and
     promotional information  to retail  stores.   In the ACS solution, all
     input at corporate is performed off line on a PC.  The PC is connected
     with OnTyme,  and the  information is  distributed  instantly  to  the
     various retail stores.  Store personnel use portable TI 707 terminals,
     logging in with one-button access, to receive the information.
     
     Cotter had  had an  entirely manual  system and  a staff  of telephone
     operators who  gave out  pricing information  on retail  items as  the
     various stores  phoned in  throughout the  day.   With the ACS system,
     Cotter  expects  the  number  of  requests  for  standard  pricing  to
     decrease, so  their operators can spend more time dealing with special
     requests.   This situation  should provide Cotter a distinct marketing
     advantage over their competition.
     
     About 200 stores will be accessing the system during the pilot, though
     potentially 1000  or more  stores could subscribe to the service.  The
     individual stores  are so  excited about  the new system that they are
     paying for the service themselves, further reducing corporate overhead
     expenses.
     
     ACS Central Region consultant Bruce Keating is opportunity manager for
     the Cotter  system.  Al Herbach and Steve Feldman were instrumental in
     the close and implementation of the system.
     
     
                     DYNATAX BECOMES TYM/COMM'S LATEST USER
     
     Acquiring Tym/COMM  through a site license agreement is cost effective
     for ACS  customers requiring  large volumes of the software.  Dynatax,
     McDonnell  Douglas'  computerized  tax  processing  service,  recently
     purchased Tym/COMM  in just  that manner.   Dynatax  plans  to  bundle
     Tym/COMM with  its tax  processing software and make it transparent to
     Dynatax users.
     
     Tym/COMM is  ACS's general  purpose communications package for IBM PCs
     (and a few compatibles) that provides
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     * terminal emulation (DEC VT100, DEC VT52, HP 2621)
     * full file transfer to IBM mainframes
     
     For more  information on  site licenses  and other  Tym/COMM  pricing,
     contact Rose Hayden at ACS.R/HAYDEN.
     
     REMINDER:  Tym/COMM's X.PC (single channel support to eliminate errors
     during data  transmission from PC to TYMNET node) will be available by
     the end of the first quarter.

                            ORDERXCHANGE DEVELOPMENT
     
     The prototype  OrderXchange system  will be completed by January 24th,
     with system  testing and resource benchmarking completed by the end of
     the month.   ACS  is talking with two potential beta site prospects at
     this time.
     
     The OrderXchange  demonstration diskette  will be available by the end
     of February.  The demo does not require a modem, and it helps the user
     "page  through"  OrderXchange  menus,  which  illustrate  many  system
     features (by  pressing a  key).   The diskette, designed to run on any
     DOS-compatible  PC,   illustrates  order  entry  of  office  supplies.
     Subsequent demos  will illustrate  order entry  of computer  hardware,
     electronic  components,   pharmaceuticals,   automobile   parts,   and
     petroleum products.   Demos featuring a particular product will enable
     sales reps  to customize  sales presentations.    Recommendations  for
     other types  of products  used in  demo disks are now being solicited.
     Contact ACS.K/FARLEY if you have any suggestions.

     ** OrderX.Overview--for an overview of the system (4 pages)
     ** OrderX.Brochure--for the text of the OrderXchange brochure (4

     4800 baud  High Speed  Access replacement (accessed via a WATS line in
     California).

     ACS.L/EDWARDS, or Gary Masters at 408-446-7079 or ACS.G/MASTERS.
     
     
           CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER: THE CUSTOMER'S PERCEPTION OF ACS
     
     Remember the  last time  you took  your TV  set in  for repairs?   The
     service center  had to  send it  back to the manufacturer, and no, you
     couldn't have  a loner;  and you  vowed never to buy that brand again.
     Quite often,  your perception  of a company is most often based on the
     service you  receive on  the company's  product:   poor service,  poor
     company.
     
     After ACS  business is  sold, our reputation is upheld by the Customer
     Service Center  (CSC).  Their knowledge of product tools is extensive,
     but product  tools  are  not  really  our  market.    Rather,  as  the
     integrated system  grows in  demand,  the  demand  for  product  tools
     adapted for those systems will also grow.  The CSC can't support these
     application-specific sales,  though,  unless  you  provide  them  with
     application-specific information.
     
     The CSC suggests these easily implemented thoughts to help them better
     support your sales effort.
     
     * put CSC.HOTLINE on your OnTyme distribution list
     * pretend that CSC is part of your customer; provide CSC with the same
       information you provide the customer
     * even though it's thought of as post-sales support, that support is
       difficult unless CSC is thought of during pre-sales development
     
     
                              ACS NAMES AD AGENCY
     
     J. Walter  Thompson Agency, L.A., has been selected as the advertising
     agency for ACS.
     
     Look for  ACS ads to appear in various national magazines during 1Q86.
     Through a  coordinated advertising  and public relations campaign, ACS
     will broaden its exposure and provide the sales force with some needed
     company name recognition.
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                           FROM THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR
     
                           TAKE A FRESH LOOK IN 1986
     
     1985 was  a great year for the Applied Communications Systems Company.
     1986 promises  to be  even better.   I  see each  new year  as a fresh
     beginning, as a time to take a fresh look at the business we are in.
     
     This is  how the new year stacks up for ACS.  The hottest market today
     is data  movement.  Recent surveys of DP/MIS managers rate it as their
     number one  problem.   ACS's business  is data movement, so the DP/MIS
     manager's problems are your opportunity to provide an ACS solution.
     
     I want  to leave  you with  just a  few  quotes  from  industry  trade
     journals that  indicate just  how big  those opportunities  are.   The
     opportunities are  fresh.   Stay fresh  in your  approach.   Happy New
     Year--and happy prospecting in 1986!
     
     "We expect  generic VAN services (TYMNET) to grow from $310 million in

     VS3780
     
     Effective January  1,  all  VS3780  customers  will  receive  invoices
     reflective of  their use  of the  service.   For any  of a  number  of
     reasons, some  customers were  not billed  during 1985,  and might now
     believe the service to be free.
