          This document is  intended for distribution to NETVAL  users.  It is
          organized in four major sections.

          The first section  contains an overview of NETVAL,  a description of
          the login process, and a description  of the Controlling User Direc-
          tory (CUD) entries.

          The second section contains the user commands.  Included are Account
          Supervisor commands,  Administrative commands,  and Programmer  com-
          mands.

          The third  section contains  a description of  the procedures  for a
          user to change his password.

          The fourth section contains NETVAL error messages.

          NETVAL User's Guide                                    April 9, 1982



          SECTION 1.0 USER INTERFACE - PROGRAM OVERVIEW          _____________________________________________

          NETVAL runs in an  ISIS job slot on a TYMNET Engine.   It is used to
          validate users, and to control their  access in the network.  NETVAL
          is an enhanced version of the ISIS Validation Program (VAL), in that
          it provides for multiple logins.  It allows users to update the Con-
          trolling User Directory (CUD) on disk.   It also has instructions to
          back up the CUD to magnetic tape,  and to restore the CUD from tape.
          If there  is more than one  Supervisor in a network,  all Supervisor
          systems will have a copy of the  CUD, called a Master User Directory
          (MUD).  NETVAL will  record all changes made  to the CUD on  a file,
          and update the MUDs from this file.

          NETVAL provides an  optional facility for users to  change their own
          passwords.  Also,  for networks  installed with  the optional  class
          information, NETVAL will provide commands to create and update class
          and group tables  on the disk, and will periodically  update all the
          Supervisors with the latest class and group table.


          SECTION 1.1 Login          _________________

          NETVAL may be accessed with  Programmer level, Administrative level,
          or Account Supervisor level usernames.   Users with Account Supervi-
          sor status  have license to create,  modify, or delete  usernames in
          their global account  (GAN).  Users with Administrative  status have
          additional license to create as  many Account Supervisor level users
          as are  required.  In  addition, they  can control  groups, classes,
          hostlists, and nodelists for users in  the network.  Users with Pro-
          grammer status  have additional  license to manage  the CUD  and the
          MUD.

          Users with Account  Supervisor status are assigned  individual user-
          names.  NETADMIN  is the Administrative  level username;  NETPRIV is
          the Programmer level username.   To log into NETVAL  at the Adminis-
          trative or Programmer level, the user should enter:

                                   NETADMIN;password

                                           or

                                    NETPRIV;password

          When a user is  successfully logged into NETVAL,  the following mes-
          sage will be output:

                      ISIS Network Validation System -- Version 1

          Multiple users may be logged into  the NETADMIN username at the same
          time.  Note that only one user may  be logged into the NETPRIV user-
          name at any one time.  If a second user tries to log in, the follow-
          ing message will be output and the circuit will be zapped:

                               NETPRIV IS ALREADY ENTERED

          SECTION 1.2 CUD Entries          _______________________

          CUD entries include the following information.  Optional CUD entries
          will be included  unless NETVAL has been specifically  set to ignore
          options.  The Home System and Class Information options are mutually
          exclusive, and the choice between these  two options must be made at
          system generation.  The account representative  must be contacted to
          have any of the options changed.  A CUD entry may consist of:

          1. username
             A username may be up  to 20 alphanumeric characters.  Semicolons,
             colons, and all control characters  are not acceptable characters
             for usernames.

          2. PASSWORD CIPHER
             The password cipher  is  computed  from  a  password   of  up  to
             30  characters.  Any  ASCII  character  other than  a  semicolon,
             Escape, or carriage return may be  used within a password.  Pass-
             words must be entered twice for  verification, and are not echoed
             back to the terminal.

          3. PASSWORD CHANGE DATE
             The change date is the date that the password was last changed.

          4. GLOBAL ACCOUNT NUMBER (GAN) - OPTIONAL
             The GAN is an  octal number in the range 0  - 37777777777, and is
             used to group users together under a single account supervisor.

          5. UNIVERSAL USER NUMBER (UUN)
             The UUN is an octal number in  the range 0 - 37777777777 assigned
             by NETVAL.  It is  unique for each user.

          6. CONTROL INFORMATION:

             IGNORE COLON OPTION (OPTIONAL)
             If the ignore colon option is set, the user may only log into his
             home system(s). (The  user must be assigned to at  least one home
             host.)

             LOGIN OVER SHUT (OPTIONAL)
             Login over shut allows users to access a host even if it is shut.

             NO PASSWORD (OPTIONAL)
             If the no password option is set, users are not required to input
             a password  when they log  in.  The user may  only log in  to his
             home system. (This option forces the ignore colon option.)

             TRANSPARENT GATEWAY LOGON (OPTIONAL)
             If the  transparent gateway login option  is set, the  user login
             will  take him  through a  gateway into  another network.   (This
             option forces the ignore colon option.)

          7. DISTRICT (OPTIONAL)
             The district is  a decimal number in  the range 0 -  4095, and is
             another way to group users together.

          8. IRC (OPTIONAL)
             The International  Record Carrier is  a decimal number  between 0
             and 13.  IRC tables  must be present for any nonzero  value to be
             significant.  The IRC  tables designate unique numbers  that have
             been assigned to IRC links.  The CUD entry may be used to limit a
             user's circuit building capability to links of a specified IRC.

          Note:  The  next two options are  mutually exclusive and  are chosen
          when NETVAL is installed in the network.  The instructions for class
          information will only work if that option was chosen.

          9. HOME SYSTEM (OPTIONAL) The CUD must  include either class defini-
             tions or  home systems.  Home systems  entries in the CUD  do not
             restrict user access.

          10. CLASS INFORMATION (OPTIONAL)

             The class  information option may be  used to establish  a closed
             user group within  the network.  A closed user group  is a unique
             segment of  the total  user population.  The  closed group  has a
             greater set of restrictions than the general category of users.

             CLASS
             The class for  a user represents the  set of hosts or  nodes from
             which the user may access the network.  Each class is followed by
             up to  6 groups or hosts  describing which destinations  the user
             may access.  Each  class must have either  a home host or  a home
             group defined.  Class 0 is the universal class.

             GROUP
             A group represents a set of  destination host numbers that a user
             may access.  A  "negative" group represents a  set of destination
             host numbers that a user may not  access.  Group 0 is the univer-
             sal group.   Note that  group 0  and negative  groups may  not be
             specified as a home.

             HOST
             A host number is an addressable entity in the network.

          SECTION 1.3 Format and Syntax          _____________________________

          This section contains a description of  the format for using NETVAL.
          It also includes a general description of command syntax.


          1.3.1 Format                ______

          NETVAL issues an asterisk,  "*", to prompt the user to  enter a com-
          mand.  After a command has been entered, NETVAL will prompt the user
          for parameters.  The prompts may be  questions or requests for data,
          and all require some form of response.  Questions may be answered by
          entering the first letter of the word.   For example, a yes/no ques-
          tion may be answered by entering "y" or "n".

          A "?" response to  any question or prompt for a  numeric value  will
          cause the   program  to   return  to   the  command   dispatcher.  A
          "Control A" may be used to delete the last character typed.  A "Con-
          trol W" may  be used to delete  the last word typed.   A "Control Q"
          may be used to delete the current line being typed.

          On two word commands, such as "CHANGE" or "TYPE", if the second word
          is not  entered,  NETVAL  will  output   the  options  to  the user.
          For example, if the user types "NEW <CR>", NETVAL will output:

                    USER, OR CLASS:

          The user only needs to input "USER"  or "CLASS"  to  continue execu-
          tion of this command.

          On commands  that change the CUD,  after  all  the   information  is
          entered, the program prompts:

                    ALL ENTRIES CORRECT?

          If all the entered  information is as it should be,  the user should
          answer "Y" and the command will be carried out.  NETVAL will output:

                    ENTRY COMPLETED

          when the operation has been successfully completed.  If some entered
          information is in  error, answer "N" and the program  will return to
          the command dispatcher to allow the user to reenter the command.

          1.3.2 Syntax                ______

          The following notation  is used to describe  the syntax of  the com-
          mands:

          uppercase           Letters  or words  are entered  exactly as  they
                              appear in the syntax description.

          lowercase           Letters are optional entries as NETVAL will rec-
                              ognize  commands abbreviated  to their  shortest
                              unique  length.   For  le,   CHEck  may  be
                              entered as  CHE, CHAnge may  be entered  as CHA,

          SECTION 2.0 USER COMMANDS          _________________________

          This section  contains the NETVAL  commands.  They are  divided into
          three logical  groups: Account  Supervisor commands,  Administrative
          commands, and Programmer commands.   Account Supervisor commands are
          the least restricted group of commands, and may be executed by users
          with  Account  Supervisor,  Administrative,  or  Programmer  status.
          Administrative  commands  are  more  restricted,  and  may  only  be
          executed by users  with Administrative status or  Programmer status.
          Programmer  commands  are  the  most restricted,  and  may  only  be
          executed by users with Programmer status.

          Each  command section  includes the  syntax, a  description, and  an
          example of  the output generated by  the command.  In  the examples,
          system prompts appear in upper case.  User responses appear in lower
          case.  Comments regarding the examples appear in parentheses.

          Note: A system response that does not match the system prompt in the
          example may  be a NETVAL  error message  (see Section 4.0).   If the
          response is not an error message, it may be a system error.  In this
          case, contact your account representative.

          SECTION 2.1 Account Supervisor Commands          _______________________________________

          This section contains  the Account Supervisor commands.   Users with
          Account Supervisor, Administrative, and Programmer  status may exec-
          ute these commands.  Note that an  Account Supervisor may only vali-
          date or modify usernames in his own account.  Users with Administra-
          tive or Programmer level status may  validate or modify usernames in
          any account in the network.

          2.1.3 New User Command                ________________

          Syntax:  New User

          Description:  The New User command enters  a brand new name into the
               CUD.  The user must first decide whether the new name should be
               validated in  a global account  that  already  exists,   or  if
               the  name  should   be validated  in a new  global account.  If
               the name is to be validated in  an old global account, the user
               will be  prompted for a  user   name that  already   exists  in
               that  account.   The  user will  then be prompted for username,
               control information,  password (twice,  not  echoed), district,
               IRC, and class  or home information (depending  on which NETVAL
               option was chosen).

               The new name is  assigned  the   next  sequential  UUN  availa-
               ble.  UUN's  are  not reused, even  after a username is invali-
               dated.  If the new name is  validated in an old global account,
               it  will   be  assigned  the  same   GAN  as   the  name   that
               already  exists  in that account.   Otherwise, the next sequen-
               tial GAN will be assigned to the user.

          Example:

               * new user

               DOES THIS USER BELONG TO A NEW ACCOUNT? n (only asked when
               ENTER VALID USER IN ACCOUNT: user6         NETADMIN or NETPRIV

               ILLEGAL CHARACTER ENTERED, TRY AGAIN: abc123
               LOGIN OVER SHUT? n
               PASSWORD REQUIRED? y            (if "N", user is not prompted

          2.2.27 Send Table Command                 __________________

          Syntax:  SENd table

          Description:   The Send  Table command  builds the  class and  group
               table from the files  which are on disk and sends  the table to
               the  Supervisors.  If  the class  and  group Tables  are to  be
               sorted, the list of nodes defining each class will be sorted in
               ascending  order.  If  a class  is  defined by  both hosts  and
               nodes, the hosts will be sorted first. The list of hosts defin-
               ing each group will be sorted in ascending order.

          Example:

               * send table

               ARE THE CLASS AND GROUP TABLES TO SORTED? n

          SECTION 2.3 Programmer Commands          _______________________________

          This section contains the Programmer commands.  Only users with Pro-
          grammer status may use these commands.


          2.3.1 Get Command                ___________

          Syntax:  Get

          Description:  The  Get command  types the  CUD block  number that  a
               username hashes   into.   The   user must  enter the  username.
               The system will return a block number.

          Example:

               * get

               USERNAME:user4

               BLOCK NUMBER: 400  (username user4 is in block 400 in CUD)

          2.3.2 Reset Command                _____________

          Syntax:  RESet

          Description:  The  Reset command  causes the  checksums on  each CUD
               block to be recalculated, and CUD blocks to be rewritten to the
               disk.

               Note:  This  is a  time consuming action  since the  entire CUD
               must be scanned.

          Example:

               * reset

               CUD CHECKSUMS HAVE BEEN RESET

               *

          Syntax:  List Cud

          Description:  The List Cud command lists an entire CUD block in hex-
               adecimal code.  The operator  must already have  read in  a CUD
               block (see Section 2.3.4).

          Example:

               * list cud

               BYTE                         CUD

          2.3.5 Type CUD Command                ________________

          Syntax:  Type Cud

          Description:  The Type CUD command types out the CUD block just read
               by  the Read   CUD  command.  The  information  that is  output
               includes  username, GAN,  UUN,  control information,  district,
               IRC,  password change date, and  home  or class information.  A
               word index, which is the user's starting location in the block,
               is also included.

          Example:

          * type cud

          USERNAME                GAN  UUN  CNTRL    DIST IRC PSW DATE INDEX

          user5                    1    3   NOPW  TG  3    1  06/08/82   1

          2.3.6 Write CUD Command                _________________

          Syntax: Write Cud

          Description:  The  Write CUD  command is used  to overwrite  the CUD
               block on disk with the buffer  information. This is a dangerous
               command, and must be executed very carefully.

          Example:

               * write cud

               ARE YOU SURE? y

               BLOCK WRITTEN TO CUD

          2.3.7 Change CUD Command                __________________

          Syntax:  CHange Cud

          Description:  The Change CUD command changes the hexadecimal code of
               selected words  of a CUD  block in  the buffer which  has  been
               read by  the operator.  The Write  CUD command must be  used to
               write the CUD to disk (see Section 2.3.6).

          Example:

               * change cud

               BYTE OFFSET: 0004

          Syntax:  REAd Mud

          Description:  The Read MUD command allows the user to read any block
               of a MUD.   The  operator  must  input the block number and the
               sup number.  NETVAL will build a circuit through the network if
               necessary and retrieve the information desired by the operator.

          Example:

               * read mud

               BLOCK NUMBER:  1668

               ENTER SUP NUMBER:  123

               block.  The operator   must  have  already  read   in  the  CUD
               and MUD blocks  to be compared (see Sections  2.3.4 and 2.3.8).
               NETVAL will  output all  words that  are different  in the  two
               blocks.  It  will output "NO DIFFERENCES"  if all words  are in
               the CUD and MUD blocks match.

          SECTION 3.0 USER PASSWORD CHANGING          __________________________________

          NETVAL may be configured to permit any user with the colon option to
          change his own  password.  To log into NETVAL for  this purpose, the
          user should  enter his username followed  by a colon and  the change
          password host  number (a configuration  parameter), and  a semicolon
          followed by his current password.

          Example:

               user2:82;password

          NETVAL will then inquire if the  user wishes to change his password.
          If so, NETVAL  will request the password twice.  When  the change is
          complete, the user will be logged off.

          Example:

               DO YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD? y

               PASSWORD:
               ENTER IT AGAIN:
