LOGON %2(106)   Post LOGIN initialization program   24-Mar-86

LOGON is a user INIT program which allows an individual user to tailor the
working environment to his or her requirements or preferences.  This
extremely powerful program saves the user from needlessly retyping various
setup commands by reading them from the user's profile file DSK:SWITCH.INI
located on the users logged-in directory.

     LOGON is normally run automatically after LOGINN as the user's "INIT"
file.  LOGON may also be run at any time by typing "R LOGON" to reset any
settings that you may have changed from their initial settings.  One time
it may be important to reset these settings is just after you reattach to
another terminal.

For more information on the options file "SWITCH.INI" type "HELP SWITCH".

Switches	Meanings
--------	--------
/CLEAR		Clears your CRT screen if the type is known.

/HP2621		Set tab stops on an HP-2621 (TYM-444) terminal

/INFO:list

/NOTIFY:list	Controls the type of messages that are output by LOGON.
		The list may either be a single argument or a list of
		arguments enclosed in parenthesis and separated by
		commas.  (i.e.  "(WARN,TELL,NOFATAL)").  The default
		setting is /NOTIFY:NONE, but this may be changed at any
		time between LOGON switches.  Arguments may be preceded
		by "NO" to turn off a specific condition.  The legal
		values for /NOTIFY are:

	SET	Output message for any /SET switches
	TELL	Output any /TELL switch messages
	RUN	Output message when running a program
	FATAL	Output any fatal messages
	WARN	Output any warning messages
	INFO	Output system info messages
	HELP	Output a help message (not very useful)
	USER	Output message for any /USERS switches
	NONE	Don't output any messages
	ALL	Output all types of messages

/SELECT:option:<condition>
		If the given condition is true, the given option is
		processed after the current section of switches is
		complete.  An option in SWITCH.INI takes the form
		"LOGON:option/switches".  Only the first option related
		to a true condition in a SELECT switch is used and
		others that may match afterwards are ignored.  The
		following are the conditions that may be used:

    ALWAYS	Always perform this option
    AUX		Perform this option if logged in on an AUX circuit
      NOAUX	Perform this option if NOT logged in on an AUX circuit
    CCL		Perform this option if LOGON was run at it's CCL entry
      NOCCL	Perform this option if LOGON was not run at it's CCL entry
    DET		Perform this option if the job is detache

    KS10	Perform this option if CPU is a DEC KS-10 processor
    NODE:nn-ppp	Perform this option if on node nn port ppp (if port is
		omitted, then perform option if on any port on this node)
    SYSTEM:sss	Perform this option if on system sss (the system number
		may be specified with or without a prefix charcter).
    SYSNO:sss	Same as /SELECT:option:SYSTEM:sss


/SET:TTY args	Will set a particular TTY function.  A [NO] indicates an
    or		optional NO argument (i.e.  TTY [NO] PAGE can be either
/TTY:args	TTY PAGE or TTY NO PAGE).  The functions are as follows:
