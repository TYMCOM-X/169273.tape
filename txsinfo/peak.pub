PEAK filename
.description
An existing or a new file is opened and modified.  A screenful of text,
along with 2 status lines, are displayed.
Special character combinations including
control characters and "META" characters (on most terminals, ESC followed by
the character), and named functions are used to do PEAK's work.  This
includes: moving the cursor; 
changing the portion of the file viewed; inserting, deleting,
moving or copying text;
searching for a text string; replacing occurrances of
a text string with another; and many other editing functions.

The following is a very brief introduction to PEAK capabilities.

      BASIC CURSOR MOVEMENT, ON SCREEN AND IN FILE
      --------------------------------------------

			  ESC <    [top of file]
			   |
			  ESC V    [View previous screen]
			   |
			  ESC ,    [top of screen]
			   |
			   ^Z      [scroll window up one line] 
			   |
			   ^P      [Previous line]
			   |
			   _
  ^A --- ESC B --- ^B --- |_| --- ^F --- ESC F --- ^E
  [3]    [2]      [1]             [1]    [2]      [3]
			   |
			   ^N      [Next line]
			   |
			  ESC Z    [scroll window down one line]
			   |
			  ESC .    [bottom of screen]
			   |
			   ^V      [View next screen]
			   |
			  ESC >    [bottom of file]


			where:	[1] = back/fwd 1 char.
				[2] = back/fwd 1 token
				[3] = start/end of line



		   VERY BASIC USE OF PEAK
		   ----------------------

To exit PEAK

    ^X ^F         Write files and exit (normal exit) 
    ^X ^C         Abort editing session and Exit

Inserting

    All normally printing characters insert themselves 
    when typed. This includes RETURN and TAB.  To insert a
    control character you must "quote" it with ^Q.

    ^Q            Insert as text the next character 
		  entered from the terminal.

Deleting

    ^D            Delete current character
    ^H            delete previous character
    <del>/<BS>    Delete previous character
    ESC D         Delete following token
    ESC H         delete previous token
    ^K            Kill line completely
    ESC K         Kill text to end of line
    ^W            Wipe:  kill to a mark
    ^Y            Yank:  recover killed text
