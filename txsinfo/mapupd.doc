		     FILES:  "NODPRI" AND "PRIADR"



Every month run (SYSMAINT)MHX for PDP-10's to check on files (SPOOL)
NODPRI and (SPOOL)PRIADR.  In MHX, run a DIR <filids>/WORDS and CKSUM on
both these files.  Determine, from the output of this, if there are any
differences among these files on the PDP-10's, and which is the most
current and common version of these files.

Compare the contents of one of these sets of common files (using with
the contents of the "master" files maintained by SRA on host 8 (see 1.,
below).  When the node numbers of any nodes assigned to any printer
differ in the output from any of the PDP-10's, but this part of the
output of at least one of the PDP-10's is the same as in the output from
host 8, the NODPRI file of that PDP-10 is to be copied around to all the
PDP-10's (see 2., below).  When all the NODPRI files differ from the
"master" NODPRI file (host 8), telecopy the master NODPRI file from host
8 to SPPOPER:36 and clean it up for the Tymcom-X's (see 3., below).
This is the NODPRI file to be checked (see 1., below) and if good to be
copied around to all the PDP-10's (see 2., below).

When the parts of the output of SPNODE from any of the PDP-10's
containing the street address or phone number of the printers differs
from the others, but this part of the output of at least one of the
PDP-10's is the same as in the output of host 8, the PRIADR file of that
PDP-10 is to be copied around to all the PDP-10's (see 2., below).  When
all the PRIADR files differ from the "master" PRIADR file (host 8), the
PRIADR file on host 36 must be edited with FET (see 4., below) and
copied around to all the PDP-10's (see 2., below).



1.)  COMPARING THE CONTENTS OF THE 'MASTER' FILES WITH THE CONTENTS OF
     FILES ON THE PDP-10:

     The comparison is done by getting a listing of the combined
     information in a format that can be compared between the PDP-10 and
     host 8 (a 940), and comparing the listings with the DIFFER command:

	a.)  Log in to host 8 and get the printer map listing of the
	     contents of its data files:

	     Log-in to host 8 and set license, with following commands
	     (user input is response to prompts, shown in upper-case or
	     enclosed in angle brackets):

		please log in:  SPPOPER:8;<password>; <cr>
		-SETE 3,2 <cr>
		-<oper password> <cr>

	     Run program to get listing of printer map info on SPOOL
	     master host 8, give command to get info listing, provide
	     output filename, and exit program, with following commands
	     (user input is response to prompts, shown in upper case):

		-1PNUPD <cr>
		+PPA <cr>
		output file:  SPNODE.8 <cr>
		+Q <cr>

	     TELECOPY output file to SPPOPER on the PDP-10 and log off
	     host 8, with following commands (variable input is shown in
	     braces):

		-TELECOPY <cr>
		:(SPPOPER)SPNODE.8,:{PDP-10 host no.} <cr>
		:Q <cr>
		-EXIT

	b.)  Log in to the PDP-10 with the copy of the printer map
	     listing file from host 8, and get the printer map listing
	     from its data files:

	     Log-in to SPPOPER on the PDP-10, and set RF license;

	     Run program to get listing of printer map info, provide
	     output filename and exit program, with following commands:

		.R(SPPOPER)SPNODE<cr>
		output file name:  SPNODE.PDP <cr>
		.Q <cr>
	     
	c.)  Compare the two printer map listing files, with the DIFFER
	     command.  If different, at least one of the files on the
	     PDP-10 host is not correct.  If the difference is in the
	     node assignments, the error is in the NODPRI file.  If the
	     difference is in a printer's street address or telephone
	     number, the error is in the PRIADR file.  The format of the
	     DIFFER command to use is as follows (output will be to the
	     terminal):

		.DIFF T = SPNODE.8, SPNODE.PDP <cr>



2.)  COPYING THE 'NODPRI' AND/OR 'PRIADR' FILES TO MULTIPLE TYMCOM-X
     HOSTS:

     This telecopying is done with the (SPL)COPY utility program.

	a.)  Log in to the host with the file to be copied around.

	b.)  Set Write File and Auxiliary Circuit licenses and GFD to
	     the SPOOL directory, with the following comands:

		.O WF AC <cr>
		SYSMAINT <cr>

		.<oper password> <cr>
		.GFD SPOOL <cr>

	c.)  Run the (SPL)COPY program with the following commands (user
	     input is response to prompts, shown in upper-case; options
	     are enclosed in braces):

		.R (SPL) COPY <cr>
		File(s):  {NODPRI} {PRIADR}
		copy to user name:  SPOOL <cr>
		[logged in to SPOOL]
		Copy to system(s) (or <cr> for all):  {sys. nos.} <cr>
		Superceed existing files?  Y <cr>
		[telecopy started in frame nn]

	     If a <cr> is the response to the request for system
	     numbers, the program will list all system numbers before
	     asking about superceding existing files.

	d.)  Check results of the (SPL)COPY run by examining the file
	     (SPOOL)nnTEL.OUT (where nn = the frame number returned by
	     (SPL)COPY).  If (SPL)COPY is done the file exists.  The
	     file will contain the results of the various TELECOpy
	     commands given by (SPL)COPY, indicating whether all
	     attempts to copy the file around were successful.  Re-copy
	     the files to any hosts which did not successfully receive
	     them.



3.)  TELECOPYING THE 'NODPRI' FILE FROM 'SPPOPER:8' TO 'SPPOPER:36' AND
     RE-FORMATTING IT FOR THE PDP-10'S: 

	a.)  Log-in to SPPOPER:8 and set license (see above);

	b.)  Copy file (SPOOL)NODPRI to SPPOPER with the following
	     commands (user input is response to prompts, shown in
	     upper-case):

		-COPY <cr>
		from:  (SPOOL)NODPRI <cr>
		to:  NODPRI <cr>

	c.)  Telecopy NODPRI to SPPOPER:36 and log off host 8 with the
	     following commands:  

		-TELECOPY <cr>
		:MODE REC BIN FILL=RIGHT <cr>
		:MODE TRANS BIN FILL=RIGHT <cr>
		:(SPPOPER)NODPRI,:36 <cr>
		:Q <cr>
		-EXIT <cr>

	d.)  Log in to SPPOPER:36, and reformat NODPRI for the PDP-10
	     with the FIXMAP program, and clean errors with the MAPCLN
	     program, if needed.

	     Run FIXMAP with the following commands (user input is
	     response to prompts, shown in upper-case):

		.RUN FIXMAP <cr>
		. . .
		input file:  NODPRI <cr>
		output file:  NODPRI.OUT <cr>
		. . .

	     If FIXMAP returns error messages indicating that node
	     numbers are bad, run MAPCLN with the following commands:

		.RUN MAPCLN <cr>
 		. . .
		input file:  NODPRI.OUT <cr>
		output file (different filename than input):  NODPRI.FIX <cr>

	     If FIXMAP has returned error messages indicating that
	     NODPRI.OUT has printer location number(s) out of range, fix
	     this using FET.  (Get help.)  Ignore any message from
	     FIXMAP about PJ not complete:  PJ is broken, which is the
	     reason for doing all this.


4.)  CORRECTING DATA IN 'PRIADR' WITH 'FET':

     Some FET and PRIADR basics:

     FET displays computer word numbers in octal, and defaults to two
     half-word octal unsigned integers for displaying word contents and
     entering new values.

     PRIADR holds the printer location number in word number nnn x 100
     (where nnn = the octal number for the decimal printer number); eg.,
     printer 77 <dec.>  (= 115 <oct.>)  is marked with "115" <oct.>, in
     word number 11500.

     PRIADR contains the street address in 6-bit char. format in "lines"
     of 10 computer words each, with 5 of the 6 possible "lines" used
     for the street address.  Each word holds 6 chars.  Each "line" of
     the address & phone number starts at the following computer word
     <oct.> in the file:

		nnn01, nnn13, nnn25, nnn37, and (phone number) nnn51

		(where nnn = the octal representation of the printer
		location number.).

     Reading and correcting 6-bit text with FET is done by setting the
     text mode to 6-bit with command '6;T', and setting the default
     display mode to text with command ';"'.  Replacement text is
     entered by preceding it with a quote (") and following it with a
     control-D.  A computer word is closed with an input-closing
     character:  <cr> to simply finish input, <lf> to finish input and
     open next word, or up-arrow (^) to finish input and open previous
     word.

     The initial word opened by FET is chosen with the word number in
     octal, followed by a slash.  the word's contents are displayed in
     the current mode, and FET waits for replacement to be input.  No
     input (just the input-closing char.)  leaves the current contents
     undisturbed.  Use of the <lf> or up-arrow as input-closing char.
     closes the opened word, and displays and opens for change the
     following or preceding word.  If any word has been opened, it must
     be closed before another command can be given to FET.

     The file is closed and FET exited with the command <;G>.


     Procedure:  make a copy of PRIADR in SPPOPER, correct it and
     replace the old version in SPOOL with the corrected file:

	a.)  Get a version of PRIADR into FET, for updating:

	     Log in to SPPOPER:36 and set RF & WF license;

	     Copy (SPOOL)PRIADR to (SPPOPER)PRIADR.NEW;

	     Run FET and load PRIADR.NEW into it with following commands:

		R FET <cr>
		;U    PRIADR.NEW <cr>	(FET auto. inserts blanks after ";U")
		6;T			(sets all text I/O as 6-bit))
		;"			(sets display mode as TEXT);

	b.)  Insert the correct street address:

	     Determine the octal equivalent of the decimal printer
	     location number with the street address to be changed;

	     Determine the computer word number for the first word of
	     the first line of the street address (see list above), then
	     open and correct the first word (6 chars) of the line, with
	     the following command:

		nnn01/ <old 6 chars>   "<new 6 chars> ^D ^J
		     (where:  nnn = oct. version of dec. printer no., 
			    <old 6 chars> = displayed by FET, 
			    <new 6 chars> = input by user, 
			    ^D = control-D, displayed by FET as ", 
			    ^J = <lf>:   closes the word and opens
				 (displays) the next word for change.);

	     Correct each word of the line, inserting blanks to replace
	     old text if the old line is longer than the new.  When the
	     line is finished close the word with <cr.>  rather than
	     <lf>, then open the first word of the next line with its
	     word number and a slash, and correct that line, as needed.

	c.)  When correction of the street address for one printer
	     location is finished, examine the complete address entered
	     with the following command to FET (this command does not
	     leave any words open for change):

		nnn01,nnn77/

		    (where nnn = octal ver. of decimal printer number).

	d.)  When all street addresses have been updated, exit FET, then
	     replace (SPOOL)PRIADR with the newly created (SPPOPER)
	     PRIADR.NEW, with the following commands:

		;G
		.DEL PRIADR <cr>
		.REN PRIADR.NEW, (SPOOL)PRIADR <cr>
