	    The process of moving the system to the new RPO6 disk drives
      is essentially one of copying everything to tape, installation of
      the new drives (including testing them and formatting them, and
      defining the number of them to the monitor and refreshing them),
      then copying everything from tape to the new disks.  The software
      -- including the Tymcom-XX Monitor -- is flexible enough to run
      with either of the DEC disk drives without any specification of
      drive type.


	    The details of the process are as follows:



	    1.)  WRITE TITO TAPES AND BOOTABLE MONITOR TAPES.

	    You must have two bootable Monitor tapes each with a copy of
      the TITO program, plus two tapes each with a copy of TITO alone.  A
      "bootable Monitor tape" contains the system micro-code, the
      bootstrap (loader) program and the Monitor.  Short tapes are
      adequate.

	    Write the software onto tape as described in Appendix I.

	    It is imperative that you write the stand-alone TITO tape
      twice, plus the Monitor-plus-TITO tape twice, so you have backup
      copies.  You must be certain that the system will boot from each of
      the bootable Monitor tapes.

	    Verify that the system will boot from the tape copies of the
      Monitor by taking the system down (at a time not inconvenient to
      users) with TAKEIT.  Boot the system from each tape and test all
      copies of TITO as outlined in Appendix II.  When completed, unshut
      the system and return it to normal use.

	    Write the tapes and perform the functional test for all tapes
      at least one week prior to the installation of the new disk drives.
      If either tape will not boot the system or if any copy of TITO will
      not work, contact Dennis Coffey immediately!  *


	    2.)  WRITE ALL DISK CONTENTS TO TAPE.

	    Immediately prior to the change-over to the new drives you
      need to re-boot the Monitor from tape, and do an "all-files" backup
      to tape (i.e., you must save to tape every file that is on disk),
      using a tape copy of TITO.  The details of the following procedure
      are outlined in Appendix III.

	    Run TAKEIT to take the system down.  Load the Monitor tape on
      the tape drive and bring the system back up.  Do not unshut the
      system when it is back up.  When the system is up set license and
      do an "all-files" backup using the copy of TITO that is on tape.

      MOVING SYSTEM TO NEW DISK DRIVES                                p 2


	    When the "all-files" save is completed, do a "DIRECTORY" of
      the all-files backup tapes, to verify that all the files are saved
      properly, and are readable by TITO.  The fact that TITO can read
      the copies of the files on tape to write the directory is
      verification.  This verification must be completed before the old
      disk drives are disconnected.



	    3.)  INSTALL AND FORMAT NEW DISKS.

	    When the verification of the all-files save tapes is complete
      the Customer Engineer can remove the old disk drives, install the
      new disk drives, and test the functioning of the new drives on the
      system by exercising the necessary parts of the system with his
      diagnostic software.

v	    The C.E. must format the new disks "program write-enable all
      drives", using the standard DEC utility "KSFORM" or the equivalent.

	    This formatting must be done before you can build the
      Tymcom-XX system.



	    4.)  BOOT SYSTEM FROM TAPE; DEFINE AND REFRESH NEW DISKS.

	    When the installation, testing and formatting of the new disk
      drives is completed, you must boot the system from the copy of the
      Monitor on tape.  You will be defining the number of the disk
      drives to the Monitor, "refreshing" the disks and initially
      bringing the system back to basic functioning with only the
      Monitor.  This procedure and the "final clean-up" procedure are
      detailed in Appendix IV.

	    Mount the bootable monitor tape on the tape drive, and run
      the bootstrap program from the console.  Run the copy of TITO that
      you had saved to the tape, and use it to restore to the new disks
      all the files that had been backed up to tape from the old disks.



	    5.)  FINAL CLEAN-UP.

	    Then run the program KSFEFS, to write the BOOTS program to
      the proper place on disk, so that system can be booted from disk in
      the future.  KSFEFS must be run after the system has been rebuilt
      from tapes if you wish to be able to restore the Monitor from disk.
      (After a crash, for example, restoring from disk is the normal,
      easier process.)

	    When this is completed run the program DSKCLN, to verify that
      the Monitor can at least access every file on disk.

	    When this is completed you have finished the installation of
      the new disk drives, the transfer of all files to the new drives,
      and the initialization of the system to load and run from disk.  To

      verify, take the system down and bring it back up from disk,
      normally.  You are done!
