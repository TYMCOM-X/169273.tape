      NOTE:  This is a preliminary draft of the  Job  Processor  Reference
      Manual.   The  Job  processor  system is in development, continually
      changing.  The manual is also changing,  as  the  Job  Processor  is
      developed and as the documentation for the system develops.

      Please  check  the  documentation  files   regularly   during   this
      developmental   time.   Updates  to  the  documentation  will  occur
      frequently, reflecting new developments  in  the  system,  and  more
      clearly  explaining  the  Job Processor system's features.  Checking
      the documentation files for new  information  is  the  quickest  and
      surest way to get this information.

  1.0  INTRODUCTION



  1.1  Overview


  The TYMCOM-X Job Processing  System  replaces  the  TYMCOM-IX  and  TYMCOM-X
  products PERP, DEFER, PCOM and COM.  The purpose is to provide a system that
  will process command files both instantaneously and repetitively on and  for
  a  single  PDP-10  host  computer.   Like  it's  predecessor,  PERP, the Job
  Processor allows scheduling of a job for execution on a periodic basis.  The
  interval  may be specified in months, weeks, days, hours or minutes starting
  at the date-time of submission or from a specified date-time.

  The system is also capable of directly running programs that do not  require
  interactive  terminal input on their command port.  The terminal output of a
  command file job can be written to a log file.



  1.2  Notational Conventions And Definitions


  A.  Square brackets "[" and "]" are used to enclose  optional  items  or  an
      optional  syntax.  The brackets are not part of the actual Job Processor
      syntax.


  B.  Angle brackets "<" and ">" are used to enclose the names  of  conceptual
      ideas and entities.  These names are given in the examples to illustrate
      the class of information entered.  These brackets are not  part  of  the
      Job Processor syntax.

TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 2
INTRODUCTION


  C.  <cr> means "carriage return".  This is not a conceptual idea or  entity,
      as other words in angle brackets are.


  D.  In the examples in this document, computer output is shown in upper case
      and user input is shown in lower case, as much as possible.


  E.  In the examples used in this document, lines preceeded immediately by  a
      period  (.)  are  usually commands typed to the monitor.  These commands
      work both in PDP10 mode and in XEXEC mode.  PDP10 mode is used  in  this
      document.


  F.  In the examples below, reference to a <file spec>  means  a  file  name,
      optionally  followed  by  a file extension, and optionally preceded by a
      username in parentheses.  Format:

          [(<username>)] <filename>[.<ext>]





  2.0  USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM



  2.1  Job Submission


  A job is submitted to the Job Processor while in monitor mode,  by  entering
  the  command SUBMIT.  In response to the SUBMIT prompt, commands can then be
  entered to do the following:


  A.  Enter  date  and  time  information  and  job  specifications  into  the
      processing queue.


  B.  Print job status information at the user's terminal.


  C.  Modify date and job information for jobs in the processing queue.


  Example of the SUBMIT command:
       .SUBMIT <cr>
       TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR  <version number>  <date>  <time>
       SUBMIT>

  A job can be entered for immediate execution  or  for  scheduled  execution.
  The  scheduled  execution can be a single execution or a regularly repeating
  execution.  All jobs  are  entered  with  the  INSERT  command.   Specifying
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 3
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  execution  date and time for a scheduled job is done with the DATES command.
  An alternative way of entering execution date and time information is as  an
  option  specified  in  response  to the OPTIONS prompt, which is part of the
  INSERT command (see below).  



  2.2  Online Help, And Ending SUBMIT Session


  The HELP command provides online assistance, and the QUIT command  ends  the
  users session in SUBMIT.


  A.  HELP gives a list of user commands and their descriptions.  
      Typing HELP and the name of a user command gives a description  of  that
      command,  in greater detail.  At the OPTIONS prompt, typing HELP gives a
      list of options the user may specify, the values he  may  set  for  each
      option, and the current settings of each option.


  B.  QUIT returns control to the EXEC.
      It would be used after the user has completed entering a  job  into  the
      system,  modifying a job, deleting a job, or obtaining information about
      the status of job(s) in the job queue.





  2.3  Specifying Execution Dates And Times - The DATES Command


  The DATES command tells the Job  Processor  to  accept  the  date  and  time
  specification  for  a  job.   These  specifications  can  be as simple or as
  complex as the user needs for defining the scheduling  of  the  user's  job.
  The  DATES  command can be entered with its date-time specification included
  on the same line as the DATES command, or the DATES command can  be  entered
  on  one  line  and  the  user  will  be  prompted  to  enter  the  date-time
  specification on another line.

  Formats:
      SUBMIT> dates <date-time specification> <cr>
                  or
      SUBMIT> dates <cr> 
      ENTER YOUR DATE-TIME EXPRESSION:
      <date-time specification> <cr>


  The date-time specification is, in its simplest form,  "<date> [AT] <time>".
  For  completeness,  the  user can include the words "OF", "AT", and "THE" in
  the date-time specifications.  However, the Job Processor does  not  require
  these  words.   Any  words  or  punctuation which the Job Processor does not
  understand will be ignored.
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 4
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  The date-time expression ends with a carriage return.  The user can continue
  the  expression  on  more than one line by continuing to type past the right
  edge of the display and allowing the display to wrap to the next line.  This
  wrapping of the line of input is done by either the terminal or the TYMCOM-X
  host.  It affects the user's display only, and  does  not  send  a  carriage
  return to the SUBMIT program.

  Each time a job is run, after the execution is completed the next  execution
  date and time is computed.  If no more executions are to occur, nothing more
  is done.  If there is to be another run of the job, the job is entered  into
  the queue for execution at the new date and time.

  If, when the job is entered into the Job Processor,  the  current  date  and
  time  meet  the  criteria  for  execution  the  job  is run immediately.  If
  execution date and time is not specified the job is run immediately.  

  If an expression specifies a number of months, with no  modifiers,  the  job
  runs on the first day of that month.  If an expression specifies a date, but
  no time, the job runs at midnight (00:00 hours) at the start  of  that  day.
  The names of months and days of the week can be shortened to the first three
  characters.

  When a number is used, it must be typed as digits, not spelled out.  This is
  true  of  cardinal numbers, and ordinal numbers of more than one digit.  For
  example, "5" and "13TH" are acceptable but "FIVE" and "THIRTEENTH" are  not.
  All  ordinal  numbers may include the ending which indicates that the number
  is ordinal (such as the "TH" ending in "25TH").  Ordinal numbers of only one
  digit  may  be spelled out (such as "FIRST", "THIRD" and "NINTH") or written
  as a digit plus the two-character ending (such as "1ST", "3RD" AND "9th").

      NOTE:  The user should always use the  the  TEST,  or  the  EXPRESS  and
      DISPLAY commands to assure that his date and time specification produces
      the exact execution dates and times he  requires.   (See  below.)  Other
      commands  which  access  a job's entry in the queue, such as LIST, clear
      the date setting, just as INSERT does.  None of these commands should be
      entered after the DATES command and before the INSERT command.



  2.4  Date-time Expressions


  A.  Time specification

      The time specification must meet the following criteria:

      1.  The time is the user's time, as the host  system  would  display  in
          response to the DAYTIME command.

      2.  The time must be specified in a 24-hour day format.

      3.  If the time specified is before 10:00,  the  number  specifying  the
          hour  may  be  written  as  one  or  two digits, with or without the
          preceding zero.
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 5
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      4.  If the time is after midnight and  before  1:00  the  hour  must  be
          specified as 0 or 00.  If the zero hour is not specified, the number
          of minutes will be interpreted as the number of hours.

              Examples of time specifications:
                  Daytime              Enter
                  --------             -----
                   8:00 AM             08:00
                   9:15 AM              9:15
                  11:00 AM                11
                  12:15 AM              0:15
                   3:00 PM   (15:00)     :15
                  11:45 PM             23:45



  B.  Date Expression

      The most basic expression specifies date and time, with  date  specified
      as  one  date  or  a day of the week.  The system's date-time expression
      qualifiers allow the use of much more complex expressions,  to  schedule
      jobs to run repeatedly on complex schedules, and at system startup.


      1.  Specific single date

          The date may be specified in any of three formats:

          Format:                                 Example:
              mmm dd, yyyy AT <time>                  July 4, 1986 AT 5:30
                                                      Sep 30, 1986 AT 23:00
                                                      June 19, 86 AT 9

              mm/dd/yyyy AT <time>                    10/23/1986 AT 23:15
                                                      7/4/86 AT 5:00
                                                      09/05/86 AT 13

              dd-mmm-yyyy AT <time>                   10-JAN-1986 AT 12:30
                                                      5-Jun-86 AT 3
                                                      07-dec-1986 AT 9:00

          In the format notation "dd" means the day of the month.  "mmm" means
          the  month  name  spelled  out, with a minimum abbreviation of three
          letters.  "mm" means the number of the month.  "yyyy" means the year
          number, as either the full four digits or the last two digits of the
          year.

          The second format, with  all  numbers,  is  American  style:   month
          first, then day, then year.


      2.  Day of the week

          The date can be specified as a day of the week.  The name of the day
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 6
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


          of the week may be abbreviated to as few as three letters.  

          Format:                                 Example:
              <day of week> AT <time>.                Wednesday AT 12
                                                      Thu AT 5:30

      3.  Repetition interval

          The regularly repeating job  can  be  scheduled  by  specifying  the
          interval  between  the  job's  start  times.   This  interval can be
          specified as a number of months, a number of days, a number of hours
          or  a number of minutes.  The regularly repeating jobs are specified
          to the Job Processor by the word  EVERY  (see  below),  followed  by
          specification of the interval.

          a.  Interval as number of months
              The interval can be specified in months, up  to  12  months.   A
              special  capability of specifying a number of months interval is
              the ability to specify the day of the month for  execution.   If
              the  day  of  the month is not specified, the job is executed on
              the first day of the month.

              Format:
                  [<n>TH DAY] EVERY <m> MONTHS AT <time>

              Examples:
                  1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12
                  EVERY 6 MONTHS AT 23:00
                  7TH DAY EVERY 3 MONTHS AT 7:00

          b.  Interval as number of days
              The interval can be specified as any number of days, up  to  365
              days.

              Format:                                 Examples:
                  EVERY <n> DAYS AT <time>                EVERY 14 DAYS AT 5
                                                          EVERY DAY AT 12:00

          c.  Interval as number of hours
              The interval may be specified as any number of hours, up  to  24
              hours.  Time of day is not specified in this format.

              Format:                                 Example:
                  EVERY <n> HOURS                         EVERY 4 HOURS

          d.  Interval as number of minutes
              The interval may be specified as any number of  minutes,  up  to
              1440 minutes (1440 minutes equals 24 hours).  Time of day is not
              specified in this format.

              Format:                                 Example:
                  EVERY <n> MINUTES                       EVERY 45 MINUTES

      4.  Qualifiers for Date Specifications:

          Simple date expressions can be modified or combined, through the use
          of  the words EVERY, AND, REFERENCE, AFTER, STARTING, BEFORE, UNTIL,
          EXCEPT and NOT.  Use of these qualifiers can  provide  much  greater
          flexibility  in specifying desired execution dates and times.  These
          qualifiers allow specification of repeated processing, and  multiple
          criteria  for execution including:  execution on date-time[1] and on
          date-time[2], or execution only after a date and time, or  execution
          only  before  a  date  and  time,  or  execution every time except a
          specified date-time.

          a.  Date expression modifier - EVERY
              Preceding a date expression with this  modifier  specifies  that
              the   job   will   be   executed   repeatedly,  every  time  the
              specification is satisified.  This  is  used  with  simple  date
              expressions,   to   make   them   repeating   or  interval  date
              specifications.  (See "Repetition  Interval",  above.)  Interval
              expressions  are  formed in intervals of months, days, hours and
              minutes.  An interval of weeks is specified in days.  

              Format:                                 Examples:
                  EVERY <date expression> AT <time>       EVERY FRIDAY AT 12
                            or                            EVERY 3 MONTHS
                  EVERY <time interval>                   EVERY 21 DAYS
                                                          EVERY 8 HOURS
                                                          EVERY 45 MINUTES

          b.  Date-time expression conjunction - AND
              Simple or basic date-time expressions can be combined  with  the
              word  AND  to  form a multi-part expression.  Such an expression
              will  specify  the  execution  of  the   job   whenever   either
              specification   is   satisified.    Each   individual  date-time
              expression may be a Repetition Interval type, with its own EVERY
              modifier.   Each  date-time  expression  must  have its own time
              specified, or its time defaults to midnight (00:00 hours).

              Format:
                  <date-time expression> AND <date-time expression>

              Examples:
                  EVERY MONDAY AT 12:00 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 12:00
                  1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 00 AND 15TH DAY EVERY MONTH AT 00
                  EVERY DAY AT 5:00 AND EVERY 8 HOURS

          c.  Date expression modifier - REFERENCE
              Repetition Interval type jobs can be given a specific  point  of
              reference  for  scheduling future executions of the job, so that
              jobs which need to be regularly executed at a specific time  can
              be  scheduled  at the proper time.  If the REFERENCE time is not
              specified  the  current  time  is  used,  for   most   date-time
              expressions.   If  an  AFTER or STARTING modifier appears and no
          EFERENCE expression appears in  an  expression,  the  AFTER  or
              STARTING expression is used to provide the reference point.
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                          Page 8
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


              The REFERENCE modifier expression consists of the word REFERENCE
              followed   by   the   date-time  of  reference.   This  modifier
              expression must follow the basic expression it applies  to,  and
              it  affects  only that expression.  Each simple expression in an
              AND  type  multiple  expression  must  have  its  own  REFERENCE
              expression if one is desired.

              Format:
                  <date-time expression> REFERENCE <date-time of reference>

              Examples:
                  EVERY 6 HOURS REFERENCE 00:00
                  EVERY 3 DAYS AT 00 REFERENCE MONDAY 1 JULY 1986 AT 00

          d.  Date expression modifiers - AFTER and STARTING
              Repetition Interval type jobs may be specified  to  start  their
              regularly  scheduled execution after a specific date-time in the
              future.  If the reference date-time is not specified, this start
              date-time  is  the  point  of  reference  for  scheduling future
              executions of the job.  This start date-time is  specified  with
              an  AFTER  expression  or  a  STARTING  expression.   The  AFTER
              modifier  expression  and  the  STARTING   modifier   expression
              consists  of the word AFTER or the word STARTING followed by the
              limiting date-time.  This modifier expression  must  follow  the
              basic  expression  it  applies  to,  and  it  affects  only that
              expression.  Each simple expression  in  an  AND  type  multiple
              expression  must have its own AFTER (STARTING) expression if one
              is desired.

              Format:
                  <basic date-time expression> AFTER <limiting date-time>
                  <basic date-time expression> STARTING <limiting date-time>

              Examples:
                  EVERY SUNDAY AT 00 AFTER 1 JULY 1986 AT 00
                  EVERY 8 HOURS STARTING FRIDAY AT 08:00
                  EVERY MONDAY AT 12 AFTER 6/30/86 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 12 
                      AFTER 6/30/86
                  1ST DAY EVERY MONTH STARTING 1/1/87 AND 15TH DAY EVERY MONTH
                      STARTING 1/1/87

          e.  Date expression modifier - BEFORE and UNTIL
              Repetition Interval type jobs can have an ending  date-time  set
              by  using  the  BEFORE  or  the  UNTIL  modifier,  followed by a
              specific date-time which specify when the job can no  longer  be
              executed.   The BEFORE modifier expression or the UNTIL modifier
              expression may appear only once in an expression,  and  it  must
              follow all other date-time specifications in the expression.  It
              ends any execution of the job to which it applies.  Execution of
              the job can not start on or after the date and time specified in
              the BEFORE (UNTIL) modifier expression.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


              Format:
                  <basic date-time expression> BEFORE <limiting date-time>
                  <basic date-time expression> UNTIL <limiting date-time>

              Examples:
                  1ST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12:00 BEFORE 1 OCT 1987 AT 00:00
                  EVERY MONDAY AT 19:00 AND EVERY FRIDAY AT 19:00 
                      UNTIL 1/1/87 AT 00:00

          f.  Date expression modifiers - EXCEPT and NOT
              Repetition Interval type job  scheduling  can  be  modified,  to
              allow  exceptions  to  the  job's regularly scheduled execution.
              This is done with the modifier EXCEPT, followed by  a  date-time
              expression.   This  expression may be complex, using the AND and
              the EVERY constructions.  For the EXCEPT expression  to  prevent
              an   otherwise   scheduled  job  execution  from  occuring,  the
              date-time  it  specifies  must  exactly  match   the   execution
              date-time  specified  in  the  preceding,  execution part of the
              total date-time expression.

              The word NOT has exactly the same effect and  exactly  the  same
              syntax and usage as the word EXCEPT.

              NOTE:  The exception  date-time  specification  must  match  the
              execution date-time specification to the minute!

              Format:
                  <date-time expression> EXCEPT <exception date-time
                  expression>
                  <date-time expression> NOT <exception date-time expression>

              Examples:
                  FIRST DAY EVERY MONTH AT 12:00 EXCEPT 1-JAN-1987 AT 12:00
                  EVERY DAY AT 9 NOT EVERY FRIDAY AT 9 AND EVERY SATURDAY AT 9



      5.  Special Expression - The STARTUP Specification

          Execution of a job which must start  whenever  the  host  system  is
          started  (such as a job which must run continually) is done with the
          STARTUP date-time specification.  When this date-time  specification
          is  given  in the DATES command or option to the INSERT command, the
          job it applies to will be started every time the  Job  Processor  is
          started.   This  includes  any  time  the  host or the Job Processor
          starts up after it has not been running.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  2.5  Commands Which List Date-Time Information


  Information about the dates and times which the Job Processor translates the
  last  previously  entered  date-time  expression  into  is  available.  This
  information is available in the form of a list of the next  scheduled  dates
  and  times  for  the  job's  execution,  or  a  restatement of the date-time
  expression by the Job Processor in its own wording, or both.


  A.  Listing Scheduled Dates And Times - DISPLAY

      The DISPLAY command gives a list of the dates  which  the  last  entered
      DATES  expression  specifies.  The user can use this list to verify that
      he has specified the dates he wants.

      The dates are printed chronologically, showing the  month,  date,  year,
      day of the week, and run time in user's local time.

      The DISPLAY command gives the  date  command  in  groups  of  10  dates.
      Typing  a  carriage  return  terminates the display command.  Typing any
      character other than <cr>  displays  the  next  10  scheduled  execution
      date-times.

      The example below illustrates  the  DISPLAY  command  with  simple  date
      expressions.  All following examples were run on June 2, 1986.

      Example:
          SUBMIT> dates the fifth day of every month at 12 <cr>
          SUBMIT> display <cr>
          05-Jun-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Jul-86 SATURDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Aug-86 TUESDAY    AT 12:00:00
          05-Sep-86 FRIDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Oct-86 SUNDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Nov-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:00:00
          05-Dec-86 FRIDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Jan-86 MONDAY     AT 12:00:00
          05-Feb-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00
          05-Mar-86 THURSDAY   AT 12:00:00 
          - <CR> ENDS LIST, OTHER CHAR FOR MORE:<cr>


  B.  Printing The Date-time Specification - EXPRESS

      The EXPRESS command gives a rewording  of  the  date-time  specification
      entered in the last DATES command.  An expression printed by the EXPRESS
      command contains only the key words that  the  SUBMIT  program  used  to
      select the actual dates for job execution.

      Example:
          SUBMIT> dates every monday at 12:00 <cr>
          SUBMIT> express <cr>
          EVERY MONDAY AT 12:00:00

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  C.  Combining EXPRESS and DISPLAY Functions - TEST

      The TEST command is equivalent to the EXPRESS command  followed  by  the
      DISPLAY command.  TEST gives the date-time specification, then a list of
      the dates and times corresponding to the specification.

      Example:
          SUBMIT> dates every other wednesday at 12:30 <cr>
          SUBMIT> test <cr>
          EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY AT 12:30:00
          04-Jun-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          18-Jun-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          02-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          16-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          30-Jul-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          13-Aug-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          27-Aug-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          10-Sep-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          24-Sep-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00
          08-Oct-86 WEDNESDAY  AT 12:30:00 
          - <CR> ENDS LIST, OTHER CHAR FOR MORE:<cr>





  2.6  Entering A Job Into The Job Processing Queue - INSERT


  A.  The INSERT Command

      The INSERT command enters a job into the job processing queue and allows
      the  users  to  adjust values for options which affect the processing of
      job.  The start of the job's execution  is  controlled  by  the  current
      date-time  specification.   This  is  the  date-time  specification last
      entered,  prior  to  completion  of  the  current  submission  and   not
      previously  used  to  schedule  another  job.   If the date-time are not
      specified, the job is scheduled to run immediately.

      The INSERT command may include specification of the names of the command
      file   and  of  the  log  file.   (If  the  job  is  the  running  of  a
      non-interactive program, the user should enter the specification of  the
      program's executable file instead of a command file.)


      1.  the Command file

          The command file (or executable file) can reside in any directory to
          which  the  user has access.  When a directory is not specified with
          the file name, the  Job  Processor,  by  default,  uses  the  user's
          logged-in  directory.   The first six characters of the command file
          name, without the  directory  name  and  file  extension  (if  any),
          becomes  the  JOB NAME in the Job Processor and in the output of the
          SYSTAT program.
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 12
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      2.  The Log File

          The user's log file can be written in any  directory  to  which  the
          user  has  write  access.  In the event that a directory name is not
          furnished with the log file name, the Job Processor writes  the  log
          file to the user's currently active ("GFD"ed) directory, by default.
          If desired, a job may be run without a log file being written.


      3.  Format of INSERT Command

          The brief format for entering the specifications for the command and
          log  files  is to include the file specs in the INSERT command line.
          This is not necessary, however:  the user may  enter  each  item  of
          information  separately,  and wait for a prompt for the next item of
          information.

          The formats for entering the INSERT command and  the  specs  of  the
          command  file  (or the executable program file) and the log file are
          as follows:

          Brief format:
              SUBMIT> insert [<log file spec> =] <command file spec> <cr>
                      or
              SUBMIT> insert <command file spec>[, <log file spec>] <cr>

          Long, interactive format:
              SUBMIT> insert <cr>
              NAME OF COMMAND FILE: <command file spec> <cr>
              NAME OF LOG FILE: [<log file spec>] <cr>


          If only the word INSERT is entered at the  SUBMIT  prompt,  the  Job
          Processor will prompt for the command file specification.  If only a
          carriage return is typed at the "NAME OF COMMAND FILE:" prompt, then
          the insert will be aborted.


      4.  INSERT Without Creating a Log File

          The brief way to enter a job to run without creating a log  file  is
          to  give  only  the word INSERT and the specification of the command
          file at the SUBMIT prompt.  The Job Processor then prompts  for  the
          specification of the log file.

          If only a carriage return is typed at the log file prompt  then  the
          Job  Processor  will  assume that the user does not want a log file.
          This applies, whether the command  file  name  is  provided  on  the
          INSERT command line, or in response to the command file prompt.


TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 13
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  B.  Other essential job information

      The host requires information about every job, in order to run the  job.
      The  required information is the same, whether the job is run by the Job
      Processor system or by a user from a terminal.  In  order  for  the  Job
      Processor  to  provide  this information when it runs the user's job, it
      collects that information about  the  user's  session  when  the  INSERT
      command is given, and saves it.  Like the command file name and log file
      name, this information cannot be changed  by  the  MODIFY  command  (see
      below).  To change it the job must be DELETEd and reINSERTed.

      The user session information saved is:  

      1.  the user's "loggged in" username, 

      2.  the "connected" (GFDed) directory, 

      3.  the session's originating node and port,

      4.  the originating terminal's "TID" (baud rate), and

      5.  the session's Project Code.


        





  2.7  Setting The Job's OPTIONs (Part Of The INSERT Operation)


  During the INSERT operation, after the  INSERT  command  is  given  and  the
  command  (or  program) file and the log file specs are given, options may be
  set.  This is indicated by the OPTIONS prompt:

      OPTIONS[Insert]:


  The user responds to the OPTIONS prompt with the name of  an  option  and  a
  value  for  that  option.   He  repeats the entry of option names and values
  until he has entered all the desired adjustments.  The user  terminates  the
  adjusting  of  options and causes SUBMIT to insert the job into the queue by
  typing a carriage return (only) at the OPTIONS prompt.

  The user may cancel the current INSERT  operation  by  typing  ABORT  and  a
  carriage  return.   This  will abort the insertion of the job and return the
  user to the SUBMIT prompt.

  At any time that the OPTIONS prompt is displayed, the user may type HELP  or
  a question mark (?) in order to view a list of the possible options which he
  may specify, and the possible values which he can set for each  option.   In
  the list displayed, the current settings are enclosed in brackets.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  The Job Processor will display the information it has about  the  job  being
  entered.   This information is available at any time that the OPTIONS prompt
  is displayed by typing SHOW.  The information displayed is exactly the  same
  information  as  that  given  in  response  to the SHOW command given at the
  SUBMIT> prompt.  (See SHOW, below.)

  In the following list of option names and  possible  values,  words  not  in
  angle  brackets  are  possible values.  The numeric values are the defaults.
  the words in angle barckets name the type  of  value.   Default  values  are
  marked by square brackets.


      Option           Values [Current setting]
      -------          ------
      Log              None, [Append], Supersede, 
      Dispose          [Keep], Delete, Error
      Mail             None, Success, [Error], Always
      Restart          None, [Start], Chkpnt, Label, Continue, Repeat
      Run              [No], Yes
      Detach           [No], Yes

      LogLimit         [0] 
      TruLimit         [0] 
      Parameters       <parameter values


  A detailed definition of each option follows.  When  the  option  statements
  are used in SUBMIT, the value to be set for the option must be listed in the
  line  that  names  the  option,  unless  stated  otherwise  in  the   option
  definition, here.


  A.  LOG 

      Specifies what logging action to take, especially when  a  file  already
      exists  with  the  same  name  as  the  intended  log  file, in the same
      directory as where the log file is to be written.   Entering  a  logging
      action  specification  will  have  no effect, unless a log file name has
      been specified.

      Values:
          NONE            No log file will be written.
          APPEND          Append any new log information to the existing 
                          file. 
          SUPERSEDE       Over-write the existing file, deleting prior 
                          file.
                          (Default, if a log file name is specified.)

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: log append


  B.  DISPOSE

      Specifies how the Job Processor  is  to  dispose  of  the  log  file  it
      creates,  after  the job has completed.  This specification will have no
      effect unless a log file name has been specified and the logging  action
      is other than NONE.

      Values:
          KEEP            Keeps the log file under all conditions.
                          (Default)
          DELETE          Deletes the log file when the job is completed.  
                          If the job aborts prior to completion the file 
                          is saved.   
          ERROR           Keeps the log file if the job ends with an error
                          exit.  

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: dispose error


  C.  MAIL

      Specifies  under  what  conditions  of  the  job's  completion  the  Job
      Processor is to send mail to the user who entered the job.

      Values:
          NONE            Never send mail.
          SUCCESS         Send mail only on successful completion of job.
          ERROR           Send mail only on error completion.
          ALWAYS          Send mail on every completion.  (Default)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: mail error


  D.  RESTART

      Specifies where in the command file to restart the job when  the  system
      is  restarted,  or  specifies  if  the job is not to be restarted.  This
      option has effect only if the job does not complete execution because of
      a  system  (host or Job Processor) crash.  Whether RESTART is enabled or
      not, if the job aborts because of a problem in the job, the job will not
      automatically restart.  Such a job will be put into an ABORT state.  The
      user should correct the cause of the failure before the job is  executed
      again.   When the job is able to run, it can be recovered with the RERUN
      or the REQUEUE command.  (See RERUN and REQUEUE, below.)

      Values:
          NONE            Do not restart.  (Default)
          START           Restart at the start of the command file, like a

                          normal start.  
          CHKPNT          Restart at the label specified with the :CHKPNT 
                          or the :CHECKPOINT command.  (Not yet implemented.)
          LABEL           Restart at the specified label in the command 
                          file.  The label must be specified in an 
                          OPTIONS entry.  (Not yet implemented.)
          CONTINUE        Restart at the next line of the command file,
                          following the line being executed when the 
                          system stopped.  (Not yet implemented.)
          REPEAT          Restart at the line that was being executed when 
                          the system stoppped, repeating execution of that
                          line.  (Not yet implemented.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: restart start


  E.  RUN

      Specifies that the job is a program to be run without  a  command  file.
      This  option  is  set  automatically when the name of the "command file"
      that is given to SUBMIT at the beginning of the INSERT operation is  one
      that  is  obviously  an  executable  program  file.  that is, the file's
      extension is .SAV, .SHR or .HGH.

      This option can be used best with  programs  that  require  no  terminal
      input  on  their  command  port.  Most programs need input, but for some
      programs this input can be provided  as  parameters,  specified  on  the
      command  line  that runs the job.  The system program that is run by the
      COPY command is an example of such a program.  Such programs do not need
      a command file to be run by the Job Processor.  They are given the input
      in the parameters specified in the PARAMETERS option (see the PARAMETERS
      option below).

      Values:
          NO              Job is run by a command file.  (Default)
          YES             Job is a non-interactive program without a 
                          command file.  (Default, if command file's
                          extension indicates an executable program
                        file, or the option name is entered without
                        a value.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: run


  F.  DETACH

      Specifies whether the job is attached to a command  port,  or  detached.
      This  option  can be used, only with RUN jobs, to keep a command port on
      the job  being  run.   This  can  be  useful  for  monitoring  the  jobs
      execution.  A job being controlled by a command file cannot be detached.
      Such a job requires a command port to pass commands to the job.
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 17
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:
          NO              Job has a command port attached. (Default)
          YES             Job has no command port attached.  (Default
                          for RUN jobs, or if the option name is
                        entered without a value.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: detach


  G.  LOGOUT

      Specifies whether a logout command from the program being executed is  a
      legal end of job execution.

      Values:
          NO              A LOGOUT by the running program is error.
                          (Default.)
          YES             LOGOUT by program being run is legal.
                          (Default, if option name is entered without
                        a value.)  

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: logout


  H.  UNIQUE

      Specifies the job's attribute which must be unique for the job  to  run.
      The  user defines which attribute.  The Job Processor checks all jobs it
      is running at the time that is scheduled to start the  user's  job.   If
      another  job  is running with the same value for the specified attribute
      as the user's job, the user's job is not started.

      Values:
          NONE            No restrictions.  This job will run, regardless 
                          of other active jobs in the queue.
          USER            Do not run if any job is running which was 
                          entered by a user logged in to the same user 
                          name as this job.  
          DIR             Do not run if any job is running which was 
                          entered by a user with the same connected 
                          (GFDed) directory as the user entering this 
                          job.  
          PATH            Do not run if any job is running which was 
                          entered by someone with the same USER and the 
                          same DIR as this one.  
          JOB             Do not run if any job is running with the same 
                          job name, entered by someone with the same USER 
                          and the same DIR as this one.  (Default)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: unique none

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  I.  CCL

      Specifies to the Job Processor the name  of  the  temporary  file  which
      contains  the  parameters  to  the RUN-type program.  The temporary file
      name must be the same as that expected by the program being run when  it
      is started at its CCL entry point.

      Values:
          <name>          The three character name of the temporary file. 
                          (The default is the first three characters of the
                          program name if none is specified.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: ccl cpy


  J.  LABEL

      Specifies the name of the label in the command file where the  job  will
      start.  This is also used if the RESTART option is turned on and the job
      is restarted.  The :CHKPNT and the :CHECKPOINT commands will set  a  new
      label  to  be  used  on  restart.   All label values must be composed of
      letters and/or numbers only, from one to six characters in length,  with
      a letter as the first character.

      Values:
          <label>         One label, marking the location in the command 
                          file where the job will start (or restart).  
                          (The default is no label.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: label gohere


  K.  PRIORITY

      Specifies the job's priority in the Job Processor's queue.  If the  host
      system's  load is so heavy that not all jobs can be started on time, the
      priority level determines which jobs will be started first.  The  higher
      priority  levels  can  be  set  only  by people responsible for the host
      computer systems.  

      Values:
          <0 to 9>        Possible priority values.  (The default is 0.)
          <10 to 15>      For host system-critical programs only. 
                          (Requires special license to set.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: priority 9


  L.  LICENSE

      Specifies the license that will be set for the job every time the job is
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 19
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      executed.   This  option is a valuable security protection.  The license
      username and password do not need to be written into the  command  file:
      if  a  job  requires  license  to  run, the option allows giving it that
      license when the job is entered.  The user  must  have  a  username  and
      password  for  the  OPER  program that provides access to the license(s)
      requested, to enable them with this option.

      The license must be specified on the same line as the word  LICENSE,  in
      response  to  the  OPTIONS  prompt.   This  line will be followed by the
      prompt "Oper name:" which asks for a name  valid  in  the  OPER  license
      setting  program.   After  a  name is supplied the user will be prompted
      with "Password:".  When a valid OPER password is supplied the license is
      set for the job.

      Values:
          <licenses>      The possible values are all the licenses any 
                          user may have access to.  Multiple licenses 
                          may be specified by listing their two 
                          character codes, separated by commas.  
                          (The default is no license.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: license rf wf
          OPER NAME: helgem
          PASSWORD: 


  M.  TIMELIMIT

      Specifies the time, in minutes, that the job may run.   If  the  job  is
      still running when the time runs out the job will be aborted.  

      Values:
          <nnn>           Time in minutes.  (For no limit nnn = 0.)
                          (The default is 60.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: timelimit 120


  N.  LOGLIMIT

      Specifies the maximum size in pages for the specified log  file.   (This
      feature  is  not  currently  implemented.)  This will be used to prevent
      run-away or neglected jobs from writing wasteful, over-sized log files.

      Values:
          <nn>            Log file size, in pages.  (for no limit nn = 0.)
                          (The default is 0.)  

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: loglimit 50

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


  O.  TRULIMIT

      Specifies the maximum number of TRUs the job can  accumulate.   Any  job
      reaching  the maximum will abort.  This can be used to prevent jobs from
      running away and unnecessarily using up TRUs.  

      Values:
          <nnn>           TRUs.  (For no limit nnn = 0.)  
                          (The default is 0.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: trulimit 500


  P.  PARAMETERS

      Specifies the parameter values that are to  be  passed  to  the  command
      file,  or  (if  the the job is a RUN-type job) to the program being run.
      The individual  parameters  values  among  the  values  of  this  option
      statement  must  be separated by blanks only, commas are not allowed.  A
      parameter value is one "word" made up of only letters or numbers,  or  a
      string  which  can  contain  blanks  or  punctuation  characters  and is
      delimited by "double" quotation marks.  (For detailed  information,  see
      Parameters  discussion  in  the  command  file  exec  language reference
      manual:  file (*6NEWS)EXEC.DOC.)

          Note:  specification of parameters for a RUN-type job  automatically
          causes the program to start at its CCL entry point, and sets the CCL
          temporary file name to its default.  (See CCL option.)

      Values:
          <value1> [<value2> [... <valueN>]]
                          The parameters to be passed to the command
                          file (or the RUN-type program, if that is the
                          job), separated by blanks only.
                          (The default is none.)

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: parameters value1 "string = value 2"


  Q.  DATES

      Specifies the date-time the job is to be  run.   Used  with  the  MODIFY
      command for changing the date-time specification.  Any date-time entered
      at the OPTION prompt will become effective after the  job  is  requeued,
      with the REQUEUE command or the job's execution.

      The command and its values are entered in exactly the same format as the
      DATES   command  at  the  SUBMIT  prompt  (see  above).   The  date-time
      specification may be entered on the same line as the word DATES,  or  on
      another line, after the Job Processor prompts for the specification.

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      Values:
          <date-time expression>        Any valid date-time specification.

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: date today at 13:00



  R.  SHOW

      This command immediately displays all available  information  about  the
      job  being  INSERTed, but does not change the job's scheduling or any of
      its  options.   Information  displayed  includes  the  options,  limits,
      licenses  and  dates  information,  plus  all  job  identification info,
      command file and log file information, info about  the  command  circuit
      through  which  the  job  was entered, and info about the job's last run
      time.

      Values:
          <none>        This command has no variable settings.

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: show


                                     NOTE

          Any of the preceding options can be declared or changed with the
          INSERT command, when the job is entered into the queue.  Options
          can be changed after the job has been inserted into the queue by
          using the MODIFY command (see below).






  2.8  Identifying Current Jobs, For Commands

  Some commands to SUBMIT access current jobs that are in  the  queue.   These
  are the commands which are described later in this document.  These commands
  use the job identification provided by the user  to  select  the  job(s)  to
  display or change.


  A.  The two fields of job identification

      Job identification consists of  the  job  name  and  the  job's  request
      number.   "Job  name"  means  the  six  character  job  name, optionally
      preceded by the job's username.   If  used,  the  username  must  be  in
      parentheses,  and  must be immediately adjacent to the six-character job
      name (without any spaces between the closing  parenthesis  and  the  job
      name).  
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 22
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      The six character job name or the username may be the only part  of  the
      job  name  field  specified.  This would specify all jobs with the given
      job name, or all jobs entered from the specified username.

      Job identification may be supplied as parameters  in  the  command  line
      which calls the function.

      Example:

          SUBMIT> list (helgem)midnit 5


  B.  Use of the wildcard character

      The  wildcard  character  is  the  asterisk  (*).   Either  of  the  job
      identification  fields may be replaced by this wildcard character.  When
      used to specify a job I.D.  field, all jobs are considered a  match  for
      that  field.   All  jobs which satisfy the other criteria (accessable by
      the user, and matching the other job I.D.  field) are selected  for  the
      command.

      Example:

          SUBMIT> list (helgem)midnit *


  C.  Omitting job identification fields from the command line

      If either of the fields  of  job  identification  is  omitted  from  the
      command  line, the Job Processor system will respond in one of two ways,
      depending on the type of command given.  If the command only  reads  the
      queue  and makes no changes to it, the command will select all jobs that
      match the supplied identification.  These commands are:  LIST and  SHOW.
      If  the  command  changes  anything  in  the queue (any options, any job
      scheduling, etc.) the user will be prompted for the unsupplied fields of
      job identification.  When prompted, the user may respond with a specific
      job I.D.  field, with the wildcard character, or with  only  a  carriage
      return.   The  commands  which  make  changes in the queue are:  MODIFY,
      DELETE, RERUN, REQUEUE, PAUSE, STOP, KILL and CONTINUE.

      Example:

          SUBMIT> rerun
          JOB NAME: (helgem)midnit
          REQUEST NUMBER: 5


  D.  Confirming jobs in a selected group

      If the carriage return response to the prompt for field(s)  is  used  to
      enter  the  job I.D.  field, all jobs will be considered a match on that
      field.  However, a group of jobs selected this way  may  not  always  be
      acted  upon  as group.  If the command is one which makes changes in the
      queue and the jobs are selected with the carriage return, the user  will
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 23
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      be  asked  to  confirm  each job for the action.  The user will be given
      brief job identification information for each job and asked to reply YES
      or  NO.  One letter abbreviations are acceptable for reply, and carriage
      return mean NO.

      Example:

          SUBMIT> rerun (helgem)
          REQUEST NUMBER: <cr>
          rerun TEST    req   3     (HELGEM) [No]: <cr>
          rerun JOBS    req   4     (HELGEM) [No]: Y
          rerun MIDNIT  req   5     (HELGEM) [No]: NO






  2.9  Commands To Get Information About A Job Request


  A.  Displaying All Available Information About Job(s) - SHOW

      The SHOW command gives a concise,  complete  display  of  all  currently
      available  information about the selected job(s).  Information displayed
      includes the options, limits, licenses and dates information,  plus  all
      job  identification  info,  command  file and log file information, info
      about the command circuit through which the job was  entered,  and  info
      about the job's last run time.

      Example:

      SUBMIT> show jobs 4 <cr>
      Job: JOBS    Req  4    DSK:(HELGEM)JOBS.LOG=DSK:(HELGEM)JOBS.CTL
      Username: HELGEM    Node:6615 TID=1200
      Limits:   Time:01:00:00  TRU:no limit  Pri:0
      Options:  Log:Supersede Dispose:Keep Mail:Always Restart:None Unique:Job
      License:  SY AC RF WF
      Period:   EVERY SATURDAY AT 12:00:00.
      Run date: 07-Jun-86 12:00:00          Queued-Wait     
      Last run: 31-May 86 12:00:16


  B.  Listing current jobs - LIST

      The LIST command lists  information  about  the  selected  jobs  in  the
      current  queue.   The user may specify which possible information fields
      he wants displayed, to provide  information  about  his  selected  jobs.
      This  information selection is done with the SELECT command.  Please see
      the SELECT command for a  list  of  the  information  fields  which  are
      available and the manner of selecting from them.

      If the user does not select the information fields to be displayed,  the
      following  default  list  is  provided.   This  default  version  of the
TYMCOM-X Job Processing System                                         Page 24
USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      information for LIST to display includes information about the status of
      each job included in the list displayed.

      Example of default list:
          SUBMIT> list <cr>

  C.  Specifying job information the LIST command displays - SELECT 

      The LIST command is capable of displaying  several  different  types  of
      information  about  the  selected jobs.  In order to display information
      different from the  command's  defaults,  the  user  enters  the  SELECT
      command, with the names of the desired information fields.  

      All available information will  be  displayed,  in  the  format  of  all
      information  about each job blocked like the output of the SHOW command,
      when the user specifies "SELECT ALL".  

      The following are the possible field names which may be arguments to the
      SELECT command:

          JobName           Request           TimeLimit         UserName
          PPN               AUN               Privilege         NextRun
          License           LogFile           CommandFile       Label
          TruLimit          LogLimit          Log               Dispose
          Mail              Restart           Unique            CtyLog
          RunFlag           Detach            Logout            Priority
          Halt              CCL               Status            Abort
          All

          NOTE:  Job info is listed in columnar form.  Don't  try  to  specify
          more individual fields than will fit on your terminal or screen.

      The following examples of the use of the SELECT command includes the use
      of the LIST command, to show the SELECT command's effect.

      Example:
          SUBMIT> select job req status commandfile <cr>
          SUBMIT> list <cr>
            Job     Req     Command file                   Status

  2.10  Housekeeping Commands


  The Job Processor system offers several commands to keep things 'cleaned up'
  in the system.  These include commands to change a job's option settings, to
  cancel a scheduled job or to recover a cancelled job, to pause or to stop  a
  job  while  it's  processing,  to restart a job, and to reenter a job in the
  processing queue.

  Before using any of these commands, the user should enter the  LIST  command
  to  confirm that the job identification to be included with the housekeeping
  command refers to the intended job.


  A.  Changing option settings - MODIFY

      The user can make any desired changes to the options of a job, after the
      job  has  been  entered in the queue, with the MODIFY command to SUBMIT.
      Such changes may even be made after a job  has  completed  some  of  its
      scheduled executions.

      The scheduling of the job is changed by specifying the DATES option with
      the new date-time value.

      When the MODIFY command and the identification of the job to be modified
      have  been  entered,  the Job Processor then displays the information it
      currently has about the options of that job.  The  limits,  options  and
      scheduling  information  may  be  changed  at  the OPTIONS prompt, which
      immediately follows this job information listing.  the  options  changes
      are  entered  just  as  the options' original values were entered at the
      INSERT command.  

      Example:
          SUBMIT> modify jobs 4  <cr>
          JOB: JOBS  Req  4 DSK:(HELGEM)JOBS.CMD
          Username: HELGEM   Node:3456-16 TID=Aux
          Limits:   Time:01:00:00  TRU:no limit  Pri:0
          Options:  Log:None Mail:Always Restart:None Unique:Job
          Period:   04-Jun-86 AT 23:00:00.
          Run date: 04-Jun-86 23:00:00          Queued-Wait     
          Last run: 04-Jun-86 08:31:21

USING THE TYMCOM-X JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM


      To update an option, enter the option name and the desired, new value(s)
      for  the  option.   Type just a carriage return to end the modifying and
      replace the request with the updated version.  When modification of  the
      job  is  complete  the  Job  Processor  prints a line verifying that the
      modification has been inserted into the queue.  

      Example:
          OPTIONS[Insert]: dispose delete <cr>
          OPTIONS[Insert]: unique none <cr>
          OPTIONS[Insert]: <cr>
          REPLACING REQUEST = 4...MODIFIED JOB "JOBS" INSERTED.  Req  4

      Typing carriage return (only) at any appearance of  the  OPTIONS  prompt
      will replace the job without any further changes.

      If the user wishes to change his  command  file  or  log  file,  or  the
      session  information  for his job, he must delete this job and re-insert
      it into the queue as a new entry.


  B.  Removing a job from the queue - DELETE 

      The DELETE command removes a specified  job  from  the  Job  Processor's
      queue  so  it  will  no  longer  be executed at any time.  If the job is
      currently executing when it is DELETEd, it  is  allowed  to  finish  the
      current execution but will not be requeued for future execution when the
      current execution is complete.  If the DELETEd job is needed to  be  run
      it  must be reentered into the queue with the DATES and INSERT commands.
      Another word for DELETE which works in  the  Job  Processor  is  CANCEL.
      Either  command  will  prevent  any  future  executions of the job.  The
      command file itself is not deleted from the user's directory.

      When the job has been deleted, the system prints "JOB DELETED".   If  no
      such job is found, the system prints "ERROR - (Cannot find record)".


  C.  Re-running a job - RERUN

      The RERUN command  re-enters  the  job  into  the  queue  for  immediate
      execution.   After  execution, if the job is a repeating job, it will be
      requeued for its next execution.  


  D.  Re-entering a job - REQUEUE 

      A job can be re-entered into the processing queue for processing on  its
      regular  schedule,  starting  at its next regularly scheduled execution.
      If the job has no future executions scheduled, such as a job  originally
      scheduled  for  one-time  or  immediate  execution,  this  command  will
      entirely remove it from the queue.

  2.11  Manipulating A Running Job


  Execution of currently  running  jobs  can  be  interrupted  temporarily  or
  completely, from the SUBMIT program, with the PAUSE, STOP and KILL commands.


  A.  Temporarily preventing further processing of a command file - PAUSE

      Giving  the  PAUSE  command  for  a  currently  executing  job  that  is
      controlled  by a command file will allow the job to complete the task of
      the last command received from the command file, but the job will not be
      sent  any  later  commands  from  the  command file.  The effect of this
      command is temporary.  This comand can be overridden with  the  CONTINUE
      command (see below).

      Format:
          SUBMIT> pause <job name> <request number>


  B.  Immediately stopping execution of a running job - STOP

      When a currently executing job that is controlled by a command  file  is
      given  the  STOP  command  it immediately stops processing, as though it
      received a pair of user interrupts (control-C or <Escape).   As  when  a
      PAUSE  is sent, the job will not receive or process any further commands
      from the command file.   This  command  has  a  temporary  effect.   The
      CONTINUE command (see below) can allow subsequent commands to be sent to
      the job, but will not restore execution of the task of the command  that
      was interrupted.

      Format:
          SUBMIT> stop <job name> <request number>


  C.  Terminate a running job - KILL

      The KILL command kills a currently executing job that is controlled by a
      command  file  and removes the current entry from the queue.  The system
      considers  the  job  as  having  completed  successfully,  in  that   it
      re-inserts  the  job  into the queue for execution at its next scheduled
      time (if there is to be another  time).   The  effect  of  this  command
      cannot be reversed by another command.

      Format:
          SUBMIT> kill <job name> <request number>


  D.  Resume sending commands - CONTINUE

      The CONTINUE command restarts the processing of a  job  which  has  been
      stopped from processing any commands from the command file by a PAUSE or
      a STOP command, and which is no longer  being  sent  commands  from  its
      command  file.   The  job  resumes  with the next command after the last

APPENDIX A: POSSIBLE VALUES FOR THE STATUS FIELD


  4.0  APPENDIX A: POSSIBLE VALUES FOR THE STATUS FIELD


  The values for processing status that users  might  see  are  listed  below.
  They  are  listed in four groups:  (1.) the normal, most common values found
  in jobs which are running or can run, (2.) the values for those  jobs  which
  can  be  returned  to  normal processing with the CONTINUE command, (3.) the
  values for those jobs which can be re-entered into the queue (for  immediate
  processing  or regularly scheduled processing) with the RERUN command or the
  REQUE command, or (4.) the values for those jobs  which  have  successfulluy
  completed and are automatically requeued if they are to run again.


          STATUS      Meaning
          ------      -------

              (1)  Normal, most common:


      Queued-Wait     In the queue, waiting for NEXT RUN time.
       Sched-Wait     Scheduled time is here, waiting for command file
                      processor.  
        Proc-Run      In process, running.


              (2)  Recoverable with CONTINUE command:

        Proc-Pause    In process, frozen with the PAUSE command.
        Proc-Stop     In process, frozen with the STOP command.


              (3)  Recoverable with RERUN & REQUEUE commands:

      Queued-Crash    Job aborted, host crashed while job running.
        Hold-Restart  Job aborted with Restart option enabled.
       Abort-Input    Job aborted, due to command file not found.
       Abort-License  Job aborted, due to problem with (insufficient)
                      license.  
       Abort-Frame    Job aborted, due to illegal user name (username
                      cancelled).  
       Abort-Run      Job aborted, run of command file failed.
       Abort-Enter    Job aborted, was unable to open (enter) the log
                      file.  
       Abort-Update   Job aborted, was unable to update the log file.
       Abort-Append   Job aborted, was unable to append to the log 
                      file. 
       Abort-Error    Job aborted, due to error other than those 
                      listed here.  
       Abort-Notice   Job aborted, job processor received 
                      notice-to-quit from host.  
       Abort-Time     Job aborted, due to job time limit exceeded.
       Abort-TRU      Job aborted, due to job TRU limit exceeded.
       Abort-Zap      Job aborted, due to circuit zap on job's command
                      port.

APPENDIX A: POSSIBLE VALUES FOR THE STATUS FIELD


              (4)  Normal job completion, automatically requeued:

        Done-End      Done processing, through the end of the command 
                      file.
        Done-Stop     Done processing, with :STOP or :QUIT control 
                      file command.
        Done-Lost     Done processing normally, char(s) lost in output 
                      to the log file.

  Of the above values, those in groups (1) or (2) would be seen  only  in  the
  output  of the LIST command.  None of these is complete, so the job is never
  in one of these states when mail is sent.  Group (4) values are  the  normal
  values for a job which has successfully completed, so one of these is likely
  to be the state the job is in when mail is sent.  The LIST  command  is  not
  likely  to  show  a job in one of these states because these states are very
  temporary.

  Jobs in any of the states in group (3) are completed but are  not  requeued.
  Thus,  these values are shown in mail messages and in the output of the LIST
  command.  If a job is seen to be in any of these "Abort" states,  a  "fatal"
  error  has  caused  it  end  processing without completion.  The fatal error
  needs to be found and corrected, and then the job can be recovered with  the
  REQUEUE or RERUN command.

  5.0  BUG REPORTS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB PROCESSOR SYSTEM



  Problems with or questions about the TYMCOM-X Job Processor system  or  this
  documentation  can  be  directed to the system's maintainers.  The system to
  send any such messages is the  SENDMAIL  program,  which  is  run  with  the
  command  "R SENDMAIL  <cr>".   When  the program prompts with "To:", respond
  with "SUBMIT <cr>".  The body of the letter is ended with control-D (^D).

  Please provide the program version, a description of the problem, your  name
  and  telephone  number  so  that we may contact you for further information.
  Your username and the name of your command file will also be useful.

  Example:

      .r sendmail <cr>

  You may receive an answer on a mail system that is somewhat  different  from
  the  older  system mail.  This newer mail system can be recognized by a MAIL
  WAITING prompt that is slightly different  from  the  older  one.   this  is
  important, because the manner in which you read this mail is different.

  The message that you have mail waiting is printed in lower case letters  and
  is  contained  in  square  brackets.   You  read  this  mail with the RDMAIL
  program.  There are other, more complex ways to read this mail, but  if  you
  are not familiar with them, running RDMAIL is the easiest and the best.

  Example:

      .[mail waiting]
      .r rdmail <cr>

      <message displayed>
