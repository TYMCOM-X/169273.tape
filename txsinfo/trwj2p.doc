I.  Reliability:

    A.  Uptime improvement (crash causes eliminated):

        1.  Eliminated hang which occurred while attempting to shut down the
            system.  
        2.  Eliminated closing of channel 0 from monitor context by XBASIC and
            PASCAL.  
        3.  Eliminated problem 2020 had reading data due to error recovering
            from ECC correction at end of cylinder.  
        4.  Eliminated creation of files with bad RIBS by PASCAL.
        5.  Eliminated inability of user to open new files, due to too many
	    files open and too little freecore available.  
	6.  Corrected problem of "CORE" command clearing an active user high-
            segment, which prevented the user reSTARTing or CONTINuing a
	    program.  
	7.  Eliminated job crashing due to address error using previous
	    context registers causing an executive page map failure.
        8.  Corrected GETSEG which destroyed I/O state while performing
	    old-style buffered I/O.  [XBASIC]
        9.  Corrected mapping of pages into a file in a directory that is over
	    quota.  
       10.  Eliminated releasing (removing) context pages for another frame,
	    which could crash other user.
       11.  Fixed output of random garbage characters, caused by improper
	    output on bad port with garbaged LDBOUT bits.  
       12.  Eliminated loop in DDB linkages which caused a system hang.
       13.  Eliminated bad page map when job is requeued twice within one
	    clock tick.  
       14.  Eliminated using up freecore by not deallocating shared pages
	    correctly.  

    B.  Implemented new STOPCD (stop-code) reporting and recovery system:
        STOPCDs are reported on system console whenever a noteworthy event
        occurs on the system.  STOPCDs are categorized into several types:
        STOP, CPU, HALT and DISK cause the system to crash or reload.  
        JOB, EVENT and INFO print available information on the CTY and
        continue normal system operation without causing the system to crash
        or reload.

    C.  Operational Efficiency:

        1.  Modified ONCE and FILES commands and messages to aid the
            operations staff in performing the correct functions.
        2.  Removed all code referring to obsolete SWAP space when a
            refresh or rebuild is required for a pack-set or strucure.
        3.  Amplified many console messages during system restart.
        4.  Added the NETWORK command and modified operation of CONSOLE
            command in ONCE to flag the use of TYMNET (default) or the
            CTY when bringing the system up in any available mode.
        5.  Allowed CHANGE SYSTEM on hosts with micro-node bases to set
            the system number between 1 and 99999. 
        6.  Changed CONSOLE mode to allow all commands to be entered
            in either upper or lower case.  Added "^Z?" help message.
        7.  Force updating of the home pages as an integral part of a
            REFRESH to avoid inconsistancy problems at system startup.

    D.  Changed manner in which system ran detached frames:  eliminated the
        SPARE-LDB and it's myriad of associated problems.  (NOTE:  This
        changes requires that the new version of LOGOUT be implemented on the
        system, as the old one will not log the user out if running under the
	new monitor.)

    E.  Fixed many port backpressure problems:

        1.  Implemented new backpressure algorithm to help prevent character
            loss. 
        2.  Fixed input and skip AUXCALs to not go into OUTPUT wait forever.
        3.  Allowed the input line to exceed the defined maximum length.

    F.  Added new hang flag to hard-kill a frame without detaching.  (Used by
        TAKEIT and other programs that need to kill another frame.)


II.  Performance:

    A.  File I/O speed improved by adding CHANIO 47 (.CHVMP) UUO to map a
        private page into a file.  

    B.  Frame handling UUOs (for systems programs):

        1.  Added FRMOP 41 (.FOSTP) to simulate an <ESC> on a frame.
        2.  Added FRMOP 42 (.FOFCF) to force a special command.
        3.  Added FRMOP 43 (.FOCPC) to change the project code.
        4.  Added FLSTOP (CALLI -147) to stop with a halt status 4,,7.
        5.  Added FLEXIT (CALLI -142) to exit with a halt status 4,,2.
        6.  Fixed FRMOP 22 (.FOSVA) to read the start offset correctly.
        7.  Added access right 32 for passing license to another frame.

    C.  Changed FRMOP .FOCFM (Create Frame) to new a format which allows the
        changed privilege bits and license bits of the parent to be passed to
        the child frame, allowing Batch-file controlled jobs to work with
        royalty accounting.

    D.  The frame INACTIVITY TIMEOUT feature is now fully implemented.  Any
        frame with this feature enabled will be logged off after a specified
        (or default) time limit in minutes, set by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT n"
        command.  In addition, this feature can be enabled automatically by
        setting the appropriate bit in the LUD.  A system-wide default may be
        set by an authorized user with the "SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY n" command.

    E.  Added Special Command Mode (SCM) to run the users Restricted Command
        Mode (RCM) program for un-recognized monitor commands.  Used to run
        programs from SYS and other directories in the user's "DO" list by
        just typing the program name, as though it were an EXEC command.

    F.  Provided more dynamic allocation of internal data structures to take
        advantage of the expanding size of available memory.

    G.  Eliminated the "race" condition with yellow balls and interrupts,
        avoiding the program waiting forever for an event that has already
        occurred.

    H.  The TRU limit for a job may now be set or extended by both the monitor
        command "SET LIMIT n" and the SETLIM UUO.  A frame may now request an
        interrupt when the TRU limit has been exceeded.


III.  Security:

    A.  Added CL.DMP flag to CLOSE UUO for TITO to set the file-dumped bit
        without possibly losing data during an update.

    B.  Made system zap the circuit of the logging-in user when "frame
        capacity exceeded" is detected upon network LOGIN, so as to prevent
        confusion.  

    C.  Made system check frame license for same or greater capabilities in
        the source frame when attaching to another frame.

    D.  Made system return maximum current license on a file instead of none
        when an attempt is made to set greater file license.

    E.  Made system give special "!"  prompt instead of "."  in PDP mode when
        a user has any license set.

    F.  Made system prevent AUX CIRCUITS from logging into a SHUT system.

    G.  Fixed frame access rights checking routines to check child's rights
        rather than parent's rights where appropriate.

    H.  Added LOGOUT ON STOP feature to force a LOGOUT on a frame if it stops
	for any reason, including completion or error exiting of the program
	that is automatically started for all logins to the username.  Set
	with SETPRV (CALLI -11).  May NOT be turned off once it is turned on.
	When used, this feature is on for every login to the username.



IV.  Accounting:

    A.  TRU scaling added for value-added and royalty products.

    B.  Changed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to pass the project code to the child.

    C.  Changed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to write an accounting record using the
        proper network-origin information for the newly created frame.


V.  Miscellaneous features:

    A.  New or Changed commands:

        1.  Added "UNDELETE" command to "undelete" files "deleted" with DIRIT.
        2.  Added "XMAGNUM" command to run (SYS)XMAGNUM.
        3.  Added the "VUE" command to run the VUE editor.
        4.  Added "PCOM" and "DCOM" command to run the PCOM program.
        5.  Deleted the obsolete "PCHECK" command.
        6.  Added "USESTAT" command to display incremental frame data.
        7.  Added "TTY [NO] RTCOMP" to allow "^T" to force USESTAT on a
            running frame.  [Only works in PDP mode] 
        8.  Added "SET [NO]AUTOLOGUT" to set or clear INACTIVITY TIMEOUT time.
        9.  Created "TALK GAN" command to allow OPER (with OP license set) or
            an account supervisor to issue a TALK message to all users in the
            appropriate GAN.  
       10.  Changed the "DAYTIME" command to print the time zone after the
            time.
       11.  Created Special Command Mode.  When SCMODE is enabled and user
            types a command the system does not recognize, the system will run
            the program (in the user's list of selected directories) whose
            name matches the command.

    B.  Miscellaneous:

        1.  Updated text messages which had referred to "jobs" to refer to
	    "frames".
        2.  Increased the network terminal ID code (TIC) field to 5 bits.
        3.  Changed monitor "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message to "I/O ERROR".
        4.  Allowed ATTACH UUO to simulate a continue command upon attach.
        5.  Corrected misplaced scanner timing routines to use the proper
            locations so that users may GETTAB their values.
        6.  Added entries for new tymnet terminal types.
        7.  Enlarged baud rate field from 3 to 4 bits for Tymnet
            specifications.  
        8.  Added AUXCAL 100 (.AXTTP) to set sixbit terminal type.

    C.  Processor specific changes:

        1.  Modified interrupt table initialization for KS processors.
        2.  Don't negotiate BLOCK I/O ports on KS and F3 micronode bases.
        3.  Fix clock-timer during ONCE/FILES when refreshing a KS disk.
