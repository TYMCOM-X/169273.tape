Has the license command been changed?  When I assign license to
my command files, it always aborts now.  It worked fine up
until about 4 weeks ago (at the same time the STATUS command
was removed).

When I issue license to a program, it aborts saying  ABORT-LICENSE.
It worked fine until the changes made to SUBMIT were done.  The date
it started failing was the same day as when the STATUS command was
removed.

Is this normal?

Subject: Tried to run FNDBAD - got Abort-License 3 times in a row. 

System 62 was reloaded.  When it came up, my FNDBAD job was marked as
Abort-License.  I cancelled the original, inserted a new one, and then did
a RERUN on it.  It got Abort-License.  Maybe it was dying because of some
sort of error it gets on the first job after startup that needs license.
So I inserted another entry, RERUN on it, expecting it to take off running.
It aborted also!.  What is going on?    /Joe

I THINK THE LICENSE PROBLEM IS SOLVED (FOR NOW).  I HAD
ENTERED LICENSE AS   LIC ALL   BEFORE AND IT WORKED FINE
(BEFORE THE CHANGES TO SUBMIT).  I RETRIED IT WITH SPECIFING
THE SPECIFIC LICENSES REQUIRED AND IT WORKED.  MY TEST RUNS
WORKED OK, I AM WAITING ON THE SCHEDULED RUNS TOMORROW AM
TO SEE IF IT DOES WORK OK.  

YOU MAIL SPECIFING THE THE YOUR MAIL MENTIONING THE SPECIFIC LICENSES PROMPTED ME TO TRY 
THIS CHANGE.  (ACTUALLY, I WAS GOING TO TRY IT BEFORE BUT I
DO NOT KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL LICENSE ABRV. THAT WELL.)

A suggestion.
I think a help to the user, when scanning a log file, would be a format for 
the list of number of lines skipped when doing a :BACKTO that somehow resembles
the listing of the lines skipped when doing a :GOTO.  I.e., indent the line
displaying the number of lines of control file skipped by a tab, ... and 
replace the lines immediately preceding and following it with lines consisting
of a tab and an ellipsis (or some other space taker).  This would provide the
user with a short block of indented lines indicating a skip, somewhat like a
forward skip.  I know it would greatly help me in reading the log file created
by your test.ctl.

Just a suggestion.   -D.-

SEND FILE doesn't seem to work.

I tried using the SEND FILE command in a command file.  It didn't sem to work.
Command:
:SEND FILE STUFF.FIL

File contents:

;                THIS IS FILE "STUFF.FIL".  INCLUDED IN THIS JOB WITH THE LINE:
;                       ":SEND FILE STUFF.FIL"
;

The test in the file should have be included in the log file, if it was sent to
the frame.  Nothing showed in the log file.  (Prev. line:  'test' should be 
'text'.)

a small error in the online HELP output.
? at the OPTIONS> prompt says "Type 'option-name ?' for help ...".  The syntax
is incorrect.  Proper format, to get help info about a particular option is
'help option-name'.  Typing what is currently documented in the help message
gives an error message in response, saying that 'help' or '?' is not a valid
parameter for option-name.  -D.-

A suggestion, re. log files.
I believe that currently no log file is created unless a log file name is
specified with the INSERT command.  I don't see any reason why the user
couldn't enter his command file name (or RUN program file name) with the INSERT
command, then just enter the logging action declaration at the OPTION> prompt.

I.e., the word LOG, without an argument, could cause logging into the file
<jobname>.LOG, with the supersede action.  This would be after defaulting to
no log file due to no log file name specification at the INSERT prompt (with
either the wild-card or <cr> response to the prompt).

It seems easier, and less likely to log to the wrong file name than my having
to type the log file name every time~v
(This logging to the wrong file has already happened to me, while testing.)

When SUBMIT is doing a LIST, how hard would it be to output the entries

queued jobs.   /Joe

Subject: LIST loops on CANCELed entries. 

The bug you mentioned about SUBMIT stopping on the first canceled entry is
much more serious than you had let on.  I had two entries in the queue, canceled
the first one, then tried "LIST".  SUBMIT was stuck in an infinite loop with
Control-C being trapped!  TURN OFF THE *#$%&# CONTROL-C TRAP!!!!!  If you
must have it, enable ONLY during the critical code and disable IMMEDIATELY
afterward!
  Operations is not going to like see naive users running a job that
chews up all the CPU cycles and cannot be killed.

I inserted a job this weekend called  bubbxr.aux.  Now whenever I try
to display it or reference it in anyway submit freezes.  It is stuck.
cCan you free it?  I have to rerun it today.

Thanks.

A bug in SUBMIT's verifying wild-card job I.D.s.
I believe the following happens, and is undesirable:  
A user with access to other users (ie: with Account Supervisor status) gets
different responses to the use of a wild-card character in the job ident-
ification for the command, depending on whether he has a job which meets
the I.D. specs provided.

E.g.:  I had a job entered, name:   (DENCOFF)TST1.  I entered 4 more jobs, all
with name:  (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1.
I gave the command:  DELETE (NOT-DENCOFF)TST1 *.  SUBMIT asked for verification
for each deletion.
I deleted 2 of the four jobs this way.
I gave the command:  DELETE TST1 *.  All 3 remaining TST! jobs were deleted 
immediately:  two from (NOT-DENCOFF) and one from (DENCOFF).

i will test further to ascertain whether the non-verifying happens when no
username is provided, or when a job with the user's username matchs the job
specs provided.

Subject: Possible bug in verifying wild-carded job I.D.s. 

Carl,

Re. my previous message re. commands working on jobs identified with
wild-cards in part of I.D.:  I have done further testing and found out about
the verifying for individual jobs from among the group selected via wild-card
characters.  The verifying is turned on only if a username is provided in the
job name.  If the user has sufficient status, DELETE * * will wipe out the
queue.  (At least it did for me.)

AM STILL having probllems with 2 of my jobs.  They are DETCH1.PER and
DETCH2.PER.  They are supposed to run on weekdays at 4:00.  They run
for 24 hours.  They work fine as long as the system does not have problems.
*but 
but when the system has problems, they seem to get deleted from the queue.
And, don't run.  Yesterday (2/16), DETCH2 started at 04:00, and DETCH1
started at 10:00.  The system went down around noon and came up around
23:00.  Neither of the jobs started at 4 this morning, and both have been
deleted from the queue.  I received no mail (mail=error).

MY 2 JOBS DETCH1 AND DETCH2 DID NOT RUN LAST NIGHT AT 0400.  DETCH1 SAID
"ABORT-NORMAL" IN QUEUE.  DETCH2 WAS DELETED FROM QUEUE.  THE OUTPUT FOR
BOTH JOBS SAID "LOST COMMAND PORT AT LINE 4".  BOTH HAVE "UNIQUE NONE"
OPTION SET.  THERE WERE JOBS WITH THE SAME NAME ALREADY RUNNING.  DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE "UNIQUE NONE" WORKS YET.

My job CKTOLD.PER #1964 did not halt when it produced a ? in the output.
The HALT option was set to NO.

If you SET TTY WIDTH 72, then the LIST is double spaced.  Even though the
info fits within 71 columns, every line has trailing blanks.  Why is the
listing padded out to column 74?

System 58 needs SUBMIT version 205.
I got mail from 58 when SZRPT.CTL was aborted due to system reset.  I thought
I had RESTART START set, but when I looked, the request was gone.  I re-entered
the request with "DATE EVERY DAY AT 0:45" to SUBMIT version 200, and it ran
immediately.  That was OK for this particular request, but not expected.  It
looks like edit 203 also fixes this problem - SUBMIT version 205 does not have
it.  One final comment: should SUBMIT.SAI really be protected ALL ALL ALL?
