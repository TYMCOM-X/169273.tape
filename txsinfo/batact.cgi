     Batch program, initiated by Henri via his message #A31491, dated
     March 3rd.
 
     Action will be taken by the Tymxom X support group to alter the Batch
     code so that transfers to FBATCH and SLIBATCH will no longer take
     place.
 
     Dennis Coffey will be in touch with us soon, indicating a time table
     for this change.  Best regards. Ken

     Eric, thank you for the Ontyme memo of November 19th, regarding the
     CTF accounting project.  I have checked with responsible parties here
     and have the following response or comments; I'll use your item num-
     bers as reference:
 
      1.  It appears you need very little additional information because
          you have taken care of most all issues yourself;
 
           a.  Tymcom 370: Nikki Marsh has indicated support will be
               available as required.  CTF will be notified if any changes
               take place.
 
           b.  Tymcom X: I have discussed this area with Dennis Coffey.
               User names CTMKTG1 and CTMKTG7 are valid on host 930 and
               the two Oper names mentioned are also valid.  However, Den-
               nis would prefer for you to access the information in the
               "INFO" data base on a host other than 930, as the Tymcom X
               group plans to eliminate many of the Oper names (Read
               files) from this host.
 
               Dennis can allow for "INFO" to be available on any host you
               choose, at the same time it is updated on host 930.  I
               imagine you would prefer host 90 for this data?  Please
               let me know the following:
 
               Is host 90 your preferred host for this information?
 
               How much informaton from "info" do you require?

 
Cegi Tymshare accounting project                                    Page 2
 
 
 
               Do you anticipate any problem if your "RF" license is
               removed from host 930?
 
               Regarding Perp, Telecopy and PCOM:  PCOM and Telecopy will
               continue to be supported and available for your needs.
 
               PERP will eventually disappear, possibly as early as Janu-
               ary '86, due to problems which you may already be familiar;
               if not early '86, then likely by December '86.  Is Perp
               critical to your operation, as long as PCOM is available?
               The Tymcom X group is working on an alternative to PERP,
               but timing is uncertain at this time.
 
           c.  Validations:  You will continue to have access to these
               database(s); user name CTOPSMGR is already valid on host
               74.
 
               Changes are being made at present time, for security rea-
               sons, as related to these data bases; therefore, Jan Kriva-
               nec requires the following information from you as soon as
               possible:
 
               Which user name will you use (we assume it to be CTOPSMGR)?
 
               Which OPER name will be used?
 
               The above two items must be set up in a file, for security
               reasons, so you'll be authorized to use the X22 validations
               data base.
 
               Specifically, which files will you require (i.e.
               USERDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS etc.)?
 
               Jan will notify CTF of any future changes, prior to changes
               being made.
 
           d.  Tape library: I spoke with Bob Jacobs.  Bob states the cen-
               tral tape library is generally accessed via a 370 by exe-
               cuting the command TAPELIB EXEC, which builds an 'auxiliary
               circuit' to host 74 (TAPELIBE).
 
               Since I know nothing about Tapelib, please let Bob know if
               you require any additional information on this item.
 
      2.  You apparantly do not require any additional tools from MIS or
          CP/CMS.
 
      3.  I understand you will also do accounting for Tymcom X host S90,
          three hosts in total, for now.
 
      4.  I'd suggest we continue with the present accounting arrangement
          (MIS continue to supply e-o-m invoices, detail, royalty and MRD

 
Cegi Tymshare accounting project                                    Page 3
 
 
          files) through January '86, or perhaps longer, in order to
          insure that all is working on both sides.
 
          AND, that you are able to supply me (or royalty accounting in
          St. Louis) with the royalty accounting for all 3 hosts.  I would
          prefer to receive the same information as is presently supplied
          by MIS but I realize you do not have the relevant royalty code
          available.  Can you give me an indication what can be supplied?
          I would need totals of connect, tru and pru (prime, n-prime and
          Batchtym) by user name and host as the present MIS system sup-
          plies.  Is this workable?  This is the one and only item that we
          require from your hosts (i.e. royalty information for 3rd party
          vendors).  Please let me know your thoughts?
 
      5.  Implementation plan appears fine except for issues in item 4
          above.
 
     Conclusion: All parties involved have indicated they will keep CTF
     informed on any changes, cancellation of specific entities etc.  The
     groups are CMS/CP (Tymcom 370), Tymcom X, Validations, MIS and the
     Tape Library.
 
     Do you have a specific plan on the best means for communicating these
     changes?
 
     We look forward to your comments and suggestions.  Best regards. Ken

             A16297 dated 07-FEB-86 from IOD.CUPERTINO

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when we have a problem
 
      PERP: we are still waiting for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.


      Regards,
      Dennis

     Phil, Henri Tocheport of Sligos has recently requested that we elimi-
     nate the old Batch arrangement whereby Batch requests submitted by
     users in branch 38 are dumped into the SLIBATCH directory.  It seems
     they no longer have a need for the "translation" of such requests and
     prefer to have them placed in the standard BATCH (OPS) directory.
 
     I have spoken with Carl Baltrunas about this issue.  What we would
     like to do is eliminate both the Sligos and Cegi Tymshare special
     arrangement whereby Batch requests are dumped to either the SLIBATCH
     or FBATCH directory, depending on the branch number of the requestor.
 
     So, the question is: Would you foresee any problem in eliminating
     this special lookup arrangement within the Tymcom X Batch system?  I
     suspect most, if not all, of your billable clients are on host S90,
     therefore translation is likely not required; basically, no need for
     two requests when one will do, directly to BATCH directory.
 
     Please let us know if you have any objection to eliminating the code
     within the Batch program which performs the above process.  It would
     likely make the Batch mechanism more efficient by eliminating the
     branch lookup code and could allow for easier enhancement to the code,
     if required in the future.
 
     We look forward to your earliest response.  Regards. Ken

KEN,

I JUST RECEIVED YOUR MEMO ABOUT TYMCOM X BATCH PROGRAM.
I THINK YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE CODE WITHIN THE BATCH PROGRAM WHICH PERFORMS
THE "SPECIAL ROUTE" BETWEEN SLIBATCH AND FBATCH DIRECTORY.
ACTUALLY IT WILL BE BETTER ALL BATCHES ARE STORED  AND MANAGED FROM
FBATCH DIRECTORY. IN FACT SINCE MAY SLIGOS SUBMITTED A FEW BATCHES WENT
DIRECTLY TO SLIOPER DIRECTORY. IL WILL BE EASIER FOR THE OPERATORS
TO HANDLE TYMCOM X S90 FROM ONLY ONE DIRECTORY.

THANK YOU AND BEST REGARDS.  PHIL

     Phil, thanks for the memo regarding Batch program on the X's.
 
     Your memo stated:  "Actually it will be better all batches are stored
     and managed from FBATCH directory."
 
     I'm a little confused by this because the 'standard' procedure does
     not use the FBATCH directory to my knowledge; in fact, I'm not cer-
     tain of the directory used via the standard Batch program.
 
     In any event, I am requesting Dennis Coffey and Carl Baltrunas, via
     copy of this memo, to proceed with the change which will eliminate
     the transfer of Batch requests to either the SLIBATCH or FBATCH
     directory (as based on district number of the user).
 
     If this is contrary to your understanding, please let me know imme-
     diately.
 
     Best regards. Ken
