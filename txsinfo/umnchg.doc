Changes to the TYMCOM-X Monitor (Operating System) between P034/J and P034/P




I.  Reliability:

     A.  Many bug fixes have been installed to prevent most of the known
         causes of software crashes.  Some of the most notable fixes:

         1.  Prevented hang while attempting to shut down the system using
             TAKEIT or LOGOUT.

         2.  Fixed problem that allowed XBASIC and PASCAL to crash a system
             while closing channel 0 from monitor context.

         3.  Fixed TYMCARE 2020 problem recovering from ECC correction at
             end of cylinder.

         4.  Fixed crash problem produced by creating files with bad RIBS
             in PASCAL.

         5.  Fixed zapper problem on PTYs in block IO to prevent system
             crashes while using the PCOM program.

         6.  Fixed the problem with freecore which caused a system to crash
             when too many files were open and the system ran out of
             freecore.

     B.  Prevented deadly embrace problems which occurred when two frames
         attempted to mutually read each others core images.

     C.  Eliminated the SPARE-LDB and it's myriad of associated problems.

     D.  Make AUXCAL 10 (.AXSIC) work correctly with RESCAN, similar to
         SKPINC (TTCALL 13) for command ports.

     E.  The port backpressure algorithm has been rewritten to help prevent
         character lossage.

     F.  Fix input and skip AUXCALs to not go into OUTPUT wait because of
         backpressure problems.

     G.  Fixed backpressure problem found by TTMS when the input line
         exceeds the maximum length under certain specific conditions.

     H.  Modify WSCTL call to not change the user working set status while
         performing a read operation.

     A.  Fixed problem that sometimes caused crash when Setuuo to talk to a
         frame (.Sttlk) was executed for a frame in the process of logging out.

     B.  Fixed problem that caused crash when CORE command deleted Hiseg.

     C.  Fixed problem that caused crash or bogus device name to be printed
         when address check error message was necessary.

     D.  Fixed problem that caused crash when closing a file that was doing
         buffered i/o.  Solves XBASIC Getseg crashes.

     E.  Cleaned up ONCE dialog.  Removed all references to the obsolete
         swapping area.  Removed references to ONCDSK.

     F.  Fixed problem that caused bad pack set ID message to be printed
         when building a file structure from a virgin pack set.

     G.  Fixed problem that sometimes caused two frames looking at each
         other's address spaces to deadlock.

     H.  Fixed problem that caused job capacity exceeded not to zap port.

     I.  Only negotiate for block I/O ports if host is on a Tymnet base.
         That is, if system is a KI or KL.  This solves the problem Rainier
         Bank was having with block I/O negotiation.

     J.  Check for yellow ball arrived when Tinass UUO is issued to enable
         interrupt on receipt of yellow ball.  This prevents yellow ball
         races.

     K.  Fixed problem that caused creation of a frame to sometimes crash a
         KI when a particular hardware bug exists.  This solves PCOM
         induced crashes.

     A.  Uptime (crash causes eliminated)
	1.  TALK message to a frame in the process of logging out.
	2.  CORE command clearing an active user high-segment.
	3.  Address error using previous context registers causing an
	    executive page map failure.
	4.  GETSEG which destroyed I/O state while performing old-style
	    buffered I/O.  [XBASIC]
	5.  Mapping pages into a file in a directory that is over quota.
	6.  FRMOP .FOCFH doing an executive XCT of HRRM to from exec
	    registers to user registers failing and writing instead to
	    the exec registers.  [Hardware ECO missing!]  Code changed.
	7.  Releasing (removing) context pages for another frame.
	8.  Improper output on bad port with garbaged LDBOUT bits.
	9.  Catch loop in DDB linkages which caused a system hang.
       10.  Tape read errors on F3s caused by improper page calculation.

  1)  Fixed the INPUT RING PROCESSING TIMEOUT crash problem caused by an
      improperly setup user page map.

  2)  Stopcode information is output to the CTY when the system crashes,
      instead of just the enigmatic BOOTS LOADED message.  The new messages
      contain more information than is reported by CRSHID.  For more details
      on the stopcode mechanism, see the accompanying document STOPCD.MEM.

  3)  Fixed the problem with running out of FRECOR and restricted the size
      of FRECOR allocated on smaller processors to allow more memory for
      user frames.



II.  Performance:

     A.  Catch interrupts which previously were lost while sleeping using
         the HIBER UUO.

     B.  Fixed freecore pointer to work for bit tables larger than 144
         words thus allowing a larger amount of freecore to be specified.

     A.  Removed some obsolete code and data structures.  This results in
         more space available for user programs.

     B.  Changed the way that some data structures are allocated so that
         the aggregate maximum number of files open on a system can be
         increased.

     C.  Make old style file I/O use VMOVPG (see below) to improve its
         efficiency.

    B.  Operational Efficiency  (Refer to memo to Operations Centers)
	1.  Modified ONCE and ONCDSK commands and messages to aid the
	    operations staff in performing the correct functions.
	2.  Fixed pack-set ID on virgin packs during a system re-build.
	3.  Removed all code referring to obsolete SWAP space when a
	    refresh or rebuild is required for a pack-set or strucure.
	4.  Amplified many console messages during system restart.
	5.  Added the NETWORK command and modified operation of CONSOLE
	    command in ONCE to flag the use of TYMNET (default) or the
	    CTY when bringing the system up in any available mode.
	6.  Allowed CHANGE SYSTEM on hosts with micro-node bases to set
	    the system number between 1 and 99999.  Affects KS-10 & F3.
	7.  Changed CONSOLE mode to allow all commands to be entered
	    in either upper or lower case.  Added (^Z?) help message.

    C.  Added cache-sweep in crash code so that the crash dump will
	reflect the same data in memory that the CPU saw at the time
	of the crash.  [KL-10 only].

    D.  Performance
	1.  More dynamic allocation of internal data structures to take
	    advantage of the epanding size of available memory.
	2.  Force updating of the home pages as an integral part of a
	    REFRESH to avoid inconsistancy problems at system startup.
	3.  Added INACTIVITY TIMOUT feature to logout a frame after a
	    specified period with no activity.  (See below for more).
	4.  Added new hang flag to hard-kill a frame without detaching.
	5.  Default SNOOP feature "off", changeable in DDT at startup.
	6.  Prevent race condition with yellow balls and interrupts.
	7.  Fixup test for disk unit off-line for F3 processor only.
	8.  Don't clear the cache sweep done flag on KL-10 since the
	    operating system always waits for the sweep to complete.
	9.  Added LOGOUT ON STOP feature to force a LOGOUT on a frame
	    if it stops for any reason.  Set with SETPRV (CALLI -11).
       10.  Increase the default Open Files per Frame to accomodate the
	    systems with more than 1 Meg. of available memory.
       11.  Allow executive free-core to automatically expand to use all
	    of the available executive memory after startup.

    E.  Security
	1.  Added CL.DMP flag to CLOSE UUO for TITO to set the file-
	    dumped bit without possibly losing data during an update.
	2.  Zap the current circuit when "frame capacity exceeded" is
	    detected upon network LOGIN so as to prevent confusion.
	3.  Check frame license for same or greater capabilities in
	    the source frame when attaching to another frame.
	4.  Return maximum current license on a file instead of none
	    when attempting to set greater file license.
	5.  Give special (!) prompt instead of (.) in PDP mode when a
	    user has any license set.

    F.  Maintenance of Sources
	1.  Correction of incorrect MACRO definitions and calls.
	2.  Removal of "Special"-Externals from the sources.
	3.  Reorganization of symbols for less complicated references.
	4.  Correction of typographical errors in code.
	5.  Simplification and reorganization of configuration symbols.
	6.  Formula radix correction to prevent F3 tape crashes.
	7.  Removed obsolete swapping code and various obsolete tables.
	8.  Eliminated module ERRMSG by merging it with module ERRCON.


     A.  Speed improvement
         1.  Added CHANIO 47 (.CHVMP) to map a private page into a file.

     B.  Frame handling UUOs
         1.  Added FRMOP 41 (.FOSTP) to simulate an <ESC> on a frame.
         2.  Added FRMOP 42 (.FOFCF) to force a special command.
         3.  Added FRMOP 43 (.FOCPC) to change the project code.
         4.  Added FLSTOP (CALLI -147) to stop with a halt status 4,,7.
         5.  Added FLEXIT (CALLI -142) to exit with a halt status 4,,2.
         6.  Fixed FRMOP 22 (.FOSVA) to read the start offset correctly.

     C.  Changed FRMOP .FOCFM (Create Frame) to new a format which allows
         the changed privilege bits and license bits of the parent to be
        passed to the child frame.  The LOGINN program may also be run
         for user validation at this time.

    D.  Added INACTIVITY TIMEOUT feature at request of COEES.  A frame
         with this feature enabled will be logged off after the specified
         (or default) time limit in minutes, set by the SET AUTOLOGOUT
         command, SETINA (CALLI -146) or SETPRV (CALLI -11).  The current
         timeout limit may be read with .GTINA (GETTAB -55).

    E.  Added Special Command Mode (SCM) to run the users Restricted
         Command Mode (RCM) program for un-recognized monitor commands.
         Settable with SETPRV (CALLI -11) and SETRCF (CALLI -57).  With
         this change the monitor command running the RCM or SCM will be
         found in SIXBIT in user register 1 to avoid a double rescan.




III.  New Features:

     A.  Added a micro-cycle timing clock to allow other Tymshare products
         to improve their performance.  CALLI -144 (SETMCY) was added to
         set the micro-cycle timer and interrupt type 15 was added to use
         the timer.

     B.  Added UNDEL command to "undelete" files "deleted" with DIRIT.

     C.  Added XMAGNUM command to run (SYS)XMAGNUM.

     D.  Changed the DAYTIME command to print the time zone after the time.

     E.  Added CHNIO function 46 (.CHNXT) to get the next free channel.

     F.  Added access right 32 for passing license to another frame.

     G.  Prevent AUX CIRCUITS from logging into a SHUT system.

     H.  Added entries for new Tymnet terminal types.

     I.  Changed baud rate field from 3 to 4 bits as per Tymnet
         specifications.

     J.  Added AUXCAL 100 (.AXTTP) to set sixbit terminal type.

     K.  Added the VUE command to run the VUE editor.

     L.  Define a new error class 3 subtype to be called when an illegal
         CALL parameter is given, HT.CAL (4).

     M.  Fixed frame access rights checking routines to check child rights
         rather than parents rights where appropriate.  This was done
         incorrectly in the past.

III.  New Features and Changes:

     A.  Added POP command.  POP attaches a user to his parent (if any) and
         logs out the current frame.

     B.  Added TALK GAN command to allow a user to talk to everyone in his
         GAN if he is the account supervisor or has OP license.

     C.  Added PCOM and DCOM commands to run Pcom and the PEAK command to
         run the Peak editor.

     D.  Added capability to scale the TRU.  XCHARG function 7 was
         implemented to allow the user to set scale factors.

     E.  Changed UNDEL command to UNDELETE.

     F.  Removed PCHECK command.

     G.  Added capability to display incremental frame data with ^T.  The
         capability can be enabled and disabled with the TTY [NO] RTCOMP
         command and Auxcal 101.

     H.  Added inactivity timeout capability.  Once-a-minute a counter is
         incremented for every frame.  A frame's counter is cleared when
         that frame becomes active.  Frames that exceed a set limit are
         evicted if so enabled, otherwise they are killed.  The limit can
         be set with the SET AUTOLOGOUT <minutes> command and cleared with
         the SET NOAUTOLOGOUT command.  Also, it can be modified with Calli
         -146, or set to a default (15 min.) with privilege bit lh 400.
         Gettab -55 was added to read the inactivity word.

     I.  Updated several messages to refer to frames instead of jobs.

     J.  Replaced "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message with the more explanatory
         "I/O error on file FILNAM.EXT".

     K.  Give a "!" as prompt if PDP mode is in effect and any license is
         set.

     L.  Added Frmop 41 (Stop Frame).  This allows a ^C to be simulated on
         a frame.

     M.  Added Frmop 42 to allow a command to be forced on a frame plus the
         new Frmop error code 37 (illegal command).

     N.  Added Frmop 43 to allow a project code for a frame to be changed.

     O.  Added new style .Focfm (Create Frame) to allow Loginn to be run in
         child and to allow license to be passed to child.

     P.  Copy project code from parent to child in Create Frame.

     Q.  Added frame fail stop (Calli -147) and frame fail exit (Calli
         -142) and associated error codes.

     R.  Added Chanio function 47 (Vmovpg).  This is the capability to move
         a private page into a file.

     S.  Added new Close flag 200 to set file dumped bit.  This allows TITO
         to set file dumped bit without having to do a Rename and
         potentially changing some other RIB data.

     T.  Changed Attach to require that the target have less or the same
         frame license as the source in order for the attach to succeed.

     U.  Changed Setlic so that the requested read and write privileges are
         not zeroed if they are greater than the corresponding frame
         license entries.

     V.  Added new mail waiting bit JP.MAI (1B8) in privlege word to
         indicate that new mail is waiting.  This allows a new mail system
         to be implemented without confusing users of the old system.

     W.  Added new Hang flag (1B13) to hard kill a frame without detaching.

     X.  Widened terminal ID code (TIC) field to 5 bits.

     Y.  Allow ATTACH and RETACH UUOs to force target frame to RUN state if
         desired.



III.  Accounting

     A.  TRU scaling added for value-added and royalty products.

     B.  Fixed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to pass the project code to the child.

     C.  Fixed FRMOP 1 (.FOCFM) to write an accounting record using the
         proper supervisor information (node/port of origin) for the
         newly created frame.


 IV.  Miscellaneous features

     A.  New or Changed commands
         1.  Change UNDEL command to UNDELETE for ease of use.
         2.  Added PCOM and DCOM command to run the PCOM program.
         3.  Deleted the obsolete PCHECK command.
         4.  Added USESTAT command to display incremental frame data.
         5.  Added TTY [NO] RTCOMP to allow (^T) to force USESTAT on a
             running frame.  [Only works in PDP mode] (AUXCAL 101).
         6.  SET [NO]AUTOLOGUT to set or clear INACTIVITY TIMEOUT time.
         7.  TALK GAN to allow OPER (OP license) or an account supervisor
             to issue a TALK message to all users in the appropriate GAN.

     B.  Miscellaneous
         1.  Add internal counters for OHT disk-page processing.
         2.  Provide better handling of own %UPT lock.
         3.  Update various text messages to refer to frames.
         4.  Correct the CHANIO function range check.
         5.  Handle page argument of -1 for various mapping calls.
         6.  Increase the network terminal ID code (TIC) field to 5 bits.
         7.  Change monitor "TRANSMISSION ERROR" message to "I/O ERROR".
         8.  Allow ATTACH UUO to simulate a continue command upon attach.
         9.  Correct misplaced scanner timing routines to use the proper
             locations so that users may GETTAB their values.

     C.  Processor specific changes
         1.  Modified interrupt table initialization for KS processors.
         2.  Changed F3 processor check instructions to accomodate the
             new microcode making the F3 look more like a KL-10.
         3.  Only for negotiate BLOCK I/O ports on VARIAN bases (KI/KL)s.
         4.  Fix clock-timer during ONCE/FILES when refreshing a KS disk

New features:

  1)  The frame inactivity timeout feature is now fully implemented.  The
      timeout may be set and read both by the "SET AUTOLOGOUT n" monitor
      command and the SETINA, SETPRV and GETTAB UUOs.  In addition, this
      feature can be enabled automatically by setting the appropriate bit
      in the LUD.  A system-wide default may be set by the operator or
      system administrator using the command "SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY n".

  2)  The TRU limit for a job may now be set or extended by both the monitor
      command "SET LIMIT n" and the SETLIM UUO.  A frame my now request an
      interrupt when the TRU limit has been exceeded.

  3)  New GETTAB tables have been added.  These tables will be fully
      documented in the next release of the YAMM.

  4)  Some errors which caused the system to be reloaded are now continuable
      stopcodes.  Instead of causing "BOOTS LOADED", these errors now output
      a message to the CTY describing the problem.  If the error affects only
      one frame, then that frame is halted, but the system as a whole continues
      running.
