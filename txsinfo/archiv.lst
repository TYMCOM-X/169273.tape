     Introduction     ____________

     Archive was created and is used exclusively by Tymshare, Inc.  as  a
     transfer  and  retrival  system  for software supported by Tymshare.
     The Archive program can be  found  in  QASYS  on  all  the  TYMCOM-X
     systems, each system with it's own customized version.  However, the
     Data Base used in the Lookup segment of the program  is  located  on
     system 38 only, due to storage space and maintenance considerations.

     There are three ports of access in the Archive  program.   They  are
     Lookup,  Transfer,  and  Build.   Each  one of these is described in
     detail in the following text.


     Operation     _________

     Archive is accessed by the usual "R" command  along  with  directory
     specification QASYS, as follows:

     -R (QASYS)ARCHIVE

     The program will respond with an asterisk, indicating the main entry
     point  to  the three branches of the program.  The entry point has a
     complete  commands  front  end  along  with  Credits   and   Version
     information.   Typing  "HELP" or "?" will print the list of commands
     used at the entry point.

     Typing LOOKUP, TRANSFER, or BUILD  will  access  one  of  the  three
     substructures of the Archive program.  Each of the substructures has
     their own "HELP" command, which gives a list  of  commands  for  the
     specific  port.   Also included in the substructures are Instruction
     and Capability commands.


     Transfer     ________

     The Transfer command is initiated by typing "RUN".  The program will
     respond  with  five  questions in sequence.  The questions and field
     lengths are as follows:

                     Program                 10 Chars.
                     Version                  8 Chars.
                     Transmittal No.          6 Chars.
                     Comments                16 Chars.
                     Source File             24 Chars.

                                                                 PAGE   2



     The Source File may be satisfied by  a  File  Name,  (Directory)File
     Name  or @File Name (indicating an indirect file list).  The file or
     files indicated will then be  copied  to  directory  QALIBSYM.   The
     file(s) will be deleted from the directory from which it was copied.
     The information input, prompted by the five questions,  is  appended
     to  QAXX.CMD, where XX is the system number.  QAXX.CMD is also found
     in QALIBSYM.  The list command will dump the contents  of  QAXX.CMD.
     This can be a means of confirming the transfer.

     Occasionally the transfer will not  be  completed.   There  are  two
     possibilities why the transfer was not completed.  The first is that
     there is already a file in Qalibsym with the source file  name.   If
     not, the other possibility is that the quota for Qalibsym would have
     been exceeded if the file were transferred.  These can  be  remedied
     by  renaming  the  source  file or expanding the disk quota.  If the
     disk quota should have to be expanded, it is time that the files are
     stored.


     Lookup     ______

     The Lookup Data Base  is  currently  on  system  38,  however,  each
     Archive  program  on  each system has the capabilities of looking up
     Archive records.  All that is necessary for Lookup to operate is  to
     have  the  Data  Base and Pointer Tables in Qasys.  If the files are
     not in Qasys and a Lookup is attempted,  the  program  will  respond
     with  an  appropriate  error  message.   The  files  necessary for a
     complete Data Base are as follows:

                     DATBAS
                     TR.PNT
                     PN.PNT
                     DATE.PNT
                     FN.PNT
                     POINT.SAF

     There are five access methods to "key" on a  record.   The  key-word
     structures are as follows:

         KEY-WORD          COMMAND STRUCTURE

         FILENAME        FN1,FN2,FN3.*,ETC.
         PROG.NAME       PN1,PN2,...,PNN
         DATE            MM-DD-YY,MM-DD-YY,MM-DD-YY THRU MM-DD-YY,ETC.
         TRANSMITTAL.NO  TRANS1,TRANS2,TRANS3 THRU TRANS4,ETC.
         LIST            LISTS OUT ALL FILE NAMES IN DATA BASE

     Wild card characters may be used with key-word  Filename.   However,
     only  one  file  name is allowed when wild card characters are used.

                                                                 PAGE   3



     The asterisk (*) or "EXT" is used for a wild card extension.


     Build     _____

     Before the Data Base can be built, the files  from  Qalibsym  to  be
     added  to the data base must be put onto Archive Tape AXXX and BXXX,
     where  XXX  indicates  the  next  sequential  Archive  tape  number.
     QAXX.CMD  (where  XX  represents the system number) should be stored
     along with the Qalibsym files to be stored,  for  each  system  from
     which  files are to be taken.  The following is a list of files that
     should not be stored onto the tape:

                     SIZE.PRP
                     QAXX
                     CXX
                     CXX.XYZ
                     CHART.*
                     TEMP
                     TOTALS

     These files are related to a  charting  program  which  generates  a
     directory of all PDP-10 Qalibsym directories (See Chart).

     The files to be stored must be put on each tape twice, not only  for
     security  reasons  but  also  for  proper building of the Data Base.
     Once the files have been put onto tape, they  may  be  deleted  from
     Qalibsym with the exception of the QAXX.CMD files.

     The actual storing onto tape may be done by batch request.  Included
     in  the  batch  request should be a request for hardcopy directories
     and a request that the TEX version directory for AXXX  be  put  into
     disk  file AXXX in Qasys on system 38.  If the TEX version directory
     is not availiable, the directory will have to be modified by running
     "DIRMOD"  in  Qasys.  The program will prompt for the directory name
     (AXXX must be in Qasys).   The  new  directory  will  be  output  to
     AXXX.TEX where it can be checked before copying to AXXX.

     In order to properly build  the  Archive  Data  Base,  the  QAXX.CMD
     command files from systems from which files were stored and the AXXX
     tape directory must reside in Qasys on system 38.  Also included  in
     Qasys must be the file "PASSWD" containing the appropriate password.
     The Build can either be run through a PERP  job  or  manually.   The
     PERP  command  file is BUILD.PRP, and output is to a file BUILD.OUT.
     To run the PERP job, the user must be logged into Qasys on 38.  File
     BUILD.PRP should be edited so that line 7 will have the current tape
     directory name AXXX.  The following is an example of how PERP is  to
     be run.  Underlined characters are user typed instructions.

                                                                 PAGE   4



             -R PERP              _ ____

             :DATE              ____

             ENTER YOUR DATE PERIOD
             TODAY.                      <INDICATES ONCE TODAY>             ______

             :INS              ___

             WHAT HOUR(0 TO 23)18        <INDICATES 1800 PDT>                               __

             COMPUTER 38                      __

             PROJECT CODE                <CARRIAGE RETURN>


             COMMAND FILE NAME BUILD.PRP                               _________

             BUILDING CIRCUIT TO MASTER PERP SYSTEM

             :LIST              ____


             :QUIT              ____


     After the PERP job has been completed, mail will be sent  to  Qasys.
     BUILD.OUT  will  contain  all  the  information  that Archive passed
     during the build cycle.

     To run the build cycle manually, the user merely accesses the  build
     substructure  by  typing  "BUILD".   After the substructure responds
     with ">", the user types in the tape directory file name  AXXX.   If
     there is a message at this point that the password is incorrect, the
     correct password must be put into file PASSWD and the build must  be
     rerun.   The  program  will search for AXXX and copy it to a scratch
     file JUNK.TMP.  The tape directory will be processed and  the  files
     appended  to  the  Data  Base.   If  any errors should occur at this
     point, they should be remedied and the safeguard Hold  files  should
     be copied to the Data Base and Pointer Tables as follows:

             DATBAS.HLD      COPY TO         DATBAS
             FN.HLD          COPY TO         FN.PNT
             TRNO.HLD        COPY TO         TRNO.PNT
             PN.HLD          COPY TO         PN.PNT
             DATE.HLD        COPY TO         DATE.PNT

                                                                 PAGE   5



     Under no circumstances should a user copy @POINT.SAF until the  Data
     Base  has  been  thouroughly  tested and there were no errors in the
     build cycle output.

     Another item to watch for is files not  transferred  via  FTP  (File
     Transfer  Program).   The associated QAXX.CMD file should be checked
     on the system from which it was transferred to make  sure  that  the
     file  indicated was not transferred by means of the Archive program.
     If the file is in QAXX.CMD the Hold files will have to be copied  as
     in  the paragraph above; QAXX.CMD will have to be copied to Qasys on
     system 38; and the build cycle must be rerun.

     *** CAUTION *** Only after the Data Base has been tested  and  there
     were  no  errors  in  the  build  cycle output, should the user copy
     @POINT.SAF.  This command copys  the  vital  files  to  Hold  files.
     Should   the  Data  Base  be  incorrect  and  the  user  has  copied
     @POINT.SAF, the Data Base files will have to be restored from Backup
     tapes.


     Chart     _____

     The Chart program is a useful aid in determining which files are  to
     be  stored  to  tape.   The  Chart program is located in Qalibsym on
     systems 33 and 38.  In order to run Chart,  the  user  must  GFD  to
     Qalibsym and run Chart by the usual "RUN" command.  For example:

     -RUN CHART

     The program  generates  a  temporary  file  called  TOUTP.TMP  which
     contains  the  files  and  each  file  size  contained in all PDP-10
     Qalibsym directories.  The size of the files is in Disk Block space.
     Since  a  tape  can hold up to 24000 blocks, a minimum of 10000 file
     blocks to a maximum of 11500 file blocks should be  put  onto  tape.
     This  is  because  each  file  is  put  on  each Archive tape twice.
     TOUTP.TMP file aids in determining which files will fit onto a tape.

     The sources for Chart are generated each day be means of PERP  jobs.
     The  PERP  command  files  QAXX (where again XX indicates the system
     number) are located in Qalibsym on each PDP-10 system.  The commands
     files  are  run  each  day  by  PERP  at 1800 hours.  Each QAXX file
     creates an output file CXX (i.e.  QA33 creates  C33)  which  contain
     the  files  and  block  sizes for the specific system.  Then at 1900
     hours the commands file SIZE.PRP,located in Qalibsym on  systems  33
     and 38, is run by PERP.  SIZE.PRP telecopys the files CXX to CXX.XYZ
     on systems 33 and 38.  The files *.XYZ are copied to a  file  called
     TOTALS.   This is the file from which Chart gets it's information to
     build TOUTP.TMP.

                                                                 PAGE   6



     Appendix     ________

     The Archive program must be "Customized" for each particular system.
     To  modify  the  program,  change  the  following three lines of the
     overlay module TRANS.SFO:

     Change the word QAXX.CMD, where XX is the  system  number,  in  line
     1140, 1090 and 3020.

     To build the overlay structure, load the following:

     LOAD ARCVE.SFO,ARCHK.SFO[BUILD.SFO!TRANS.SFO!LOOKUP.SFO]

                  or

     LOAD @ARC

     The Archive must reside in Qasys on all the TEN'S with  WF  license.
     The file ARC.HLP must also be in Qasys for "HELP" information.
