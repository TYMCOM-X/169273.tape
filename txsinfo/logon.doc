   DESCRIPTION

           LOGON %2(106)   Post LOGIN initialization program   24-Mar-86

           LOGON is an extremely powerful user INIT program which  allows an
           individual user to easily  tailor the working environment  to his
           or her  requirements or  preferences without  needlessly retyping
           various setup commands.  LOGON uses the settings from  the user's
           profile file SWITCH.INI located on the users logged-in directory.

           LOGON is normally run automatically at the time of log in  as the
           user's "INIT" file  (see NONAME).  LOGON may  also be run  at any
           time by  user command, in  order to reset  any settings  that may
           have been changed from  their initial settings.  One time  it may
           be  important to  reset  these settings  is just  after  the user
           reattaches to another frame.

           For more information on the options file "SWITCH.INI"  type "HELP
           SWITCH".

           --------        --------
           /CLEAR          Clears your CRT screen if the type is known.

           /HP2621         Set tab stops on an HP-2621 (TYM-444) terminal.

           /INFO:list

           /NOTIFY:list    Controls the type of messages that are output to
                           the user's terminal by LOGON.  The list may
                           either be a single argument or a list of
                           arguments enclosed in parentheses and separated
                           by commas.  (i.e.  "(WARN,TELL,NOFATAL)").  The
                           default setting is /NOTIFY:NONE, but this may be
                           changed at any time between LOGON switches.
                           Arguments may be preceded by "NO" to turn off a
                           specific condition.

                           The legal values for /NOTIFY are:

                   SET     Output message for any /SET switches
                   TELL    Output any /TELL switch messages

                   RUN     Output message when running a program
                   FATAL   Output any fatal messages
                   WARN    Output any warning messages

                   HELP    Output a help message (not very useful)
                   USER    Output message for any /USERS switches
                   NONE    Don't output any messages
                   ALL     Output all types of messages


           /TELL:"string"  If /NOTIFY:TELL was already seen, then type out
                           the given string on the terminal.


           /USERS:list     Output an info message about any logged in users
                           specified in list.

                           **CAVEAT** Since this switch is designed for a
                           list of usernames, each username must be
                           enclosed in "()" parentheses, and the entire
                           list must be enclosed in "()" parentheses; even
                           for a single username.  For example:

                           /USERS:((user1),(user2)) or /USERS:((user1))


           /SET:TTY args   Will set a particular TTY function.  A [NO]
               or          indicates an optional NO argument; i.e.
           /TTY:args       TTY [NO] PAGE can be either TTY PAGE or TTY NO
                           PAGE.  The functions are as follows:
