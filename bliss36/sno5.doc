1.0  INTRODUCTION

     SITBOL version 5 contains many bug fixes and  many  new  features.
Among  the  new features are the external function capability, a SNODDT
(SNOBOL  debugger),  new  error  processing,  and  programmer   defined
variable  associations.   We  would  like  to  thank  the University of
Arizona for the code to process the external functions, SNODDT and  the
programmer defined variable assocations.

     SITBOL has been tested on a KA-10 running 6.02,  6.02A  and  6.03.
SITBOL  has  not been tested under TOPS-20, TENEX, or ITS and it is not
known whether it will run properly under these operating systems.



   1.1  New Modules

        The following new modules have been added to the SITBOL  system
   for  the  new features.  SNOPAV for programmer associated variables,
   or programmer defined variable  associations,  SNOEXT  for  external
   functions,  STBERR  for  the  new  error  processing,  and SNODEB to
   implement the SNODDT processing.



   1.2  Feature Tests

        Several feature tests were added to SITBOL,  because  the  code
   received  from  the  Unversity of Arizona was for a KI-10 (they used
   KI-10 instructions).  So processor feature tests were added, as well
   as the feature tests for the new code.



        1.2.1  FTKA, FTKI And FTKL - These  are  feature   tests   that
        govern whether the DMOVE and DMOVEM instructions are opcodes or
        macros.  Nothing else changes if these are changed.



        1.2.2  FTPAV - This feature test is for the programmer  defined
        variable  associations.   FTPAV feature test is dependent on no
        other feature test.



        1.2.3  FTDDT - This feature test is for  the  SNODDT  debugging
        system.  This requires that FTPAV is on.

        1.2.4  FTSINGLE - Allow the error segment to be loaded with the
        main snobol segment.



        1.2.5  FTDEBUG - Facilitate changes for use when debugging  the
        sitbol sources.



   1.3  Dispatch Table

        A dispatch table added to SITBOL so that save files will now be
   compatible with future versions of SITBOL, except if the low segment
   changes (the lowseg version number LWVRSN is  incremented  with  any
   change).  The dispatch table has been added to SNOFIO.



   1.4  File Names And Formats

        The formats of the different files have been changed.  A  title
   page  with  all  directives  to  macro has been added, followed by a
   table of contents, and then a revision history for the module.   The
   complete  revision  history  for  SITBOL  is contained in the module
   SNOPRM.  The modules have also been  renamed.   The  names  are  now
   SNOxxx,  were  xxx  is from the old name, but changed a little.  The
   only exception to this rule is SNOPRM, the parameter file, which was
   COM in past versions.



   1.5  Unevalued Expressions

        Unevalued expressions have been changed so that they no  longer
   are  in  a code block (CBLOK).  The code block now points to the EDT
   block which points to the expression block (EBLOK).  This  was  done
   so  that  the  unevaluated expessions would not take up a code block
   and to speed up the interpreter.



   1.6  New Listing File Format

        The format of the listing file has been  updated  to  a  better
   looking  listing.   The  changes include page numbers and a title on
   each page,  line  numbers  on  every  line  and  slightly  different
   messages.

   1.7  Defaults

        SITBOL's default name, prefix for the error messages  and  temp
   files  and  its default extension on file lookups can now be changed
   by changing  D$NAME,  D$PRE  and  D$EXT,  respectively.   These  are
   presently defined as SNOBOL, SNO and SNO, respectively.



   1.8  Bug Fixes.

        Many minor bugs, in addition to several  major  bug  have  been
   fixed  in  this  version.   A  complete list of the bug fixes can be
   found in the edit history.



2.0  KNOWN PROBLEMS

   2.1  Usage Of MACTEN

        SITBOL %5(305) must use MACTEN %2(26)-6 which contains  changes
   which  both  speed  up  the  TITLE.   macros, as well as a new macro
   ABV'NME which is used in the module SNODAT.



3.0  SUGGESTIONS

   3.1  Revision Of Page Handling.

        It has been suggested that on a error message or a  reenter  to
   SITBOL,  the  number  of  the page also be output in addition to the
   statement number.  this would be useful when using LSN files.



   3.2  Double Precision Real Numbers

        The 'D' identifier  has  been  added,  however  it  is  treated
   exactly  as  the 'E' identifier for real numbers (i.e., 2.3E13).  It
   has been suggested that SITBOL should facilitate the use  of  double
   precision reals.



   3.3  Changes To External Functions

        SITBOL's external functions could support more LINK item  types
   in  the  future.   Some examples of the things that may be added are
   F10 support and a library search mode.

4.0  EDIT HISTORY

122  Cleanup the file format.  Add tables  of  contents,  and  revision
     histories to each of the different modules.

123  Define a symbol for each error, so they can be  found  in  a  CREF
     listing.

124  Add definitions for external functions as well as the code.

125  Remove the patching space from SNOLEX.

126  Add processor feature tests (for SNOEXT).  Fix and move the  DMOVE

130  Add another argument to the FUNC macro to allow  the  creation  of
     the  dispatch table.  Remove unnecessary code from SNOEXT.  Delete
     the TMP file from disk when  done  with  it.   Make  PPIINT  macro
     external any symbols it has to.

131  Start addition of process associated variables and the  additional
     facilities for debugging.

132  Removed.

133  Fix the conversion of number with just '+' or '-'.

137  Fix a problem with external  functions,  Y.PER  should  have  been
     Y.PCNT.

140  Fix problems with the file specification scanner.

141  Remember where we came from (save .SGNAM, .SGPPN, and .SGDEV),  so
     a GETSEG will get the correct version of SITBOL.

150  Prevent labels from becoming undefined in tracing.

151  The expression INTEGER(3.0) should fail, fix it.

152  Save more information during a trace.  Some strange person may  do
     pattern matching during a trace (user defined).

153  Tracing of &STFCOUNT doesn't work, fix it.

154  Give the correct error number in SNOTBL (6.1 not 6.0)

     things.

221  Make OPSYN check for natural variables in the first two arguments.

222  LABEL("")  and  FUNCTION("")  should  fail,  not  give  an  error.
     Correct this oversight.

227  TSEQ missuses floating addresses in registers, fix that.

230  Don't bomb if the  TMP:   file  does  not  contain  a  line  feed.
     RELEASE channel 17 all the time.

231  TABLE referencing is too slow, speed it up.

232  Make absolute errors work, not ill mem ref.

233  Fix edit 226, so that REPLACE will work always.

234  Fix a problem with EVAL when it fails with &ERRTYPE  set  to  more
     than one.

235  Use correct defaults for project  and  programmer  number  if  not
     specified in the brackets.

236  Revise the format of the listing's output (again).

237  Add FTDEBUG to add some debugging features.

240  Redefine FMT.A so that it doesn't conflict with others.

242  Don't use PUSHR and Popr for just the P or the Q registers.

243  Give more errors for loading external functions.

244  Add FTOPS10 and FTOPS10 feature test.

245  Add missing portal in SNODFD.

246  Move  some  definitions  from   different   modules   to   SNOPRM.
     definitions include FMT.XX and CSTACK.

247  Allow D to signify an exponent.

250  Fix mistakes in edit 243 dealing with external functtions.

251  Add another missing portal.

252  Fix EVAL (again)  so  that  it  works  correctly  with  a  failing
     statement.

253  Error SNOSSO should be able to work (i.e., don't  use  stack  when
     you don't have any.)

254  Change output listing page numbers (allow a minor page number).

255  Add a low segment version number, so that only a low  seg  changes
     will create a conflict with EXITed files.

256  Fix some fixes to SNOEXT and start work on LNKENT & LNKHSG.

257  Allow a comment to follow after a semi-colon.  (SNOLEX)

260  Fix a problem which occured when ENDFILE wouldn't close files.

261  Fix the compilation error pointer on the listiing file so that  it
     points to the right item.

262  Fix a HALT when sorting an  array  which  contained  defined  data
     types  and  had  a  field function, and the array was not full, so
     that it contained null strings.  Clear the offset sooner  that  it
     was cleared so junk is not used later.

263  Use XWD22 in SNOARY instead of using [2,,2].

264  Add defaults for SITBOL's name, prefix and extension to SNOPRM.

265  Change the error 15's to something other than just a halt, so that
     one can tell when SITBOL gets a system error.

266  Put a JSP in .JB41 instead of a JRST, so we can tell what  address
     the error occured at.

267  Change the text of the error messages  in  STBERR  back  to  ASCII
     (SITBOL strings are ASCII -- not ASCIZ).

270  Do some misc.  cleaning in SNOGC.

271  Fix a type on STBERR's error text (SNOPNP).

272  Fix a bad return after printing an error message with  a  &ERRPARM
     argument (SNOERR).

273  Don't do HALT if an  error  occurs  on  DEVNAM  in  STRIO,  it  is
     detected later (and should be).

274  In STRIO (SNOFIO) a refernece to IOPPN should be to IOSFD (the PPN
     is stored in IOSFD).

275  Append to the listing file after requesting a listing  of  a  file
     containing and EXIT().

276  Don't die if the nnnSNO.TMP file is protected when deleting it.

277 Fix a ridiculous problem where TIME(1) would return 1 insted of the
     MSTIME.  A silly typo.

300  Allow EXIT(-1) to work on a KI-KL with EXO SITBOL.

301  In STRIO also check for identical PATH against other files.   This
     lack  of  a  check  caused two files with different PATH's but the
     same name to be treated as one.

302  Add a missing PORTAL where we retunr from an external function  in
     SNOEXT.
SITBOL %5(305)                                                  Page 10


303  Fix another bug in STRIO (SNOFIO), which causes the file primitive
     not to check for file duplication correctly.

304  The error message for incompatible high segments should  not  rely
     upon  using  the  low segment.  Have it simply do an OUTSTR.  Also
     delete the error messages which are no longer used in STBERR.

305  CORE UUO in SNOGC should use an ADDI, not an IORI to calculate how
     much core is needed.

                          [End of SNO5.RND]
