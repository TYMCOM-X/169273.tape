
Sherman,

I come to San Francisco for the second international unified technology
seminar. On this occasion, I expect to meet you and discuss on the
following subjects:

- TYMCOM-X Monitor:
	- Frames
		. Possibilities for a frame to pass rights to another
		  frame.
		. Facilities to exchange messages between frames without
		  excessive rights.
	- PTY
		. facilities to control jobs connected with PTYs.
	- Multiple structures
	- Spooled devices
	- Class schedulling
	- Mount of tapes

- TYMCOM-X Utilities and system programs:
	- Files save-restore
	- Batch (perp) system with control from operator
	- Taylored command system (possibility to build your own exec).
	- General purprose copy program (PIP) with non buffered disk io
		and full support of file system (PID, licences, holes).

- Possibility to have more disks on P90.

- Future hardware

I expect also have a very free, clear and open discussion with you about
TOPS 20 and future DEC hardware.

I plan to stay at Cupertino from the first to third of march to have a
full and mutual information on those subjects.

I expect also have some information about IBM systems at TYMSHARE:
organisation, maintenance, trends... Because in the next future it is
possible for me to take more responsability in this field at SLIGOS.

Best regards.

Bernard.
