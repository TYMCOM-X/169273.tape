CLRPT instructions on 2020 are very slow, because they sweep
the whole cache. To minimize the number of these done, if a frame's
own context pages appear in %UPX, they are always write enabled,
rather than switching between write enable and write protect.
If another frame's context pages appear in %UPX, they are handled
as they were previous to this change, i.e. when not in use for writing,
they are write protected. /EVS 8-26-80

Fixed crash code in COMMON to write down more accurate STOPPC

SCHED1: Fixed possible problem with wait states getting overwritten
at SWOSJ0 - if interrupt changed JBTSTS, MOVEM T1,JBTSTS(J) would
write old value back, causing various problems possibly having
symptoms like the JBTPGO loops. /EVS 9-22-80

GETLNK("NOCORE") GETTAB to get at it. /Darren 22-SEP-80

UUOCON: new UUO RLSLDB - release spare LDB, to be used by LOGOUT
to release the SLDB so that alt log progs don't tie things up and
to speed killing jobs in general.	/WRS 9-25-80

ACTSER: FILUUO: UUOCON: changed places who got date and time together

SCNSER: Fixed CREAUX to always use 1 for it's dummy port number in
KMC monitors.  Using the CMD PORT number as it sometimes did caused
the wrong 11BASE to get the AUX request sometimes. /GL 9-26-80

FILIO: Add routine to type "Unit XXXX Hung" to operator whenever
a hung disk condition is detected. /Darren 26-SEP-80

CTYSIM: Fix ^ZL loginn sequence to accept lower case L.  Pull CTYDO out
and declare it external.
ONCE:	Add CONSOLE command to those accessible when sense switch 4 is
set.  It sets CTYDO etc. to come up manually in CTYSIM standalone mode.
COMMON:	Added NXTLPT:: EXP LPRUN for LPTSER to test to find out how many
LP20s the monitor was configured for.  0==> non-existant device.
LPTSER:	Fixed bug by adding PXCT 4,[] arround HLRZ T3,(M) in VFU code.
ONCDSK:	Took out the RMA# IS OFF-LINE/NO RESPONSE messages IFKMC<>.
CIOPR:	Fix for NODLOD. Don't set DRDO just because KMCDO was off when
deselecting a DR.  This causes crashes when running from the CONSOLE.
/GL 12-6-80


/G07
----
Fixed bug which had symptom of causing crashes at MAPF34+4, USEOUT+3.
RIBs would get areas where there were 0 pointers when there should
have been a real pointers. Problem was that code changed DEVRIB
prior to reading in prime rib for file, and DDB pointers were
still valid and from the spare rib. If another job was sharing file
and went looking thru DDBs for pointers, it would find these pointers
and copy them, DEVFLO, and DEVRIB from the DDB which was in process
of reading in the prime rib. Therefore, the copied pointers were
from another rib other than the DEVRIB one. If these poiners were
written back out, prime rib could get smashed with pointers
that didn't belong there. This bug could also cause GIVPGK crashes,
since it could cause same pointer to appear in two places in the file.
Fix is to invalidate DDB pointers before changing DEVRIB. In NXTPT0
this meant just turning on sign bit, since need the value of DEVFLO
throughout the routine.
Rib validate CHANIO, USETST, NXTPT0 changed to fix this condition.
/EVS 12-8-80

Changed ENTER and RENAME so that it requires WA to set or clear
ATPPID and ATPALC. Previously to this any program could clear
either of those bits, and JL and WF programs could set them. /EVS
12-8-80

Fixed bug where 1)Lookup file 2) Do some input on it so ATB stays
around after close 3) Do truncating RENAME 4)Lookup file sometime
later while FNB still around 5) Close file caused
crash due to FNBALT being set to -1. This was because truncating
RENAME code didn't set FNBALT and RIBALT after finishing
the allocation change. (Slight oversight in doing fast DSKCLN
file system change.) /EVS 12-8-80

Fixed potential bug where doing CLBMEM UUO could screw up
by not giving all club members if job doing CLBMEM UUO
got rescheduled in middle of returning club IDs (could happen
if page fault for user's page) and someone left the club.
Was not likely to happen, but it could if the club membership
card got reused before CLBMEM job started up again.
Fix is to check to see if any jobs on system have left a club
and start UUO over if they have. /EVS 12-8-80

Attempted to solve IL club interlock problem for general case:
Don't give club interlock to job with MRQ set unless RNDBIT
is set in the system uptime (RNDBIT is an attempt to be fair
every once in a while on a "random" basis) unless that job is
the only one who needs the interlock.
/EVS 12-8-80

SCNSER: Fixed cache bug in block output that was discovered
by inspection (cache bug was suspected, but turned out to be
some other problem). BIOCSH set too early, before copying
data from user space to the block I/O buffer. Move this
to after data is BLTed to the block I/O buffer. /EVS 12-9-80

/G08
----

S: Added macro MAPONC to define symbols for once module sizes;
ONSZCK to check if enough pages have been allocated to a particular
once module and print an error message if not.  Changed once module
page allocations to 3 for REFSTR, 6 for ONCDSK, and 3 for ONCE (the
minimum sizes). Commented out the RES page allocation.  It is not
yet clear if this is valid.
REFSTR,ONCDSK,ONCE: Call ONCSZCK to check if module is larger than
number of pages allocated to it.  /TLC 12-11-80

FILUUO: put in Ernie's patch to fix GIVPGK crashes (WRTOK2+n) 
/WRS 12-20-80

/G09
----

CORE1: Introduced new routine REPOK to check to see if a page selected
by the uws or mws alg is bumpable (i.e. doesn't have DIO up or isn't
locked).  Call REPOK from uws and mws code when a page is selected
to be replaced.  Previously these checks were only done in the mws
alg so it was possible, for example, for the destination of a BLTPAG
to be the page selected for replacement if uws full and a fault occured
on the source page.  /TLC 12-29-80

CLUBS: Fixed random function in RELINL to work correctly - must
use mask to test bits, not just test bit. /EVS 1-5-80

FILUUO: In CLRACH, turn off ATPALC if FNBALT is greater than
PCDTIM, since in this case RIBALT must have been from a previous
incarnation of the monitor. Installed this so that merely
looking up a file and closing it will clear ATPALC if it got turned
on in a previous monitor most of the time. This is so the program
CLRALT will still be able to clear ATPALC after an all files restore,
in which all ATPALC bits are on, even if the system crashes.
/EVS 1-5-80

SCNSER: Fixed GOTBUF routine to not mangle PDL in the case where
there is contention for block I/O input buffers. /Darren 08-Jan-81

OF THE CURRENT JOB RATHER THAN THAT OF THE JOB HOLDING THE

SCHED1: Moved TI queue higher in swap out priority, just below
SL. Reason for this is alleged problem reported in Paris
concerning ML waiters getting swapped out when TI jobs were still
hanging around in core, causing PCB resource turnaround to go
way down. Observed this on C29 (Coees). Moved TI to be swapped out
before any sharable resource wait, since sharable resource
waits should normally not be long. This may not be exactly right
because of other low priority reasons for going into ML wait
(Aux circuit wait, block I/O stuff, etc). /EVS 1-22-81

SETETY:	Moved Todd to 4 and Darren to 6.  Added Macros and PRINTX to
allow definition of industry SETEs in CONF##.MAC (2020s only).

FRMSER: Re-do read/write frame attribute FRMOPS to match spec.
	FRMOPs to read, write or write/read (exch) frame
	attributes.  Format of call is:

	<ADDR>:	Attribute #,,<Argument address>
			OR
	<ADDR>:	     0,,<Argument block address>
		-COUNT,,<Attribute list address>
	-----------------------------------------
	On error return, FRMOP error is in AC right, positive
	index into argument/attribute table is in AC left.
	-----------------------------------------
	FRMOP function codes are:
		36 - Read frame attribute
		37 - Write frame attribute
		40 - Exchange (read, then write) frame attr.
