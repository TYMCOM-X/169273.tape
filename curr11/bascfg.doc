Introduction


1.0 Introduction

  This document describes the hardware configuration  specification  for
  the TYMBASes based on LSI-11 computers.

  It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the architecture of the
  LSI-11  and  that the appropriate DEC hardware manuals are at hand and
  available for reference.

Components


2.0 Components

  The following is a list of components which  can  be  integrated  into
  TYMBAS configurations.

  2.1 Processors

    Two processor boards can be used in a TYMBAS configuration, both are
    revisions of the KD11 module.  These are the M7264 quad height board
    with on board memory and the M7270 dual height board, both mentioned
    in the 1978-1979 edition of "Microcomputer Processors".

  2.2 Bootstraps

    The bootstrap board used in a TYMBASe configuration is the BDV11-AA.

    The BDV11 board is described in the 1978-1979 edition  of  "Memories
    and Peripherals".

    The bootstrap has a prom which resides on the board.  This bootstrap
    allows  the down line loading of the TYMBAS from TYMNET using LOADII
    or equivalent program, or from a connected  host.   Hosts  currently
    supported are:-


    1.  Pdp-20 Tymcom-X

    2.  Pdp-11 Rsx-11m

    3.  Pdp-11 Rsts

    4.  F3 Tenex


    The BDV11 is a quad height board.

  2.3 Memories

    The TYMBASe is provided with either a 64K  byte  or  32K  byte  dual
    height MSV11-D or MSV11-E 18 bit MOS memory board.

    The MSV11 memory is described in the 1978-1979 edition of  "Memories
    and  Peripherals"  and both the MSV11 and the MXV11 are described in
    the 1979-1980 edition of "Microcomputer processor handbook".

  2.4 Asynchronous Interfaces

    Two serial asynchronous port options can be used in a TYMBAS.  These
    are the DLV11-J and the DZV11.
LSI-11 TYMBAS Hardware Config. Spec.     Jan 13 1981              Page 4
Components


    The DLV11-J is a dual height module  with  4  separate  serial  line
    units  (SLU).   A  DLV11 SLU interfaces one asynchronous serial line
    I/O device (either 20ma or EIA) to the  LSI-11  bus  (without  modem
    control).   One  DLV11 port must be configured as a console terminal
    (cty).

    A DZV11 multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for 4 devices.   It
    is a quad height module and has full modem control.

  2.5 Synchronous Interfaces

    Only one synchronous serial line  interface  is  available  for  the
    TYMBAS  configuration,  the  DUV-11.   This  is  a quad height board
    described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories and Peripherals".

  2.6 Backplanes

    Two boxes can be used for the TYMBAS configuration,  the  BA11-N  or
    large 9 slot, and the PDP-11/03 or small 4 slot box with an optional
    expansion box.  These boxes are described in the  1979-1980  edition
    of "Microcomputer Interfaces Handbook".

    For the 9 slot box,  the  slots  serviced  by  the  Q-bus,  are  the
    leftmost  two  (as  viewed from the rear of the box).  The rightmost
    two slots do not interface to the bus.

    All slots in the 4 slot box (and the expansion box), are serviced by
    the Q-bus.

Configurations


3.0 Configurations

  There are two possible configurations that can  be  supported  by  the
  TYMBAS software.  These are detailed below.

  3.1 Large Box

    The modules in the large box are inserted as follows:-

    1.  KD11 processor

    2.  MSV11 memory board

    3.  0-2 DUV11 synchronous serial interfaces

    4.  1-5 DLV11-J asynchronous serial interfaces

    5.  0-4 DZV11 asynchronous multiplexors

    6.  1-2 DRV11 parallel interfaces 

    7.  BDV11 bootstrap board (with prom)


        +---------------+---------------+
        |    KD11       |               | 1.
        +---------------+---------------+
        |    MSV11      |               | 2.
        +---------------+---------------+
        |             DUV11             | 3.
        +---------------+---------------+
        |         DLV11-J/DUV11         | 4.
        +-------------------------------+
        |        DLV11-J / DZV11        | 5.
        +-------------------------------+
        |     DLV11-J / DZV11 / DRV11   | 6.
        +-------------------------------+
        |     DLV11-J / DZV11 / DRV11   | 7.
        +-------------------------------+
        |        BDV11 / DRV11          | 8.
        +-------------------------------+
        |             BDV11             | 9.
        +-------------------------------+

    The DUV11(s) must be installed in the bus closest to  the  processor
    because  this  is  the most time critical device.  The BDV11 acts as
    bus terminator, so it must always be inserted in the last slot after
    the  other  boards.   (i.e.  there must not exist any `holes' in the
    bus).

Configurations


  3.2 Small box

    The insertion of boards in the  small  box  (with  expander)  is  as
    follows:-

    1.  KD11 processor

    2.  MSV11 memory module

    3.  1-2 DUV11 synchronous serial ports

    4.  1-5 DLV11-J 4 SLU module

    5.  0-4 DZV11 asynchronous multiplexors

    6.  1-2 DRV11 parallel interface

    7.  1 Q bus expander


        +------------------------------+
        |      KD11     |    MSV11     | 1.
        +---------------+--------------+
        | (2 x DLV11-J)/ DZV11 / DUV11 | 2.
        +------------------------------+
        | (2 x DLV11-J)/ DZV11 / DUV11 | 3.
        +------------------------------+
        | ::::::::::::  |   DLV11-J    | 4.
        +-::::::::::::-----------------+
          ::Expander::
        +-::::::::::::-----------------+
        | ::::::::::::  |   DLV11-J    | 5.
        +------------------------------+
        |         DZV11 / DRV11        | 6.
        +------------------------------+
        |    DZV11 / BDV11 / DRV11     | 7.
        +------------------------------+
        |             BDV11            | 8.
        +------------------------------+

    All boards must be contiguous from slot 1.   The  DUV11(s)  must  be
    installed  in the slot(s) closest to the processor because it is the
    most time critical device.  If no bus expander is provided, then the
    BDV11 must be inserted into slot 4, and the DUV11 in slot 2.

  4.3 Parallel Interfaces

    To set up the standard addresses and vectors on  the  DRV11,  it  is
    necessary to install and/or remove several wire straps.

    4.3.1 Address Selection

      The DRV11 address is encoded in 10 address straps A12 through  A3,
      A12 being the most significant.

           A3 o   o     o   o A9
           A4 o   o     o   o A10
           A5 o   o     o   o A11
           A6 o   o     o---o A12
           A7 o   o
           A8 o   o
       o A3  => install jumper for DRV11  2 and  4

      To set up the standard addresses and vectors for the  4  ports  on
      the DLV11-J, it is necessary to jumper the board accordingly.


      1.  Address selection

          o A12 => X to 1

          o A11 => X to 1

          o A10 => X to 1

          o A9 => X to 0 

          o A8 => X to 1 

          o A7 => remove jumper for DLV11  1 and  2 else install jumper.

          o A6 => remove jumper for DLV11  3 and  4 else install jumper.

          o A5 => X to 0 for DLV11  1,  3 and  5 else X to 1.

      2.  Vector selection

          o V7 => Installed for DLV11  1,  2 ,  4 and  5 else removed

          o V6 => Installed for DLV11  1 ,  2 and  3 else removed

          o V5 => X to 0 for DLV11  1

            V5 => X to 1 for DLV11  2 ,  3 and  5 else removed

      3.  Console selection

          o C1 => X to 1 for DLV11  1 else X to 0
