Introduction


1.0 Introduction

     This document describes the  configuration  specification  for  the
  TYMSATs based on LSI-11 computers.

     It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the architecture  of
  the LSI-11 and that the appropriate DEC hardware manuals are available
  for reference.

Components


2.0 Components

     The following is a list of components which can be integrated  into
  TYMSAT configurations.

  2.1 Processors

       The processor board used is the M7270 dual height board described
    in the 1978-1979 edition of "Microcomputer Processors".

  2.2 Bootstrap

       The bootstrap for the TYMSAT is the MXV11-AC dual  height  board.
    The  bootstrap  code  resides  in two 2716 proms on the board.  This
    code allows the down line loading of the TYMSAT  from  TYMNET  using
    LOADII or equivalent program.

       The MXV11 is a dual height board which also  has  the  memory  on
    board,  and  is described in the 1979-1980 edition of "Microcomputer
    Processor Handbook".

  2.3 Memories

       The MXV11-AC has 32K bytes of RAM on board and as  such  requires
    no separate memory board.

  2.4 Asynchronous Interfaces

       Three serial asynchronous port options can be used in  a  TYMSAT.
    These are the DZV11, DLV11-J and the MXV11(bootstrap board).

       An MXV11 serial  line  unit  (SLU)  interfaces  one  asynchronous
    serial  line  I/O  device to the LSI-11 bus (without modem control).
    One MXV11 SLU must be configured as a console terminal (cty).

       A DZV11 multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for  4  devices.
    It  is  a quad height module, has full modem control and programable
    baud rates.

       A DLV11-J multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for 4 devices.
    It  is  a double height module, does not have programable baud rates
    and has no modem control.

  2.5 Synchronous Interfaces

       Only one synchronous serial line interface is available  for  the
    TYMSAT  configuration,  the  DUV-11.   This  is  a quad height board
    described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories and Peripherals".

Components


  2.6 Backplanes

       The essential box used for housing the TYMSAT is  the  BA11-N  or
    `large' box (or equivalent).  This box is described in the 1979-1980
    edition of "Microcomputer Interfaces Handbook".

       This box contains an LSI-11 Q-bus backplane  and  is  capable  of
    housing  up  to 9 dual or quad height boards.  The slots serviced by
    the Q-bus are the leftmost two as viewed from the board side of  the
    backplane.   The  rightmost two slots do not interface to the Q-bus.
    Power  is  supplied  to  the  rightmost  two  slots  for   non-Q-bus
    peripherals.

  2.7 Watchdog Timer

       The watchdog timer is a dual height board  that  monitors  output
    from  an  MXV11  SLU.   If  a  character is not received within a 10
    second time cycle, the TYMSAT is rebooted.  The code  of  the  MXV11
    bootstrap  code will generate a character output once a second.  The
    node software can be configured to do the same.

       The watchdog timer does not interface with  the  Q-bus  directly.
    It  requires  only power from the backplane and can therefore reside
    in a rightmost dual slot ( as viewed from  the  rear  of  the  box).
    Interfaces exist on the board for three 10 pin berg connectors.  One
    provides the watchdog timer with access to the halt/enable logic  in
    the  processor,  another  inputs  data  from  an  asynch serial port
    (either DLV11-J or MXV11) and times out if 10 seconds elapse without
    a  character  being  received,  and  the processor is rebooted.  The
    third connector is driven by carrier  detect  from  a  modem.   When
    carrier  is  detected,  the  watchdog timing function is temporarily
    disabled, thus allowing access to an asynch serial  port  (the  cty)
    for diagnostics.

       Currently no document exists to reference for this device.

Configurations


3.0 Configurations

     There are two possible configurations that can be supported by  the
  node  software,  depending  on  whether  DLV11-J  or DZV11 modules are
  included.  The components are as follows:

  1.  BA11-N `large box'

  2.  M7270 processor

  3.  MXV11-AC bootstrap and memory

  4.  1-2 DUV11 synchronous serial ports

  5.  1-4 DZV11 asynchronous serial multiplexors (or DLV11-Js)

  6.  0-1 Watchdog Timer


     The boards are inserted into the backplane as follows:-

        +--------------------------------+
        |      KD11     | Watchdog/Timer |  1.
        +---------------+----------------+
        |      MXV11    |                |  2.
        +--------------------------------+
        |              DUV11             |  3.
        +--------------------------------+
        |        DZV11  1/DLV11-J  1     |  4.
        +--------------------------------+
        |        DZV11  2/DLV11-J  2     |  5.
        +--------------------------------+
        |        DZV11  3/DLV11-J  3     |  6.
        +--------------------------------+
        |        DZV11  4/DLV11-J  4     |  7.
        +--------------------------------+
        |            --EMPTY--           |  8.
        +--------------------------------+
        |            --EMPTY--           |  9.
        +--------------------------------+

     The boards must be contiguous from slot 1  on  the  bus  (i.e.   no
  `holes'  must exist in the bus) this includes the MXV11.  The DUV11(s)
  must be installed in the bus closest to the processor because this  is
  the most time critical device.



                                   NOTE

      The two asynchronous serial ports on the MXV11  are  dedicated
      to  three  functions.   One as the cty, the other to drive the
      watchdog timer and to  optionally  act  as  a  high  frequency
      interrupt  source  for the TYMSAT software.  The cty cannot be
      used for this last purpose as it is driven at 19.2K  baud  and
      will   not  then  be  compatible  with  the  diagnostic  modem
      connection.

4.0 Configuring the Boards

     This section describes the way in which the component  boards  must
  be configured to make them work in a TYMSAT.

     It is assumed that the  reader  has  access  to  the  relevant  DEC
  reference handbook.

  4.1 Serial Interfaces

       The following is a list of `standard' addresses and vectors  that
    can   be   assigned   to   serial   interface  boards  in  a  TYMSAT
    configuration.

        Device     Address   Vector      Range
        ======     =======   ======      =====

                   176570      370
        DLV11 2    176600      140
                   176610      150
                   176620      160
                   176630      170
        DLV11 3    176640      200
                   176650      210
                   176660      220
                   176670      230
        DLV11 4    176700      240
                   176710      250
                   176720      260
                   176730      270

       These addresses and vectors must!  be observed for consistency.
