                               PREFACE                                  


This document describes the support features on the TYMNET ATC (ASYNCHRONOUS
TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR) 8 port processor, running code version 01.26, in
comparison with the TYMNET 512 KB MICRO-ENGINE configured as an Stand-Alone
TYMSAT, or Stand-Alone CONsolidated TYMSAT (CONSAT).

This is a reference guide also, particularly applicable to the analysis and
planning of private networks and independent network systems. To aid the user
in distinguishing the operational capabilities between the ATC and the Stand-
Alone TYMSAT/CONSAT, the material in this document has been arranged into
three main sections:

The first section provides a brief descriptions on the ATC (ASYNCHRONOUS
TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR) basic functions and features.

The  second section identifies the attributes on the ATC that contribute  to
its performance flexability. This section provides feature-feature comparisons
of the ATC with the 512 KB MICRO-ENGINE Stand-Alone TYMSAT on: product items,
asynchronous port features, network features, and diagnostic features.

The third section lists the default option statements of the 512 KB MICRO-
ENGINE Stand-Alone CONSAT in comparison with default values preconfigured in
the ATC. This section also defines the baud rates supported on the ATC and
their respective terminal identifiers.

                    ATC - Asynchronous Terminal Concentrator

           SECTION 1.0  OVERVIEW





   The TYMNET ATC (ASYNCHRONOUS TERMINAL CONCENTRATOR) is a compact data
   communications processor designed for use within typical desk-top office
   environments. It provides an economical access to a TYMNET packet-switched
   data network for up to eight remote, or clustered asynchronous terminals
   ports.

   The ATC is based on a VLSI 16-bit microprocessor, and is supplied complete
   in its own desk-top mounting cabinet which includes; power supply,
   processor, memory, and I/O interfaces. The most significant  benefit is, it
   is preconfigured with all software program instructions and provides, among
   other features, hardware self-checking diagnostic routines.  The need to
   downline load for reconfiguration or after power failure is eliminated,
   streamlining the roles of network management.

   Two synchronous network ports are standard provisions. For specific
   applications requiring extra network access reliability, both network ports
   may be used to accommodate alternate network paths in case of a line or
   modem failure. The ATC converts asynchronous data from the terminals into
   TYMNET's synchronous internodal protocol on one network link, or two
   network links (depending on configuration).

   The asynchronous ports provide transmission speeds from 110 and up to 9600
   bps for hardwired terminal access.  The ATC also provides asynchronous
   modem (full duplex) control signals for 110, 300, 1200, and 2400 bps dial
   up applications.  Another significant feature is customers may pick and
   choose or, mix the access connections on the asynchronous ports with
   hardwired and dial up terminal applications.

   Installation procedures have been simplified; the terminal user specifies
   the parameters characteristics of his/her terminal by entering a "Terminal
   IDentification character" (TID). The ATC then performs two distinct
   operations upon detecting the TID entered by the user, automatically;
   communications speed and character code set.

   When power is first applied, the ATC performs its own self-checking
   hardware test  and provides visual indication of its operational status on
   the front panel.
