1    Introduction     

   This manual provides the specified information needed by  the manager
of  a  MICRO-NODE  network. Topics  covered  include  general  rules for
configuring a  network and detailed  information on  specifying software
and hardware configurations of network nodes.

2    Node configuration      

   The  configuration  of each  node  in a  MICRO-NODE  network  must be
specified  in a  configuration  file for  that node.   In  addition, the
global configuration of  the entire network must  be specified in  a map
file for the  network.  Also, a link  command file must be  produced for
each node.  To generate the program for each node, the module COMMON.MAC
is assembled  with the  configuration file and  the module  ROUTE.MAC is
assembled with the configuration and map files.

   The resulting  object files are  linked along with  the pre-assembled
node object files which  are independent of the configuration  using the
linker program to produce a "image" file which can be loaded from a host
into the node using the NODLOD program.  The image file can be  input to
the  program NIBTRN  to produce  a "NIB"  format file  for  loading over
TYMNET using LOADII.

   A GENBAS  program is planned  to generate the  required configuration
and command files  for building a network  node.  Until this  program is
available, the configuration and  command files must be  edited manually
to indicate the desired configuration.

   Following is a complete typical node configuration file:

   Following is a  description of each  macro used in  the configuration
file:


**********
* DEFINE *
**********


   The  DEFINE  macro is  used  to assign  non-standard  values  to node
parameters.  It normally does not need to be used.  Its format is:

        DEFINE  parameter,value

Where:  parameter = name of node parameter to be defined
        value     = value for parameter


**********
* NAME   *
**********


   The NAME macro is used to  specify the name of the node.  It  must be
included in the configuration file.

   The LNKH macro is  used follow a LINK macro  for a type H  gateway to
specify the "hosts" which  are to be known  to Tymnet.  If this  node is
not to support  any hosts, i.e.,  if it is to  be a "TYMSAT"  only node,
this macro should not appear.   In this case the LKHST  modules  must be
loaded.  If it does appear, this node will be a "TYMBAS" and  the LKHBS 
modules must be loaded.  The format is:
        LNKH    TYMHST,NEXHST


Where:  TYMHST = Tymnet host number

        NEXHST = MICRO-NODE host name which corresponds to TYMHST


   There may be up to 4 hosts specified for each type H link.

   The LNKL  macro is  only used  following a  LINK macro  for a  type H
gateway.  It  specifies a  synchronous line  connecting to  Tymnet.  The
format is:

        LNKL    chn,nbr,speed,sat,type,xxxxxx


Where:  chn    = Number of channels on line (number of groups times 16)
        nbr    = number of neighbor node
        speed  = speed of line as follows:
                       1 = 2400 baud

Where:  dv     = two letter mnemonic for device
        level  = minimum priviledge level for connection to device
        xxxxxx = device dependent parameters

Valid devices are:


ST      Status  device -  this is  a software  device which  is  used to
        obtain status information from the node and to control the node.
        The status device is optional but should usually be  included to
        allow  access  to  data  stored in  the  node.   The  two device
        dependent parameters are the priviledge level for  examining and
        writing memory.


WD      Load device -  this is a special  device which is used  to down-
        line load  adjacent nodes.   It only be  used with  type B  or C
        links.   When included,  it must  always be  specified  with one

DEV macro must be followed by one or more SOC macros which  specify each
socket on the

   device as follows:

        SOC     sn,type,<xxxxxx>


Where:  sn     = socket number (must start at 1 and increase by 1)

        type   = type of device driver for this socket (not used  for ST
                 or WD)

**********
* HCL    *

   The HCL macro specifies any "host connect lists" which are to be used
by terminals on this node.  Each host connect list specifies  an ordered
list  of  host  systems  whs  used  when  a  terminal  is initially
connected to the node or  when a "connect" command is issued  without an
argument.  Format of this macro is:

        HCL     list,<host1,host2,...>


Where:  list  = a single letter which identifies this list.   First list
                must be "A", second "B", etc.

        host1 = name of first host system in list

        host2 = name of second host system in list

   The DHOST macro specifies a single "default host" which will  be used
as  the destination  whenever an  unknown host  is specified.   The host
specified will be used as the destination extension.  This  allows hosts
connected  to a  foreign  network connected  to this  network  through a
gateway  to  be  accessed  in  a  transparent  manner.   The  gateway is
specified as the  default host.  Any requests  for an unknown  host will
thus  be routed  to the  gateway, which  will then  use  the destination
extension as  the destination  on the foreign  network.  Format  of this
macro is:

   The LINX macro specifies the asynchronous terminal interfaces  on the
node.  Format is:

        LINX    type,<xxxxxx>

Where:  type   = type of interface as follows:
                   A = DLV11/DL11 single line interface

* LINE   *
**********


   Each line  on each  terminal interface  must be  specified in  a LINE
macro.  The  LINE macros  must immediately follow  the LINX  macro which
specifies the interface.  Its format is:

LINE num,fa,or,ir,cmd,type,code,pro,ask,snm,cm,acd,rob,duhw,hcl,priv

Where:    num  = socket number for port (must be in ascending order)

                 printer port.  If C or F, no parameters beyond this one
                 are used.   All C  or L lines  must follow  all A  or F
                 lines (even if on different interfaces).  F and A lines
                 may be freely intermixed as may C or L lines.

3    Routing configuration      

   For  all configurations  of MICRO-NODES  some routing  information is
necessary.    For  an   isolated  node   the  routing   is   simple  and
straightforward.  As the the number of nodes in a network increases, the
routing become more  complicated.  The routing information  is contained
in the ROUTE macro.   Generally the ROUTE macro  is placed in a  file of
the form RUxxxx.MAC, where xxxx is the node number.  The ROUTE macro has
three   parts:   node   identification   information,   local   resource
information, and connectivity information for all other resources in the
network.

   An example of a routing macro is:

; ru552.mac - network map for node 552 (and friends)
.macro ROUTE
        node    552
            NPATH   554,554

   The NODE statement specifies which node the information  that follows
is associated with.   Information which follows  a NODE statement  for a
node  other  that the  one  being  assembled is  ignored.   Thus  a NODE
statement is REQUIRED in  order for routing information to  be assembled
for a node.

   The first  NPATH parameter  specifies the  primary path  for reaching
other nodes in the network.  The second parameter specifies  a secondary
path to be used if the first is down.

   The  HPATH  statement specifies  how  to reach  resources  (hosts and
gateways) in the network.  The "*" indicates that the resource is in the
node being assembled.  It specifies a primary and a secondary  path line
the NPATH statement.

   The following table summarizes the modules required for  various node
configuration options.  Each module  should only be loaded once  and all
modules may  be loaded  in any order  after the  COMMON, ROUTE,  and XDT
modules except that END must always be the last module loaded.

   The base for the loaded  image should normally be 1000.  This  is the
default for the PDP-11 LINK11 linker.  It must be specified for the PDP-
10 cross-linker.  If  the node uses  an MXV-11 multi-function  card with
the ROM  area configured  for bank 0,  the base  address must  be 21000.
This must be specified for both the PDP-11 linker and the  PDP-10 cross-
linker.

   The following modules must always be loaded:

   CGxxxx,RUxxxx,EXEC,ERROR,PKT1,PKT2,PKT3D,ONCE,END

   If the  node includes  a Tymshare "watch-dog"  timer, the  DOG module
must be included unless the AUTO7 module is included.
This table shows modules required for each type of link.

   The AUTO6 and AUTO7 modules  cannot both be loaded in the  same node.
The AUTO7 module includes Tymshare watchdog timer functions, so if it is
loaded, the module DOG must not be loaded.

6    RSTS host configuration       

   In order  to use a  RSTS system  as a host  in a  MICRO-NODE network,
several  network  related parameters  must  be defined  at  SYSGEN time.
These parameters specify how the system is connected to the  network and
how  K.B.  numbers are  mapped  to network  terminals  or  devices.  The
parameters associated  with the  connection to  the network  specify how
many nodes are connected to  the host and give the device  addresses for
each interface  to a node.   Note that, unlike  other devices on  a RSTS
system,  the  device  addresses  for  the  network  interfaces  must  be
specified at SYSGEN time.   The correspondence between K.B.  numbers and
network terminals or  devices is also  specified at SYSGEN  time.  These
specifications establish a one-to-one correspondence between a RSTS K.B.
number  and  a terminal  or  device  on the  network.   This  serves two
purposes: first,  it allows an  "outgoing connection" to  be established
from  the  host  to  the terminal  or  device  by  simply  "initing" the
corresponding K.B. by a program; second, it guarantees that whenever the
specified device or terminal connects to the host system it  will always
be  mapped as  the  corresponding K.B.  number.  If  the  specified K.B.
number is not  available, the connection  will be refused.   This should
normally not happen since K.B. numbers which are specified to correspond
to a special network device or terminal are not used in the general pool
of network K.B.'s.

   The  configuration  of each  RSTS  host in  a  MICRO-NODE  network is
specified  in  the normal  manner  for  RSTS with  the  addition  of the
information  necessary to  specify the  connection to  the  network.  An
extended SYSGEN program  will be provided,  but, until it  is available,
the  following  proceedure  should be  used.   The  standard  DEC SYSGEN
program should be  run to specify  the RSTS system  configuration except
for the  connection to MICRO-NODE.   Any direct terminal  connections to
the  RSTS system  are specified  at this  time.  Note  that  the "multi-
terminal" and "echo control" features are not supported by  this release
of MICRO-NODE and must not  be included in the RSTS  configuration.  The
output  of the  SYSGEN  program consists  of two  files:  SYSGEN.MAC and
SYSGEN.CTL.   Both  of  these  files  must  be  edited  to  include  the
specification of the MICRO-NODE connection.  In the CONFIG.MAC file, the
following  lines  must be  inserted  just before  the  line  which reads
"; TERMINAL OPTIONS"

  NX    =       1       ;1 IF NEXILIS NETWORK SUPPORT; ELSE 0

   In the  above code,  upper case  letters indicate  text that  must be
included exactly as  given; lower case  letters indicate text  that will
vary according to the configuration.  Additional (or fewer) lines may be
required  in  some  places depending  on  the  configuration.   For each
network interface, each of the  symbols NnVEC, NnCSR, and NnSOC  must be
defined, where n is the number of the interface.  The first interface is
always numbered 0.  Also, a separate KBN line must be included  for each
"outgoing"  network  device.   The parameters  in  these  lines  must be
defined as follows:

      CLASS    = 200
      PRIORITY = 0
      TYPE     = 0
      SUBTYPE  = 0
      WRN      = 5
      MAX      = 7

The  DEVICE parameter  is the  full network  name of  the device;  for a
terminal this is:

      TRnNODE

Where "n" is  the port on  the node for the  terminal and "NODE"  is the
name of the  node.  The K.B.  number given must  fall with the  range of
network K.B.'s in this configuration.  Remember that network  K.B.'s are
assigned above all other K.B.'s in the configuration.

   The network map section must  include a "NODE" line for each  node in
the network, including  nodes which are  not directly connected  to this
host.   The  number following  the  node name  indicates  which directly
connected node  will be used  to reach the  indicated node  for outgoing
connections.  This  is the number  which is used  the NnVEC,  NnCSR, and
NnSOC symbols.  If a node is  not included in this table, it  will still
be able to connect to the host, but no outgoing connection from the host
to that node will be possible.

   Nexilis  Systems  provides a  set  of  PROM chips  for  the  DEC 9301
bootstrap module which allow a  Unibus PDP-11 node to be  loaded through
either a local  (DR-11) or remote (DU-11  or DUP-11) connection  or from
paper tape (for diagnostics).  A DEC compatible front-panel  emulator is
also provided  for use  with PDP-11/04  and PDP-11/34  machines equipted
with  the  operators  panel.   A  simple  memory  diagnostic  routine is
included.

   Startup  characteristics are  determined by  setting  the appropriate
switches on the 9301 card during installation.  The bootstrap can be set
up to expect commands from the console terminal or to boot automatically
from any one of 9 devices without operator intervention.

   The bootstrap is initiated by  the operator when the node  is powered
up  or  when the  "boot"  button (programmers  panel)  or  "init" switch
(operator's panel) is pressed.



   Console terminal commands

   The console terminal  startup option is selected  during installation
by  setting  the 9301  switches  as  per table  A.   The  bootstrap then
displays the contents of R0,  R4, SP, R5 and the '$'  prompt.  Initially
the registers contain garbage.  Now any of the commands from the console
command summary can be entered.

   After loading  the node  the bootstrap  waits several  seconds before
starting the node.

   The memory diagnostic option is selected with the  appropriate switch
settings from  table A.   This diagnostic  tests only  the lower  28K of
memory.  Any  error detected  will immediately halt  the CPU  at address
173742.  The bad memory location can then be determined by examining and
recording the contents of these registers:
          R0 = expected data
          R4 = received data
          SP = failing address

   This kind of error is not solved by skipping the memory  diagnostic -
your computer is sick!  Call your DEC representative for assistance.

                            *** Warning ***

   All normal boots  should be done  with the memory  diagnostic option.
This may be skipped but only  at the risk of your system's  integrity as
bad memory can cause any number of mysterious problems.

   Nexilis  Systems provides  a  set of  PROM  chips for  the  DEC BDV11
bootstrap module for the LSI-11 which allow a node to be  loaded through
either a local (DRV11) or  remote (DUV11) connection or from  paper (for
diagnostics).  A simple memory diagnostic routine is included.

   Since there are no option switches on the BDV11 module, the bootstrap
routine  scans all  devices for  activity and  loads from  whichever one
becomes active.  The bootstrap  is entered whenever the node  is powered
up or whenever the reset switch in operated.

   Complete information on the operation of the BDV11 bootstrap  will be
provided in a later edition of the document.

   The following specifies  all reserved PDP-11 memory  locations.  This
includes  the  recommended  device  register  and  vector  addresses for
network devices and interfaces.  Generally, only those devices which are
to be  used for  booting must be  at the  specified addresses  since all
devices are specified in the config file for each node.  It  is strongly
recommended that the addresses given here be used, however, to eliminate
the possibilty of conflicts.
