Introduction


     1.0 Introduction

          This document specifies  the  functional  characteristics  of  the
     program used to build PDP-11 based TYMBAS files.

          It is assumed that the reader is familiar with what a TYMBAS is ,
     with  the  information  required  to  build  a  specific TYMBAS and is
     familiar with how to run a program on the TYMCOM X system.

Purpose


     2.0 Purpose

          The purpose of the program is to facilitate the building  of  the
     files  required  for  installing a new code image for a PDP-11 TYMBAS.
     The procedure is to be a simple, straight forward, single step process
     which requires a minimum of operator attention.

General Description


     3.0 General Description

          The program to facilitate  the  building  of  the  PDP-11  TYMBAS
     images  creates  a command file containing the commands required to do
     the following steps:
         .Delete any extraneous files in the current directory
          for the node being built
         .Run the GENBAS program in (11TOOLS)  and answer its questions
         .Run MACN11, the cross assembler, in (11TOOLS) to create the object 
          files for the node specific modules
         .Run LINK11, the linker, in (11TOOLS) to create the core image
          file for the node
         .Run NIBTRN in (11TOOLS), which creates the NIB file for the node
         .If requested delete any interim file created in the generation 
          process
         .Get a directory of the files existing for the node

User Interface


     4.0 User Interface
       4.1 User Prompts

            The program asks the following questions, creates  the  command
       file  and runs the program (UPL)COM which causes the command file to
       be executed.
               Question                                   /*  Answer  */

            The output of the  program  is  a  command  file  of  the  name
       GNnnnn.CMD  where  nnnn  is the number of the node being built.  See
       Appendix B for a sample command file.

     5.0 Internal Description

          The GENNOD program is written in SAIL and is  closely  linked  to
     the GENBAS program.  The GENNOD program must produce the data required
     for GENBAS so any modification to GENBAS will need to be reflected  in
     GENNOD.   Also  any  change  to  the command lines required by MACN11,
     LINK11 or NIBTRN will need to be reflected in GENNOD.
