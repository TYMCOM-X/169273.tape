INTF BOARD - INTERFACE (MODEM CARD)           THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO VERSIONS OF THE uP 9600 INTF CARD. THE           EARLIER VERSION IS PART NUMBER -5061 AND THE LATER VERSION IS           -5161. THE PART NUMBER VERSION IS STAMPED IN BLACK INK ON THE           COMPONENT SIDE OF THE BOARD BETWEEN THE EDGE CONNECTORS. EACH           VERSION OF THE INTF BOARD HAS IT'S OWN CHART BELOW.        THE PRIMARY CHANNEL'S MASTER MODEM USES AN INTERNAL CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR        TO SUPPLY THE CLOCKS FOR SYNCHRONIZING THE TRANSMITTER TIMING PHASE        LOCKED LOOP.        THE PRIMARY CHANNEL'S SLAVE MODEM USES THE RECEIVER CLOCK TO SUPPLY THE        CLOCKS FOR SYNCHRONIZING THE TRANSMITTER TIMING PHASE LOCKED LOOP.        THIS RELATIONSHIP IS STRAPPED ON THE INTF BOARD (5061 and 5161) BY        SWITCHES: S6 #3  AND S6 #5.                MASTER MODEM = S6 #3-OPEN, AND S6 #5-OPEN                SLAVE MODEM = S6 #3-CLOSED, AND S6 #5-CLOSED        FUNCTIONALLY IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH MODEM IS THE MASTER, HOWEVER,        IT IS MANDATORY THAT ONE MODEM IS MASTER AND THE OTHER IS SLAVE IN        OUR POINT TO POINT NETWORK.        THE PRIMARY CHANNEL MASTER/SLAVE RELATIONSHIP SHOULD NORMALLY BE        STRAPPED TO MATCH THE SECONDARY CHANNEL RELATIONSHIP. THIS IS DEFINED        BELOW IN THE GUIDE FOR THE 96RD BOARD.  *****************************************************************************  *     INTF PCB  PN -5061  REV A and above

PROVIDES THE MONITORING AND INTERFACE FUNCTIONS OF THE           PRIMARY CHANNEL TO THE ANALYSIS SYSTEM.        THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWO VERSIONS OF THE 96RD BOARD. THE EARLIER VERSION        IS PART NUMBER -5061 AND THE LATER IS -5161. THE PART NUMBER VERSION        IS STAMPED IN BLACK INK ABOVE LOCATION 4A ON THE COMPONENT SIDE. EACH        VERSION OF THE RD BOARD HAS ITS OWN STRAPPING CHART BELOW.        THE SECONDARY CHANNEL MASTER/SLAVE RELATIONSHIP IS DETERMINED ON THIS        BOARD BY SWITCH S2 #4:  OPEN = MASTER,   CLOSED = SLAVE.  THE SECONDARY        CHANNEL MASTER/SLAVE RELATIONSHIP IS COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT OF THE        PRIMARY CHANNEL MASTER/SLAVE RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD BE THE        SAME IN EACH MODEM FOR CONVENTION'S SAKE. THE SECONDARY CHANNEL MASTER/        SLAVE RELATIONSHIP WILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE PRIMARY CHANNEL.        IT IS MANDATORY THAT ONE MODEM OF A PAIR IS MASTER AND THE OTHER MODEM        IS SLAVE IN OUR POINT TO POINT NETWORK.                                                                        page 7        96 RD BOARD Continued        AS A GUIDE FOR UNDERSTANDING WHY A MODEM IS CHOSEN AS THE MASTER, THE        FOLLOWING LIST IS IN DESCENDING ORDER OF CHOICE:                1. THERE MUST BE AN EIA BRIDGE (PN 170018-001) WITHIN FIFTY                   FEET (NOW OR PLANNED)                2. THERE MUST BE A TYMSAT/CONSAT TO SUPPORT THE PVC FOR THE                   EIA BRIDGE                3.

THE DROP NUMBER MUST        FIRST BE CONVERTED TO A BINARY CODED TWO DIGIT HEXADECIMAL NUMBER.        FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING DROP NUMBERS HAVE THEIR RESPECTIVE BINARY        CODED HEXADECIMAL RD ADDRESS BELOW THEM:             9,        10,        15,        16,        29,        30         0000 1001  0000 1010  0000 1111  0001 0000  0001 1101  0001 1110        REMEMBER THAT "ON = 0" AND "OFF = 1"        A DROP NUMBER OF 29 WOULD BE STRAPPED AS FOLLOWS:          1.
