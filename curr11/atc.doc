            TYMNET Asynchronous Terminal Concentrator -- ATC

1.  General Overview

The ATC (Asynchronous Terminal  Concentrator) is a compact  stand- alone
dead  ended  node, which  can  accommodate  up to  eight  (8)  remote or
clustered asynchronous lines.  It  then converts the serial  inputs from
each  port   into  TYMNET  compatible   data  packets   for  synchronous
transmission through its respective  network.  The ATC should  be viewed
as a low-end node, that is, it only passes its data into the network.

There is no down-line loading involved  with the ATC, due to the  use of
PROM based software.  The ATC uses a DEC  DCT-11AA  microprocessor  chip
and nearly  the full range  of instructions are  used.  A  more detailed
explanation  of  the  ATC's characteristics  will  be  covered  in later
sections.

3.  Theory of Operation

The ATC utilizes DEC's DCT-11AA microprocessor.  The ATC can accommodate
up to 24K words of ROM and up to 6K words of RAM.  It  incorporates five
(5)  Zilog  SCC's  and   one  (1)  CIO.   These   Serial  Communications
Controllers  provide  two  (2)  ports  each  and  the  Counter/timer and
parallel I/O chip is used to provide clock interrupts.

A simple RC circuit through a Schmitt inverter provides a delayed active
low after  power up to  pin 19 of  the microprocessor.  The  19.6608 MHz
crystal oscillator is divided by 4 in the 74LS393 to provide a  clock at
pin 22 of the T11.  The 4 MHz crystal provides a clock for the Zilog I/O
devices.

Most of the interrupt input pins 32 through 39 of the microprocessor are
permanently  pulled high  or low  in  the ATC,  since only  one  type of
interrupt,  called  the  "bus  interrupt"  is  used  in  the  ATC.  This
interrupt will be seen as an active low at pin 36 of the T11.

A 74LS367  tri-state buffer is  used for mode  control.  its  inputs are
strapped high or low, and its outputs are gated onto the bus by the BCLR
signal (pin  18 of the  T11) immediately after  power up.   These inputs
tell the CPU what mode to use.

A 74S139 is used for address decode, and provides chip enables to ROM or
RAM or an enable to  the 74LS138 that provides further decoding  for the
Zilog chip enables.

Two 74S373's  are used for  a transparent address  latch.  The  latch is
transparent until RAS (pin 29  of the T11) goes active.  Then  the latch
is latched until RAS goes inactive.

A 74LS240 inverter/driver provides increased fan-out for some of the T11
outputs.

The OR  gate at  the ready  input of  the T11  (pin 26)  provides cycle-
slipping during interrupts.  The pulsing COUT clock (pin 21) is fed back
as one input to the OR  gate.  The other input is held high  normally so
that READY does not see the pulses.  But, at interrupt acknowledge time,
SEL1 goes high and is ANDed with  RAS to drop one input to the  OR gate.
This allows READY to  see the COUT pulses, causing  cycle-slipping.  The
same AND gate output  that starts the cycle-slipping also  removes reset
from half of the 74LS393, allowing it to start counting a  delay.  After
approximately  1230  nanoseconds  the  74LS393  output  goes  high which
prevents further cycle-slipping and allows RAS to cause a read strobe to
the interrupting Zilog device.   The interrupting device places  a seven
(7) bit interrupt vector address on the data bus and the CPU  begins its
interrupt service routine.

Additional  gates  provide  read  and write  strobes  for  ROM,  RAM and
peripheral I.C.'s.

********************************************************************
*                          ITEMS OF IMPORTANCE                     *
********************************************************************


Along with  the theory  of operation, there  are additional  items which
should  be  kept  in  mind  when working  with  the  ATC.  They  are the
following:

       -RS232 connectors J1 through J8 are ASYNCHRONOUS.
        RS232 connectors J9 through J10 are SYNCHRONOUS.


       -Because  the ATC  is  a PROM  driven device,  (i.e.  "burned in"
        program  instructions)  the   creation  of  a  TYMFILE   is  not
        necessary.

       -Due to the above statement, the sync lines for the ATC  are wild
        carded.  This  means that the  neighbor node(s)  TYMFILE(S) MUST
        have XLINK with a window  size of eight (8).  (Note:  for custom
        networks, the default baud rate [9600] is allowed,  however; for
        the public network, XLINKS are not allowed and the  TYMFILE must
        have  specific instructions;  baud rate,  window  size, etc...).
        ALSO,  SYNC  CLOCKING MUST  BE  PROVIDED BY  THE  ATC'S NEIGHBOR
        NODE!!!!!

       -The ATC is further constrainted to being able ONLY to "hang-off"
        a TYMNET II node running under ISIS.  I will reiterate  that you
        can only have one (1) ATC sync port going to EACH neighbor.

       -Also,  when  both  sync  line  ports  are  utilized,  they  both
        simultaneously pass the I/O traffic flow.

       -Finally,  the ATC  provides no  TYMCOM functions,  and  can only
        handle  two   types  of   incoming  commands   and/or  messages:
        Supervisor  commands/ network  messages, and  remote diagnostics
        (i.e. XRAY and PROBE).  I will emphasize there are NO PASS THRUS
        and ATC to ATC CONNECTIONS.

4. Installation Procedure

**********************************************************************
*                                NOTE                                *
*                                                                    *
*   INSTALLATION OF THE ATC IN THE FIELD IS SIMPLICITY IN ITSELF.    *
*                                                                    *
*    SO, WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MIND, THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE WILL     *
*                                                                    *
*         ATTEMPT TO ADHERE TO THAT AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE!          *
*                                                                    *
**********************************************************************

   I.  Unpack and inspect the unit for any possible damage.

  II.  If  damaged,  return  the  unit  for  replacement.    Follow  the
procedure in Section 6:  Repair.

 III.  Remove the cover by using  a 3/32 inch Allen wrench.   The screws
can be found on  the left and right sides  of the unit when  viewed from
front.  A total  of eight (8)  screws will be  removed, one (1)  in each
corner.

  IV.  After removing  the cover,  you will notice  nine (9)  red rotary
dials.  The four (4) dials on the left side of the PC board are  for the
kernel host number and the next five (5) dials set the node number.
They are  labeled SW1 through SW9 from left  to right.
The dials are in decimal, but the values you will set them to will be in
octal.  EXAMPLE1:  NODE-2553, KERNEL HOST-553
                                 SW5=2      SW1=0
                                 SW6=5      SW2=5
                                 SW7=5      SW3=5
                                 SW8=3      SW4=3
                                 SW9=0
        EXAMPLE2:  NODE-12553, set SW9=1.


   V.  After  you have  set the  node and  kernel host  numbers,  do not
replace the cover.  Instead, connect a 300 baud terminal to the  J1 port
on the rear of the ATC.

  VI.  After the successful completion  of the above steps,  verify that
the yellow jumper on  the power supply is  set to the correct  value for
the line voltage source.   The jumper will be  set either to 110  VAC or
230 VAC.

 VII.  Apply power to the ATC.  The ON/OFF switch is located on the rear
of the ATC, between the fuse  holder and power cord.  If the  ATC passes
RAM test successfully, the message "RAM DIAGNOSTICS OK" appears, and the
TID  prompt is  then received  by the  terminal.  Type  in your  TID and
VERIFY that the node and port number are the correct numeric values that
you previously set in Section 4 item IV.


                                   5




(The node number, kernel host and ports assignmensts will come  from the
Project Implementation Group.)

THE  "PLEASE LOG IN"  MESSAGE IS SENT  AT  1200 BAUD.

VIII.  Now  connect  your  sync  lines to  the  appropriate  J9  and J10
connectors.

BE ADVISED THAT THE ATC SHOULD  NEVER HAVE BOTH SYNC PORTS GOING  TO THE
SAME NEIGHBOR NODE.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE ATC CAN NOT  SUPPORT MULTI-LINE
LINK LOGIC.

  IX.  Remotely log into PROBE and double check that the node and kernel
host settings are correct.  Also, do the same with XRAY.

   X.  Replace the ATC's cover, and inform the customer that the unit is
ready for operation.

  XI.  If any problems  are encountered with  the above, proceed  to the
next section of this guideline:  Trouble-shooting.


                                   6



 5.  Trouble-shooting

Established  TYMNET  recommended trouble-shooting  techniques  should be
followed when working on the ATC.  Those particular idiosyncrasies which
are  only  found  with the  ATC  will  be discussed,  and  they  are the
following categories:  XRAY, PROBE, DIAGNOSTIC PORT, ASYNC AND SYNC.

XRAY

Once you have logged into  XRAY, there are three (3)  available commands
which you can input at the prompt "#".  They are "c" for  configuration,
"a" for status of the eight (8) terminals and to display the contents of
a specific address, type in the address followed by a "/".  Please refer
to the XRAY manual for each command description.

PROBE

Please  refer  to your  PROBE  manual for  an  explanation  of available
commands.

Diagnostic Port

The diagnostic port is J1  on the ATC.

If you connect an async terminal to the J1 port, and power up  the  ATC,
fatal node error messages will be displayed if the ATC  crashes.   Also,
if the ATC passes its internal self test on power  up  the  message "RAM
DIAGNOSTIC OK" will appear at 300 baud.  An explanation of the three (3)
character code can be obtained from NTD.  The only drawback to  this  is
that the error message will be displayed only  once,  unless,  it  is  a
repetitive failure, in which case it will constantly be displayed to the
J1 terminal.  (NOTE:  This is ONLY  applicable  to  300  baud  hardwired
terminals, and does not apply to dial up lines.)


Asynchronous

The eight (8) async ports labeled J1 through J8 provide auto-recognition
for terminal speeds up to 9600 baud.  To determine a port  problem, find
a known working terminal set at 1200 baud and move its cable on  the ATC
end to the port which is in question.  If the terminal fails to  ask you
the TID,  replace the ATC.   If the port  does respond to  the terminal,
then you have either  a cabling or terminal  problem.  It will be  up to
you  to  determine which  it  is by  using  established trouble-shooting
procedures.


Synchronous

The two (2) sync ports, J9 and J10, run at 2400, 4800 and at  9600 baud.
Trouble-shoot sync problems along  the same lines currently used  on any
of  the node  to node  links.   Bear in  mind that  if the  ATC  port is
determined to  be the problem,  replacement of the  ATC will need  to be
done.

                                   7



6.  Repair

It has been determined that the  repair of the ATC will be done  only at
depot level.  This means that on  any unit which goes bad in  the field,
the  whole  ATC  will be  swapped  out  and replaced  with  a  new unit.
