1
                              SYMBOLS AND DEFINITIONS

^             Designates the following letter or character as a
              control character.  In general, TECO will allow you to
              type a control character in the "<up-arrow><character>"
              form, unless it is part of a text string within a search
              or insert command.

$             Altmode or escape key (^[).

<CR>          Carriage return key (^M).

<LF>          Line feed key (^J).

<TAB>         Tab key (^I).

<FF>          Form feed key (^L).

m or n        Represents any number.  Many TECO commands accept a
              numeric argument, which, if missing, generally defaults
              to 1.

i             Represents one of A-Z, 0-9, or * for Q-register
              commands.

Buffer        A block of core memory within TECO into which text is
              read or inserted, edited, and output.

Page          The amount of text read into the buffer by an input
              command or output by an output command.  Editing is
              performed in the buffer on a page by page basis.

Buffer Pointer
              Represents the current position within the buffer where
              editing is taking place; always positioned between two
              characters.

Q-registers   Auxiliary data storage locations available for storing
              numbers, character strings, and TECO commands.

Filespec

     dev:filnam.ext<prot>[proj,prog,sfd1,sfd2,..]/switch1/switch2..



2
                            CREATING AND EDITING A FILE

              The following monitor commands automatically run the
              TECO editor and perform standard file initialization.

MAKE filespec<CR>
              Create a new file with TECO.  Performs an automatic
              EWfilespec$.

TECO filespec<CR>
              Edit an existing file with TECO.  Performs an automatic
              EBfilespec$EY$ sequence.

TECO<CR>      Enter TECO using the file named in the previous edit.

MAKE filespec1=filespec2<CR>
              Same as "TECO filespec2", but direct the output to
              filespec1, and don't create a .BAK file.  (Performs an
              automatic EWfilespec1$ ERfilespec2$ EY$ sequence.) A
              "TECO" command will always ignore the second filespec if
              given, causing filespec1 to be editted normally.  This
              allows "TECO <CR>" commands following a MAKE command to
              continue to edit the newly created file rather than read
              from the original one again.

TECO filespec$command$...$command<CR>
              Execute the specified commands following the filespec
              automatically after entering TECO (works with MAKE too).
              The command string will be remembered as part of the
              filespec on subsequent "TECO<CR>" commands.  Note that
              the "$" characters shown are dollar-signs, not escapes.
              Since real escapes on the command line would cause the
              command to terminate prematurely, we make use of a
              "pseudo-escape" character, the dollar sign.  TECO will
              substitute real escapes as it executes the command(s).

R TECO<CR>    Run the TECO editor without selecting any files for
              editing.  File selection must be made with the TECO
              commands described under "File Selection".



3
                                 EXITING FROM TECO

EX            Output the remainder of the input file, close the output
              file, and then exit to the monitor.  If an ED command is
              in effect, run the specified program.

EG            Output the remainder of the file, close and then
              re-execute the last compile class command that was
              typed.

^C            Exit immediately to the monitor.  May also be used to
              abort an editing session (leaves original file intact).
              Typing CONTINUE (perhaps after performing some monitor
              commands) will allow you to resume your editing session
              where you left off.  Typing REENTER will cause TECO to
              abort any command string it may have been executing and
              ask for the next command.  (This is good for stopping
              infinite search loops, etc.) ^C can be entered in the
              command string by typing it as up-arrow C.

^Z            Close the output file and exit to the monitor.  (Simple
              close; no files are renamed).



4

              left of the pointer.

Z             End of the buffer; number of characters in the buffer.

              the K, P, S, T, and X commands.

              pointer position.

0L            Move pointer to beginning of current line.

              Q-register i to be inserted into the string at that
              point.

              characters except ^R, ^T, and altmode to be taken as
              text.  Nullified by a second ^T.  (Note:  does not work
              unless the monitor command "TTY RTCOMPATIBILITY" has
              been given).

              The following commands execute immediately when typed as
              the first character following the prompting "*".

^J <LF>       When typed immediately after the prompt, moves the
              pointer to the beginning of the next line and types the
              line.  (Same as 1LT).

^H            When typed immediately after the prompt, moves the
              pointer to the beginning of the preceding line and types
              the line.  (Same as -1LT).

;             When typed immediately after the prompt, moves the

              read into the buffer).

nStext$       Search for the nth occurrence (following the pointer) of
              the text delimited by S and altmode, but do not go
              beyond the end of the current page.  If n<0, search
