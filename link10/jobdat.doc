JOBDAT.DOC -- Changes from %431(447) to %432(452)
January 1983


1.0  SUMMARY

JOBDAT %432 implements the new JOBDAT locations .JBHSO and .JBBPT.

This version of JOBDAT supersedes  all  previous  versions.   It  runs
under  all  monitors.  It may be loaded with all monitors.  There have
been no bug reports.

JOBDAT is documented in the Monitor Calls  Manual,  Software  Notebook
Volume 4.



2.0  CHANGES

JOBDAT location .JBHSO (value 75) has  been  added  to  "reserve"  the
JOBDAT  location  as used by TOPS20 for DDT.  .JBHSO is meaningless on
TOPS10.

JOBDAT  location  .JBBPT  (value  76)  has  been  added  as  the  "DDT
unsolicited  breakpoint" vector.  If location .JBBPT is non-zero, then
DDT is loaded and the user program may cause a "DDT breakpoint" via  a
"JSR @.JBBPT" instruction (this capability requires DDT %41 or later).

JOBUAL (the start of the "user argument list" area within JOBDAT  used
by  the  TOPS10 monitor as a "scratch" area during various user calls)
has increased by 2 (to 77), with a resultant loss of 2  words  in  the
overall length available to the monitor.

The symbol JDA is no longer used.



3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

None.



4.0  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

No changes  for  old  procedures.   To  produce  the  UNIVERSAL  file,
assemble  with  a  parameter  file  defining  the  symbol %..UNV.  For
example,

     .COMPILE UNV.MAC+JOBDAT.MAC

where UNV.MAC defines "%..UNV==0".

5.0  SUGGESTIONS

None.
