;	.R MACRO
;	*TECO.ERR,TECERR/C=TECERR
;THE .REL FILE IS THE ACTUAL TECO.ERR.  THE LISTING FILE, IF YOU
;MAKE ONE, WILL SHOW THE ACTUAL INDEX, AND WILL CONTAIN E$$XXX SYMBOLS
;FOR EACH ERROR MESSAGE.  THE CREF LISTING MAKES FINDING MESSAGES
;EASIER.

;THE OUTPUT FILE CONTAINS AN INDEX, FOLLOWED BY THE TEXT.
;THE INDEX CONTAINS ONE WORD ENTRIES FOR EACH MESSAGE IN THE FILE.
;THE RIGHT HALF CONTAINS THE SIXBIT ERROR MNEMONIC, AND THE LEFT
;HALF CONTAINS THE DISK ADDRESS OF THE MESSAGE.  THE DISK ADDRESS
;IS ACTUALLY A WORD ADDRESS IN THE FILE -- DIVIDE IT BY 200 AND YOU'LL
;GET THE BLOCK NUMBER (MINUS 1) AND THE WORD WITHIN THAT BLOCK WHERE
;THE MESSAGE BEGINS.  A ZERO WORD MARKS THE END OF THE INDEX.


;THE MESSAGES ARE IN ASCIZ FORMAT.  A NULL TERMINATES EACH FULL

;?EEE	Unable to Read Error Message File
;An error, whose code was typed previous to this error message, has
;occurred, and while TECO was trying to find the proper error message
;in the error message file, one of the following errors occurred:
;1) the error message file, TECO.ERR, could not be found on device SYS:,
;2) an input error occurred while TECO was reading the file TECO.ERR,
;3) the error message corresponding to that error code is missing
;   from TECO.ERR,
;4) the user's TECO job does not currently have enough room for a
;   buffer to read the error message file into, and no more core can
;   be obtained from the monitor,
;5) for some strange reason device SYS: could not be initialized for
;   input.
;Note:	This message can obviously never be typed. It is included
;	for the purpose of documentation. Also the question mark
;	with which it begins serves as the terminator for the
;	last real error message.
;
;Documentation for TECO.ERR:
;
;This file is made up entirely of ASCII text.  It
;contains one entry for each TECO error number.
;the format of an entry is as follows:
;   ERR(PFX,<TEXT>)
;
;WHERE PFX IS THE 3-LETTER PREFIX, AND TEXT IS THE TEXT (WITH A CRLF
;BEFORE THE CLOSING BROKET.  REMEMBER TO KEEP BROKETS BALANCED
;WITHIN A MESSAGE.
;
;Note:	At certain places in this file there are control-N characters.
;	These signal TECO to type out special information at that point.
;	The information typed is determined by the two digit number
;	following the ^N, as follows:
;00   type last character seen in command string
;01   type name of output file
;02   type filename referenced by UUO
;03   type monitor error code from FILNAM+1
;04   type device name
;05   type project-programmer number at FILNAM+3
;06   type first numeric argument
;07   type file protection from FILNAM+2
;08   type EB filename without extension
;09   type input filename
;10   type EB command input filename
;11   type I/O error flags
;12   type missing command string tag
;13   get monitor error code from FILNAM+1 and skip to the
;      string ^Axx, where xx is a two digit octal number, then start
;      typing text at the character after xx.
;      If ^Axx is not found before ^B is encountered,
;      start printing immediately after the ^B.
;14   get device error code and skip as with ^N13
;15   (not used)
;16   type EOVAL for this version of TECO
