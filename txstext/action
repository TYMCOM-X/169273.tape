Dear Sir;

This is a long story but I'm enclosing copies of my documentation, so I'll keep
it short.I had been paying off my Guaranteed Student Loan, when the bank in
Boston notified me that they showed a computer error on my account, stating that
I was in default of my payments. I assured them that I was not and sent them
copies of the last 15 months' worth of payments to prove this, per their
request. I also stopped payment on the account until the problem was corrected,
per their instructions.

When I tried to follow up on this I got no response until I got the letter
telling me that my loan was now seriously in default and was being turned over
to the guarantor for payment. At this point, I have contacted the bank, their
guarantor, the State Banking commission in two states, and retained a lawyer to
attempt to straighten out a problem which I did not cause in the first place.
Now the IRS is threatening to garnish our income tax return! I am writing to you
at the suggestion of another lawyer whom I recently consulted. I would appreciate
it if you could refer me to the appropriate government agency (the one which
actually deals with these things; none of the ones I've contacted seem to have
anything to do with my problem; nor do any of them seem to know who does.)

Sincerely,
