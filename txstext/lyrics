                         I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU

IF I SHOULD STAY...
WELL, I WOULD ONLY BE IN YOUR WAY.

AND SO, I'LL GO 
AND YET, I KNOW THAT I'LL THINK OF YOU EACH STEP OF MY WAY.

REFRAIN

AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. OH...
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

BITTERSWEET MEMORIES-
I GUESS THAT'S ALL
I'LL BE TAKING WITH ME.

GOODBYE...PLEASE,
DON'T YOU CRY-
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
I'M NOT WHAT YOU NEED.

REFRAIN

BUT I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

(SPOKEN)
AND I HOPE LIFE TREATS YOU REAL KIND,
AND I HOPE YOU'LL HAVE ALL YOU EVER DREAMED OF.
OH I WISH YOU JOY;
I WISH YOU LOTS AND LOTS OF HAPPINESS,
BUT ABOVE ALL THIS/(SUNG) i WISH YOU LOVE...

REFRAIN

I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU....
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.
                    WHO SAID YOU COULD GO?

Who gave you permission; who said you could go?
You know if you'd asked me, I would have said no.

You always said we'd grow old together
You promised that's the way it would be.
You never said that one would go first-
How could you do this to me?

Who is there to cook for, and what is there to clean?
And how will I fill up the washing machine?
How do you sleep with nobody snoring...
Waste a tea bag for one cup of tea?
One loaf of bread will last me a month
How could you do this to me?

Who's going to balance the checkbook?
Who will correct me when I'm right?
Who's going to change the fuse, zip me up in the back
Who's going to kiss me good night?
Who said I was ready?
Who said I was strong?
I'd never desert you,
Not after so long.

You helped me through the birth of our children
You did your share of bottles and diapers
There at my side through mumps and through measles
You drove the car, paid off the mortgage
You always made me go to the dentist
And only you remembered my birthday

Whenever there was trouble
You managed to fix it somehow
And if ever there was a time I needed you-
It's now.
