RE:Update Status Report			DATE: October 15, l985
   Medical Record Department
   Word Processing Department
   July 22, l985 to October 15, l985

For the record, the following is a compilation of the issues which were 
addressed, problems which were identified and/or resolved, and projects begun
and/or completed from July 22 until October 15, l985:

o Revised and implemented the Attendance Policy and Procedure. This not only
brought under control the poor attendance habits of two problem employees, each
of whom had already received a First Letter of Warning in August regarding her
respective attendance record, but also allowed the department to realise a
savings of $2862.00, based upon unused sick time for all employees in August
alone.

o There was a marked improvement in general morale due to increased verbal and
written communication by supervisors and to scheduled variation of routine.
Supervisors also increased their efforts to be more visible and more available
within the department.

o There were far too many physical locations in the department where an
incomplete record could be filed. To date the Pencil File (completed records
whose chart covers from previous admissions are not yet available), Pathology
File (records which are lacking only the Pathology report in order to be
complete) and the PKU File ( newborn records which are lacking only the PKU test
report) have been permanently eliminated. Eight different Nursing incomplete
record files have been consolidated into three; the Summary File (records
missing only dictated reports) has been reduced from approximately 300 records
to 25, and the OB Summary File has been reduced by 50%. The final goal is 100%.
All of this was acomplished through a combination of work reassignment and
procedural revision.

o One historically difficult employee, who is also a union steward, had refused
to speak to the Evening Supervisor  since she had started work in the department
over a year ago. This behaviour had been recognised but ignored by the two
previous department managers. Based upon effort directed at opening up
constructive dialogue with this union employee, she is now freely communicating
with her supervisor.

o A problem was discovered with backlogged subpoenae for medical records (some
with stale-dated checks still attached) dated as far back as two years
previously. The employee responsible for this function had not been keeping
adequate records of the requests and subpoenae which he had been receiving.
Upon meeting with him on several occasions, he explained that he had failed to
do his job because he felt overwhelmed by the volume of work to be done. This
led to the reprioritisation of his job functions, and his agreement to bring any
future problems he feels he is having to my attention for prompt resolution. A
tracking system was also designed and implemented, whereby he can easily chart
the progress of the subpoenae and requests he is processing. Also, anyone who
covers for him can easily interpret and maintain it.

o The number of Continuing Education hours still available to each employee was
established and a schedule devised to allow employees to attend as much relevant
instruction as possible on an ongoing basis.

o A chart purging procedure was implemented to replace the former inefficient
one. In addition to the implementation of color-coded year tapes to facilitate
record pulling, the biggest single improvement was the sucessful negotiation
with the Storeroom Manager for the use of his electric truck to transport much
larger numbers of boxes of records than the staff had ever been able to move
previously. This allows us to reduce 60 round trips to an outlying building,
using a small, wheeled cart, to 1, using the truck.

o The proposed 1986 operating budget was reworked to include the cost of new
office equipment necessary for the upcoming installation of computer
applications and equipment which is to be installed in the department in May,
1986. These recalculations increased the projected budget by approximately 300%
over last year's, but was approved with very little revision, based upon
verification of the calculations used.

o No personnel evaluations had been performed since March of 1984 because of
time constraints placed upon previous supervisors. Upon discovery of the
problem, half of the staff has been evaluated in a two month period, and the
department is presently current.

o A cost-benefit analysis was performed in order to validate the department's
ned for its own photocopier, a need which will become only more serious when
the reorganisation of all Release of Information functions is finally completed
and installed in the department. The analysis resulted in administrative approval
for the purchase of a 3M photocopier, in spite of previous notification by
hospital administration that no additional approval for photocopier purchases
would be granted until 1986, or beyond.

o As an interim emergency measure, the department held a Chart Blitz party for
both resident and staff physicians to encourage them to complete their
delinquent medical records, thereby bringing the incomplete chart count down to
a level which is acceptable to the JCAH. This effort included a vigorous
promotional campaign aimed at the physicians by our staff by means of fliers,
posters, memos, use of the physiican newsletter, word of mouth and invitations.
The resulting physician attendance was excellent, and an estimated 400+ records
were completed.

o The physician suspension procedure, which had never been implemented, was
reviewed, revised, and is in the process of being implemented. This effort has
included much negotiation with physician department heads to assure their
buy-in, and thereby assure the success of its implementation.

o Many Quality Assurance audits have been performed, not the least of which is
one on the status of dictation awaiting signature. Based upon the results of
this audit, a revised procedure has been drawn up and implemented, whereby
outpatient dictation is no longer sent to physicians' offices for signature. It
is instead kept in the Medical Record Department and pulled for signature when
the physician arrives to complete his/her records. After it has been signed, it
is sent to the Chartroom to be filed with the patients' outpatient records.

o Revised the loose lab filing procedure and reduced the volume of unfiled loose
lab work to 30% of July levels. It is projected that this backlog should be
eliminated by the end of October.

o Designed and implemented an improved system to process incoming loose lab
work. The system enables staff to immediately identify which work belongs to
patients who are currently in-house, and to send it back to the nursing floor to
be filed in the patients' records. Previously, these loose reports had been held
in the department until the patient had been discharged, thereby making our
staff responsible for handling loose work which should have been filed by unit
clerks.

o Designed and implemented the current system of processing fetal monitoring
tapes, and eliminated a three month backlog in the process. This backlog was
eliminated in August.

o Revised the chart assembly procedure to update and clarify changes mandated by
administration.

o Assisted with revisions of the CRT screens to be used with the Case Abstracting
System (CABS), to be installed in early 1986.

o Designed and implemented an orientation program for incoming residents from
all services, to educate them as to the importance of proper dictating methods
and formats, in order to reduce time spent researching missing and incorrect
information by both medical records and word processing staff.

o Designed and implemented data collection forms to gather the information
necessary to extrapolate valid productivity standards.  These standards will be
established when sufficient data has been collected to establish valid results.

o Have designed and implemented improved scheduling control of department
personnel.

Word Processing

o Revised and implemented the Attendance Policy and Procedure.

o Designed and implemented a productivity standards study using line count as
the new statistical basis for establishing revised productivity standards.

o Facilitated the acquisition of three additional FTEs from the Business Office
to process the  increasing volume of Release of Information requests.

o Re-evaluated the job functions of the Abstract Clams clerks and established
new policies and procedures which more accurately reflect the tasks they are
performing. Also designed and implemented data collection forms to gather
productivity standards information.

o Revamped the attorney request clerk's duties when the position was eliminated
from the budget.
