Subject: St.Louis KL#1300 call 

We received a call to look at a crash on cpu#1300 and called the FE and
the FE's beeper and received no response.  I logged into OSTC.DEC1 but
it is homed to KL#1195 at the moment and both 5243&5244 report host down.

I called the computer center, @Roe West's # 314-232-7151 and no one was
working on the machine... so, if they need our help... we just have to
wat for them to call us back.

I have version 2.31 of KERMIT for the DEC Rainbow available for
downloading from The Pot of Gold Fido (1:109/483) at 1-703-359-6549.
The BBS supports 300-2400 baud, and you can download with XMODEM,
MODEM7 or KERMIT.  The versions for the IBM and GRiD are also available
at the same BBS.

	MSKERM.ARC	Documentation for Version 2.31
	KERRB.ARC	DEC RAINBOW version

FidoNet (or FidoNet compatable) nodes can file request either or both of
these files during non-ZMH hours.

Joe,
  I put some of the things from my tape on PUSH:[1,2,*] including 2 versions
of SED (POssibly the same version? I didn't look) in [1,2,sed] and [1,2,sed,nih]
fo you to look over.

  PUSH:[1,2,SYS] has the system files from GALLAUDET, with many of the .EXE

Subject: St. Louis KL Administration 

Jim,

  As I promised earlier, the following document is a few pages of information
on how to modify a userid on the KL system in St. Louis.  I gave some little
introduction about the two programs, and what each one does (is used for).

  I also show how to use the commands we need and give examples of all the
things we expect to do before the beginning of the year.  I will see what
needs to be done in order to allow MDCIS to create NEW userids at will.

(This can be done now in a limited range of user ids.  I'd like MDCIS to
be able to arbitrarily use as many ID's as they want, in whatever ranges
they want.  I'll talk to you all about it later!)


I also attached the HELP TEXT for SADMIN which tells about ALL of the
commands.  When I come to St. Louis to give a presentation on how every-
thing works, I will spend some time on the rest of the SADMIN commands.



If you have any problems or questions... please send mail, or call me at
the office.  If I am not there, please call (408) 922-6224 to reach our
secretary and she will have me paged if the matter is urgent.

Thanks again.

PS.  I will be turning off the user id's about 1 hour from now!



	    A Brief Cookbook on using AT&T's  ADMIN programs

1.0 Introduction

There are two programs: SADMIN and MADMIN.  They should be run from the
userid 31,31 so that you may have all the privileges that AT&T has been
using over the years.

SADMIN is the program to use to list accounts, add new accounts, delete
or modify accounts.  AT&T wanted to distribute this function to each of
the sub-administrators in various regions, thus SADMIN may be run by
multiple users at the same time from various locations.

MADMIN is the program to copy the changes into the actual accounting
files and make them permanent.  You must be logged in as 31,31 to run
the MADMIN program.  Only one person may run MADMIN at any given time.


2.0  Using SADMIN

The basic commands needed at this time will be TYPE, CHANGE and SUBMIT.
The TYPE command allows the administrator to list all the information
about a given user id.  The basic format is:

    TYPE USERID
    T USERID

An example follows:

    .R SADMIN
    *TYPE 37,36
    Userid: 37,36  [37,36]
    Password: XXXXXXX
    Privilege bits:
    MULUSE
    Name: MDFSCO      
    VM limits: Maximum physical pages: 512   Maximum virtual pages: 512
    IPCF limits: Maximum IPCF reads: 2   Maximum IPCF writes: 5
    Profile bits:
    TIMPSW BATCH BATSUB REMTTY DATSET REMOPR LOCAL SPOLPT SPOPLT 
    SPOPTP SPOCDP SPOCDR 
    Expiration date: 1-JAN-90
    Scheduler class: 1
    Maximum ENQ/DEQ's allowed: 511
    Structure: DSKC  FCFS: 20000  Logged-out quota: 15000
    Mailing address:
    Osman Guven    MDFSCO
    2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    P.O. Box 49019
    San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    Telephone number:  (408) 922-6236

    *EXIT
    .

Note:  It is always a good idea to EXIT from SADMIN when you are
       finished with your work.

2.1 The CHANGE command

The CHANGE command allows the administrator to change one or more of the
fields associated with a user id.  The following items may be changed if
the administrator has the privilege enabled for that field.

    ACCT, NAME, PASSWORD, LOC(ation), PROFILE (bits), PRIVILEGE (bits),
    VM (limits), IPCF (limits), CUSP (to run), EXPIRATION (date),
    SCHEDULER (class), ENQ (limits), FCFS (in quota), OUT (quota),
    AUXACC (disk space quotas), ADDRESS, PHONE, DOLLAR (limits),
    PPNSYS (requisitions)

For our purposes, we are primarily concerned with NAME, EXPIRATION,
ADDRESS and PHONE.  The examples below show how to change some of these.

    .R SADMIN			; Change the expiration to 1-Jan-90
    *C EXP 37,36		;   for userid 37,36
    Expiration date: JAN-90
    *SUBMIT			; Submit the changes to MADMIN
    *EXIT			; Exit
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's telephone number
    *C PHONE 37,36
    Telephone number: (408) 922-6236
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's mailing address
    *C ADDRESS 37,36
    Mailing address:
    \Osman Guven              MDFSCO
    \2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    \P.O. Box 49019
    \San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


3.0 Running MADMIN

MADMIN updates the accounting files and makes the changes made by SADMIN
permanent (until another change is made, and MADMIN is run again).  You
must be logged in as 31,31 to run MADMIN.

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N
    [Processing completed on ACCT.SYS]
    [Processing completed on ADRCOM.SYS]

    .

4.0 Examples

 o  Change a single user's expiration

    .LOGIN 31,31
    Password: xxxxxxx

    .R SADMIN
    *C EXP one-user-id
    Expiration date: NOV-88
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N
    [Processing completed on ACCT.SYS]

    .KJOB


 o  Change multiple user's expiration

    .LOGIN 31,31
    Password: xxxxxxx

    .R SADMIN
    *C EXP one-user-id
    Expiration date: NOV-88
    *C EXP another-user-id
    Expiration date: NOV-88
    *C EXP one-more-id
    Expiration date: JAN-89
    *C EXP and-another-id
    Expiration date: JAN-90
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N
    [Processing completed on ACCT.SYS]

    .KJOB

	  LIST and TLIST command.  listfn refers to the
	  list functions.

        ALL
        ACCT
        AUXACC
        PPNSYS
        STUDY:st        st - study type

    Note:   Leaving the userid blank on those commands (CHANGE, TYPE,
	    ADD and REMOVE) that permit it cause the current entry, if
	    any to be used.

    Example:
	*CHANGE NAME 40,41
        Name:

        *TYPE

        (lists all ACCT entries with a study type of A0 for all
        userids beginning with WE on the user's terminal)

    Note:   C is a valid abbreviation of CHANGE.
	    T is a valid abbreviation of TYPE.

    Note:   If a requistion number is to be deleted, first delete the
	    number from each USERID by using the REMOVE REQUISITION
	    command.  Then the REQUISITION DELETE command may be used
	    to delete the requisition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result of our conversation with Greg Gray, he will establish a
"Dummy" service code to handle records being passed to CPIP from the
KL-10 that are for services for which we will NOT be chargeing. An   
example of these services would be "Plotter Mounts" or "DECTape Mounts".
This "Dummy" service code will e "K99", with a description of
"Miscellaneous".  It will NOT have a cost code assigned to it, so that
the records coming from CPIP will go to the reject file, and not show
up on either the invoice or the detail backup.

If you have any questions, please call......

Carl,

I need your help.  Jim O'Connell is in Sales Training Class this week.  He
received a call from a user that is planning on continuing processing
next year.  The user would like to know approximately what his cost would
be.  Since Jim is not in the office, he called me to as to run
the Bill-10 program on the users November data.  If you
could send me documentation on how to run, I will do it for Jim so
that he can pick up the report when he stops by tonight.

The PPN in question is 31544,62142.  Give me a call.

Thanks,
Debbie

Carl, I talked to Greg Gray and he says there is no special blocking that
they require.  A 154 character, EBSIDEC tape will be okay.

Carl, Please add MCN 1608726 for all the PDT2A users.  Also I talked to
Joe Huelett and Glen Kasinger who are the KL-10 operators, they don't
know how to write an EBCDIC tape on the KL-10.  you will need to call them
at 314-234-5588 and let them know what needs to be done.

Debbie,
  I forgot to send the confirmation that 1608726 has now been entered for
all AT&T users that had a PDT2A study type 'PD', even if they also had any
other study types.

  The expiration date of 1-Jan-90 has also been entered for these accounts.


Subject: Testing progress

  It turns out that there were some minor requirements on the CPIPS data
that wasn't known until today.  The data is required to be blocked at 100
records per block (spaces filled to padd out unused records).  This has
been done [This afternoon].

  One other "glitch" we found was that COBOL writes it's data as:

    <lf> record <cr>

  so that multiple records are separated with <cr><lf>, but the file ends
  up starting with a lone <lf> and ending with a lone <cr>.  This also caused
  some problems for CPIPS, so I will have to edit the data each day just
  prior to shipping it to CPIPS to fixup the lone <lf> and <cr>.

  I did this by hand this evening, and Bob Brown will run the test in the
morning and let us know the results.

Subject: Updated SADMIN document 

Jim, Debbie, Walt...

  PLEASE NOTE:  I found out that you must use a SUBMIT command in
		SADMIN for each userid.  If you change multiple
		user, each one must have a separate SUBMIT command.

		SADMIN has a work area and if you change id-1 then
		id-2 without issuing a SUBMIT command, it forgets
		all about id-1.  Only the last id referenced will
		be sent to MADMIN with the SUBMIT command.

  I have updated the document I previously sent you (about 2 hrs ago)
  and am re-sending the entire document.  The change is on page 3 with
  the examples (section 4.0).

	    A Brief Cookbook on using AT&T's  ADMIN programs

1.0 Introduction

There are two programs: SADMIN and MADMIN.  They should be run from the
userid 31,31 so that you may have all the privileges that AT&T has been
using over the years.

SADMIN is the program to use to list accounts, add new accounts, delete
or modify accounts.  AT&T wanted to distribute this function to each of
the sub-administrators in various regions, thus SADMIN may be run by
multiple users at the same time from various locations.

MADMIN is the program to copy the changes into the actual accounting
files and make them permanent.  You must be logged in as 31,31 to run
the MADMIN program.  Only one person may run MADMIN at any given time.


2.0  Using SADMIN

The basic commands needed at this time will be TYPE, CHANGE and SUBMIT.
The TYPE command allows the administrator to list all the information
about a given user id.  The basic format is:

    TYPE USERID
    T USERID

An example follows:

    .R SADMIN
    *TYPE 37,36
    Userid: 37,36  [37,36]
    Password: XXXXXXX
    Privilege bits:
    MULUSE
    Name: MDFSCO      
    VM limits: Maximum physical pages: 512   Maximum virtual pages: 512
    IPCF limits: Maximum IPCF reads: 2   Maximum IPCF writes: 5
    Profile bits:
    TIMPSW BATCH BATSUB REMTTY DATSET REMOPR LOCAL SPOLPT SPOPLT 
    SPOPTP SPOCDP SPOCDR 
    Expiration date: 1-JAN-90
    Scheduler class: 1
    Maximum ENQ/DEQ's allowed: 511
    Structure: DSKC  FCFS: 20000  Logged-out quota: 15000
    Mailing address:
    Osman Guven    MDFSCO
    2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    P.O. Box 49019
    San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    Telephone number:  (408) 922-6236

    *EXIT
    .

Note:  It is always a good idea to EXIT from SADMIN when you are
       finished with your work.

2.1 The CHANGE command

The CHANGE command allows the administrator to change one or more of the
fields associated with a user id.  The following items may be changed if
the administrator has the privilege enabled for that field.

    ACCT, NAME, PASSWORD, LOC(ation), PROFILE (bits), PRIVILEGE (bits),
    VM (limits), IPCF (limits), CUSP (to run), EXPIRATION (date),
    SCHEDULER (class), ENQ (limits), FCFS (in quota), OUT (quota),
    AUXACC (disk space quotas), ADDRESS, PHONE, DOLLAR (limits),
    PPNSYS (requisitions)

For our purposes, we are primarily concerned with NAME, EXPIRATION,
ADDRESS and PHONE.  The examples below show how to change some of these.

    .R SADMIN			; Change the expiration to 1-Jan-90
    *C EXP 37,36		;   for userid 37,36
    Expiration date: JAN-90
    *SUBMIT			; Submit the changes to MADMIN
    *EXIT			; Exit
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's telephone number
    *C PHONE 37,36
    Telephone number: (408) 922-6236
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's mailing address
    *C ADDRESS 37,36
    Mailing address:
    \Osman Guven              MDFSCO
    \2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    \P.O. Box 49019
    \San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


3.0 Running MADMIN

MADMIN updates the accounting files and makes the changes made by SADMIN
permanent (until another change is made, and MADMIN is run again).  You
must be logged in as 31,31 to run MADMIN.

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N
    [Processing completed on ACCT.SYS]
    [Processing completed on ADRCOM.SYS]

    .

4.0 Examples

 o  Change a single user's expiration

    .LOGIN 31,31
    Password: xxxxxxx

    .R SADMIN
    *C EXP one-user-id
    Expiration date: NOV-88
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N

    Note:   C is a valid abbreviation of CHANGE.
	    T is a valid abbreviation of TYPE.

    Note:   If a requistion number is to be deleted, first delete the
	    number from each USERID by using the REMOVE REQUISITION

Subject: Expiration dates set 

Jim,
  As of the time of this message... all expiration dates are set.
A few users with PPNs in the DEC or SYSTEM range, such as 1,2 and 30,30
have been virtually unaffected.  However, any account in the system range
that I personally didn't know who it belonged to, was set to NOV-88.

  I will assume any of these will be dealt with accordingly
.


It took longer for the batch job to run than I figured... and it appears that
there is a limit on how many account can be modified at a time before MADMIN
is run.  (It is very large, but less than 2000).


Anyway... I'll be working on th erest and will give Walt status updates as
necessary.

Subject: Test of accounting data 


Debbie,
  I received your ONTYME about the tape information.  I believe creating
the tape will be easy.  If operations does not already have a procedure
to do it, I can walk them through one and we can record it for the future.

I have updated the summary file data through December 14th.  The automation
will be completed after we are sure we don't need to make any other changes
to the source code.

  There are still the concerns about service codes with zero charges for
the items which we collect information on, but do not charge our customers
for using.  I have not heard anything from you or Jim on this topic since
I've brought it up.

  I've entered K99 for as the service code for the following items which
we do not "ever" expect to see on the KL-10.

    Plotter mounts, Plotter elapsed time, Plotter minutes plotting
    Paper-tape-punch (PTP) mounts, PTP elapsed time, PTP feet punched
    Paper-tape-reader (PTR) mounts, PTR elapsed time
    Dectape mounts, Dectape elapsed time
    Fast Fortran Jobs (SITGO)
    Miscellaneous Services (we want to count these, but not here)

These codes apply for both prime and non-prime


  I've also entered the following codes for items we do expect to see, but
for the moment, we are not charging anything for.

    K80 Job Sessions (Logins)
    K81 Batch jobs
    K82 KL-10 Kilo-core minutes [Prime]
    K83 KL-10 Kilo-core minutes [Non-Prime]
    K84 Disk mounts
    K85 Disk elapsed time
    K86 Magtape mounts
    K87 Magtape elapsed time
    K88 Line-printer mounts
    K89 Line-printer elapsed time
    K90 Disk Kilo-blocks read [Prime]
    K91 Disk Kilo-blocks read [Non-Prime]
    K92 Disk Kilo-blocks written [Prime]
    K93 Disk Kilo-blocks written [Non-Prime]
    K94 Magtape Kilo-blocks read [Prime]
    K95 Magtape Kilo-blocks read [Non-prime]
    K96 Magtape Kilo-blocks written [Prime]
    K97 Magtape Kilo-blocks written [Non-prime]

The charge for these should be entered in CPIPS as 0.

Note:  K98 is not assigned, otherwise K80 thru K97 refer to items that we
collect dat on, but do not charge.  I believe that if we provide detal info
for our customers, these should be passed to the customer... because it will
allow us to 1) charge for them later if we choose, and 2) show the customer
what he is doing to the system as far as resource utilization.  Especially
if we decide to help our customers to work "better" or "smarter".

I have made thses changes to the rate table in [31,31] and copied it to SYS
so we can generate our test data.

I would like to test it today if we can choose a time that Greg or Rick
can allocate for us in their schedules.

It will take me 15 minutes to generate the data, and whatever time it
takes operations to write a tape (I'll do it if they don't know what needs
to be done to write EBCDIC tapes).

The we give it to the CPIPS people.

(Please excuse my typing... I'm slightly dyslexic and a little tired at
the moment.)   I will call you when I get to the office.  If you want to
test this before 2pm your time, please call my office and let Karin Okey,
our secretary now what time... 

Thanks again for your help in setting up the test.

Subject: TOPS-10 Accounting system 

Walt,

  I need to talk with you about installing the new accounting system on
the TOPS-10 KL in Saint Louis.  I have already built the initial versions
of the data gathering, account summary and reporting programs.

  What still needs to be done is:

  1)  Install a filter to read the raw accounting records written by AT&T's
      accounting DAEMON.  (Later, we want to modify their DAEMON to add the
      characters read/written information... but that isn't necessary yet!
      When that phase is ready we will need whatever co-operation is necessary
      from AT&T so that we don't mess up their billing programs.)

  2)  Obtain whatever co-operation we need from AT&T to allow us to rebuild
      and release newer versions of certain system utility programs.  These
      include the accounting DAEMON, and the MONITOR.

      Note:  We are not asking for information about their billing system,
      (which I am told they are unwilling to give us), we are asking for the
      co-operation (or authority) to modify certain specific programs which
      I have identified as direct interfaces to the new accounting modules so
      that both accounting systems may co-exist thru the end of December.

  3)  I need to start the ball rolling and setup a meeting with you and your
      group (to show you the possible detailed information we can provide) and
      at least a second day to have us meet with someone in accounting to
      determine what they will accept from our system.  (I have the detail
      layouts of the TYMCOM-X RAW ACCOUNTING records, and see where we can
      insert most of the infor from the CUA system, but we need to discuss
      the level of summary/detail we want to pass to CPIPS/MPIPS).


Please give me a call.  (408) 922-6206, secretary (408) 922-6224

I will be out of the office for an off-site meeting until 1pm PST, so if
we cannot arrange for a call today (Tuesday) please contact our secretary
to let me know.   I will also be taking vacation Wednesday afternoon thru
Friday, so I do have some urgency in arranging to talk with you.

Thanks Again.
