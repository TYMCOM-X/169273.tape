    The SETOP program allows a user with an opername on the TYMCOM-X system
    to perform various housekeeping functions.  Anyone with a valid opername
    may:

     o  List information on:
	- himself or herself
	- any specific opername
	- opernames managed by himself or herself
	- opernames managed by any specific opername

     o  Show license and capabilities on:
	- himself or herself
	- any specific opername

     o  Change any unrestricted information on himself or herself including:
	- password
	- telephone number and inter-office mailstop
	- internet SMTP mail address


    An opername that has manager capability may also:

     o  Change any unrestricted information on any opername in his or her 
	management tree including:
	- password
	- telephone number and inter-office mailstop
	- internet SMTP mail address
	- user name of employee
	- supervisor name, telephone and inter-office mailstop

     o  Transfer an opername from one manager in his or her management tree
	to any other opername with manager capability in the same tree.

     o  Place an opername in his or her management tree in a temporary hold
	state which has the effect of removing license and other capabilities
	from that opername.  (This is used to temporarily prevent an opername
	from being used without affecting any of the information known about
	that opername).

     o  Release an opername in his or her management tree which has has been
	placed in temporary hold, thus allowing full use of that opername.


    An opername with license grant capability may:

     o  Grant any of the accumulated license received from managers or any
	other opername to any valid opername in the database.

     o  Remove any license previous granted by this opername to any other
	opername.  (A side-effect of removing license from an opername is to
	remove that license from any opernames that received a grant from the
	specified opername.  Note:  This may cause a "ripple effect" removal
	of license.)
	


    In addition, any opername may submit a request to:

     o  Add an opername.
     o  Cancel an opername.
     o  Transfer an opername.
     o  Change any restricted information about an employee.




SETOP Internal and External Design Information
==============================================

Record Types

    Employee Record		Description of authorized individual
    Opername Record		Description of an Opername
    License Grant Record	Description of who is giving what license

    Password File Record	7 word binary format used in password file


The Master File

    The master file is actually split into two parts.  The first part
    (the Structure file) contains the tree structure, license, password
    and grant records in a binary record format.  The second part (the
    Employee file) contains information about the employee in text format.


The Structure File

    The Structure file uses the first page as a status and directory map
    for the data contained in it.

    Name		|  0  File verification ;
    Format		|  1  File format version ;
    Version		|  2  SETOP program version ;
    Size		|  3  Size of file in pages ;
    Lock		|  4  Write-lock for entire file ;
    Read		|  5  Read-lock for entire file ;
    PPN			|  6  Change PPN ;
    Change		|  7  Change date-time TDT ;
    Next		|  8  Next date-time to change ;
    Extra		|  9  Extra
    Extra		| 10  Extra
    Extra		| 11  Extra

    SAT			| 12  First space allocation word ;
			| **  12-511 block allocation table ;


    The second and succeeding pages of the structure file contain the
    opername and license grant record data.


Employee Record

    The employee record is a description of an authorized individual that
    requires some particular privilege or capability that is unobtainable
    just by having a valid username on a particular host computer system.
    The information in this record is needed to track the person that is
    responsible for using a particular opername.  The direct line of
    corporate management may also found in this record.  (As such, it is
    possible for an employee record to exist, without any status, for the
    sole purpose of tracking an individual's manager).

    Employee Number			ISG Employee Number
    District Number			Marketing District number
    Entry Info				Date-time of entry, who entered
    Employee Name			Name of Employee
    Employee Phone			Phone number, interoffice mail stop
    Security Mail address *		SMTP mailing address
    User Name of employee **		Assigned network username(s)


*   In the event of any suspected improprieties, SMTP mail will be directed
    to this address or to the address specified in the manager's record for
    this opername.  A message may also be sent to the address designated by
    those individuals that have granted various licenses to this employee.

**  This username will be used to identify access via the appropriate network
    to the host systems designated herein.  In the event of any suspected
    security breach the owner of this username will be contacted as well as
    other appropriate security officials.

    The usernames that may use this opername as designated will be permitted
    to use this opername without question.  Any others will be flagged by the
    stream reader and mail will be sent to the appropriate parties.

    Note:  The opername belongs to the specified employee.  The main
    purpose of the username list is for those employees that use more than
    one username in the normal process of work.
    


Opername Record

    The Opername record describes completely the capabilities of each
    opername associated with an individual.  An employee may have any
    number of different opernames.

    Oper Name				12 character oper status name
    Password Cipher			Hashed password
    Password Change TDT			Date and time of password change
    Who changed password 1-12		Opername that changed the password
    Payroll Site # and ISG #		ISG Employee info
    Marketing district			Marketing information
    License				Implicit license for this name
    Grant,,Gift pointers *		Link to list of grants and gifts
    Employee info pointer		External pointer to employee info
    Management chain pointers **	Manager and subordinate pointers

*   A linked list of capabilities is kept with pointers to the opername and
    the employee that granted and received the license.  This list allows
    different licenses to be granted by different opernames and merged into
    a single license list.

**  Internal pointers will be maintained to indicate the management tree
    structure including the Manager and Subordinates for all opernames.
    This information will be readily available.

License Grant Record

    Each license grant record will describe the license that is to be passed
    from one opername to another.  Each record will be linked to all other
    records for a particular opername and to all licenses granted by an
    opername.  Note:  The two lists thus linked will have no bearing on the
    management structure or each other.  Thus, any opername may pass any of
    it's license to any other opername.

    For reasons of security, if any license is taken away from any opername,
    any license grants by that opername will also lose license.  To prevent
    problems when an employee leaves the company, the employee's record can
    be marked inactive rather than cancelled until all licenses passed by
    that opername to others can be "passed" by some other opername (propably
    one taking the place of the employee that is now gone).

    All license grant records contain activation and removal dates.  If
    the activation date is 0, the entry date is used.  If the removal
    date is 0, no termination is assumed.

    Grantor pointer			Opername granting license
    Receiver pointer			Opername receiving license
    Grantor list link			Next grant by this grantor
    Receiver list link			Next grant for this receiver
    Activation Date			Start Date
    Removal Date			Stop  Date
    License value			License mask granted/received

    Note(1):  All opername entries initially default to no license.  The
    special licenses SU, LG and MG allow the user to manipulate the SETOP
    database.  SU is for SETOP validations use only.      opername to grant license to other opernames.  These licenses should
    only be assigned in special circumstances.    MG is to allow opernames
    to manage other opernames.

    Note: Any opername may be requested as a placeholder with no actual
    license capability.  Such opernames may be modified later or left as
    manager records for other users with valid opernames.

    As part of the conversion effort, all opernames from the system password
    file will be converted to the new format and merged with information for
    each name from the appropriate individuals.  Any opername record that is
    not updated with with a valid ISG number by the designated cutoff date
    will remain in the database, but each time a new system password file is
    created said opername records will not have an entry in the password file.

				given license by this employee via this
				opername will also lose their license.
				If this is the last license being removed in
				a grant record, the grant record will be taken
				out of the list unless it is the only record.
