I just got my Jan/Feb issue of _Workbench_, and there is an extensive article
on building a dust collection system.  They have the cfm tables, and sketch a
layout for a simple system.

	That's all ?  That's ALL ?   Hah!  This is highway robbery.
	Even if he is a pro.

	It's an outrage (or a typo).  I suggest he be paid the typical
	fee of $35 for a 90 minute lesson (usually a game plus commentary).
	Let him earn the extra by giving lots of lessions.  I'm sure there
	are many that would be willing to pay $35.
