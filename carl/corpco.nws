current and historical trading statistics on more than 50,000 stocks,
bonds, mutual funds, and other securities from 11 major U.S. and
Canadian exchanges.  Lynne's survey determined:

  - how things are going with those customers
  - what sort of improvements or additions they want
 
Two concerns expressed by the ACs are now being addressed:
 
  - transfer of the PDP-X and 370 systems to Dallas to meet customers'
    needs for timely updates
  - addition of the McDonnell Douglas name to brochures, and the production
    of new data sheets
 
If you are interested in TYMQUOTE, please contact Kelli Ramirez at
ACS.K/RAMIREZ.
 
 
 . . . . . . . ONTYME CONNECTION:  FEATURES AND BENEFITS . . . . . .
 
The OnTyme Connection (Version 2.0) has many important features:
 
- Binary file transfer using the XMODEM protocol
- Automatic redial to an alternate number, for ease of access
- Selection of COM1 or COM2 ports within the software
- Baud rate selection from the SETUP screen
- User programmable timeout configuration from within OnTyme
- Error-free text transmission using the XMODEM protocol
 
The micro-based OnTyme Connection benefits are:
 
- Off-line message preparation decreases the connect time to OnTyme,
  resulting in major cost savings to customers
- Its full-screen editor is easy to use
- Message preparation using any micro-based editor or word processing
  package results in greater flexibility
 
The 2.0 version will be released this summer.
 
 
 . . . . . MAY PROFILE:  ONTYME - AN INTERVIEW WITH SHERRI HOROWITZ . . .
 
WHAT IS ONTYME? . . . .
 
OnTyme is the premier product for ACS!  An electronic messaging system
first developed by Tymshare, OnTyme is now hot.
 
OnTyme runs on specially manufactured minicomputers (called OnTyme
engines) in the TYMNET network.  The software combines the Pascal
nucleus, ISIS (Internally Switched Interface System) and OSIRIS (the
OnTyme code).
 
NEW VERSION COMING SOON . . . .
 
Version 20, due for release in June, includes several new features, most
importantly:
 
BINARY FILE TRANSFER - Ensures error-free transmission from your PC to
OnTyme, using the XMODEM protocol.


                                                                   PAGE 4

 
NORMAL CIRCUIT BUILDING - Enables you to build a circuit to a host in
the TYMNET network, and transfer temporary control back and forth from
OnTyme to the host processes.  This feature is important to customers
wanting to
 
- distribute by OnTyme some files now stored on a host (without
  retyping the files)
- build OnTyme EXEC files that can include host processes, and
  answers to host prompts
 
FASTER PROCESSING - Greatly improves processing time when you are
creating and editing messages and files.
 
SALES PROMOTION . . . .
 
Look for lots of activity in the next few months:
 
- Brochures and data sheets:  June
- Nationwide advertising:  mid-summer
- Yankee group story:  probably summer
- Improved coverage in trade magazines
 
FUTURES . . . .
 
Electronic Messaging Systems manager Sherri Horowitz is seeking field
input to help determine the future direction of OnTyme.  She
specifically wants you to identify qualified prospects for OUTDIAL
capabilities and, PROFS and MVS/TSO connections.  The question is:  Is
there a market for them?

      DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS COMPANY ANNOUNCES THE MODEL 426!!
 
                     !!VIDEO DISPLAY TERMINAL!!
 
 
 
Cupertino,   California  --  May 17, 1985  --  A  smart,  editing 
terminal  useful for word processing,  financial spreadsheets and 
other   specialized  applications  is  being  announced  by   the 
McDonnell Douglas Distributed Systems Company.
 
Designated  the Model 426,  the terminal features an 80  or  132-
column  display for financial spreadsheet operations,  as well as 
expanded editing and programming features.  It also works in both 
conversational and  block mode,  thus enabling full compatability 
with 3270 type applications.
 
The   terminal  features  programmable  cursor  keys   for   word 
processing  programs such as Wordstar,  a variable format display 
memory,   variable   speed  vertical  scrolling  and   horizontal 
scrolling.  The Model 426 provides two pages of 80/132-column  by 
24-line  display memory (plus 25th status line),  or a choice  of 
wide  and  long page memory configurations.  A four  page  memory 
option  is  also available to double the standard memory  formats 
and  add  a  158-column by 48-line "Super  Page"  display  memory 
format.
 
The  keyboard layout,  soft function keys and display memory  are 
popular  wordprocessing features.  The emulations also provide an 
upgrade  path  for  users  of  the  Model  426  and  other  smart 
terminals.
 
This  ergonomically designed terminal features  16  non-volatile, 
programmable  function  keys (shiftable to 32 functions) and  400 
bytes  of dynamically allocated function key  memory.  Additional 
features  include  auxilliary  port and  independently  set  baud 
rates, and a 12 inch green or amber screen. 
 
Priced  at $745.00 in single quantities,  the Model 426  will  be 
available for shipment in June 1985.

RE:       *****    P R I N T E R   S P E C I A L   ***** 
 
 
For a limited time only while supplies last, Distributed Systems is
making the following two SPECIALS available on the 
 
                 I B M   G R A P H I C S   P R I N T E R 
==============
 
SPECIAL # 1 
 
============= 
 
     Order any IBM PC, PC/XT or PC/AT system and monitor and 
     receive an IBM GRAPHICS PRINTER for only 
 
                        $ 5 0 !!! 
 
     That's right! For the cost of the cable alone, you will 
     receive an IBM GRAPHICS PRINTER and CABLE. 
 
     For example, DSC's price for a PC with 256K of memory, 
     a monochrome display and no printer is: 
 
       PC256K-MC-NP    $2,829 
 
                                                                Page  2
 
     For only $50 more you will receive that configuration  
     plus an IBM Graphics Printer and Cable: 
 
       PC256K-MC-GP    $2,879   
 
     That's a reduction of $243 off the current price!! 
 
  ********************************************************** 
 
     The suggested list price for this SPECIAL OFFER is 
     a PC256K-MC-GP configuration for: 
 
             ****  $3,714  **** 
 
  ************************************************************ 
      
 
     Compare $3,714 with the current suggested list price 
     for that same configuration, $4,103, and with the current 
     price for the no-printer (PC256K-MC-NP) configuration,  
     $3,664. 
                    
                   **   A N D   ** 
 
 
     REMEMBER---All PC's shipped by Distributed Systems include:  
 
          * 1200 Baud internal modem 
          * Dos 2.10 (3.1 for AT's) 
          * TymComm Communication Software 
          * Basic 
 
TO RECEIVE YOUR COPY OF THE PRINTER SPECIAL PRICE LIST FOR IBM PC'S,
PC/XT'S AND PC/AT'S contact Marian Lawrence at (408)446-8877 or via
Ontyme at DSD.M/LAWRENCE.

Including, cable, shipping and handling for only: 
 
 
                    $ 3 7 5  ! ! 
 
This is DSC's Price (internal transfer price).  The suggested list 
                                                                Page  3

Subject:      ISG EXECUTIVE BOARD DECISION ON THE FIELD FACILITIES 
              CONSOLIDATION PROGRAM



The Executive Board has approved moving forward with Phase I of 
the recommended plan for consolidation of selected field office 
locations into shared ISG Business Centers.

The initial metropolitan areas to be addressed in the plan include 
New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, 
Chicago, Denver, Houston and Dallas.  These eight areas represent 
over 50% of the annual ISG real estate lease expense and personnel 
in field locations.

A task force of real estate management representatives from five 
ISG business organizations will team with Dick Miskell, Director - 
ISG Field Facilities, to develop a specific detailed 
implementation plan and schedule for each metropolitan area.  The 
actual consolidation process will be implemented over a three year 
period and will involve other metropolitan areas.

An executive level Steering Committee comprised of representatives 
from six ISG organizations will be utilized to review and 
recommend policy needs.  These policy recommendations will support 
the implementation and remote office administration needs of the 
shared ISG Business Centers.  Specific areas to be addressed 
include the remote office administrative organization structures, 
office standards and the tenant cost allocation process for real 
estate lease expenses as well as common office services and 
equipment in the shared environment.

These new ISG Business Centers will increase McDonnell Douglas 
visibility in the ISG major market places, optimize office 
services through the larger shared office environment and obtain 
maximum leverage in lease negotiations to reduce long-term real 
estate lease expense.  Please give your support to the task force 
over the next few months to expedite completion of this task 
assignment by the Executive Board.

TO:       ISG MANAGEMENT LEVELS A-H

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFITS PACKAGE



1.  Distribution of the new ISG Benefits summary plan 
    descriptions is scheduled for Saturday, July 27, 1985.  As 
    managers you will receive the first packets.  This advance 
    copy will allow you to review the material prior to the 
    general employee mailing.

2.  Original plans called for you to receive your packets one 
    week prior to the mass distribution.  Due to printing delays 
    and the need to hold to the implementation date of 
    September 30, 1985, there will only be a two day difference 
    between packets mailed to management and those mailed to the 
    balance of employees.

3.  Enrollment meetings are scheduled at major business unit 
    locations throughout August.  A schedule of meeting dates 
    and sites is included with the packet.  Your support of 
    these enrollment sessions is critical to the success of the 
    program.

4.  Specific questions about the enrollment procedure or 
    benefits booklets can be referred to Karen Welch 
    (714) 250-1000 or Joe Hoffman (314) 232-8488.

     SUBJECT:      PROMOTION OF P. A. JELINSKI




     I am pleased to announce the promotion of Peter A. Jelinski to 
     the position of Director Business Management-Manufacturing and 
     Engineering Systems of McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
     International (MDISI).  Peter will remain in The Hague and report 
     to me.

     He will have business management responsibility for international 
     sales of ISG manufacturing and engineering systems products.  
     Peter is well qualified for this position having had sales and 
     management experience in Europe since September 1982 when he 
     joined the Nordic office in Stockholm and then assumed 
     responsibility of General Manager for the Nordic operations in 
     February 1983.  In January 1984, he was promoted to European 
     Manager of CAD/CAM and moved to The Hague.

     Peter first joined MDC in July 1972 as a scientific programmer in 
     Huntington Beach.  He then joined Control Data Corporation in 
     January 1977 in Minneapolis where he was a unit manager for 
     software field support and later was promoted to senior 
     consultant for CDC computer systems marketing.  He rejoined 
     McAuto in June 1982 in St. Louis and moved to Stockholm in 
     September 1982.

     Born in London, Peter is an American citizen and attended schools 
     in Montreal and California.  He received a B.A. in mathematics 
     from California State University, Fullerton in 1971.  In 1972 he 
     was graduated with an M.S. in mathematics from the University of 
     London.

     Peter and his wife, Kerstin, are the parents of two children:  
     Rebecca, 2, and Christopher, who is 3 months old.  Peter attended 
     the ISG Marketing Achievement Club in 1984 in Jamaica.  He is a 
     member of the American Management Association.

     We are looking forward to receiving the benefits of Peter's 
     business management, insight and knowledge of planning and 
     contributing to the sales of ISG`s manufacturing, architectural, 
     engineering and construction products on an expanding scale 
     internationally in the near future.  Your cooperation with him in 
     achieving our greater goals will be greatly appreciated.

***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
    DATE:  AUGUST 16, 1985                                           
 
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  NEW COURSE OFFERING --- "COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS"
          
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
The Wilson Learning "Counselor Selling Skills" program, used 
extensively by the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, is now 
available to all ISG employees. 
                                                                         
Counselor Selling is a CUSTOMER focused program, rather than being 
product-focused like the Xerox-based programs.  It teaches how to 
build relationships with potential customers and how to achieve a 
MUTUALLY AGREED UPON UNDERSTANDING of their situation PRIOR to 
discussing the features and benefits of one's product(s).  It focuses 
on creating a "win-win" environment where the prospect WANTS TO BUY, 
rather than trying to "sell" the prospect.  Participants receive pre- 
and post-course feedback from potential and actual customers of their 
choice.
 
The seminar will be conducted by Randy Lipson, trainer for Bob 
Donoghue, Inc.  Randy has 23 years of sales experience and is former 
PSS-II & III trainer.  Employees' cost centers will be charged $710 
for their participation in this four day seminar.  This seminar is 
scheduled for the following dates: 
 
                 Oct. 21-24                  San Jose

***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
     
   DATE:  AUGUST 19, 1985                                                  
                                                
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)                       
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  MT&PD MANAGEMENT TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINDER 
          OF 1985.                                                     
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
Given current initiatives to reduce costs within the ISG, a number of 
questions have been raised about programs conducted by MT&PD.  The 
following summarizes the status of these programs.
 
     1. All "Phase" programs in St. Louis scheduled between August 19 
        and December 31, 1985 have been cancelled.  A full schedule
        of Phase seminars is planned for 1986;  allocations for 1986 
        Phase slots will be made early in 4Q85.
 
     2. All San Jose MHP seminars will be held as scheduled, allowing 
        all Bay Area managers and supervisors to be trained by
        December, 1985.  The September MHP for New York has been 
        postponed until 1Q86.
 
     3. All other MT&PD programs will be held as scheduled, so long as 
        minimum enrollment requirements are met.  (A complete
        schedule is available on ONTYME; type :READ *** MTPD.SCHED)
        Enrollment in any MT&PD seminar (which includes a cost 
        recovery charge-back) requires written approval of your
        manager.  In some divisions additional levels of approval may 
        be required prior to confirmation of enrollment.
                                          
If you have any questions about MT&PD programs, please contact us at
408/446-7813, HRD.TRNG (ONTYME), or VG2-A04 (inter-office mail).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
 
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
                                                                Page  2

   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.
 
   * Vacation records will be maintained in PPSII begining 09/30/85.
     This will require the number of vacation days taken by each 
     employee in 1985.  The amount of vacation accrued in 1985 (Jan.01
     thru Sept 30) will be calculated based on service date.  The 
     number of vacation days taken will be deducted from the 1985
     accrued time.  The figure that management will be asked to supply
     is the number of  vacation days each employee has taken in 1985 
     (Jan thru Sept) which were earned in 85.  Any vacation days taken
     against time earned in 1984 are not to be included.
 
   * No Borrowed Vacations
     The ISG vacation policy requires that vacation time be earned,  
     prior to being taken.  It is possible that under the present 
     Tymshare practice that by 09/30 an employee may have taken more
     days than have been earned to date, resulting in a negative value.
     This value will then be balanced out as an employee accrues  
     additional vacation days.
 
   * The procedures for vacation advances will be covered in a seperate
     memo.
 
2. In order to assist in the collection of the above information, you
   will be given a worksheet via the attendance system by Sept 6 with
   the names of all the employees assigned to your area.  This listing 
   will have space to fill in the requested data and can be used as an
   input sheet Sept 24 - 27, when inputing to the collection system.
 
3. Please direct your questions to the author via Ontyme to HRD.TOSH.

MEMO
 
T-RJF-009
 
TO:       The World
 
FROM:     Asset Control
 
SUBJECT:  Physical Inventory of Fixed Assets
 
As  announced previously via Ontyme,  McDonnell Douglas  Business 
and  Network  Systems will be conducting a physical inventory  of 
fixed  assets on October 1,  1985.   This inventory will  involve 
only  those  locations  whose assets are  tracked  in  Cupertino, 
California.   These  locations have cost center  numbers  between 
2000  and 6000;  those cost centers falling outside this range or 
which have alpha-numeric designations such as L475, etc. will not 
be included in this inventory.     
 
The purpose of this inventory is to insure that all fixed  assets 
are   recorded  at  their  proper  locations,   and  to  allocate 
depreciation expense correctly.   We must rely upon the personnel 
at  each  location  to  give us  the  most  accurate  information 
possible.
 
Inventory  packets  will  be sent to contact  personnel  at  each 
location  by  September 20,  1985.   These packets  will  include 
complete inventory instructions,  as well as a Physical Inventory 
Report listing all assets which the Cupertino Fixed Asset  System 
shows as being held at your location.  Additional asset tags have 
already been sent to those who have requested them.
 
You  will  be asked to (a) verify whether you do or do  not  have 
each  item on the Physical Inventory Report;  (b) tag and  record 
those assets which have not already been tagged;  (c) give us any 
information you can for those assets shown which you do not have; 
and  (d)  tag  and record any assets you may have which  are  not 
shown  on  the report.   Completed inventory packets  are  to  be 
returned the day following the inventory to:
 
McDonnell Douglas ISG
Asset Control Department
VG1-B12
20705 Valley Green Drive
Cupertino, California  95014
 
Only MDC-owned assets are to be included in the inventory; do not 
tag  items  which are on lease or loan from outside the  company.  
Also, all company-owned equipment located at employees homes must 
be brought in to your office location for tagging and recording.
 
 
 
 
 
Items to be inventoried and tagged are as follows:
 
A.   All  computer  equipment - CPU's,   memory,  disk  and  tape 
     drives,  controllers,  processors,  line and laser printers,      
     etc.
 
B.   All personal computers (main units and printers).
 
C.   All terminal equipment.
 
D.   Modems (except those associated with engines, which will be 
     inventoried separately with the engines).
 
E.   Specific  office  equipment  - copy  machines,  tyewriters, 
     bursters, collators, microfiche printers, etc.
 
F.   Specific  test  equipment  - oscilloscopes,  volt  meters, 
     off-line testers, etc.
 
G.   Specific  furniture  - microwave   ovens,   refrigerators, 
     conference  tables,  etc.  (do not tag desks,  chairs,  file 
     cabinets, adding machines or other low-cost items).
 
Complete  lists of items to be or not to be tagged,  as  well  as 
instructions on tagging and recording assets, will be included in 
the instructions you will receive in your inventory packets.
 
If  you  do not receive your inventory packets by  September  20, 
1985,  or  if  you  have any questions regarding  the  inventory, 
please  contact  either Bob Forgione at (408) 446-6516  or  Peggy 
Bollinger at (408) 446-7760.   Also, if you have not already done 
so,   please  send  the  following  information  via  Ontyme   to 
FIN.FIXEDASSETS immediately:
 
(1)  Name and Ontyme I.D.  of person responsible for controlling 
     inventory procedures at your location;
(2)  Contact phone number;
(3)  Organization/Division name and cost center(s);
(4)  Full   address   for   shipment  of   tags   and   inventory 
     instructions;
(5)  Mailing  address  for  shipment  of  tags  and   inventory 
     instructions;
(6)  Estimated  number of tags needed for assets not  previously 
     tagged.

SUBJECT:  Budget Input Forms
 
 
For  those  of you who received budget input forms,  I'd like  to 
clarify some of the information presented.   The actual column on 
the  input sheets represents the year-to-date figure rather  than 
the  monthly  amount.   For  example,  the  March  actual  figure 
represents the actuals for January, February, and March.  It does 
not represent the actual just for the month of March.
