Subject: Hotline Call 

Bonnie called me at 10 minutes to 8, and I responded late (at 9:20pm when
I returned home) that the Japanese customers were complaining about SPOOL
and BIONIK and a fortran program TOKTYP that were causing them problems.

This same problem occurred last week, DEC 22, when the SA-10 problem caused
them to put 74 on the spare KL. I presume they swapped the SA-10 and brought
things up on 74's base... 'cause the japanese customers reported the problems
fixed shortly after that.

I checked out BIONIK and BIONIC, Bonnie and I checked out TELECOPY and all
block-io programs appeared to be having problems.  BIONIC received every 4th
byte transmitted (? really ?) and TELECOPY failed miserably.

I found out they were using node 2100 for the base (?the bad one?) and had
Bonnie call FSC to have the base swapped out for Node 6722's hardware.  It
took until 2:00 for them to get the base loaded after the swap out.

The system answered by 2:40 and I logged in and tested BIONIC.  Cindy from
operations checked out TELECOPY and it worked ok.  I asked her to put a note
on the base 2100, that BLOCK-IO doesn't work on this base.  (I thought the
bad base was retired?)

System 74 is up on the spare KL (that is why it was using node 2100) because
the SA-10 is still down... need to check with FSC to find out when X32 will
be back with it's own SA-10.

Subject   : F74 another problem    
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Rick,
     
Now, we have another problem on F74 (or the Base for F74).  
     
Our customers have sent files on to F74's KANA files by BIONIK, I will mentione 
about the BIONIK below, and the sent files had a problem.   
     
Some portion of the files, 8chars or 12 chars string, was replaced  as
unexpected same length string.
     
1. The characters which were replaced seemed to be by some Word unit. 
   (In KANA file,a word is 4 chars.)    
     
2. BIONIK is modified version for KANA file creation of BIONIC, and was    
   generated by ex-Tymshare person for NIS, ex-KTL. The program is located 
   on (UPLKT:74).   
     
3. About the timing of the problem, following 4 cases are reported.   
     
        In JST 
     
        '87  Dec  21st  morning    
                  21st  evening    
                  24th  morning    
        '88  Jan  06th  evening    
     
4. In those cases, the customers had made an access to F74 through 2 or 3  
   kind of HSA slot in Japan. 
     
5. We also know some unstable condition about I/O to F74 from the end of the    
   last year to the begin of this year. 
     
6. We have changed nothing in past one month, about BIONIK, HSA slot, etc. 
     
     
Regarding above matters, even though we have no explicit evidence, sorry,  
I suppose there might be some problems about I/O for F74 (or Base ?). 
And about the problem, the customers are very frustrated on our F74 system.
     
So please check and advise me on it, or please pass this letter to appropriate  
person. (Who is responsible about F74's system program now ?)    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: FFIle recovery? 

Dan,
  I called your office and got no answer... since it seemed urgent
I thought that if the problem was that something was deleted, or lost
then you should know that the best thing to do is to contact the system
operator and have them restore the file or files in question from the
previous day's backup tapes.  (this presumes that the lost information
is at least a day old, when it was lost....)

  Let me know if this helps.... send me mail to CARL@D35

  You can call the operator, or you can send a batch request to restore
the file(s).  SPecify the date-time you know the data was good and when
you know it was lost and they should be able to find a copy on tape.

Subject: Re: Meeting... next week 

Wayne,
  Next week would be a time for us to get together.  I've been working on
the mapping package I'll be using for SETOP and haven't done anything new
on the actual program.

  I just started working on the program the past couple of days and have
fitted the new routines into the main program.  I expect to have a scaled
down version of what we originally talked about so we can talk about it
by next week.

  The main additions over the previous SETOP version will be the audit trail
and the tracking of license holders by their ISG numbers.  There will be the
capability to grant license to people that do not report to you, but the
capabilities based on this will be more limited.

  Tracking ISG numbers will be the biggest problem still!!!  How will we
verify the id numbers given.  Do people like me give 212344 (the number on
my badge), 008324 (the number on my payroll checks) or 808324 (the number
I'm listed under in the benefits/human resources computer)?  People who have
joined CSC or FSC and paid out of Irvine after the badges were issued have
numbers such as 008324 in payroll and on their badges.

  I suggest that we ask for a company name, eg. FSC and we insert a code
for each ISG company/payroll and allow all the varieties as long as we can
code them accordingly.  I think I can squeeze in a payroll code somewhere
in the current record description...

Subject: Block I/O problem 

Joe,
  In memory of my previous patch to track down a similar problem with
block i/o, I think it would be a wise idea to install a similar check
in the monitor to verify that the base did indeed write a full/partial
block-i/o buffer and if the base skips a word somehow, do one or more
of the following:
	Issue a black-ball received on port (data lost)
	Issue a new messge type to the base to retransmit the block-i/o buffer
	Error return to the user, cause is data lossage?

I think that there should be some handshake to tell the base that we did NOT
receive the buffer when it sends a message in the ring saying it is done
writing a block-i/o buffer.

Joe,
  When you copied things from 930/62 ==> 32 and then 32 ==> 33, 34, ...
did you copy (SYS), (SAILIB), (FTSYS), ...?

  I just remembered.... that I patched the SAIL runtimes on system 62 to
do something different than on all the other systems.  I guess I can re-think
what I did to patch it, but if the patched version is around... I'd like to
get it in a place where I can use it.

  What I patched was the remote-interrupt stuff to use frame-interrupt calls
instead.  The only program that uses intrmt (or rmtint?) is CHKPNT on device
ACT: anyway.  I doubt we'll ever rewrite it into SAIL...

      Actual contact, Danny King @home 713 721 4101, for system 370.
      Yes, this is Fayez sarofim...

Problem: Support in diagnosing the hardware problems, cause of system crashes
      over the past month.  FE would like some assistance.

History: Looked at the crashes on disk, CRA004-CRA008, CRA011-CRA014, CRA015.
      All but CRA015 were of the same type; in FILIO, DTASAT+4 had received
      an i/o interrupt for the disk, the PGYIO table says no i/o in progress
      so crash!

      CRA004-CRA007 were on RMA0, CRA008,CRA011,CRA012 were on RMA1, and
      CRA012-CRA014 were on RMA0.  (Danny says they had Fayez swap drives
      for a time).  CRA015 looks like a shutdown... SYSCRS/ NOCRS.

      I looked a little deeper, and tracked the CONO/DATAI info to see if
      there were any common patterns and relayed the info to Danny.  Spent
      a little over 2 hours.

Follow up:  We can look on Monday to see if there is anything else we can
      give to Danny, otherwise, hope the info already given was enough for
      him to track down the problem.

To who if may concern... if you receive this and you are not responsible
for (NETALERT)ALERT, please pass it on to whomever is now responsible...

Why are there 5 jobs running ALERT?  I thought that the proposed idea was
to keep a single ALERT program running on multiple systems so that ONE of
them would always be running even when systems are taken down or crash...

If this is still true, and there is more than copy of ALERT running on each
system, then somethng is wrong with the logic in the program.  Someone needs
to look at it.

I've only brought this up, and sent this message because I recall a comment
in a meeting with Gary Walker, that (NETALERT) was one of the largest CPU
users on system 70 just before it went away...  If multiple copies of ALERT
are running on the same system, we are wasting TYMNET's computing resources.

Thank you for your attention.

Subject   : F74 PROBLEM

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Carl and Dennis,

At first, I'm sorry I'm not sure that you are the right person to be contacted
on such problem. However, in my old memory, you have been the responsible
persons for PDP-X system software.

The problem on F74 reported during the middle of the last Dec and today, by
many users.

And the problem is becoming very critical.

So please check and advise me, or please pass this letter to appropriate person
and let me know the name of the responsible person.

The problem is

        When users sent files onto F74 by BIONIC or BIONIK, the modified BIONIC
        for KANA file input written by ex-Tymshare, they found that some
        characters (8-12 char string) was replaced as other string.

        For your checking, I located one of the troubled files onto (OGURA:74)
        CHKDAT.NIS. (The original file in user area is (HAL:74)RHAMK2.020.)
        In that file, you can find a string "WW@@ZZ Z" at 15th column of the
        307th record. But the original string for the 8 chars is ";  YVWYS",
        and also we can find the "WW@@ZZ Z" at the 302nd rec in the file.
        So I guess the 8 char string of 307th rec is overwritten by the 8 char
        string of 302nd rec.

        Anyway, our users found that the sent files on F74 were different from
        the original files on their terminals.

        The users tried to send the files through HSA in Japan. And regarding
        the HSA, no Tymcom-370 user, who access to the host through the HSA
        slot, report such kind of problem.

Thanks and regards,
Makoto

P.S. I also find some strange matter on creation date in dir information
     of (OGURA:74)M28250.OTM. Year 1999 was indicated for the creation!!
     I feel there is something wrong in the current F74.

Subject: Patched monitor for F74 

To all concerned with F74's recent problems.  I have created a patch and
applied it to a copy of F74's monitor.  The next time system 74 is reloaded
for any reason, including an emergency scheduled reload (if possible),
please bring system F74 up on (SYS)PATMON.SAV.

The patch implements an INFO STOPCD named BIOBAS which will report on the
CTY when/if the current problem is caused by the base skipping any data
words when writing into the PDP-10s block-io buffers.

Please call the hotline, or contact one of: Carl, Osman or Joe before the
reload occurs.  If any problems with PATMON, please fall back to (SYS)NEWMON
after checking with Rick Daniels or one of us.

Subject: HSA question... 


Osman,
  I expect to be in by noon.  If you get a chance, could you contact Linda
Maurer at x6261 and ask her who is responsible for HSA at the moment, in
NTD and (if she knows) TYMNET.

  Also, does she know if the HSA converts the EBCDIC data records which
come in as <data-record><irg> etc, into...
           <data-record><cr>  etc  or
           <data-record><cr><lf> etc.

I ask, so that we can determine if the 132 characters records from Japan
are being converted by HSA-BBXS into 133 ascii characters or 134 characters.
That will tell us how they are packed in the block-io buffers.

You may also hint that, we may need some of their assistance in tracking
down this problem (assuming that it is not a hardware problem).

Subject: Skiing 

I've been pretty busy trying to keep track of some things lately, and we
have a friend of Cherie's visiting till Thursday... so you can guess why
I haven't gotten back to you sooner.

As for the skiing, I don't really know what the crouds and conditions
are like on Friday & Saturday...  The two times we went last year, we
went on Wednesday & Thursday, then again on Monday-thru-Thursday.  If
it were up to me, I'd try to make it during the week, since we know
what to expect, but if it has to fit into your schedule, Friday and
Saturday should be alright.  I haven't had time to discuss your last
message with Cherie to see what she thinks.

We still hadn't made any final plans other than that week.  (although
we want to finalize it so we can make reservations).  We also don't
know how well either of us is going to hold up, with the skating and
both of us getting over an injury (Cherie, her knee, and me, my foot,
so we expect to be taking it pretty easy).

We could ski, Tuesday-Friday to take advantage of their mid-week ski
package with the super price discount, and you could ski Friday thru
Sunday to give us a day of overlap (and depending on how we're
doing we can decide if we want to continue on Saturday)...  That way
you'll get to be alone (without us?).

I don't know how our budget is holding up or whether we can afford to
stay through the weekend.

Give me a call in the afternoon and we can chat briefly... I'll hope
to have talked with Cherie by then, or we can try a 3-way call.  I also
thought that maybe we could have you stop by on your way home, and I'd
arrange to be home so we can talk about it together (since we're only a
little out of your way to go home), possibly Wednesday.

Rick was concerned about not being able to run more than 1 tape at a time

more tapes were being used at the same time.  The culprit was in stopcode
FTACFC (which was added in /B08) left T2 pushed on the stack when it POPJed.
(M33)FTACFC.PAT changes the reference from CPOPJ to T2POPJ and is being

Subject: BLOCK-IO buffers 

At the moment, BLOCK-IO buffers are gotten right out of freecore along
with everything else that comes out of freecore.  This will make it  very
inconvenient to uncache them, since we would be uncaching whatever else
is interlaced in freecore on the same pages.

A suggestion... in addition to GET4WD, we add a routine which works from
the top of freecore backward (much like the stack and heap on many micros)
looking for space.  This way, only when freecore gets full would we ever
mix cache-able and non-cache-able data structures in freecore.  A second
routine could take a page number determined from the address and re-cache
the page whenever a buffer is released to freecore (only if all bits in
the free-core map say no one else is using that memory page).  Then, always
turn off the cache bit for any pages used for block-io at buffer creation
time.

Block-io buffers are only created when one is needed and no free ones are
available.  Block-io buffers are normally returned to the pool until 2*jobn
buffers exist, then they are returned to freecore as they are released once
more than 2*jobn buffers have been created.  No telling if this limit is
ever crossed in either direction (since not all jobs use block-io and they
would have to get backed up somehow to use more than 2 per job).

(internals: See GETBB and RELBB, page 205 [/N] or /N-fiche #10 D2 & E2).

OOPS, my mistake.. I remembered what I read wrong... it's not 2*JOBN for
the number of buffers in the pool.  It keeps up to 2*<biocnt> which is
the number of ports using block-io.  No distinction is made for input or
output.  So, yes, when no one is doing block-io the buffer pool is empty.

Subject: P035/D Monitor release .. 
----------------------------------

	This is an announcement of official release of "Monitor Version
P035/D".  Included with this mail is a brief document describing the
significant changes and improvements made to the monitor.

	(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all PDP-10 systems now have the P035/D
monitor.  This monitor is already tested.  All of Fremont D.C.
PDP-10's have been running with this monitor since December 1, as P035/C10.

	If you need a copy of the Monitor release notes, they are located 
on all of the PDP10s.  They are named as: (OSP)P035D.DOC and (OSP)STOPCD.MEM

	Any questions or comments please call (408)922-6224 and ask for
Carl Baltrunas, Osman Guven or Joe Smith.  Thank you.
(OSP)P035D.DOC - List of changes from P035/C to P035/D.            3-Feb-88
These are the "release notes" for the P035/D monitor.


New messages for the OPR:
  RIBHRE - Hard read error trying to lookup the RIB of a file.
  RIBERR - Software detected error in the RIB of a file.
  REDSAT - Hard read error trying to read a page of the SAT.
  BADSAT - Software detected error in the count of bits in the SAT.
  BADPAG - Hard read or hard write error detected, page gets marked in the BAT.

New UUOs:
  More entries in GETTAB table .GTCNF - see P035D.MEM for details.
  Set KSYS command and UUO give programs warning when the system is
    scheduled to go down.
  Notice-in-Child and inactivity timer added (for XEXEC and SUBMIT jobs).
  SYSDVF function 6 returns named buffers.  (Makes CTYLOG program faster.)
  KS2020 can have up to 8 tape drives defined.  Don't die if no LP20.
  Output event stopcode PTYSBL when a PTY gets a buffer-zap.
  Fixed the problem of "slot out of ports" by no allowing excessive input.
  Monitor edit number stored in GETTAB(70,11) where programs can look at it.
  GETTAB table 130 has date/time job logged in.

Performance enhancements:
  Files are created with contiguous pages if possible.  This speeds up
  sequential access to files (such as TITO saves) and makes BOOTS much
  faster in loading the monitor.

ONCE dialog:
  TYPE BAD will decode the BAT pages and output a list of bad disk pages.
  The date and time must be entered before refreshing the structure.
  The creation date for SAT.SYS and HOME.SYS is the date when refreshed.
  The command to dissolve the structure is spelled correctly (not DISOLVE).
  The front-end file (FEFILE.SYS) on the 2020 is created correctly now.
  TSTSUP commands have been added to allow for patching absolute pages on
    disks.  This disaster recovery procedure has already been used to
    salvage disk problems that would otherwise require a system rebuild.
  A new startup command - NOINITIA - starts DSKCLN but no other part of the
    autorestart procedure.  This was specifically added for TITO rebuilds.

Miscellaneous:
  The date and time defaults from SAT.SYS, so we should never see the
    phony date of 1-JAN-64 ever again.
  The current date/time is now more accurate on KS-2020 systems.
  Stopcode SAXINY has been removed.
  Device errors on 3650 disks are now logged in BAT pages like data errors.
  The EBUS base can be reloaded without reloading the PDP-10.
  Problems with the host/base interface are reported as INFO stopcodes instead
    of DEBUG stopcodes, so that the system will not crash when they occur.

Changes which affect general users:
  The SEND command uses SENDMAIL to send TUMS mail instead of RPG mail.
  The MAIL command now checks for both RPG mail and TUMS mail.

License and privileges:
  The ENABLE and DISABLE commands can set/clear specific licenses.
  A new license has been defined - HR allows home-files read privileges.
  New UUO to allow operators to get all license when doing TITO restore.
  SET AUTOLOGOUT modified to not allow users to disable inactivity timeout.

Subject: Found bug in DSKCLN. 

Problem: The errors that cause files to be deleted print garbage PPNs on the
	CTY.  In particular: SLF = Rib has bad self pointer, NAM = RIB's
	name does not match UFD, and MUP = RIB page is multiply used.

Diagnosis: The PPN in T3 was getting half overwritten by the error code.

Cure:  T2 has an index into BUF (from 000 to 777), so put the error code
	in the LH of T2.

File 1)	DSK:DSKCLN.107	created: 1626 21-AUG-87

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Robert C. Grandey

Osman,
   Hi. This past Saturday when I was starting to run the weekly
ASP on system D55, I noticed that we were unable to come up in
console mode. When I got to the procedure where the operator types
a ctrl z followed by 'L' to login, I received the following message
on the CTTY 'user invalid on this computer'.
   I tried several variations in the 'reflag'.. command while in
DDT (such as 'reflag! ,1'  'reflag! 1,0'  'reflag! 1,1'  ...etc
but none of them worked (kept receiving the invalid user msg).
( the usual syntax used is 'reflag! ,0' )
   If you could send us the correct PPN to use it would be greatly
appreciated as we usually bring the system up in console mode when
running the ASP backups.
                                       Thanks a lot,
                                        Paul Miller

We forgot the mention in P035D.DOC that "REFLAG" is no longer works.
They don't need reflag to come up in console mode, I will send them
documents showing how could they do it without reflag.

Carl,

I have just returned from 3 weeks off sick and I am getting a long
message about problems on January 27th every time I log in.

The problem appears to be that something went wrong either on system
26 or on the "PERP master" for 26 and my regular job that goes around and
assembles our queued jobs went crazy.

Since these have been running for over 3 months, I am surprised that
such a catastrophic problem occurred.

I have re-entered and monitored the jobs for a couple of hours now
(taking care to ensure that no restart is set in case of interuptions)
and would be grateful if you could have the message removed so that
I can login without waiting for that printout to finish.

The username concerned is MWALTERS on system 26.

Many Thanks
MJW

     It is with both pleasure and regret that I have decided to leave
     McDonnell Douglas, effective February 11, 1988.  I have accepted the
     position of Domestic Training Manager for Seagate Technology, in Scotts
     Valley, California.  

     I am extremely pleased to announce that Kathleen Corcoran, formerly
     Senior Training Specialist in M&PD-San Jose, has been appointed to fill
     my position.  Please join me in congratulating Kathleen on her new
     assignment, which reflects her outstanding accomplishments over the
     last year in a variety of M&PD programs.

     I am also pleased to announce that Becky Spencer has taken the position
     as Department Secretary of M&PD.  Becky was previously an MDC employee
     with Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach.

     Kathleen's former Training Specialist position is currently available.
     Interested candidates should contact Kathleen at (408)922-7651.

     Questions about M&PD programs and services can be directed as follows:

         Kathleen Corcoran (408)922-7651 -- Questions on program content of
         M&PD programs.

         Becky Spencer (408)922-7653 -- Questions on enrollment in M&PD
         programs; borrowing films and tapes; ordering Ethical Decision
         Making supplies.

         LaVonne Hage (408)922-7652 -- Educational Reimbursement questions
         and forms.

     The following is a listing of M&PD-San Jose programs scheduled for the
     next two months and their status.  (The 2Q88 M&PD-San Jose schedule
     will be published in early March.)  Employees wishing to enroll in any
     of the following programs should see their senior section manager for
     an enrollment form.  If additional enrollment forms are needed, contact
     Becky Spencer.

Dispatch said caller had right number and right department and had an emergency
on system X0DDD74.  The memo is working!

The Japanese users are quite upset that they were getting A016 errors trying
to run MAGNUM ever since F74 came back up.  Bonnie said that the accounting
files from yesterday were missing, and day shift had remedied the problem.
I recommended she get a hold of the people in charge of royalty accounting;
it appears the database is not correct and is rejecting access from the
nodes the Japanese users are on.  There is nothing I can do.     /Joe

Dear Mr.Baltrunas,  
this is the first time for me to sent you a mail. First I'd like to   
introduce myself, my name is Kazuo Watanabe, Application System  
Dept. in NIS. I have some customers on host F74.  
     
By the way, the F74's problem was returned to our customers. They have
sent  files on to F74, and the sent files had a problem. About the timing  
of the problem, following 5 cases are reported.

Please investigate again, and let me know result. I will try to test, 
if necessary.  
     
Best regards.

The reason why they never had to enter ^Z L O P E R <cr> when they came
up console was that they set reflag non-zero.  That meant ignore the
normal LOGIN procedure and just log them in.  Without reflag, they needed
to enter a login name so that LOGINN would do the right things for them.

Re:  Your jobs on system 26

As you saw, your "PERP" jobs using the SUBMIT program went out of control
in your abcense.  This caused the SUBMIT program and the entire "PERP"
system on F26 to process an inordinate amount jobs which stepped on each
other and caused each other to bomb (all yours) and took about 20% of the
CPU resources.

I looked at the files being used by your jobs to analyse what they were
doing to take up so much CPU time.  In the process, it appears evident that
you are NOT using the SUBMIT/EXEC system properly.  There is no need to use
SUBMIT to run PCOM jobs.  This in fact is wasteful.  SUBMIT jobs are fully
upward compatible from PCOM jobs, as SUBMIT was designed to replace PCOM
and PERP.

I will be happy to work with you to setup a smooth job processing system
for your actual needs.  I shall be back from vacation on Monday 22-Feb-88.
Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss your needs and allow me
to demonstrate the most optimal way to fulfill those needs on TYMCOM-X.

Thank you.

Subject: Potential /E enhancement 

Investigate connecting RM05s (we have at least one DCL and 4 drives, and
we were supposed to swap Dallas a drive for a DCL) to the 2020s.  If they
are more reliable than some of the hardware we have (they are newer) they
may be another solution to the RP06 problems we continue to have.

Talk about procedural problems....

System D55: Contact Louie, 214-637-7435

Problem:  Their customer RAILTRACK, calles them complaining that their
          SUBMIT jobs are not running.  They've entered them a few times
          and they are not doing anything.

Research: (SUBMIT)*.JQL shows that nothing has run since 21-Feb-88.  The
          isn't any problem with (SYS)XEXEC or (SYS)EXECX.

          CTYLOG shows that the system has been up since Sunday 20:05 in
          "MANUAL" mode, no DSKCLN has been run, system was unshut after
          running ASP.   (An aside: we need to have ASP write to the CTY
          so that we can detect this condition.)

Solution: I masked as PERPOPER and started XEXEC.  I also impressed on the
          operator and shift supervisor the gravity of what "could" be a
          major file-system integrity problem due to the failure to reload
          and run DSKCLN.  I advised them to reload and do a FULL DSKCLN.

As we left it, Marconi was due in at any moment and he would authorize them
to do whatever they feel is necessary as far as scheduling down-time to try
to correct the problem.   I'll follow-up and contact Marconi later today.

    Attn:   Landa Morris
	    RPM group members

    From:   Carl A Baltrunas

    Subj:   PDP-10 developments for performance monitoring


    Landa,

      I have gone through our recent release notes for the P035/D monitor
    and identified all of the work accomplished to provide better tools and
    information for monitoring the resources available on PDP-10 systems
    running TYMCOM-X.

    1)  Access to previously unavailable internal monitor tables.
	Provide information requested by TYMNET and for RPM so that newer
	tools may access the information for any user.  (Resource Monitoring)
	A)  Frame CPU time.
	B)  Frame login date-time.
	C)  Second internal status word (6 bits defined).

    2)  Aux circuit trace info.
	Provides a table indexed by port number with the login string passed
	to the network for all aux circuits.  (Resource Monitoring)

    3)  Fixed erroneous info reported for disk drives units DSKB1 and DSKB2.

    4)  Internal system console log.
	Provides a log of all output that appears on the system console in
	a form readable by utility programs.  (Operations Support)


      In addition, the SYSTAT program was updated to report the proper data
    for 3650 and 3652 disk units specifically, and to handle units formatted
    in blocks (old style) or pages (some selected systems).


      The above changes will allow our group to provide a new version of the
    ICP program (possibly a new program) to aid RPM with the monitoring of
    the PDP-10s run by MD-IPC.  However, we have not actually agreed on which
    features should be provided by the new ICP version.  That is the purpose
    of today's meeting.

      I have a display program which utilizes much of the above information
    just as ICP does and presents an ongoing snapshot of the system on the
    screen (similar to SRACRT).  This is my test program for all of the new
    resource monitoring info.  I will be happy to give a brief demonstration
    during or after the meeting.  Any display that you can run PEAK on will
    work for my program.

      As I mentioned to you on the phone, it may be in the best interest of
    both IPC and FSC to provide a new version of ICP which includes the new
    features we decide on today and ONLY that information utilized by RPM.
    Again, we should decide on this in today's meeting.

Landa,

  I should be on time for today's meeting...  However, my wife has an
appointment at Kaiser in Santa Clara at 8:30am and I have to provide
transportation since she is unable to drive for a few days after her
knee surgery today.

  We expect the appointment to be over soon enough fr me to drive home
and then to the data center by 10.  However, I may be a few moments late.
Please let everyone know, if I am later than I expect.

  Thanks.

Subject: Mail questions 

Carl:

The problem with your reply involves the way interontyme is set up between
machines.  Only some accounts can communicate with each other across
systems.  Obviously (although I did not look this up), TXS can and the
other account cannot.

Now I have a question for you.  I read the mail fine using "mail" on
35, but when I went back to reread it I could not find it.  I tried
"r tums" which first told me I had 8 messages, but when I tried to read
or list them it said I had none.  I have a tums.tix which has the
message headers in it, updated with your latest message.  What goes?
I was afraid to use tums to send a message to you when it had
"lost" my messages.  Is there another program I should be using?

You will probably need to log into ontyme (poor Carl) to send your
reply unless you can instruct tums as to which system (account) to
send your reply from.

Questions?  Call me at x6197

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

     CARL, HERE IS AN OUT-LINE OF THE PDP-10 TOOLS RPM FINDS NECESSARY TO
IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE MONITORING.  FOR NOW, IF POSSIBLE, WE CAN RECEIVE
THIS DATA TRHOUGH THE ICP REPORTS BUT LATER ON WE WANT THE DATA DISPLAYED
ON THE CRT'S AND HISTORY OUTPUT TO A FILE.

     NEW SPECS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

          *  CPU BUSY THRESHOLDS

          *  CPU CAPACITY  (when the system is out of room/saturated)

          *  MEMORY - when capacity is exceeded/what's normal/what's not

          *  DISK QUEUES  -  number of blocks per sec. (disk i/o)


     REGARDING THE CURRENT ICP REPORTS, WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ICP
MEASUREMENT THRESHOLDS:  WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY RELATE, WHAT KIND OF
TOOLS THEY ARE.  THE DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE CLARIFIED.

     AGAIN, THE CURRENT ICP FILE IS SUFFICIENT FOR NOW, BUT LATER THE DATA 
OUTPUT TO A SCREEN.  THE FORMAT IS NOT IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME.  THESE NEW
TOOLS ARE NEEDED NO LATER THAN END OF APRIL.


THANK YOU,

B39 had some base type problems today, it seems slot one was
"restarting".  Somehow the memory buffers had been corrupted
and needed to be cleared.  When you see slot 0 running ok and can't 
log in try pushing the "INI" button or the "bubble switch" on the
left corner of the CPU board.  This refreshes all memory and restarts the
node from ADDR 70 just the same as a reload.

Any questions just call me........Kal

Well Ops, it did it again today.  B39's base 2674 slot 1 went bad.  I
don't know what is causing this problem because there have been no changes
to the base code.  Have there been changes to the system monitor?
Since I was logged into the dispatcher of the base I was able to "HALT", 
"INIT" and "EXECUTE" the 'bad guy' from here.  If this problem
continues I will look into it further.

Subject: VT100 terminal status. 

Before 4-Mar-88:
  VT101 at VAX Lab - good video board, but logic board goes bonkers after
    it has been on for a few minutes, many beeps and goes into SETUP.
  VT100 in KL Lab - good video board, logic board stuck with white background.
  VT100 in Nicholson - video board dead, logic board good, no AVO.

After 4-Mar-88:
  VT101 in VAX Lab - has bad video board and bad logic board.
  VT100 in KL Lab - has good video board and good logic board.
  VT100 in Nicholson - has good video board and so-so logic board.

(The video board can be easily repaired.  One diode runs hot enough to scortch
the board and evaporate the electrolyte from the adjacent capacitor.  When
the capacitor dries out, it blows the fusable link.  Replace link and capacitor,
and board works again.  The previous info came from a DECUS session.)  /Joe

Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size".  It did not say whether there were too
          many or too few units in the new structure.
Solution: Told them to verify that the new DSKB had exactly the same number of
          units as when the ASP was done.  The highest unit can be found at the
          end of the hardcopy from when ASP was run.

11-Mar-88 00:23/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, David Jorgenson, (415)498-2588, System 32.
Problem:  When bringing up the system READONLY to run ASP as part of operator
          training, it died with a NONAME stopcode in SCHED1.
Diagnosis: LOGINN was trying to update the LUD to turn off the 6 letter bits
          to indicated that OPER had seen the "system is going down" message.
          During READONLY, updating ENTERs are allowed.  However, when the
          program issues an OUT uuo or VALPAG chanio, the system crashes.
Solution: Told them to come up MANUAL this time to do the ASP.  Later analysis
          showed that they could have come up MANUAL, run TAKEIT to HANG the
          system, and then come up READONLY.
Note:     Looking at the monitor source code implies that this bug existed
          prior to P034/N.  One way around it is to come up using "NOINITIA"
          and "FULL", then login as OPER (which clears the bits in the LUD)
          to run TAKEIT and "HANG" the system.  That leaves the files is the
          proper state to bring up "CONSOLE" and "READONLY" so the OPER can
          login and run ASP.  This will be fixed in next release of the monitor.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System 30.
Problem:  One user had 30 jobs logged in, all detached, all running MAGNUM
          programs.  The jobs would not go away immediately - LOGOUT and TAKEIT
          only evicted them.  System was heavily loaded and very slow.
Solution: None.  By the time I logged in, all these jobs had logged out.
          MAGNUM enables notice-to-quit (NTQ) so that it can clean up after
          itself and leave the database in a consistent state.  Until the clean
          up is done, the job can be evicted but not killed.

To get TXS added to interontyme for the account you want to communicate with

go through channels.  Catherine Derby is the actual human who will do the

It looks like TYMNET had to turn off their circuit-breaker panel.
All the engines were down around noon today, but the 2020's kept running.
Nodes 5416 and 5561 were down so we couldn't get to 17 or 14 via TYMNET,
and we couldn't get thru via the micronet because node NICK and its modem
were plugged into TYMNET power.  I located a 30-amp extension cord, now
node NICK, node FOON, the sync modem, and both async modems are now
plugged into our conditioned power.  We need another 10-foot 30-amp
extension cord so that all the terminal by the Foonlys can be plugged into
our conditioned power.  		/Joe

When I tried to log into JMS:14, the Supervisor told me the host was down

in effect.

The following hosts are transparent: 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,20.
The following hosts are normal: 3,7,10,15,17,18,19,21.

Someone needs to tell the Supervisors that hosts 14 and 16 are normal hosts,
not transparent.   /Joe

It is the intent of MDNSC to get off of DEC-10 systems and convert our
existing applications, as necessary, to appropriate alternate
environment within the next 12 months.  This decision is based on the
recommendations made by an internal task force on hardware planning.
This migration will eliminate excessive IPC charges and also get us off
an archaic and inflexible computing environment that we have been using
for nearly 15 years.  While purchase of departmental processors might be
appropriate for applications specific to your groups only, common
hardware/software strategy may be required for applications such as code
management, validations, documentation, accounting, etc.

Please collect the information on your current DEC-10 based applications
in the format suggested by April 1 and return it to your representative
of the Hardware Planning Task Force.  The members of the task force are:

Raja Rajaraman - Operations 
Ken Holcomb - NTD 
Gary Walker - Marketing and Sales 
Sateesh Lele/Fred Canning - Finance (HR, Legal, Business Planning, if 
necessary)

Your cooperation in this matter is extremely critical in order to put
together an intelligent and consistent hardware/software strategy.

Thank you for your compliance.

Subject: AR/ARX failures show up as "IME" on current monitor. 

The "IME" stopcodes on system 33 were a result of an AR/ARX parity error
being detected.  I suspect a bad cache board.

.CPUP1+0 = saved contents of UPT+500 = page fail word
.CPUP1+1 = saved contents of UPT+501 = PC at time of page fault
.CP7+0   = saved contents of AC 0 of block 7 (contents of AR)
.CP7+1   = saved contents of AC 1 of block 7 (contents of ARX)
Page fail type 36 is AR parity error (data word from cache or E bus)
Page fail type 37 is ARX parity error (instruction PC points to from cache)

Crash  Date   Time  Type  UPT+500 UPT+501    Good data      Bad data    Where

CRA006 was a parity error detected at the S-bus, the sector lights should have
been on for this particular crash.

On all the other crashes, the bad data came from cache and the good data was
read after doing a cache sweep.  The difference in each case is 020000,,000000.

Patch #3 (IMEPAR.PAT) has been applied to NEWMON on all systems in the
data center.  It causes all AR/ARX detected faults to output the standard
"PARITY ERROR" message and then stop with an APRFAT stopcode.

I will look into the possibility of continuing after an AR/ARX error.  /JMS

Subject: Patch #4 for P035/D stops on AR/ARX errors. 

Patch #4 has been applied to NEWMON in the Fremont Data Center.
This patch causes the system to stop with CPU stopcode AR.ARX whenever
an AR or ARX parity error occurs.  The previous patch invoked the old
parity error scanning routines when AR/ARX problems were detected, but
that caused misleading information to be typed out.  It produced a
"USER PARITY ERROR" messaged, scanned memory, couldn't find any errors
in memory, output "SPURIOUS PARITY ERROR", and then marked all pages of
the user's core image as being bad.  This in turn triggered many BADPAG
messages.

With patch #4, AR/ARX problems will cause an immediate stopcode.
The way to recoginize an AR/ARX problem is by looking at the "UPT+500"
word printed as part of the "CPU STATUS".  If the first 2 digits are "36",
it is an AR error, AC 7:0 has the bad data.  If the first 2 digits are "37",
is is an ARX error, AC 7:1 has the bad data.

Hi...
  The access message you saw was a response to Warren Prince's memo to all
of MDNSC that they should identify their PDP-10 applications so that they
can meet their goal to be off the PDP-10s by the end of 1989.  I will be a
little suprised if they make it.  We shall see.

  The expunge message is normally what you see when you delete a mail message
and then issue the EXPUNGE or EXIT commands.  (EXIT does an implied EXPUNGE of
any deleted messages).  The "% phase error; EOT found in message" text is a
warning message that TUMS is confused by (what it thinks is an extra ^D inside
the text of the message) so it complains.  You may ignore it.  It is a bug in
TUMS.  Send mail to WRS if it annoys you... he knows about it, but I don't know
if it will ever get fixed.

  Thanks about the infor for otforms.interot/req ... I haven't done anything
yet, but plan to one of these days.

*** I'm too busy... and until I get another message saying I cannot send mail
*** it seems I can ignore it.   (Maybe the need will go away?)

Subject: What went wrong on F22, F33, F58. 

Patch #3 from the original IMEPAR.PAT had a bug.  It picked up the page-fail
code from UPT+501 instead of UPT+500.  This means that when a page fault
occured, if the PC flags had CARRY0 + CARRY1 + FLOAT_OVERFLOW + FIRST_PART_DONE 
+ USER all set, then the patch would say it was an ARX error, and jump to
the parity error routine.  APRER1 saw the USER flag set and tried to locate
the word with the bad parity error by scanning all of the user's core.  Since
it couldn't find any parity error in memory (the problem was in the cache,
not in core), the routine had no alternative but to wipe out all of that
user's core.  It marked all his pages as having read errors.  The routine
that frees up user core saw the read error bit set, so it added all of
those pages to the BAT page.

The final fix did not get installed into P035/D-4 until about 6pm, Tuesday
March 29.  The AR.ARX dumps on F22 and F58 prior to that time are bogus.

All Fremont systems are now up to date.  The way to check the crash dumps,
NEWMON, and/or the running system is to look at location PATCH+26 and
verify that the RH is UP%500, not UP%500+1.   /Joe

Subject: MAILER and ONTMTP 

Bill,
   Someone in FSCO just received an itemized bill for a few months ago and
found 1500 logins/month on each of our FSC.x/xxxxx ONTYME names.  He said it
amounts to about $5K just for logging in, since the volume of messages for
our names was negligible.

   I checked the queue and found MAILER running every 20 minutes on system 29.
TThe log showed ONTMTP running about 2 times an hour... this adds up to about
1500 logins per user per month.  I realize that polling is the only way we
can have ONTMTP check for mail, but the frequency shown is a little much if
you don't get much mail via ONTYME.

   I changed the schedule for MAILER to run every 2 hours.  We can change it
whatever is needed, but for now, I thought 2 hours would be OK.  What I am
really interested in at this point is what are the alternatives?

   o  Can we add a field to ONTYME.DAT to indicate the frequency to check for
      ONTYME mail on a name by name basis?  This way it would only login to
      an account when asked...  I easily see wanting TXS.* to check every 2-4
      hours, and FSC.* (for me anyway) every 24 hours or even once a week.

    If there wasn't so much goings on about paying for this stuff it would be
fine the way it is.  We are even getting charged for cpu and disk storage for
the MAIL username (not to mention TYMNET traffic, for all the inter-host mail).


    Let me know what you think about the ONTYME.DAT frequency parameter, and
if we can live with MAILER running every 2 (or longer) hours.  I understand
that MAILER also kicks the other servers for MCAUTO into action (that's why
I set it at 2 hours instead of 4).

Subject: Subtle solution 

After talking with Bill Soley today... we hit upon a solution that lets
MAILER run every 20 minutes (on system 29) and doesn't kick-start polling
our ONTYME mail each time.

  Remove our names from (MAIL:29)ONTYME.DAT
  ...actually modify them to allow sending, but not to poll.

This removes the 1500 logins per month.  To still receive mail, I've
setup a batch job to run once a day at 14:00 to pull our ontyme mail
to FSC.* and TXS.* on system 35.  To do this we run ONTMTP on system
35 once a day, and MAILER knows nothing of this.  ROUTER.DAT is unchanged.

The first pickup will be at 14:00 on Thursday.  The last pickup was at
16:20 on Wednesday.  If once a day is too infrequent, please let me know.
Osman and I agreed that once a day is enough for us.

/Carl

PS.  TXS.C/FLETCHER will still forward to FSC.C/FLETCHER (once a day)
     and FSC.C/FLETCHER will still NOT be polled at all, so whatever
     arrangements you (Craig) have with Karen will continue.

Hello Bruce,
  I was working on a new display systat program and noticed that you were
running SAIL, so I took a quick nosey look (since I was surprised to see you
using SAIL) to see what you were doing.

  Did you know that there is a program on (SYS) called LOGON that reads 99%
of the things that you're doing with your init program from a parameter file
and does a few other things?

  (Not at the moment, but later) If you're interested, I can send you some
documentation and a how-to parameter file.  It's much nicer than what your
INIT file is doing.  [I've seen that INIT file before... Bill Soley wrote it
initially, 8 (or more) years ago].

Both 2020's, both bases, and both ADM3s lost power sometime this afternoon.
X17 was up but its base hadn't been reloaded.  X14 was down.  Attempting to
power it up produced a big blue spark as the circuit breaker tripped.  Then
I saw Chuck's note in the log saying that a new power supply for X14 is
expected tomorrow.  X17 keeps dying with PAR ERR - its power supply may
need adjusting too.  It stayed up long enough to load 6657 but not 6760.

Subject: SENDMAIL 

Since SENDMAIL replaced the RPG SEND command, I've been getting alot of
mail appearently due to people saying "SEND MAIL" in stead of "SENDMAIL".
I just released a new version of SENDMAIL which (0.2) checks for the first
name being MAIL and prints a little message explaining the correct syntax.
The new version also fixes a bug in the @filename feature and includes a
simple help message in response to "SEND HELP" and "SEND ?".  I have just
copied it to (MAIL:29) and RDIST should take it from there.  It is pretty
well tested.  It also checks for message length and refuses > 100000 like
most of the other TUMS programs.  -Bill

Hi Carl -

Sure do remember.  Happy to see that there are a few other die hards around.
I am aware of your program, and it does seem better.  I have used it in the
past.  I assume you are refering to the one that uses "SWITCH.INI".  I keep
meaning to use SAIL more.  Would if I where more involed with the PDP-10s
these days.  I hae been writing proposals, running cables uder floors, 
playing sailsman, supporting ANZ bank here in Australia, and writing
accounting software in C (among other things).  I don't mind the snooping
but most of what I do is probably pretty boring.  By the way, I have a nice
editor for the PC.  It is a distant relative of EMACS/JOVE, but has quite a few
enhanced features.  If you are interested I will get a copy to you.  Hope
that you are doing well.  Anyway, I have to get back to work...

o  Chuck is working on X17 to see if he can find anything why the system
   would not stay up.

o  X14 is back up with the same P/S.  Spare P/S would not work at all.
   So, Chuck put back the old one and made it work some how.  Base 
   needs to be reloaded.

Subject: suggestion for a PDP-10 utility. 

Carl,

  HI!  I'm writing this using 'vi' on one of the Suns.  I'm learning vi.

  My idea is this:  a little program which does what CLS does under MS-DOS.
This program would read the terminal type info (as do PEAK and SY), and then
send the appropriate escape sequence to clear the screen.  The Suns have just
such a utility, and I like it.  I don't recommend using the Sun name for it
('clear'), however, since (SYS)CLEAR is the program used by operators to 
"clear" their sys mail and OPER jobs.  I like 'CLS' for a name.

  I like and use the SUN's 'clear' utility a lot.  I have created the alias
'cls' to run it.  I have (and probably got from you or Joe) a little program 
for the 10's which sends the escape sequence to clear the Rainbow's screen.  
I have it in my directories as CLS.  I use it a lot, when I'm on the Rainbow.  
On the 444's I use the 'function' keys to clear the screen and display memory.
I believe a 3-char 'command' would be easier to remember and to type than:
(1.) left-up arrow; (2.) shifted roll/down-arrow.  (I'm a touch typist.)

Subject: Monitor too big 

I built a monitor in OSP:33 for B39 and X32 and attempted to reload X32
with the new code.  Mike Silva said that it tried to come up but printed
some message about virgin monitor too big... (I don't know the exact msg).

The only differences were to add a 1000(8) word buffer and code which
calls 2 new tiny routines to put things into this buffer.  I find it hard to
believe that 1 page+ a little overflowed the monitor size.  Did I have
the maximum configuration of something?  It was the same size (pages=171)
on disk as the current production monitor for 32...?

Joe,
  I looked at the .PAT files and it appears that DMON.PAT has -1-2-3 and
that IMEPAT.PAT has -3-4.  It wasn't clear to me that these had been
cleaned up and as I'm not particularly thinking straight, I didn't want
to commit to installing the patches.  (M33:39)DMON.PAT is also diferent
than (M33:32/33)DMON.PAT, so I suspect that IMEPAR.PAT may also suffer
from the same problem.

  Please apply the patches from the correct DMON.PAT and IMEPAR.PAT and
change TTYZNE to S$DEBUG and send us mail.

  (M33:39)NEWMON.SAV is a copy of (M33:39)39N35D.SAV, ready to be patched.
  (M33:39)DMON.P32 is (M33:32)DMON.PAT copied for comparison
  (M33:39)DMON.P33 is (M33:33)DMON.PAT copied for comparison

Subject: Suggestive steps for B39 .... 

To isolate and/or fix the problem B39 is having, these are
suggestive steps to take.

o  Most of the system crashes in last 2 weeks always started
   with TTYZNE event stopcode, follewed by some number of BASE
   event stopcodes and than crashed with some kind of STOP 
   stopcode.  To find out more information about the crashes, 
   made the TTYZNE a STOP stopcode and monitor should goto
   BOOTS when it detects it.  A crash dump should be taken to 
   be  analized.

o  B39's Base code should be tested running with the same
   base code as the rest of the systems, which is:
   Node code version 5.10
   ISIS code version 7.01
   to see if B39 will run as well as the other PDP10s.

o  Put diagnostic patch in monitor to save I/O ring messages 
   between the Base and the PDP10 to find out the message sequences 
   just prior to crash.

o  Run one of the Fremont D. C. hosts with the same base code
   version as B39:
   Node code version: 5.22
   ISIS code version: 7.03
   to see if it will experience the same problem as B39 is having.

  I say we are "in luck"... it appears that SY is not crashing the system
by peeking or spying with SYSDVF.  In fact, what appears to be happening
is SY does a FRMOP 1,addr trying to read the node-port of a frame and then
we see FILAMO or FILAUU ...  (FILAUU says ATB: Private pages for frame 985)
I forsee this as significant information but I don't know what Joe is trying
to print when we see this message.

  My guess is that there's a problem with dummy ATBs and keeping count if
sone number of users are trying to get/release something for a specific frame.

Subject: Strange zaps on MUX thru gateway. 

Around 11:20am today, my circuit to B39 got zapped.  I had logged in from
the MUX on host 2096 to username BUBB to JMS:39.  When I trie to login again,
the gateway said that host 39 was down.  However, when I tried 5 minutes later,
I got thru and the system had been up for 20 hours.  There were not a bunch
of detached jobs; the base had not crashed and the host had not crashed.
Osman had the same experience - for a short period of time he could not log
into 39 from the gateway, but people in Bubbnet had no problems.

Around 5:30pm, I was again zapped from the mux and could not get back for a
while.  When I did get thru, my previous job was still logged in and had a
port (it was not detached).  
SYSTAT said "4067(n1B3)" for both jobs, which is public net host 5981.
It looks like the portion of my circuit between the mux and the gateway got
zapped, but the portion between the gateway and system 39 was not.

Has anyone else reported similar problems?  Who should be notified?

Subject: (SYS:39)CRA015 is a TTYZNE crash. 

Login request (message type 6) received on port 172.
LDBLOG is 200000,,0 which means not logged in, zap in progress.
L2LOWT is set meaning SCNSER is waiting for orange ball to come back before
releasing the zapper.  L2LOWS is set meaning that L2LOWT has been on for 10
seconds (zapper will be unleashed if no orange ball within another 10 seconds).

This one might be SCNSER's fault.  I find it strange that the rest of LDBLOG is
all zero.  If the base thinks that particular port is not in use, it probably
will ignore the yellow ball instead of reflecting an orange ball.  Since the
base thinks the port is not in use, it is quite reasonable to send a login
request on that line.  The 68000 gets upset when we zap its login request.
I haven't checked to see what SCNSER does with the rest of the login request
(4 bytes of node id, 12 chars user name).  If it sends zaps for every one
of those bytes, I wouldn't blame the base for getting upset.  The 20 second
delay between yellow ball and zapper send by SCNSER is consistent with the
CTYLOG on CRA003.
  16:19:29 Something makes SCNSER think it should send a zapper on port 71.
           It sends a yellow ball first, starts the 20 second timer.
  16:19:32 Base wants to use port 71 for an aux circuit.  TTYZNE stopcode.
  16:19:49 Orange ball timer expires, SCNSER sends zapper.
  16:19:49 INFO stopcode BASE, Key=354.
  16:19:57 Stopcode IME (probably due to loop in TTYBMT output).

We should modify SCNSER to allow incoming logins to quietly cancel pending
zappers.  As long as the sign bit in LDBLOG is off, it make more sense to
take the base's word for it that the port is available to be re-used.  /Joe

Any FRMOP that accesses another job has to map the other job's context pages
into %UPX.  This access increments the use count stored in the other job's
dummy ATB (since context pages and private pages use the same ATB).

Subject: Loop found in ISIS to 68K initialization. 

Paul Krumviede found a bug in ISIS where it sends the wrong command to the IPI
(68000 board) whenever slot 1 crashes.
1) Something goes wrong, ISIS crashes slot 1.  IPI sends KEY=354 to host.
2) Because CRASTOP is not set, ISIS does not stop on the crash, and instead
   tries to restart the slot.
3) Slot 1 executes SVC SYS,CONIP to connect to the IPI.
4) The kernel checks to see if the requesting slot was started as a result of
   a startup command or a crash restart condition.
5) Seeing that it is not an 'E' command from DDT, the kernel tells the IPI
   to reload itself.
6) The IPI sees the message to reload, doesn't recognize it, sends 354 to the
   PDP-10 and sends "I give up" to the Kernel, which crashes slot 1 again.
7) Go back to step 2, repeat every 4 seconds.

The original problem that caused step 1 is still unknown.  Any data about it
has been wiped out.  Dave Smith agrees this is a bug in the ISIS kernel.
Paul is trying a hack to the IPI code so it responds to message to reload
itself.

Subject: B39-P035/D-6 in NEWMON. 

Patch #6 (TTYZAP.PAT) has been tested on X32 and applied to (M33:39)39N35D.
It is in NEWMON as B39-P035/D-6 and is ready to be loaded.
Patch #6 tests if TTYZAP has been asked to send a zapper to a not-logged-in 
port.  If so, it outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 with the job # and program
name, then goes ahead and sends the zapper without a yellow ball.  This way
we can determine if a program running on B39 is causing the problem.

To refresh your memory: B39-P035/D-6 and X32-P035/D-6 both include the SCNSER
log of IRING/ORING traffic and treat TTYZNE as a DEBUG stopcode (which goes
to BOOTS on B39).

Paul will build new node code for BB2674 that will halt the Engine when the
slot crashes so that a dump of the Dispatcher rings can be made on hardcopy.
Operations should force 39 to take a dump when the Engine halts so that
SCNSER's rings and slot 1's rings can be compared.

Subject: Annoyance: Zappers send when INITIA detaches. 

TTYZAP.PAT outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 whenever SCNSER tries to send a
zapper to a port that is not logged in.  The idea is to catch programs
doing that.  Well, the patch has already caught one program, but not the
right one.

Whenever a program issues the ATTACH uuo with an argument of -1, the frame
is detached from its line.  If it is already detached, not thing happens.
If there is an LDB, SCNSER sends a zapper to that port.  The lines that
run INITIA at startup are a bit strange.  These TTYs have LDBs but to not
have TYMNET ports.  At system startup, 6 TTYZP1 stopcodes are output when
INITIA detaches from TTY0 thru TTY5.

We may have to live with this unwanted typeout until the real guilty
program makes its presence known.  It is my feeling that some program
which runs on B39 only is causing SCNSER to send bad data to the base and
the Dispatcher crashes the slot when it gets the bad data.  The bad data
is probably a legitimate message that is not allowed under certain conditions
(such as while the port is in the middle of logging in).

Actually, I presume this means it will simply not work in it's present state
and that Joe (?) is in the middle of doing something to it.  However, this is
not good... there should at least be a .MAC which was the last "good" .MAC

SCNSER.MAC exists on X32 and was in the process of being TELECOpied to F33
when X32 was taken down (for F30 swap).  Renaming SCNSER.D05 to SCNSER.MAC
would have worked, however the correct version has been copied over now.

The following is a list of FSC Internal Ids valid on F-40, which is   
scheduled to shutdown on June 30, 1988. 
     
Many of the ids are only valid on F-40. If they are needed on an 
IBM host, please let me know by May 20th, so that I can validate 
their id's on D-43. On June 3rd, I will then move files for them.
If there are id's that are not needed, please let me know by May 
20th, too. I will remove them from F-40 on that date, or as I    
receive them.  
     
Ids that are valid on other IBM hosts, are responsible for moving
their files to the alternate host by the closing of June 30th.   
If more storage is required to accomodate F-40 files, please call me  
for more resources. 
     
Our IBM hosts (D43) already running successfully on CP Version 4.2    
and (D47) expected to run on CP Version 4.2 beginning on May 7th,
is different from F40, which is running on CP Version 3.2. If you
want to test your application against 4.2, please let me know right   
away. I will setup your id for the test on D43 (if you are not already
there).

As of monday morning, May 9, 1988 there will be a job logged into (SRA) on
all PDP-10s running the program (SRA)SYSDAT.SAV.  THis job will write a log
file with the name <YY><MM><DD>.MON in directory (SRA) on each system.

This data includes all the system-wide information available at this time
for performance monitoring.  The system is identified in each record which
also contains CPU microcycles, frame, port and memory usage, disk capacity
and free space, user, monitor and swapping/paging i/o rates, base characters
read and written and block-i/o usage.

Please DO NOT log this job out.  It should be running whenever the system is
up for normal timesharing in order to monitor system performance.  At present
a snapshot is taken every 15 minutes and recorded.  (If the sample rate needs
to be adjusted, please let me know and I will change the program.)

MCAUTO.Q has been taken care of.  I created a TECO-macro called SPLIT.TEC.
Using "MUNG SPLIT,MCAUTO.Q" produced MAILQ.100 thru MAILQ.348 - where each
message was stored in a seperate file.  I then used FINDIT to get a list
of the file names with their checksums.  Using the list sorted by checksums
I deleted all names from the list that had a duplicate checksum.  (For the
most part, only the messages from Office-8 showed up.)  The resultant CMD
file was given to "COPY @MAILQ.CMD" to append all the good messages together.
(Did you know the limit to "COPY 1+2+3+...+63,SUM" has a limit of 64 files?)
The end result was a new MCAUTO.Q that was 109 pages long, which was
processed with no further problems.  MAILQ.### and the old 1511 page MCAUTO.Q
have been deleted.

We have had similar problems twice before.  SMTP needs a command that will
refuse all mail from a particular host, giving it an error code that the
SMTP interface is temporarily out of service.

Joe - sorry the Tumsgate seems stressed.  My view is that I am not getting 
useable feedback from something.  Either Augment, or Tumsgate. I certainly 
never get any feedback from Profs.  The messages are representative of the 
reports we are distributing electronically and it is valuable to see if they 
make it completely in a useable form.

Is this the new Sun based Tumsgate?  If so, does that mean you are checking 
things out also?  We would treat it more delicately if we thought you were also
testing new stuff.  Too many variables at one time.

Thanks for your response to us.      Dave Carter
------------------------------------------------------------------

The TUMS gateway is system F29, a PDP-10 approximately 100 feet south of
Office-1 in Solar way.  Since Bill Soley has gone to the Turbo-Engine project,
the TUMS mail system is under the TYMCOM-X Support Group.  The TUMS gateway
has not changed for over 2 years.

I got involved when I notice that username MAIL was chewing up an inordinate
amount of CPU time.  There appeared to be two problems.
  1) The message was truncated, in that TUMS did not get the End-Of-Message
     indicator.  The log shows "time out waiting for command".  This is
     most likely a bug in the SMTP program on Office-8 because logged in
     another circuit and resent the entire message immediately.
  2) The message had no blank lines, and the body got smushed up into
     the header.
Problem #1 created a message queue that was 1511 disk pages long.  It
contained about 100 copies of 3 slightly different messages.  The only
difference was the subject: "Testing TUMS format with quick body" or something
to that effect.  When I sent the "please use smaller messages for testing"
message, I was under the assumption that TDC and/or YOUNG was repeatedly
sending messages manualy.  If Office-8 hadn't timed out or did not try to
resend the messages, there wouldn't have been a problem.

As a side note: I did see two copies of the message that did go out OK.
I believe it was 9 pages long and had lots of blank lines.  Sorry, I did not
take notice of the sender or recipient.

Subject: crufty string garbage-collect fix 

Bill,

  As per the ill-mem-ref we see from time to time in SAIL string garbage-
collect... I found that in my new SETOP it dies after calling the routine
%ARRSRT inside the GC cycle.  This is where it is supposed to be tracing
down STRING-ARRAYs to see what is in use etc. (I guess?)

anyway, the code assumes that register F is setup and at %ARRSRT the setup
code is commented out in the sources and later on it loops back to get the
next item using  "HLRZ 6,1(12)" at label %ARRS1 which happens to also be
%ARRSRT due to the commented out instruction.

I tried a DDT patch to setup F (F=12) then fall into the right code, but
the error still occurs.

I finally put "POPJ P," in %ARRSRT and the symptom of dying with an ill-mem-
ref went away.  To this end, I have a little subroutine called FIXSGC on
my directory which does:

              PUSH P, .+2
	      POP  P, %ARRSRT
              POPJ P,

It doesn't really fix the GC problem but I thought that you might like to
try this in your code which dies in the string GC to see if it will stop
the >explosions<.

Subject: UPDUFD.PAT created to try to solve UFDER1 crashes on F29. 

It looks like the MAIL programs were trying to set the "dumped" bit on a
file that was marked for deletion.  The code in FILUUO:CLOSIN at CLOSRN
says to jump to CLSIN2 only if no one else is reading the file and the
file is NOT marked for deletion.  The crash shows that the ATB got marked
for deletion between the time it took to get from UPDUFD+0 to UPDUFD+14.
Since that section takes two page faults, there was time for this to occur.

Scenario:
1) Job 1 runs ONTYME or SMTPX or other MAIL program that creates *.FEM file.
2) Job 1 does a CLOSE trying to set the dumped bit (so that TITO won't store
   the FEM file to tape).  At the time, no other job is looking at the file.
3) While doing the CLOSE, job 1 gets a page fault while reading the RIB of
   the UFD and gets a page fault while reading the UFD data page.
4) While job 1 is waiting for disk I/O, jobs 2 deletes the file.
5) Job 2 lucks out, finds the UFD data before job 1 gets a chance to run, and
   the monitor removes the FEM file from the UFD data page.
6) Job 2 finally gets a chance to read the UFD data page, can't find the
   file (because it was deleted).   Crash with UFDER1.

Fix: Before calling DIRSRC to search the directory, make sure ATPDEL hasn't
     gotten set.

X32 is rebuild from ALL-FILES and BACKUP tapes.  All the files are up
to date and nothing is lost.  It is build on 4 pack, 3652 in pages.
After the rebuild and ASP dump was taken and all went OK.  Changed DSKTYP
to 3652 in CONF32.MAC and rebuild a X32-P035/D05 monitor.  System is up
and running with it.  I think we can consider this to be alfa testing for
F26's rebuild in pages on 5/28/88.

From South Bay Center, there is one 56Kb line to Nicholson Lane.
When we login to the Fremont hosts, the circuit goes to Nicholson then to

from South Bay Center to Dallas, from Dallas to Nicholson Lane, from

Subject: What's in OSP. 

Directory OSP has the production monitor only.  (No patch files, no patched
monitors.)  On each system, OSP has P035D.MEM, P035D.DOC, STOPCD.MEM, and the
appropriate ##035D.SAV file.  A backup copy of ##035D.SAV is also on (OSP:33)
and 33's duplicate is on (OSP:34).

DMON.PAT is in M33 on all systems and has all patches up thru #7 for UFDER1.

The ##035D.SAV file in M33 on all systems was created from (OSP)##035D.SAV
using DMON.PAT.  They have the "###-P035/D-7" monitor.

Example of use:

System 37 added a second string of 3652 disks in March.  
1) Edit (M33:33)CONF37.MAC to add 2nd string, then "CPY CONF37.MAC/HOST:32".
2) GFD to OSP and run MONED1 there to create a new 37035D.SAV
3) TELECOPY from (OSP:33)37035D.SAV to (OSP:37)37035D.SAV
4) Login to 37 and apply DMON patches:
   GET (OSP)37035D
   DDT
   ^Y (M33)DMON.PAT
   SAVE (M33)37035D

To repeat: OSP has the virgin, unpatched monitor.  M33 has patches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------   
     
     
     
In two weeks, I will be moving your accounts from F40 to D43. The move
will begin at 5pm pdt on June 3rd. 
     
A previous memo was sent to you on May 4th, listing all users found   
on F40. Several ids were found valid on a Dallas IBM host. These users
are responsible for moving their own files to Dallas. A memo regarding
information to transfer files to Dallas was sent on May 10th.    
     
Again, here is the list of userids that I will be moving to D-47:
     
MAINTFSC  
ABELE
AGTDMS    
CSS1 
CSS10
CSS11
CSS5 
CSS6 
CSS7

MIKEMO    
MSTRBRD   
NORTHRIP  
RBROWN    
SOLOMON   
SULRICH   
JCM  
     
And again, this is the list of userids that are responsible for moving
their files to Dallas by the closing of June 30th.
     
1213MGR   
OSMAN
TXSDOC    
ANVERM    
MOORING   
PKRUMV    
SALTYRON  
BUDGET    
     
And finally, this list contains users only valid on F-40 with one file:    
MAIL ADDRESS. These users will be removed from the move and will be   
removed from F40 on May 31, 1988:  
     
ARELLA    
FACILITY  
FSCLI
LAUVER    
WAGNERD   
WWPC 
WWPM 
BILLROD   
BROWNR    
CHINJEFF  
DBLISS    
GOLOBIC   
GUINASSO  
JGIUSTI   
KENNEDY   
KOLICZEW  
PATELN    
     
To ensure a smooth center-to-center customer move, the users that I am
moving must be FREE of bad files. If BAD FILES  are found on the day of    
the move, I will delete them from their directory.
     
Any users who have BATCH jobs, must be canceled on June 3rd and re-   
submitted on D-47.  
     
The users involved in this move, must be logged off at the time of the
move. This includes disconnect users. Any users found logged on when  
the move begins, will be messaged to log off within two minutes. After
a two minute lapse, the users will be forced off. 
     
If you have any questions, I can be reached at (415)498-2556.    
     
Thank you,
Jan

Plans are being formulated to convert System 33 from a BLOCK
monitor to a PAGE monitor starting on 2 July.  This conversion needs
to be done by ALL-FILES and will take approximately FIVE (05) DAYS
to complete once started.  Converting to a PAGE monitor will increase
the file storage by eleven percent (11%) and will handle the READ ERRORS
more effectively.

The system will be unavailable from 0000, 2 July (PDT) until approximately
2400, 6 July (PDT).

If this timeframe is unacceptable, please give us an alternate
timeframe.

Please contact McDonnel Douglas, Fremont Operations at (415) 498-2595
or Ontyme IPC.R/DANIELS with your proposals by 10 June.

Do you have a copy of what it is supposed to look like?  Including run/det/etc
bits so that I can have the full details when I look for the request.

During the past 18 months, the TYMCOM-10 Software Support Group, has
been a tremendous help in solving some long overdue problems on
these systems.

They have put in long hours to provide updated software for the
conversion of these systems from MEMOREX disk drives 3675's to 3650's
and 3652's; from BLOCK monitor to PAGE monitor; updated disk recovery
software; and numerous other software changes to improve the 
availability of these system for our customers.

The Fremont Data Center wishes to express our appreciation to:

     Craig FLETCHER

     Carl BALTRUNAS

     Osman GUVEN

                                                                Page  2

     Joe SMITH

for their untiring dedication, long hours and support for a smooth
transition during this period.

Subject: F30 problems & recovery 

Due to the apparent hardware problems with drive A1, it was not possible to
bring the system up for timesharing. The system was able to be brought up in
manual mode for disk inspection, however, none of the system files in (SYS)
were available.

I logged in "REFRESH MODE" and was able to run the disk reading programs and
disk repair programs (ASH and TSTSUP) from tape to determine the extent of the
damage to (SYS).  The retrieval block for [1,4].UFD contained garbage in
locations 131-777 which appeared to be UFD data.  Location 131 is the correct
word address for a UFD entry to start, so this confirms that somehow UFD data
was inadvertantly written into the RIB of the UFD instead of one of the UFD
data pages.  I cleared out the garbage data and fixed the pointers.

We also had read errors for the first BAT page and the third BOOT page.  I
copied the bad data for the BAT page to memory and corrected it.  After
rebooting the system, we ran ASP from tape to make an image copy of the bad
pack.  Then we restored the tape copy to a newly formatted pack.  All was
successful and the system came up with a FULL DSKCLN showing only 3 bad files.
Two of these were open when the system crashed and the third was caused by
a RIB error shortly before the first crash.

The message "BPB6 SECOND BAT BLOCK CONSISTANCY ERROR" was caused by the second
BAT page havinfg correct data which did not match the bad data from the first
BAT page.  This morning, I zeroed out the BAT page data to reflect running on
a newly formatted pack and this message should not occur anymore.

It is not completely certain that this was the only damage to the original
pack.  However, it was the only apparent damage to the file structure.  the
actions taken by the operations staff in taking the system down and calling
both hardware and software support was a significant aid in making the
successful recovery possible.

It's been pretty quiet around here since DPN week (as the "in" crowd here
refers to it. Hee hee.).  As for the change in gateways, Wisconson got tired of
supporting the BITNET-ARPANET gateway, and the dubious honor has fallen to N.Y.

As for your architectural/carpentry skills, I imagine they're pretty good.
Especially consindering you have the benefit of using (or consiously ignoring)
the knowledge on which your degree is based.  Anyway, I can imagine the place
from your description.  Sounds rather nice.

Me on the other hand...  I putter around.  A few years ago I found huge old
phone spool (about 4' diam. x 3.5' high).  I got it into my head to turn it
into a table, so I sanded it stained it with a mahogany stain, put some casters
on it, cut a door in the side, and replaced the bolts holding it together.
I thought it was going to be a cheap piece of furniture.  Boy, was I wrong!
(I had to buy the tools as well as the parts.)  But once I had made the inital
investment on one, I found 3 other spools.  They are considerably smaller, and
less expensive since I have the tools.  They've come out pretty good so far.  I
finished two, and the other two wait for a rainy year.  I'd like to take a
woodworking class somewhere in the future.

Work for me consists mostly of avoiding work.  I'm very good at it.  I've been
doing some small tutorials here and there.  I'm practically evangelical when it
comes to E-mail.  "Throw out your TDD's" cries the voice in the wilderness, "E-
mail is goodness, truth and light!"

As for BIGCAL, I don't know how much messing you do with the VAX, but I'm
thinking of converting it to C and incorporating some of Screen Management
routines provided by the VAX.  Provided (A) I have time, (B) I have the
motivation and (C) I can get my hands on the source...  Computer Center has all
that stuff under lock and key (as well as the stuff I and others have left
behind).  I still dislike the VAX.  Not as much as I dislike IBM, but enough to
make mw wish for the DEC-10.

Lastly, California...  I talk a lot, but I'm trying to save every penny for
school.  So, I don't know how soon I'd actually make the trip.  At some point
I will definitely want to get away from it all and head west.  I now know
several people I can freeload off of.  And they're welcome here in Brain-
Washingtron, D.C. provided that neatness is NOT a criteria of theirs.  The
invite extends to you as well.  (Considering that you once had a car in your
living room, I figure you can wade through the papers here, without complaining
too much.  Hee hee.)

Anyway, t'was good hearing from you, and thanx for the permission.

P.S.  Seen or read any good science fiction lately?  I just finished the Julian
      May saga (4 books). Liked it.  Saw "Willow" -- so-so.  Now I'm hunting
      for a good read again.

The following messages were found in "JZ(!.FEM" dated 28-Apr and "CA(!.FEM"
dated 13-Jun.  If TUMS dies for any reason (such as Illegal Memory Reference
or SAIL String Garbage Collect Error), it often leaves behind a *.FEM temp
file.  The way to recover is to recover is:
        DIR *.FEM
        RENAME *.FEM,MAIL.
        TUMS
        EXIT
If there are more than 2 *.FEM files, repeat the above procedure until they
are all taken care of.

Carl and Soley tell me the problem is in the way SAIL does its garbage
collection, which is part of the SAIL runtime routines.  It doesn't look like
this bug will ever be given the priority needed to fix it.

RIck, Bill... 
  1400 Wednesday is fine.  We should try to keep it short.

I'll call you if I'm going to be late or anything like that.  I'll be at
Nicholson lane in the morning for awhile, so if you need to get ahold of me,
then feel freee to beep me... (I'm on call: 408-977-7960)

Rick,
  Yes... I know... Craig's last two memos said to call DISPATCH or the
secretary.  One of the previous ones published the group pager number and
since that time, the method of contacting software support has depended
on who contacted us.

  As per our conversation, we have no problem with contacting us via the
group pager number, however that puts the burden on you (operations) to
call us back if there is no answer.  If you call DISPATCH, then they are
supposed to worry about getting us to respond.

  Next week, when OSMAN returns we will go through the motions to get all
the systems straight in the dispatch database.  We may even re-enter them
using the CPU serial numbers.  I'll keep you posted about when that is
complete.  ...and we can bring it up in the change control meetings as soon
as everything is in place.

Carl;

On 14 June, F29 also went down with a STOPCODE of TTYZNE (CRA009).

is this the same type of crash that occurred on F38 yesterday?

Need an answer on the following as soon as possible.

When Operators are using TAKEIT to take a system down for ASP dumps,
they are using deposit 1 in 30 in most cases when they get the message
"?can't halt frame with JACCT: job 2, user OPER <CHKPNT> RN".
Usually, they art at a -7 or -10 before entering the 1 in 30.

Subject: Hello! 

Hi!
  You will have gotten this by the time I come to the office
and have time to call you.  I just thought that I'd give you
some advance warning so you can prepare any info you need.

I talked to the people in St. Louis and they are interested in putting
the CUA accounting system on their KL.  I am told they have TOPS-10 7.01A
(not 7.01 as I said earlier: they left the name as 7.01 so their users
wouldn't know there were any differences).  If this is mis-information I
will have determined what I'll need by the time you have to send me any
tapes or what-not.

I need the correct price (assuming $2500 was an estimate), and I guess
whatever materials you send to prospective customers about the package and
what changes need to be made to the system (so I can estimate installation
time).  Chances are, I and/or Joe Smith will do the installation.

I will be writing a time proposal based on the info you give me.  The people
in St. Louis will evaluate my proposal with their plans to provide KL-10
service past the end of the year.  If all is accepted, I will let you know
and we will purchase the accounting system as expected.

Information I can give you about the system and software versions are:

    GATEWAY DEC1/7.01 system 1300  (system is in St. Louis)
    BATCON %102(2067)-4		DAEMON %20(757)-4
    LOGIN  %61(751)-4		LOGOUT %102(2027)-4
    LPTSPL %102(2263)-4		OMOUNT %27(205)-4
    OPSER  %5D(116)-4		QUEUE  %2A(100072)-1
    SPROUT %2(2116)-2		UMOUNT %26A(103)-4


If there is anything else you need... try sending me mail (or reply to this
message).  I will be giving you a call around 3:00 PM EDT when our weekly
staff meeting is over.



Sincerely,

Subject: Strnage behavior? 

I looked at the ?ill mem ref for SYSDAT and it's kinda strange.  The code is
somehow mangling the byte pointer which initially points into page 777 and
in adjusting it to point to the right offset (using a subtract) the byte ptr
becomes ['10677,,-1].  The illmem ref appears when LDB 11,PTR is executed
and PTR contains the value in brackets above.

Don't ask me... but I think an illmem ref for 310000 or 50533 is out-to-lunch.
Someone has gotten the wrong info from somewhare.

Joe: any ideas?  Osman:  Isn't this strange behavior for hte hardware?
Any: Am I missing something rather obvious?

SUBJECT>   Checking NODE CODE Loads


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On the TYMCOM-10's there is a utility  that identifies date and time,
slot, user and directory that a specified  file(s) was accessed on the
TYMCOM-10 currently logged into.

For example, I want to know when anyone loaded node or slot code for 
node 2430.  The output of this request and the full session is listed below.
The program is FIND.SAV.  To execute it, you must log into the system
you suspect the code was loaded from.  The code and documentation is located
in the SPL directory.

The following is the node 2430 session example:

R (SPL)FIND

Target 1:  2430.      For all occurrances of "2430." in my specified file.
                      Be sure to put a 'period' after the number.

Target 2: <cr>        At this point, more search strings could be entered
                      but this is all I'm interested in.  Also, rather than
                      2430 as a string, I entered 2430. to capture all
                      occurrances of ##2430.* and also avoid capturing
                      other loads that happened to be done where the time
                                                                Page  2

                      stamp had the string 2430 in it.

search in: .R         This is where all commands are entered.  ".R" to
                      file all lines containing "2430." in them.

Recording file: RICK.TMP      This is my file name.

search in: (SYS)LOADII.ACC     Search for "2430." in file (SYS)LOADII.ACC.

(SYS)LOADII.ACC: 1 (14)       Target 1 found 14 times.

search in: .Q         At this point, more command could be entered like ".T"
                      to enter new targets, etc.  ".Q" entered to close
                      file RICK.TMP and end the session.

The following is the file RICK.TMP and the format is the following:

File name that was searched:

DATE ! START TIME ! STOP-TIME ! ? ! SLOT ! LOADII-CMD ! SUCCESS !
USERNAME ! FILE-NAME ! NEIGHBOR ! LINE-# ! NETWORD ! ? ! ? !TARGET #) !
"STRING" ! # OF MATCHES

***********************************************************************

(SYS)LOADII.ACC

(PAGE 1)...
110485 155656 16 1 1        LD OK OPER  (TYMNET)ND2430.`BND 2355 1

************************************************************************

To obtain the above file, enter TYP RICK.TMP on terminal.

This could be useful for resolving erroneous code load problems, etc,
and can be tailored by inputing the appropriate search string.

This only lets you know if the code was loaded from the right directory
with the correct filename.  It does not tell you what version was loaded.

The output on the CTTY when the code is loaded should report the current
version loaded.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: Re: NETID on CREAUX. 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 24 Jun 88 21:36:41 PDT

Joe,
  I think we should define a new message so that maybe things will work with
mismatched code.
  The node-code uses a 16 bit field for NETID, but I'm not sure how many new
nets will want to have this done... We currently don't even require 8 bits for
NETID.
  You suggested sending aux crq requests to the originating node-code for the
port if the AUXNETID is zero.  Is the port send from the monitor to the EBUS
as part of the aux circuit request the ISIS port number for the command port?
Is it possible that one could get a zero AUXNETID and a zero port number?  We
may have to define a default NETID (I guess whatever is in slot 0?) to cover
this case...

The bug in the SYSDATa program has been fixed!!! So, the CTYLOG output is
again being collected on all systems [except 32 which has been down].

Joe: By re-arranging the order of a couple of operations, everything now
     works as intended.  The problem was caused whenever data was added~
     to the log and the previous data ended exactly on a page boundary.

The new version is %2(17) and is installed on (SRA) on all systems except
the test system :32.  WHen 32 comes up, I will copy it over.

Yes, it is a very good idea as to not to refer to X32 as "SPARE"
system.  SPARE has the connotation of being dispensable which
I don't like our system being refered to.

By the way, Joe tested the 41 day crash on the base successfully.

o  Please go ahead and load Dallas's Bases whenever the systems come

   User name is (EBUS), file name NWxxxx.BND.

   Fremont D.C. has been running with the "NEW BASE CODE" successfully and
   without any problems.  Again, one of the important fixes in the new base
   code is: Prevention of host/base crashes when system has been up more
   than 41 days.

   If you have any problems with the new base code, please send mail indicating
   on what system it was not successful.


o  I am planning to be in Dallas Aug 2-4 to teach a seminar to "Operations"
   and "MDFSCO" and whoever else is interested in attending.

   The basic thrust of the seminar will be to go over the new and updated
   monitor functionality and some system utilities.

See you all soon.

Subject: AI slides 

Craig,
  This is the first of 2 messages.  The next message contains each of
the individual pages that we discussed for the AI-Slides.  I put a extra
form feed at the beginning and end so that the entire file could be
loaded from ONTYME to Karin's PC so that she could make any changes
or simply print them, or insert them into the text of the slides she
has already prepared from your text.

I will try to be in between 9 and 10.  This message is primarily to
give you 99% of the foils prior to my arrival so that Karin can gather
them together for sending to Bill.

The remaining foils will be the copy of the actual flowchart and the
changes made to it... (in pencil?) and copied.

I also suggested to Bill K. that if we were going to Fed-Ex the hardcopy
to Irvine anyway... that maybe it would be a good idea to send all the
prepared foils (on an IBM floppy disk) so that they could modify them in
Irvine.  He thought it was a good idea.  He also said they could print
them on the laser printer and make nicer foils...

See you in the morning.

/Carl

PS.  There are more slides than we really need.  I punched them all in
     with various examples so that we wouldn't be typing them in if we
     decided later to use any of them.

Subject: F30's problem was an off-by-one bug in ONCE. 

EVASIZ has the highest unused address.  When EVACLR rounded it up to a page
boundary, it did so using a method that failed if EVASIZ just happened to
be on a page boundary.  In particular, the monitor asked for memory up to
and including address 744777, which made EVASIZ be 745000 (the first unused
location).  The old code using IORI T4,777 and ADDI T4,1 would round that
up to address 746000, instead of leaving it at 745000.  (A kludge to get
around the problem was to bump PATSIZ up by a couple of pages - incrementing
it by any number that was not a multiple of 145 did the trick.)  The file
EVACLR.PAT has been created, and added to DMON.PAT as patch #8.   /Joe

I just got around to sending mail.  Looks like mail form operations and
Joe finding the solution to F30 are all that is necessary.  Bravo!

PS. F30 is up with PATSIZ set to PAT+3000.  I didn't check to see if Joe
    changed it back when he fiddled with NEWMON on F30...?

Subject: Re: D31 downtime - UFD rebuild 


The problem on D31 today was that the RIB pointer for the (SYS) directory
was wiped out by a data page for some directory file.  The cause of this
catastrophe is unknown.

What transpired today was an educated re-creation of the initial RIB data
which contained pointers to all the "special" system files, in place of the
destroyed RIB page for the (SYS) directory.

After this step the system was reloaded several times in an effort to verify
that each step was complete and to restore as many critical files as would
fit on D31 with the limited disk space available.  An hour and a half was
lost getting DSKCLN to run to recover lost pages (after we ran out of disk
space).

After DSKCLN completed, I finished restoring the remainder of the missing
files for (SYS) from the most recent all-files tape.  Operations finished
the job by restoring the files from the 12 daily backup tapes and the
system was up for timesharing with everything restored.

I do not have the precise times for any of these events.  The system was
answered immediately after DSKCLN finished, then Operations shut the system
to begin restoring files from the backups and all-files.  When the all-files
and the 12th day backup was completed, the system was un-shut.  Operations
proceeded to restore day 11 through day 1 in reverse order as per my 
instructions.

Note:  I failed to mention this, but... the time spent re-constructing the
       (SYS) directory RIB and restoring the missing (SYS) files saved D31
       from having to do a full rebuild and prevented the loss of any work
       done between the time of the last daily backup and the time of the

Someone deleted username GAMES from all systems today.  I think X32 has
a complete set.  If not, and if it's worth the bother, we could have them
restored to X32 from the other systems's all files.   /Joe

SUBJECT>   Converting System 39 To A PAGE Monitor


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To give system 39 more disk space, Fremont Data Center is planning
on converting it to a PAGE monitor the weekend of 6 - 7 August 1988.
Converting to a PAGE monitor from a BLOCK monitor picks up about 11%
of free pages on each unit.

While doing this conversion, system 39 will be unavailable for
approximately 48 hours.

Please discuss this with your Group/Users and let Fremont Data Center
know if this timeframe is acceptable.  It is is not, let the Center
know when it can be done.

Thanks

Subject: Dispatch wants us to close incidents. 

A typical call to Central Dispatch goes like this:
  o  The Data Center has a problem that may be software, they call Dispatch.
  o  Dispatch opens an incident number, pages us.
  o  We call Dispatch, get system number, this marks incident as answered.
  o  We look at problem, fix it, or tell them it's a hardware problem.
  o  Third Party Maintenance fixes the hardware, opens a new incident number,
     gives Dispatch a code number for what was replaced, closes the incident.
  o  Third Party happens to notice an open incidence number pertaining to
     the system they just fixed, and closes it for us.

We have been unaware of that last step.  If it is not done, a timer
automatically escalates it.  If the original incident was logged on Friday
evening, it may escalate to the Regional Manager by Monday morning.

To avoid this in the future, we need to be sure to get the incident number
when answering the page from Dispatch, and to call Dispatch back when we
are done working on the call.  The incident number needs to included in the
mail sent to MONITOR and included in (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG.

                messages printed on the system console.  A secondary objective
                is to prescribe the appropriate action to take to bring the
                system back to full optimum performance.

     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Rick,
     
This morning on Japan, we have a problem about MAGNUM access on F74, maybe 
you know. I checked F-center on it and was respounded that it would be
followed at noon.   
Then, this afternoon, i tried and found some MAGNUM access was OK, however 
some MAGNUM access still have the problem. We, NIS,may be requested by
the Japanese users some conpensation about the problem, because adding
the current problem they have the big problem at the begin of this month.  
     
        1. NIS must explain about the problem to the customers.  
                What was happened on F74.    
                What was the cause.
           Please let me know it in detail.  
     
        2. Some user still has the problem. Some user can not use MAGNUM yet.   
           So please advise us how we can repaire it or what you can do for it. 
     
           Major usernames which is indicated messages from the system saying   
           the file was damaged.   
     
                MMETAL   
                MVX 
                MPPC
                NETBILL  
     
           Especially, about MVX, it seems that the files on MAGNUM which  
           was not mentioned in the message was garbled. Simple command on 
           MAGNUM is NOT available. Please advise ASAP.
     
           I attached sample log of MVX access for your reference.    
     
NIS, and the customers want to repaire it by the next Monday morning. 
So please reply ASAP.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Tracking down MM interlock problems on an SMP system is very nasty.
I looked at it, and found nothing obvious.  My guess is that it will take
over a week of solid looking to find the problem, which will undoubtedly
require a change to the software to fix.  As I understand it, this would
exceed the amount of software support we have promised (if any) to this
customer.  I'll leave it at that.     /Joe

     Osman, please note the attached Ontyme message from NIS (Japan).
 
     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Rick,
     
This morning on Japan, we have a problem about MAGNUM access on F74, maybe 
you know. I checked F-center on it and was respounded that it would be
followed at noon.   
Then, this afternoon, i tried and found some MAGNUM access was OK, however 
some MAGNUM access still have the problem. We, NIS,may be requested by
the Japanese users some conpensation about the problem, because adding
the current problem they have the big problem at the begin of this month.  
     
        1. NIS must explain about the problem to the customers.  
                What was happened on F74.    
                What was the cause.
           Please let me know it in detail.  
     
        2. Some user still has the problem. Some user can not use MAGNUM yet.   
           So please advise us how we can repaire it or what you can do for it. 
     
           Major usernames which is indicated messages from the system saying   
           the file was damaged.   
     
                MMETAL   
                MVX 
                MPPC
                NETBILL  
     
           Especially, about MVX, it seems that the files on MAGNUM which  
           was not mentioned in the message was garbled. Simple command on 
           MAGNUM is NOT available. Please advise ASAP.
     
           I attached sample log of MVX access for your reference.    
     
NIS, and the customers want to repaire it by the next Monday morning. 
So please reply ASAP.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Contact:  Fremont Operations, L T Smith, (415)498-2588, System 32
Dispatch: Called me at home, said they paged me twice with no response,
          however L T's page came thru (I was outdoors in Fremont at the time).
Problem:  X32 had  3 crashes after Lenny replaced some boards, an IME, a UIL,
          and PAGP3R.  System ran DSKCLN with no problems, died only while
          running diags (such as MEMEXR or XCORE).  Lenny wanted to know
          if this IME is the same as the previous ones.
Diagnosis:  IME caused when PC was set to the middle of CTYLOG.  There were
          no tracks as to how it got there.  The IME is not related to the
          SKIPLE J,.CPJOB problem this CPU was having earlier.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Debbie Hightower, (415)498-2588, System 32
Problem:  Lenny was running diagnostics, trying to reproduce the problem on
          CPU 1336 (B39).  The two-pack test system would fail, but diags
          wouldn't.  Between the time I was paged and when I answered,
          DDQCB failed on bit 27.  All he needed at this point is verification
          that it was the same bit that was set in the IME dumps.

PS.  To truly determine if there is a difference between the TRUs for
     PREMIUM ON   and    PREMIUM OFF,  I suggest a more controlled test
     on a stand-alone system.  However, for the schema.discount, it is
     very obvious.

     I hope these results help with your meeting in St. Louis.  At least
     you now have a clear procedure to follow to test PREMIUM when you
     return to France.

     Let me know if I can be of further service.  My ONTYME name is:
     TXS.C/Baltrunas   I can also be reached at TXS.SUP and FSC.C/Baltrunas
                       however, response from those mailboxes is somewhat
                       slower.

XEXEC isn't doing anything on D23.  It and EXECX are just sleeping - no
jobs have run since 18-Jul.  I tried attaching to XEXEC and restarting
it, but that didn't help.  Roy Roskilly's NETDB jobs aren't running.

PS.  To truly determine if there is a difference between the TRUs for
     PREMIUM ON   and    PREMIUM OFF,  I suggest a more controlled test
     on a stand-alone system.  However, for the schema.discount, it is
     very obvious.

     I hope these results help with your meeting in St. Louis.  At least
     you now have a clear procedure to follow to test PREMIUM when you
     return to France.

     Let me know if I can be of further service.  My ONTYME name is:
     TXS.C/Baltrunas   I can also be reached at TXS.SUP and FSC.C/Baltrunas
                       however, response from those mailboxes is somewhat
                       slower.

        Product Name:    E-BUS BASE FOR PDP-10    
        Code Version:   02.00        DATE:07/20/88
        Release Document:     (BASELINE)EBUS02.X00
        Release Description:  (BASELINE) NONE
        Modified Files:       (SOURCE)  
                                        EBUS02.O00   JOXRUW

        Test Site Location(s): X32, all PDP-10 systems in Fremont Data Center   
     
        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
     
        Engine code now drives front panel.  
        Engine code now contains Operation Monitor.    
        68K code has been completely rewritten!   
        There now exists an ERS and an IMS for this product.
.    
        This release (19-Jul-88) consists of patches to the 68K object code
        only.  All changes are stored in EBUS02.O00 ('oh', 'zero', 'zero').
        The new checksum for EBUS02.O00 is JOXRUW.
.    
        Fix problem with restarting after a Dispatcher crash.    
        The symptom was that the IPI would immediately crash when the 
        slot was restarted, causing the slot to crash again.  After   
        several repetitions, the 68010's stack would overflow and the 
        entire Engine would have to be reset.
.    
        Fix problem with the base zeroing out the PDP-10's ring pointers   
        when the base was restarted.    
.    
        Fix problem with the base crashing the PDP-10 host for no
        apparent reason 41 days and 10 hours after the node was loaded.    
.    
        ================================================================   
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        This  code is now  available on  NTD's  system 39.   For Tymnet    
        release  date and system information,  contact  Tymnet  Quality    
        Assurance.  
     
        Testing  should  be coordinated with JOE SMITH

As of 27-Jul-88, the new (SOURCE)EBUS02.O00 is on D25, D54, and F33.
This means that if PI (Project Implementation) makes a new BND file for
any base, they will automatically get Krumviede's patches.

     Ogura-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding F74 file problems.
     Rick Daniels is not in office today, so I cannot obtain additional
     information at this time.
 
     I am unclear as to the reliability of F74 Disk drives this week.
     Hopefully Rick and/or Mike Bellopatrick can supply you with present
     status, if this problem has continued during recent days.
 
     For your information, I've not seen message A25087 from Mike.
 
     As I'm sure you realize, we do not have personnel here to analyze and
     solve Magnum problems.  If the issues relate to hardware, IPC Ops.
     can respond accordingly; if they involve Tymcom X software other
     than Magnum, the Tymcom X Support group can analyze and solve.
 
     Accordingly, I'm requesting that Rick supply you with an update on
     the present status of F74 hardware problems, as they may be responsi-
     ble for the problems you're experiencing.
 
     Regards. Ken

Ken san,
 
Thank you for your support on our service on F74.
 
Right now, NIS found some file problems on F74.
Please pass this OnTyme to appropriate person.
 
Flat file problem:
 
        From Jul's 25th evening to 26th evening in JST, files  (MPPC:74)
        SHOHI.A29 and/or SHOHI.X29 were garbled. They are the element of ISAM
        and I don't know which one (or both) is garbled. 
        Yesterday, the user who is the owner of the username MPPC pointed out
        that illegal figures appeared in their reports. So, NIS checked, found
        the problem, and could recovered.
        Now, NIS is requested to explain the cause of the problem by the user,
        because he know troubles on Jul, (04th, 06th, and 21st), and is afraid
        of reliability of our host.
        
        Please check and let me know what was happened.
 
MAGNUM problem:
 
        Kazuo Watanabe got the all files of MVX:74 at 18th JUl from the backup
        files of the Fremont center, and we found the MAGNUM error at the 
        execution of programs on the (restored) MAGNUM. From 18th to 20th Jul,
        we could execute the programs without problem every day.
        I attached the execution log with this OnTyme, so please check it.
        You can find the fatal MAGNUM error at the middle of the log.
 
        So the MAGNUM is seeemed to still have a problem. Please check and 
        advise me.
 
        Also, Mike Bellopatrick mentioned in his OnTyme #A25087 about the
        missing MAGNUM file on MVX:74, so please let me know what kind of file
        is missed, and it's id if possioble.  ######.M??    .... ?
 
Again MAGNUM problem:
 
        Today, we found a magnum text file P.REP01(exec level id is MG5WI9.ME2)
        of TYMPAS (the name of the schema) on NETBILL:74 was garbled without
        explicit file modification in past 2 weeks. About the file, no warning
        is indicated. Regarding the file, it is recoverble, however we are
        afraid that there are this kind of silent garbled files which are not
        found by our check, yet.
 
All those problems have no explicit relation with the trouble on 21st Jul,
we can only supporse they were caused by it, however it is the fact that
after the trouble, we find this kind of file (especially MAGNUM file)
problems frequently. We feel something was wrong on F74. So please check it 
again and let me know the status.
 
At this moment, we find the problem on MAGNUM in MVX:74 and NETBILL:74.
And I hope no more MAGNUM id which has the problem appeared.
 
Best regards,
Makoto

Makoto;

Read through your Ontyme  M79463 today.  I do not know that much about
MAGNUM, only enough to clear up errors that we may have on our own, which
I learned from the MAGNUM Group that use to be here.

What I did this morning is the following:

As menioned before, there may still be some files garbled on System 74,
but we have no way of knowing which ones until the USERS lets  us know.

The files can be restored if the Users know which ones they are from the
lastest all-files and backups.  Even after doing this, the User may have to
recreate some files.

Fremont Data Center needs to schedule this system down for the next three
Fridays in order to check-out/replace some HDA's  It is imperative that
system 74 be scheduled down this coming Friday to start this work.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: SAT.SYS HRE Fixed 

Rick,
   WHat I did today was as follows:

   Prior to the pakcpy:
	Rebuilt (SYS)SAT.SYS so that DSKCLN would accept the structure
        and so the monitor would not get messed up if the system was
        reloaded before a PAKCPY could be done.  Page 22000 on BPA5:DSKB4
        is indeed bad and the pack should be copied out.

    <system crash> BADSAT or REDSAT BPA5:DSKB4 page 10
                   SAT2ND BPA5:DSKB4 page 10

    <pakcop done>  System came up ok, DSKCLN ok
                   FNDBAD reports (SYS)SAT.SYS still has HRE

    After PAKCPY:
	Fixed [1,4]UFD information for SAT.SYS and cleared HRE for pages
	previously marked as bad.

Subject: F74 SAT.SYS rebuild 

This afternoon, I had to rebuild the RIB to SYS:SAT.SYS while the system
was still up.  They had a SATRED error for a sat-page on logical unit 4.
The page was legitimately bad, could not read/write it.  I suggested they
PAKCPY it out as soon as possible, since DSKCLN would get upset trying to
re-write the SATs the next DSKCLN.

While checking, I looked at the rib, and gee-golly-oh-my it was garbage!
I was going to clear HRE on SAT.SYS initially, but hmmm...  So, I told
Rick what was going on and began the repair.  I rebuilt it using the RIB
from system F33 (also 365x's formatted in pages) as the template.
  Details:  Used PEAK to create FOO.DDT showing all page pointers then
            ^Y (read command file in DDT) in TSTSUP to do most of the
            typing in... 18 units x 13 page pointers ...

Anyway, all said and done, the system crashed for SAT2ND on a different
page on the same logical unit 4, before I could clear HRE from the status
bits in [1,4]UFD entry for SAT.SYS.  DSKCLN found my reconstructed RIB
to specification and the system came up.  I then fixed the UFD entry.

Again, if this tool we talked about last week existed, the reconstruction
would not have been necessary, a simple page copy would have been enough!

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

     Ogura-san, received your latest memo regarding F74 Magnum problems.
 
     Although we all appreciate and sympathize with the problems you are
     experiencing with Magnum internal file corruption, we can do little
     or nothing to solve the problems associated with Magnum code or
     files.
 
     As I have mentioned in past Ontymes, we have no remaining expertise
     with Magnum here at our facility, or anywhere in the U.S. for that
     matter.
 
     It is my feeling that NIS has the Magnum knowledge necessary to ana-
     lyze and correct the problems better than anyone else (i.e. re. MFUDO
     relation which reflects 2 instances for one key value: I assume it
     will be necessary to dump the relation to a 'flat' file and make nec-
     essary adjustments).
 
     However, we also realize the problems you are reporting are due to
     hardware disk failures on host F74.  Operations and the maintenance
     staff are doing everything possible to remedy these problems.
 
     I strongly suggest you keep close records of all problems, for future
     credit request requirements, and keep me posted on these problems if
     you wish.

     I'm not trying to discourage your communication to us on such issues,
     but wish to emphasize that we can do very little to assist you in
     resolving Magnum file corruption problems.
 
     We're all hopeful the hardware problems will be resolved soon.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Ken san,  
     
Thank you for your OnTyme.    
     
Today we could get more information about the current MAGNUM atatus.  
     
MAGNUM commands as  
     
        COPY TEXT .... TO FILE ....       and
        BACKUP ......  TO ......   
     
are not available on some schemas with error message "User Directory Access
Error", and available on other schemas. It depends on the directory which the   
schema is located. And if the destinaton file is not-existing (i.e. new) file,  
the problem is not appeared.  
The  problem is reproducable on the specific schema as 
     
                ONTYME.DB on DISTRICT239:74, 
                MMCAIS    on MMETAL:74, and etc.  
     
We guess the matter points is a part of MAGNUM copy mechanism which copies 
a MAGNUM file to a exec file as new file. And also, we found , on the same 
schema, a mechanism reading record from MAGNUM file and writing it onto exec    
(new) file works without problem, because    
     
        LIST FROM ..... TO ..... and    
        MAGNUM report writing 
     
has no problem.
     
I tried the COPY and BACKUP commands after the schema recompiling, however 
the problem still be appeared.
     
     
As you understand, this problem is very serious for NIS and reliability of 
MDC's RCS service in Japan.   
     
     
After host moving to F74 last autumn, we experienced heavy host problems every  
half a year, the cash memory trouble for over two months at the begin of this   
year and this disk un-reliability problem from Jun.    
Then our customers are going to feel something critical to operate their   
system, especially the financial system, on our service.    
     
I wonder that someone in IPC mentioned his MAGNUM on F74 had no problem, and    
hope he has no hidden problem as we are having.   
     
We know, you have no team for MAGNUM at this moment, however Mr. Matsumori,
the president of NIS, may not agree to pay the MAGNUM fee for such unstable
MAGNUM service and support, but may indicate some compensation from MDC for NIS.
     
At this moment, we can't evaluate the current MAGNUM on F74 run normally or not,
and only thing we need it to offer stable MAGNUM service to the customers. 
The simple example of the stable service is that the MAGNUM command, which 
I mentioned above,should work normally in anytime in any schema. 
     
Can we continue the MAGNUM service on F74 or should we change the service host  
to another host(X) ?
     
Please advise us.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ken san,  
     
Over Saturday and Sunday, we checked major relations and procedures of
customers on F74 by recompiling the procedures and accessing all instances 
for the relations. And we found several problem, however they were recovered.   
     
MFUDO's Problem
     
  However, about MFUDO's schema, by this moment, NIS can't complete to recover  
  it's destroyed data even though Tadashi Takahashi tried to do for last three  
  days.   
     
Problem   
     
  Right now, we still have the system reliability problem of MAGNUM.  
     
        1. Kazuo Watanabe recreated (NOT only recompile schema) the schema on   
           MVX:74, and found some program on the schema run normally sometime,  
           and run abnormally sometime without explicit changing for the program
           and execution environment.   
     
        2. And, I'm not sure this is related with the current problem, one of   
           person reported that temp files which was created by MAGNUM are still
           remained when he logged off all usernames related the directory (at  
           Saturday ecening) then logged in again (at Monday morning).
     
  I'm sorry I can not indicate the evidence for both case, but I feel something 
  unstable about F74 and MAGNUM.   
     
The Current Status  
     
  Again at this moment we can't evaluate what is incorrect. 
     
        - The current MAGNUM processer ?
        - Individual files on the MAGNUM schema ? 
        - Something others ?  
     
  Please set up the MAGNUM processer in normal status, or please point out 
  what is wrong if the cause is being outside of the MAGNUM.
     
     
Counter Plan   
     
  To avoid future problem, I'd like to discuss following matters.
     
        1. Moving host from F74 to other host.    
           Because almost of the current problems are believed to come from
           the disk problem. If we can get another host, the MAGNUM on that
           host works without problem. (Of cource, the support for MAGNUM has   
           still problem.)    
     
        2. Special BACKUPs for NIS's customer
           We supporse the backup operation at the center is taken when our
           our customers are operating their files by the time difference  
           between Japan and USA. So the restore operation from the backups
           is very complicated. Please arrange Following special backup for
           NIS.
     
                - NIS indicates file-list file containing username and file
                  ids.   
                - NIS indicates username-list file containing usernames.   
                - Center execute backup for all files indicated in the file-    
                  list file at 06:00 JST (Start 06:00 JST, and end the
                  operation within two hours, if possible.) every day through   
                  Monday to Friday/Saturday in JST.    
                - Center execute backup for all files under the usernames  
                  indicating in the username-list file at 06:00 of Sunday JST.  
                - All data should be remained for one month. (i.e. it's need    
                  31 Mag Tapes for this operation.)    
                - Backup information (backup starting time, backup ending time, 
                  file-ids, file creation date & time, size, etc.) for every    
                  operation is informed to NIS as on-line file just after the   
                  operation.  
           By above mechanism, we can easly follow the problem speedy.
           If this is feasible, we will discuss on details and charges.    
     
  How do you think about the matters ?  
     
Charges   
     
  Regarding the problem, we user a huge amount of TRUs by checking and
  recovering as compiling, programing, test run, and etc. And NIS will intend   
  to negotiate about the charges and costs after everything is over.  
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Contact:  "Fountana" Data Center, Mike Silva, System 26, no incident number.
Problem:  PAKCOP hung after copying cylinder 504 on BPA2.
          Select light off, no action in memory lights, no response to the
          attention button.  They wanted to know if it was OK to do an ASP
          save on the 3652.  BPC2 copied out OK.
Fix:      I suggested they try the OLDC command.  It got an unrcoverable
          error on cylinder 473.  Told them to do the ASP one-disk save.
          This worked, but BPC2 had a "missing or inconsistent pack set id",
          which was to be expected.  After putting a JFCL at STRFIX, the
          system came up running a full DSKCLN.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As part of the project to bring OnTyme to MDISC, training is
being delivered across the country to key offices.  If you
are in a smaller office, you probably did not see a flyer
announcing the class.  (Or perhaps you're so busy you haven't
read the bulletin board!)  Either way, below you'll find our
first training schedule.

If you are interested in participating, please register by 
phoning the appropriate contact as soon as possible - as class
size is limited.  Each session lasts 3 1/2 hours, scheduled either
in the morning or afternoon.  Most are morning sessions from 8:30 to
12:00.  When you call to register, you will be informed of the
class time.

I look forward to meeting those who plan on attending.




Best,
Les

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As everyone is aware of, or has heard, ASP can be used to copy
out a unit, or units, on the TYMCOM-10's.

ASP is only used if PACKCOPY cannot be used, or if it fails to
copy out a unit - it is not a general procedure to use instead
of PACKCOPY.

If not done correctly, a system can be wiped out.

It is requested that Shift Supervisors get together and let
me know the best time and day of the week I can instruct Operators
of these procedures.  Please submit a joint schedule to me by
19 August.

All other interested personnel are invited.

Thanks Rick Daniels

     Ogura-san, received your latest two memo's on subject (August 5th and
     8th); I was out of office on the 8th, returning to office today.
 
     I cannot give you advice on "The Current Status" issues at this time.
 
     Regarding your section "Counter Plan":
 
      1.  I can check into alternative hosts, with Jan Krivanec (or Ed
          Roop), if we find that it's absolutely necessary.  However,
          PDP10 hosts are being removed from the network (at a slow pace)
          and I'm not sure the required resources are available on another
          host.
 
      2.  Backup of customer files:
 
           a.  Presently, an ALLFILES dump to Mag Tape is performed twice
               a month, during Saturday mornings (late Saturday afternoon
               JST).
 
           b.  Tape BACKUP's (for new and modified files) are run daily
               between the hours of 0001 and 0200 PDT (1600-1800 JST).
               I'd suggest we request Operations to run the BACKUP's
               between 0300-0500 PDT (1900-2100 JST).
 
               I see this as giving two benefits: A) Customers on-line and
               running at time of BACKUP may not have files placed on
               backup tape; you would have less clients accessing system
               after 1900 JST.  B) As your prime time ends at 1900 JST,

 
F74 Problems                                                        Page 2
 
 
               most all of the files updated or created during that busi-
               ness day will be stored on the BACKUP tape, whereas now the
               files created between 1600 and 1900 may not be back'ed up
               til following day.
 
           c.  Special backups for clients, as you suggest in your memo:
               You would be required to submit Batch Requests in the stan-
               dard fashion, by user name, (or group of names) and request
               that Ops send you the TID for each of the groups.  I
               believe you'd be required to submit Batch Requests daily to
               store the specified users files, appending to the existing
               TID previously set up.  Then, when a tape is full, a new
               TID would be assigned.
 
               This would involve a large administrative effort for NIS
               and am not sure a good alternative exists (not to mention
               the transfer cost involved).
 
     I'm afraid I must finish this correspondence for now, due to a previ-
     ous appointment.  Please supply your comments to the above and we'll
     continue the dialogue.  Best regards. Ken
 
     P.S. Note I have cut down the DISTRIBUTION list.

SUBJECT>   TYMCOM host F74 Problem


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Dear Ken,
As you know, I am responsible for sales of TYMCOM service since April '88.
Recent heavy and frequent host down causes serious problems for our business.
History of F74 host down is shown on an attached form. Even if the term 
of host down is short,it causes problem for batch type operation as re-run.
We understand PDP-X host is so old and being removed. Based on this
circumstances,we installed VAX host in our node center and transfer
TYMCOM-Xuser's application from PDP to VAX. But it will take one more year
to complete that migration.
I am very afraid that if these accidental and troublesome situation will
continue, most of our costomer will start to plan removing from our RCS
service because of lack of reliability.
Mr. Ogura's proposal (Ontyme M80513) is most important for NIS to protect
customer's trustness. I hope you will find alternative host of F74 and
arrange to take special back-up.
The host down on July 22nd was the worst during past 7 years of our 
RCS service. Customers files were damaged and back-up tape could not cover
proper back-up function because of improper timing and continuous host 
down. It has been taken 5 days to complete recovery by "MANUAL".

We shall appreciate it if you will consider the above circumstances
and reply at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Ivan Kyoda
General Manager , Sales Dept 4.

Well, we used to be able to set the size to anything we wanted as I mentioned.
Will this mess up anything that you've done with saving a copy of the rings at
crash time? or in allocating space to hold the copy of the rings?

If not, then just changing the right pointers, it's done!

     Ivan, I've just received copy of Ontyme you sent today on subject
     of Tymcom host F74.  I did not receive the original ontyme from you,
     but Rick Daniels forwarded a copy when I learned a message had been
     sent.
 
     I certainly realize you've had a very rough July due to F74 reliabil-
     ity; your statistics point out that July had more than 43 hours down-
     time, with the understanding it was not all Prime Time outages.
 
      1.  Rick Daniels has changed the hour when backup is run for F74.
          Effective 88-08-11, backup will be run at 0300 PST, rather
          than shortly after midnight.  This item was referenced in my
          previous ontyme (I14434, item 2b).
 
      2.  Jan Krivancec (Resource Allocation) has informed me that host
          F29 could be considered as an alternative host to F74.  However,
          I don't think it a good idea to transfer all customers to anoth-
          er PDP10 immediately unless F74 hardware problems continue.
          Rick has informed me they've not had additional disk (DASD)
          errors in recent days.
 
          Please notify me if you wish for "resources" to evaluate the
          possibility of F29 replacing F74 as the primary NIS host.
 
      3.  It is quite complicated and time consuming to attempt and
          arrange a "special" backup arrangement for NIS customers.  Is
          Ogura-san suggesting this be an on-going process for a long
 

 
Host F74                                                            Page 2
 
 
          period of time?  In addition to the complexity of such an
          arrangement is the cost involved for all tapes etc.
 
     Consider this an interim response to your memo of today (10th) and
     let me know your thoughts on the above.  Best regards. Ken

     Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects
     and workloads to be planned accordingly. All of the conversions  
     are scheduled during weekends, and coordination with other data  
     center will take place to insure availability of its designated  
     back-up host. A system message will be posted prior to its  
     conversion date.    
     
     If any of the systems scheduled poses a problem, please call me

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following proposal is submitted of the intended dates when the
remainder of the TYMCOM-10's are scheduled for conversion at the
Fremont Data Center.

     F58 - Weekend of 9 through 11 September

     F29 - Weekend of 11 through 13 November

     F38 - Weekend of 25 through 27 November

At the completion of this schedule all Fremont TYMCOM-10's
will be running on a PAGE vice BLOCK monitor  This will prevent
some confusion as to what type of monitor the systems are up on.
It will also cut down of remembering what PACKCOPY version to
use.  Instead of remembering FOUR version;s; only have to
remember TWO.

Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects and
workloads to be planned accordingly.

If any of the systems poses a problem, please call me at (415)498-2595
as soon as possible and we can make arrangements to reschedule.

Subject: TECH-SYS 

Will the TECH-SYS expert-system/phone-assist system be able to accept
calls from a computer system?  For example, we could have a remote
monitoring program (SYSDAT) running on the PDP-10 that builds a circuit
to an out-dial host (or directly to TECHSYS if it has ports directly on
TYMNET) to connect as a client and open a service call (or incident in
CHAD) and have us paged via dispatch when it decided that a particular
PDP-10 host is having problems.  We could then investigate and provide
operations with the "level of care" we desire before operations has had
time to make the determination themselves to call us...

re: well-system care!  we need some way for a PDP-10 to call us!

you had passed on to us is greatly appreciated by the Operators
and by us Supervisors. It has opened new doors of thinking for

CRA003 and CRA004 are IME crashes in CORE1 where it's looking for pages
to remove from job's working set, and that job's context pages are swapped
out.  I'm guessing that PAGWK2 is also related to swapped context pages.
If that is true, one way around this problem would be to add more memory
to D56.  It currently has only 2 meg and is running a lot of 1022F4 and
MAGNUM jobs.    /Joe

At one time Carl and I were toying with the idea of eliminating BACKUP.SAV
so as not confuse things with BACKUP.SHR - but nothing has come of that.
I copied SYSTEM.SAV to BACKUP.SAV on X32's 3675 packs - I think it is already
there on the 3652 packs.

What is the status of the disks connected to X32?  Are the 3675s there for
long term or short term?

To set up a Turbo Engine from scratch:
  I.   Set up the GP cards and disk hardware (done in Manufacturing).
  II.  Run MAKESFS to set up the sfs root directory.
  III. Run SFS and create top-level directories.
  IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to do it when BITS is working:

Part I will not be necessary if manufacturer sets up the hardware correctly.

Part II.  Load makesfs via BITS and run it.
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p u makesfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Go to the TTYA port on GP.133 and enter 51849.

Part III.  Load sfs via BITS and create top-level directories
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p f sfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Enter "fo mkdir /isis".
  3.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.133".
  4.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.135".

Part IV.  Load the six mandatory files using BITS.
  1.  "fs -p f sfs.e        /GP.133/load".
  2.  "fs -p i kernel.e     /GP.135/load".
  3.  "fs -t s isom.e       /isis/debugger".
  4.  "fs -t s dispatcher.e /isis/dispatcher".
  5.  "fs -t c syscon.e     /isis/syscon".
  6.  "fs -t s nodecode.e   /isis/slot00".

Part V.  Bring up Turbo Engine.
  1.  Enter "bs GP.133" and "bs GP.135" to BITS.
  2.  Copy any other files as needed after Turbo is up in the network.

How to do it without BITS:

All board addresses and Unix directory names are what where used in the
demonstration given the week of August 15.  The actual names and addresses
will be different on your system.

You must be at the keyboard of a Sun workstation to do this.
  1.  Make sure GP board in slot 0 is strapped for VME arbitration master.
  2.  Verify File Server is addressed as GP.133 and ISIS is GP.135.
  3.  Both boards must have Probug ROMs, not Rodney ROMs.
  4.  Login to the workstation and start suntools.
  5.  Open 2 shell windows, and enter "skytool tb6" in one of them.
  6.  Use the other window to locate the following files:
      Sun programs: skytool, skyload, tw, skycheck, skyclock
      Probug bootables: dl.x, makesfs.x, sfs.x, filebug.x, rodney.x
      X.409 binaries: dispatcher.d, isom.d, nodecode.d, kernel.d, sfs.d
      Node specific: syscon.d, nodecode.d

Part I.  Set up the GP cards and disk hardware.
  1.  Connect a line from TTYA on the workstation to TTYA on GP.133.
  2.  (here we do somthing to run skyclock and skycheck on each GP card).
  3.  Enter "skyload -b dl.x tb6" to the shell.
  4.  Enter "j800a000" to skytool which starts dl.
  5.  Enter "in" to initialize the disk.
  6.  Enter "bl" to change block length.
  7.  Enter 3 blanks and then "1024"
  8.  Enter "y" to "make permanent" and return to "abort".
  9.  Enter "ex" to get back to Probug.

Part II.  Run makesfs to set up the sfs root directory.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/makesfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "j" to skytool.
  3.  Makesfs will type recommended disk size.  Enter this number to skytool.
  4.  It will take about 45 minutes for this to complete.

Part III. Run sfs and create top-level directories.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  4.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  5.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start sfs.
  6.  Enter "m /isis" to the "cmd:" prompt (to make /isis direcory).
  7.  Enter "m /GP.133" and "m /GP.135".
  8.  Enter "f /" to list files.  The 3 directories should be there.
  9.  Enter "c /isis/syscon" to create an empty file (due to bug in "tw").
 10.  Enter "c /isis/debugger", "c /isis/dispatcher", "c /isis/slot00".
 11.  Enter "c /GP.133/load" and "c /GP.135/load".

Part IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  1.  Disconnect cable from GP.133 and plug into TTYA on GP.135.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/filebug.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  4.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  5.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  6.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start filebug.
  7.  Enter "tw /isis/syscon <syscon.d" to shell.  Note: tw is very slow.
  8.  Enter "tw /isis/slot00 <nodecode.d". 
  9.  Enter "tw /isis/dispatcher <isis68k/dispatcher/1.0/bin/dispatcher.d".
 10.  Enter "tw /isis/debugger <isis68k/isom/1.0/bin/isom.d".
 11.  Enter "tw /GP.135/load <isis68k/kernel/1.01/bin/kernel.d".
 12.  Enter "tw /GP.133/load <rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.d".

Part V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.
  1.  Power card cage off, wait 30 seconds, then back on again.
  2.  Once the node has come up in the network, BITS can be used for all
      further transfers.

Subject: Re: "I DON'T GET WHY A JOB WOULD RUN"... 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 19 Aug 88 9:03:41 PDT

Lets say you have JOB1 scheduled to run at startup, and it schedules JOB2 to
run every day at 6am.  The system comes up, JOB1 completes, and JOB2 is in
the queue.  If the system crashes, JOB1 will run again when the system
comes back up and puts in another request for JOB2.  Now if this crash
occurs before the first JOB2 has run, it means that there are two JOB2
jobs in the queue.  If the system crashes 5 times in one day, then there
will be at least 5 JOB2s in the SUBMIT queue; all set to go off at the
same time.

One way to prevent this is to have JOB1 do a "CANCEL (NETDB)JOB2 *" before
it does an "INSERT JOB2".  This will remove any pending JOB2 requests and
replace them all with a single JOB2 request.

The inactivity timer is currently a system-wide parameter.  It is set
by the operator, and affects all users that have inactivity timeout
enabled.  Your request for an individual timeout will be brought up
at the next Monitor Development meeting.   /Joe

Subject: AUXMOX overloading of F33 to end in a couple of days. 

I talked to Phillipe Michel in Project Implementation about the many jobs
running AUXMOX.  The "522 Deployment Project" is modifying the TYM and
CMD files of all nodes in the Public Net to use Node Code version 5.22.
The BND files are being telecopied from D25/D54 to F33 as they are
created, because many nodes are reloaded the same night as when their
code is generated.  The people in PI did not know that you could enter
more than one file specification at a time when running (SPL)COPY.
Therefore each node was transfered as a seperate TELECO job.

Phillipe said they should be done in a few days.     /Joe

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, System 33, (415)498-2588
Problem:  System when down with RIBBRP on (EBUS)[3,317016].UFD and Mike wanted
          to know how serious it was.  System 54 was scheduled to be down
          for the conversion to pages at 20:00 and System 33 was supposed to
          be up all weekend.  He was worried about bad RIB in UFD.
Action:   Had them bring the system up MANUAL so I could check the UFD.
          No RIB errors were found.  Considerring that I had 5 jobs GFD'd
          to EBUS when it went down, it might have been a bad RIB pointer
          in a DDB, meaning everything on disk was good.  Told them to force
          a FAST DSKCLN so that it would finish before D54 was scheduled down.

My rough draft of the MOD for performance analysis/monitoring is
in (CARL:35,33,29)PERF.MOD.  I would greatly appreciate any cand
all comments.  I need a fresh look before I'm done, but I think
I haven't left anything important to us out.

I'll also run it by Lloyd before I finish it...

I'd prefer to hang onto my password and not give it out to anyone, at least
for the time being.

I have asked you before not to call me by those nicknames anymore,
and I realy woish you wouldn't.  It makes me feel uncomfortable.

Sorry the prospect didn't turn out as well as hoped with the condo.  
Maybe the next one will be the right one.  I really hope you aren't
spending a lot of money on me for Christmas, cuz if you are, I'm
not going to be able to accept your gifts.  I don't want to be in
a situation where that happens.

I hope work is going better. Sounds like you have a lot of ideas to
offer them.

Gotta run and get some orders into the system before lunch.

Talk to ya later.

P.S.  THANKS FOR A *GREAT* TIME LAST NIGHT.  I HAD A BLAST.  I CAN'T TELL
      YOU HOW MUCH FUN I HAD.  WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAN ON VISITING
      SEBASTIANS AGAIN ON THE 29TH AT LEAST FOR DRINKS AND DANCING!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ii just got back from looking at another house that was for rent.  It was
in better condition, but I think we're going to try for the first one
(the one that I told you about tonight).  It has two separate living rooms
as well as the bedrooms.  The bedrooms and bathrooms are smaller in
the first house, but the way the house was designed space-wise, Ii think
it is going to be better for three people living there.  There are more
areas to go to get away from each other.  The house tonight had
a large kitchen and family room but that was it except for the bedrooms.
So, you could either go in your bedroom or join everyone else in the
living room.  Meep said she'd call the first guy back tomorrow and tell him
we are definitely interested.  I hate moving; especially at this time of the
year!  Oh well, it'll be good to start the new year in a new house, though!

How was San Diego?  Sounds like it went really well.  I'm glad.
I tried to log in to do some more work tonight and I can't get the #!*%&@!
modem to work.  I don't know what buttons to push in on it and Mmeep
went to the movies.  Crap!  I wanted to get in some more o.t. over this
weekend.  Oh well, I can always do it tomorrow night.

Well, guess I'll go to bed so I can get to work at some reasonable hour
tomorrow.  Maybe I'll go in early and work an extra hour.  That'll be a good
way to get in o.t.  (over time, if you haven't deciphered that by now...)

Talk to ya tomorrow.  Lunch will probably be fine.  I don't think
the evening will work out too well, though.  I've still got a lot of stuff
I want to accomplish before the new year and Thursday night is already
booked, so that only leaves me with tomorrow and possibly friday.

G'Night!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*yawn*!  (notice the time of this message...)  i have been here since 7:15
and am only planning on a half hour lunch.

We got the house in campbell and spent from 8:00 A.M. until 9:00 last night
PAINTING.  We are about half done and have to get it finished asap so they
can clean the carpets before we move in Saturday and Sunday!  I'm so tired
of painting I could cry.  Where I'll find the energy/desire to go back there
after I get off work this afternoon is beyond me.  That's why  I'm coming in
early and taking little or no lunch, so I can leave early and paint some more
before it gets too dark and cold.

Every muscle in my body aches, especialy my hands...and I'm sure you really
don't need to or want to hear all about my aches and pains, so I'll cool it for
a while.  

How was your new years?  We (Mmeep and Gil and me) went to zapps that
evening.  It was okay, nothing earth shattering or extremely thrilling.

Wwell, gotta get to work since that's what I came in early for.  I'm not
going to be able to go to lunch or anywhere after work until some time next
week.  Thanks for asking though.

Sheila

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YES, I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE INTERESTING THINGS YOU HAVE
FOUND OUT ABOUT ROSS.

GIL IS GOING TO TALK TO HIS DAD TODAY TO SEE WHEN WE CAN BORROW HIS TRUCK
TO MOVE.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW ASAP, AND WILL MOST LIKELY CALL.
WE'LL PROBABLY DO THE ACTUAL MOVING ON SUNDAY.  I DON'T  KNOW
WHEN WE'LL PACK, I GUESS SOME TIME AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN WE RETURN FROM
PAINTING THE HOUSE!  (I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WORK WE'RE DOING, I'M
JUST IN SHOCK AT HOW LONG IT TAKES AND HOW HARD OF WORK IT IS, AND THAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY DOING THIS INSANE ACT!)  I GOT OFF WORK YESTERDAY AT 3:30, STOPPED
BY ALPHA BETA TO GET WOOD FOR THE FIREPLACE SO WE DON'T FREEZE AT NIGHT
(THAT IS ONE *COLD* HOUSE!), WENT HOME AND CHANGED AND GOT TO THE HOSE
BY 4:30 (THAT SHOULD BE 'HOUSE', NOT 'HOSE').  PAINTED LIKE MAD UNTIL
10:45 (SIX HOURS!!!!!), WENT HOME, JUMPED IN THE SHOWER AND CRASHED 
UNTIL 5:45 THIS MORNING.  *YAWN*, AM I ACTUALLY HERE AT THIS INSANE
HOUR OF THE MORNING...??

SO, IF ANY ONE ASKS ME WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING LATELY, I CAN SUM IT UP PRETTY
EASILY:  GO TO WORK, PAINT, SLEEP.....GO TO WORK, PAINT, SLEEP...
ETC, ETC!

WE STILL HAVE THE DOORS LEFT AND A LOT OF TRIM AROUND THE WINDOWS AT TOPS OF
                                   ___
THE WALLS.  IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST TWO MORE NIGHTS BEFORE IT'S ALL DONE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN KEEP THIS UP.  I'M SLEEPING AT MY DESK
DURING THE DAYS AS IT IS.  I MAY HAVE TO ASK FRANCIS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON
OFF SO WE CAN GET THE ODDS AND ENDS CLEANED UP AROUND THERE SO WE CAN MOVE
STUFF IN.  I COULD ALSO PACK THAT DAY.

I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THIS WEEK IS OVER AND WE'RE ALL SETTLED IN!  WHAT A RELIEF
THAT WILL BE!

WELL, TOMORROW'S PAY DAY AND THAT'LL BE NICE.  I'VE BEEN WRITING CHECKS
LIKE CRAZY FOR THE PAINT, ETC, AND HAVE TO WAIT TILL WE PAY RENT TO
OUR NEW LANDLORD AND DEDUCT IT FROM THAT.  

GUESS I SHOULD GET AT MY WORK HERE.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS
WEEKEND PROBABLY THIS EVENING OR TOMORROW MORNING.

TALK TO YA LATER!

SHE

HI.  I WAS GOING TO ENTER SOME ORDERS TO SHIP BUT DECIDED TO WRITE
YOU FIRST.  I'M SURE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY FOR BEING SO SNAPPY...I OWE
A FEW OTHER PEOPLE AN APOLOGY OR TWO, TOO.  WHAT CAN I SAY...I CAN'T
HELP FEELING THAT WAY SOMETIMES.  AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN
MAKE ME SNAP OUT OF IT.  I TOLD YOU I WAS EITHER GOING TO END UP PRETTY
BITTER THIS YEAR OR THAT FOR A CHANGE THINGS WOULD FALL INTO PLACE AND
GO WELL.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST IS GOING TO WIN OVER.

TO ANSWER YOUR LAST ONTYME:


THAT IS INTERESTING AT ROSS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING.  MAYBE THEY
JUST DIDN'T "FIT" WITH THE CO. AND IF THEY AREN'T/WEREN'T HAPPY,
IT IS BETTER THAT THEY RE GONE SO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE THERE, CAN BE THERE.

NO MY SCANSET ISN'T LOCKED INTO CAPS; IT'S JUST FASTER AND EASIER IF I DON'T
HAVE TO BOTHER WITH CAPS.  THEY KEYS ARE TINY ENOUGH THE WAY IT IS
WITHOUT HAVING TO HIT THEM MORE OFTEN.

HOW DO YOU LIKE IT THERE NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A MONTH?
       ---

I WILL KEEP THE CONDO IN MIND.  HOPE ALL GOES WELL.  I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE REALLY AIMING AT MAKING A MARK AT ROSS BEFORE YOU MOVED.  I THOUGHT
IT WAS MORE OF A PLACE TO BE IN THE INTERIM.  TWO YEARS COULD BE REALLY
TIGHT.  HOPE IT GOES OKAY.  I DON'T THINK EVEN I CAN HANG AROUND THIS
VALLEY THAT LONG.  MAYBE I'LL GET A GOOD OFFER TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COMPANY
FROM THIS POSITION AND CAN MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION.  OR PERHAPS
GOING TO SCHOOL AT BIOLA WILL BE A GOOD CHANGE.  WHO KNOWS...

GLAD THE PEN HOLDER AND KEY CHAIN ARE DOING THEIR JOBS.  ABOUT THE RING:
I DECIDED I DO NEED TO GET IT SIZED.  PROBABLY 1/2 SIZE LARGER WOULD DO.
I CAN GET IT OFF BUT IT'S TIGHT A LOT OF TIMES.  AFTER JUST HAVING TO HAVE
ONE RING CUT OFF THAT FINGER, I'M NOT REAL ANXIOUS TO THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF BEING IN THAT POSITION AGAIN.  MAYBE WE COULD MEET FOR LUNCH ONE DAY AND
TAKE IT TO ZALES AT VALCO  (DO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ORIG. STORE?) AND
THEY CAN PROPERLY MEASURE MY FINGER AND SIZE IT.  SOUND OKAY?

I NEED TO ENTER THE ORDERS NOW, I GUESS.  TALK TO YA AGAIN LATER.

SHE

P.S.  IT LOOKS LIKE GIL WILL BE ABLE TO BE AT THE HOUSE TOMORROW AFTERNOON
FOR THE CARPET  CLEANERS SO I WILL BE HERE ALL DAY.  IF YOU WANT, WE CULD
GO TO ZALES TOMORROW...OR ANOTHER DAY IS FINE, TOO.

I'LL TRY TO CHECK ONTYME AGAIN BEFORE I LEAVE TONIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW
MORN FOR A RESPONSE.

Subject: ASH 

In noticing that you're doing something to ASH, I did a differ... and
I'd like to make the following comment:

    I think that NOT reading the entire structure sequentially is a
    good feature.  [That is what I surmised you are adding]

    I propose that BOTH mechanisms be allowed to co-exist, and that
    the determination of whether to "randomly" read versus sequentially
    read be based on a SWITCH, eg. VERBOSE/BRIEF, called RANDOM and
    that this switch be toggled with the RANDOM command, or set to the
    appropriate value by the RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL commands.

    Correct me if I'm wrong, but I presume you want to read a buffer
    at a time, not a page at a time, and therfore, if you modify the
    code which increments the buffer pointer to the next buffer to
    select the next "random" buffer address (either at random, or if you
    keep a table [a la SATS] of buffers read, so as to only read the
    entire structure once, but not sequentially, then select it from
    this table and mark it read).  A SAT table for the entire structure
    may not fit, if you set the buffer size to 1 page, but it was a
    suggestion.

Subject: re: Lines on the screen.. 

Both PEAK and VUE have an internal buffer that has a maximum of 24ish lines
by 132 chars.  Anything less than that can be configured with terminal types
that set the parameters.  (Some terminals in VUE set less than that, I don't
think PEAK can do it.)

If I changed the buffer in REDISP.SAI to handle larger sizes for redisplay
and then modified PEAK to also allow larger screens, then you could get what
you want.

I'll think about it... might want to hack up a special PEAK for you, since
extra memory lets ytou edit bigger files and someone may get kicked over
the limit by such an increase.

Subject: re: .chCFP and VCREAT 

I was thinking....

  If we had a new bit in RIB pointers (near RBREAL et al) that said that
this page is a virgin page that HAS NOT been zeroed on disk.  Then, .chCFP
could be speeded up by simply assigning pages to a file.  When a page is
mapped in (by whatever means) with this bit set in the RIB, the data on
DSK is ignored and the user is given a free memory page assigned to the
disk page.  Only after the new page has been written to disk is the entry
in the RIB modified to reflect that the data is good!

  Likewise, for super-map/virgin we simply assign a clean memory page to
the appropriate disk page and set the page-dirty bit so it will be written
out reasonably soon.  ASP would then be speeded up by not using such a large
page cache for writing (not having to wait for it to come in)...

  For .chCFP, all pages created with .chCFP could use this bit and the user
would NOT pay the penalty of having to wait twice (once while it is zeroed
and written, and again to have it mapped).  This also would remove the NEED
for create-zero-map page, since allocation and mapping would be as though
a VCREATE was done, (allocation - finding free pages in the SAT, mapping -
assigning a free memory page).

  If you also add your super-map "retrieval-pointer"-page then if this new
"virgin" bit is set in the retrieval pointer, the page is allocated from
clean (zeroed) memory and assigned to whatever page the ret-pointer was
pointed at.   This could helf DSKCLN and otehrs a lot.

Think about it and comment...

Subject: re: .chCFP and TITO 

Hmmmm...

  What if when I open the file on output, I do .CHCFP for one more page
than I actually need... this will produce a file of contiguous pages with
the pattern n+1,n+2,....,n+m,n.   Then, I truncate the file to the proper
word length, thus deleting page n, and leaving a one-page orphan that won't
be contiguous in any file (most likely).

  I can check the .chCFP result for errors and if I get "no room" then I
simply release the channel freeing up the pages and print the appropriate
message on the console, can't enter file.. No use writing the file up to a

Just a note... it will have to be done the right way, that is, writing
to (SYS)SPAGES.SYS as a file doesn't work as long as we have the no-delete
bit set in the RIB, ... so, to write into SPAGES, I have to figure out the
geometry of the disks, and verify in the RIB of SPAGES that they match
on each unit, then use super-mapping to write into SPAGES.  Sigh..
 a little more work than just writing into a file in update mode....

Subject: re: SPAGES.SYS writing 

Joe,
  There is "sort of" a way to get the page information for SPAGES.SYS
without without too much trouble...

  VDSKPT AC,    ; where ac/ memory page

  First, we lookup SPAGES.SYS to get the size.
  Then we do a DSKCHR on the STR to get the # pages in STR and each UNIT.
  The number of units is deduceable from the DSKCHR info.
  The size of SPAGES div #-UNITS = 2 times pages per cylinder and gives
      the offset into SPAGES per unit.
  This offset div 2 = Max pages we want to write per unit, thereby only
      using 1 cylinder of the 2 on each unit that SPAGES uses.
  Then we do CHANIO .chMFP each of the pages we wish to scribble in
      for safety's sake (and we do want to compare info later).
  Now that it's mapped, we use VDSKPT to get the retrieval pointer on disk
      for each page "before" we overwrite it.
  To overwrite it, we take the retrieval pointer, calculate the appropriate
      structure page that matches the <UNIT>B16+<PAGE> and super-map that
      page read/write and then scribble in it and unmap both pages.

**This is still much less work than deciphering rib data structures in a
  user program, and depending on things that ONLY the monitor and DSKCLN
  ought to know in the first place!

Craig,
  What this means is that writing SPAGES is simple and straight-forward and
the extra steps taken here will provide greater reliability that QIKSAV will
NOT damage anything on the disk.  If SPAGES doesn't exist, it will report it
as such and maybe write a disk file, but won't just go scribbling on various
unknown cylinders, corrupting the file system in an effor to save it.

Note: TXS confidential

I have the map from disk and write to tape portion of TITO working, tested
and benchmarked against the standard (SYS)TITO.  I had directories made using
(SYS)TITO of all tapes written with both versions of TITO.

On system 33, with a minimal load (not a controlled single user environment)
Saving (SYS)*.* took 20 minutes with TITO
                took  8 minutes with TITO-P

On system 32, with the static sys-jobs (again not completely controlled)
Saving ALL (for 1 tape) took 52 minutes with TITO
                        took 18 minutes with TITO-P
                        took 17 minutes with TITO-P (minor change to loop)

All times are approximate... within one-minute.

TITO-P is approximately 3 times faster than TITO.

Subject: SYSDAT, SYSSHO 

A newer version of SYSDAT and SYSSHO have been propagated to (CARL) on
all KL-10s in TYMNET.  Didn't do B39 or the 2020's except :17.

SYSDAT corrects a bug which overwrote the high-order 5 bits of the 12-bit
apr serial number with ones in the data.

SYSSHO now displays a new field after the memory usage "m%%" which is the
percentage of user memory required to meet the need of memory usage.  It
contains a slight hack, assuming the size of the running monitor is the size
to deduct from the amount of physical memory available for each sample, to
determine user available memory.



Note:  This change is in response to monitoring D56 when they get to adding
more memory.  For Sept.. the approx. highest usage was 350%, with the normal
usage above 150%, only a few periods that fell below 100%.

When running KERMIT on the rainbow, it appears that it changes the non-shift
of the ~ key to ESC.  That's very nice and kind of it.  I have my MUX setup
to use accent-grave as the escape character.  How do I type it in MSKERMIT?

Is there some key combination that will do it?  Or am I S.O.L. ?

The command to do the translation is in the MSKERMIT.INI file.
I'm not sure which other key it uses to create ~, but you can disable the
translation by editing the INI file.  It might be mentioned in the Rainbow
specific chapter of the manual, something like MSXRB1.DOC.

Subject: Another Rainbow-kermit question 

Joe,
  2 things...

  I found out what was necessary from a hardware point of view to deinstall
  and re-install the hard drive.  In fact, it is now in the rainbow I have
  at home (at least temporarily).  Do you know when the last time you were
  able to do anything with the CP/M partition on the disk?  Was it before or
  after the rainbow was shipped to Tom Ellis?  Any ideas what might have
  happened to the CP/M boot?

  Does KERMIT, or MSKERMIT (since there seems to be 2 versions available) do
  anything to disable the "switch-to-printer" escape sequence coming from the
  host?  I cannot get ~TYPE to function properly when running KERMIT.  If I
  use print-screen then I get the extra stuff or worse miss part of the
  beginning...  At present, it seems ridiculous to have to get out of KERMIT
  and go into terminal emulation mode just to print a file with compressed
  print... {sigh}


(Yes, I found out about the .INI stuff, and where to find ~ and ` ).  Thanks!

I checked the CP/M partition after it cam back from Tom Ellis.
It was working then, but I have no idea as to where the CPM boot floppy went
to.  (I was very disturbed to find it missing!) 

I just check the doc file for version 2.31 (which came out this summer).
It says that $[5i and friends do work with latest version - I think you
are running 2.29c or so.  I will try to obtain the new version at the next
Silicon Valley Rainbow Users Group meeting this week.

Thanks for the info, and for trying to get the latest version.

A CP/M question about formatting... what would you say if the problem if
every disk I try to format comes back looking like:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
??___?_?_??_???????_?___??___?_???________?__?__?_?_?_________???_???_????_???__

I've already swapped in a new set of floppy disks since I lost my A drive over
the weekend, and in all cases, I seem to get lots of errors.  I tried running
FNDBAD60 on a few of the disks and they found 3 or 4 bad sectors, but said the
rest were OK.  It created [UNUSED].BAD or whatever.  I then tried using PIP to
copy files onto the disk with the [UNUSED] file and it reported writing errors
in the same first sector and aborted.  {sigh}

I also tried the B drive, and some disks that formatted fine a month ago... but
now say they're bad.  (Should I give up?)

The people at DECTECH (who do maintenance on Rainbows) usually junk RX50's
that have problems.  (Easier and cheaper to swap than to fix.)  Try disassembling
the drive and checking for dust.  Otherwise swap with one of the unused
Rainbows.

The version running everywhere was dated Aug-79.  It used <JRST .-1> to
keep polling for incoming characters.  There was a version in SSPAMSYM
dated Aug-82, but it had 3 problems.
1. It was loaded with a version of PAM.MAC that had the debugswitch set.
   This made it incompatible with the existing PAM.LOW, and caused I/O
   to unassigned channel due to mismatch.
2. The ACs weren't defined consistently.
3. The routine to do waiting did not have 2 <SOS (P)> instructions to
   retry the AUXCAL that read in characters.

The new version is running everywhere - it hibernates while waiting for input.

                     HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THE NEW IDS?
                     ********************************


              To figure out a new ID, merely change the OLD 
                   account name to the NEW account name




         For example, Dick Kovach's ID is FIN.R/KOVACH.  His new ID,
         starting 9-26, will be NSC.R/KOVACH.  

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > FIN.R/KOVACH
                     NEW ONTYME ID === > NSC.R/KOVACH



         Another example is Dick Gunther's ID.  His new ID, starting 10-3
         will be NSCMS.D/GUNTHER.

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > TYM.D/GUNTHER
                    NEW ONTYME ID === > NSCMS.D/GUNTHER


Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Osman,
  After you left on Thursday, I talked to Joe and here is what we decided
to do with who was on-call.

Scheduled: 9/12- 9/18 Joe     Actual:  9/12- 9/14 Joe   M -W  3
           9/19- 9/25 Carl    Actual:  9/15- 9/21 Carl  Th-W  7
           9/26-10/02 Osman   Actual:  9/22-10/02 Joe   Th-W  7 Th-Sn 4
          10/03-10/09 Joe     Actual: 10/03-10/09 Osman M -Sn 7
          10/10-10/16 Carl    --back on schedule--      M -Sn 7

Since I am going to be off Th-Sn with visiting relatives, I shifted my week
back 4 days, with Joe taking the first 3 and last 4 days of his scheduled
week a week apart.

Then, since we're both going to be out-of-town for 3 1/2 days, Joe will swap
with your scheduled week.  This gives Joe a week and 1/2 at once, but keeps
the swap uncomplicated and gets us back on schedule.

This also allows me to be available to go to St. Louis for a couple of days
in the first week of October.

So, I am on call!

/Carl

     Use the MDC OnTyme User Directory to locate OnTyme IDs!
 
 
The MDC OnTyme User Directory consolidates account directories
each OnTyme Account Supervisor maintains.  To simplify look up,
you no longer have to know the user's account!
 
 
   To look up an employee's OnTyme ID, when accessing OnTyme 
   (Choose Manual Access if you are using ISGMail), merely type
 
                  :EXEC *** DIRECTORY [RETURN]
 
   Wait for the prompts and you are then asked to identify 
   the person.  Whenever you use the Directory, you have 
   three times to request OnTyme IDs.  After this, you are
   logged out of the Directory and back into OnTyme.  If 
   you are unable to locate a person's ID, let them know.
   It is possible the Supervisor* needs to add the person to
   his or her directory.
 
 
We think you will find the MDC OnTyme User Directory a valuable 
tool, especially useful during the OnTyme restructuring transition 
taking place during the next few weeks.  

*Note:  For a current list of internal OnTyme Account Supervisors,
type :READ *** DIR.SUPERVISORS

                       OnTyme Account Restructuring


    This is to advise you that the ISGFM account will be phased out.
    There are some new Diversified accounts available, beginning Monday,
    9-26.  They are as follows :

         RSC        Remote Services Center
                    [Includes Mr. Calvert]

         MPD        Manufacturing, Permac & Distribution

         ISE        Information Systems Engineering


The restructure only affects the account name.  For instance, Bill McKay's
OnTyme ID is currently ISGFM.B/MCKAY.  Starting Monday, his new ID will be
RSC.B/MCKAY.  In the same way, Kathy Waddell's OnTyme ID is currently
IPC.K/WADDELL.  Her new ID will be ISE.K/WADDELL.


    In addition, the entire account, MDCSS, will be renamed to the new
    account, MDCIS.  On Monday, you must send your OnTyme's using the new
    account.


    For instance, Paul Scholten's current ID is MDCSS.P/SCHOLTEN.  His new
    ID will be MDCIS.P/SCHOLTEN.


        ** WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION **

                     HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THE NEW IDS?
                     ********************************


              To figure out a new ID, merely change the OLD 
                   account name to the NEW account name




         For example, Dick Kovach's ID is FIN.R/KOVACH.  His new ID,
         starting 9-26, will be NSC.R/KOVACH.  

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > FIN.R/KOVACH
                     NEW ONTYME ID === > NSC.R/KOVACH



         Another example is Dick Gunther's ID.  His new ID, starting 10-3
         will be NSCMS.D/GUNTHER.

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > TYM.D/GUNTHER
                    NEW ONTYME ID === > NSCMS.D/GUNTHER


Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Subject: Hotline call at 8:15pm Saturday 

24-Sep-88 20:15/Joe
Contact:  TRW Opertaions, Tina Ngo, (714)786-3145(home?) (714)385-5522
Problem:  TRW had a head crash on DSKB0 and DSKB1 at 5:14pm Friday the 23rd.
          After aligning new heads and formatting new packs, "the FE was
          unable to IPL the system".  This call was a warning from Tina
          that she might need assistance in rebuilding the system.
          I.e. this is not yet a hotline call, but may turn into one.

---------------
My personal procedure is to put something into (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG before
working on the call, whenever possible.  This is so that if anyone is
curious as to what is going on can find the information on the first page
of (M33)HOTLIN.LOG on system F33.  After the call is closed, I take the
message verbatim, extract it into HOTLIN.TMP, and then use TUMS to send
it to MONITOR.

              PLAY NO LONGER.  TELEPHONE NO LONGER.
 
     Use the MDC OnTyme User Directory to locate OnTyme IDs!
 
 
The MDC OnTyme User Directory consolidates account directories
each OnTyme Account Supervisor maintains.  To simplify look up,
you no longer have to know the user's account!
 
 
   To look up an employee's OnTyme ID, when accessing OnTyme 
   (Choose Manual Access if you are using ISGMail), merely type
 
                  :EXEC *** DIRECTORY [RETURN]
 
   Wait for the prompts and you are then asked to identify 
   the person.  Whenever you use the Directory, you have 
   three times to request OnTyme IDs.  After this, you are
   logged out of the Directory and back into OnTyme.  If 
   you are unable to locate a person's ID, let them know.
   It is possible the Supervisor* needs to add the person to
   his or her directory.
 
 
We think you will find the MDC OnTyme User Directory a valuable 
tool, especially useful during the OnTyme restructuring transition 
taking place during the next few weeks.

Subject: The ARPAnet connection will be out for a while 

Bill Soley mentioned that tymix will get a real ARPAnet host name,
as in "Tymix.Tymnet.MDC.COM", in 2 to 3 months.  I found the following
in the comp.lang.ada newsgroup, which implies that there will be a
period of time where we do not have an ARPAnet mail gateway.

Subject: SYSDAT/SYSSHO outputs garbage on systems with 8192 pages. 

I had to remove the edit you added on Sept 9th (problem with overlapping
bits in the word that has memory and serial number).

It was trying to store the value 256 in an 8-bit field, which was causing
systems with 4 Meg to show up as having 0*16K of memory.  I noticed this when
D56 started reporting -657% core used.  I had to fix SYSSHO as well.

Subject: Memory utilization of the Dallas PDP-10s 

I ran Carl's SYSSHO program on all the machines in Dallas and checked the
memory utilization over the past 24 hours.  The results are:

System Memory  Low High  Comments
D23    2 meg   70% 600%  could use 4 meg, CPU is only 50% utilized
D25    2 meg   50% 100%  OK                 (Public Net code generation)
D31    2 meg   25%  40%  OK
D34    2 meg   90% 150%  OK, CPU usage is about 30%
D35    2 meg   20%  30%  OK
D37    4 meg   20%  30%  could run on 2 meg
D54    4 meg   20%  50%  could run on 3 meg (Public Net code generation)
D55    4 meg   30%  40%  could run on 2 meg
D56    4 meg   90% 170%  was 180% to 350% before upgrading from 2 to 4 meg

Please remember that these percentages were obtained by looking at the systems
for only one day.  Weekly or Monthly activities could use up more system
resources.  It may be worth considerring moving 2 meg from D37 to D23.
This move is not as urgent as adding 2 meg to D56 was, because D23 appears
to be running large but mostly inactive jobs.

D56 has been saturated at 100% CPU utilization all day today since 6:34am CDT.
It really needed the extra memory.

Subject: EDITOR vs P035/D 

Robert (NOWELLR) is having problems with running EDITOR under the new monitor
.  He says that when he's in line edit mode, and types Control-Z "A" to go
to the next occurance of the letter A, it just beeps at him.  But Control-Z
"," or any other nonalphabetic works.  This problem did not occur with
P034/P.  I have never used EDITOR; could you look into this?   /Joe

Subject: QIKSAV testing 

A version of QIKSAV is now available for testing.

IT writes the following information into the first "n" pages of
(SYS)SPAGES.SYS:

  A directory
  HOME Page
  HOME.SYS RIB
  SAT.SYS  RIB
  [1,1]UFD RIB
  [1,4]UFD RIB

The directory is in sixbit and is self explanatory for the
informed user/repair-person.

At present, if unit 0 is clobbered, so is the data, since it
is ONLY written once.  However, this is a major improvement
over not being written at all!!! :-)

10/12/88
Carl, I have compiled TRP.FOR (copied and revised from MAKTRP.FOR)
from TRP.CMD, followed by SAVE TRP.SAV.  I am in the TLDEV directory
on systemd 74.  When I run it I get the following message:
%FRSSYS MONITOR not built to support FOROTS
? Job aborted

I suppose this means version FOR of FORTRAN is not supported?
Thanks for any help you can give me--Vivian

Joe,
  Do you know WHY system F29 has an SPAGES.SYS file that is only 2+rib pages
long?  Was the file wiped out by DSKCLN at some point?

  I have no memory of any catastrophy... did I forget something?

Also, systems D35 nd D56 do NOT have (SYS)SPAGES.SYS at all.  I guess that
this means they have NOT been rebuilt since we created SPAGES?  Hard to

Subject: VUE installation 

As part of my trip to St. Louis, I took a couple of tapes with me.
(Actually one tape, but copies of 5 tapes on it with MTCOPY)...

Anyway, tonight I installed a copy of VUE (Yes! VUE not FINE!)

There's also a copy of FINE as it existed at University of Arizona in 1980
on SYS:FINE.EXE but the key bindings are somewhat different than PEAK or VUE.


I had a copy of the preliminary version of VUE as originally installed as
FINE on the TYMCOM-X systems on the tape.  I changed a few of the key bindings
to reflect the bindings of the current VUE, and put it on SYS as VUE.EXE.

To run it:

    .R VUE;filename                   where filename is the file to edit


The only complications are with ^S through TYMNET.  ^S^S^Q works in-place of
any single ^S as needed.  I also added ^XS as a binding = ^X^S just for ease.
Help is ^X?  and mind you this is an OLD OLD version of VUE.  Many features
do not work (eg. $X function doesn't work)

Joe:  I have SED and other things on the tape if you want to install them.
      I onl;y put up VUE so I can work 3-5x faster on things than I can using
      TECO or SOS.

Subject: OHTFUL = Spurious usermode parity error. 

If the PC was in usermode at the time a parity error was detected and the
memory scan routine can't find the word with the parity error, all of the
user's core is marked as bad.  Due to the unfortunate way that "bad" is
reported as having a disk I/O error, all these pages get stored in the OHT
(Output Hash Table).  If the user's core image had more that 63 pages, we
die with OHTFUL.  To check for this condition in the crash, look at:
  PARPC = PC from CH1 at time of parity error.  10000 in LH if user mode
  SAVERA = nonzero if parity error
  SAVSB0+1 = SBUS diag.

CRA013, CRA014, and CRA015 on X32 match this description.

Subject: X32 Mail host 

Hi gang,

  Two problems have come to mind in regards to using system X32 as a
mail host (other than the obvious: what to do when it's being used as the
spare hardware for some other system)...

  1)  mail names will be limited to 12 characters
      R/Williamson  works fine = 12 chars
      C/Longfeathers  is a couple of characters long = 14 chars

  2)  TUMS currently relies on "user/filename" for archive files, lists,
      exec files and other special things.  Thus, C/BALTRUNAS looks for
      (C)BALTRU.TUM

      We could hack TUMS to get around this, but it may not be worthwhile
      since it would break the features it relies upon.
      This means we'd have to look at a different way to specify names and
      that means re-training people.

---------------------------------------------------------------
No intention here to send a deluge of mail... but

The cause of the problem is in MAILIB in CheckLocal
where you scan on Slashbreak then take C/BALTRUNAS
and turn it into looking for (C)BALTRU.TUM in case
it is an archive or other special file.

QUestion:  Is the format for an archive name = user\file  ?
          if so, then by making "/" just a regular character
          the problems is solved...   or is it   user/file ???

systems and it seems that they all have the OLD version 1.5 from the
December 1986 release.

  I know we set them up with a special version on (SYS) from Bill Soley
that checked access to NAD.  What happened to it?

Joe,
  PERPOPER's job XEXEC seems to be running solidly (all the time)... SRA's
job doesn't appear to have ever been started.  Something looks strange here.
(Here being D34).

Joe,
  I was trying to create a version of LOADII that has DDT linked in (as that
seems to be useful to see why it is crashing sometimes) but don't remember
how...  It does seem that LOADII will crash if compiled/linked on 33, but
not if built on 56.  Something seems strange here also.

thanks,
Paul

  I talked to Don Murtaugh, who added a hack to record load statistics in a
1022 data-base (SYS)LOADII.DMS.  It appears that escaping out of it damages
the data-base, and it can't recover.  I guess somebody is having problems
with Bubbnet loads off of 25 also.
  Ron Saltgaver has a program to install things like LOADII and NAD that uses
SSINSTALL.  Don Murtaugh is going to hack the data-base stuff and re-install
LOADII (over our objections).  Don't know more... Don was going to call
Debbie.  Looks like a few ill-advised changes screwed things up real well.
  We were wondering if any other systems had problems, but I guess we will
wait and see.
  Can somebody look at the XEXEC job on D34?  It seems to be hung...

Carl:
 
The following events were what I found and did this morning:
 
    1. In the directory of UPL, system 31, there is no FTX22.* files
 
    2. I copied FTX22.SHR, FTX22.LIB and FTX22.REL from system 74 to 31
       and move them to UPL.
 
    3. I typied R (UPL)FTX22 then it returned:
 
       -321 DAYS EXPIRED
       EXIT
 
    4. I deleted FTX22.*
 
I don't believe that copy FTX22.* from other system would work, because
1022 has to be installed by each system(?)
 
I probably will stay at home tonight (Friday night!), but you can call
me at (415) 490-2169 if you need to. Bye-------------

Subject: SPAGES.SYS on F29. 

The hotline call this morning was justified.  (SYS)SPAGES.SYS is a "critical"
file, and we need to be notified whenever it has problems.  In this case, the
file on F29 had been damaged some time ago.  Since F29 was scheduled to be
converted, we chose to leave SPAGES.SYS alone until the rebuild.  The
REFRESH option in the FILES dialog creates SPAGES at the same time that it
creates HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and CRASH.SAV.

I consider this hotline call my fault, since I forgot to set the bit in the
RIB of the damaged SPAGES.SYS that would have told TITO to not save the file
to tape.  In this particular case, the error message when TITO could not
enter the file must be ignored.

Thanks for your concern, I don't expect any other problems during the restore.

Resent-date: Mon, 14 Nov 88 17:03:24 PST 
Resent-to: CARL 

There are 3 problems I want to make you all aware of:
1) SUBMIT jobs abort for no apparent reason; EXECX says that it lost the
   command port of the currently running job.
2) (MPL)TTYTAB sometimes reports PTYs that are "zapped" and "gone" but one
   half of the pair is still marked as being in-use.
3) The TTY buffers get messed up which cause IME stopcodes on monitors prior
   to P035/D08.  They get reported as INFO stopcode RCCDBG in new monitor.

The following evidence indicates that the 3 problems may be related:

Carl: I recommend a quick hack to EXECX to make it output a message on the
CTY whenever it loses the command port, so we can compare its timestamp
with that of the stopcode.  I would like this on all systems before
P035/D09 is installed.    /Joe

Joe,
  i didn't get a chance to tell you...

  Apparently, 1022 or (UPL)FTX22 has not been used for awhile on system 31.
According to Linda F. in SRA, Fremont.... UPL has been almost empty (15 files)
for over a year.  About 4 months ago, 1022.ERR (or FTX22.ERR) appeared.

  I guess whatever problem Don M. Had with LOADII caused him to try to run
(UPL)FTX22 to try to fixup the damage to the LOADII data file.  FTX22 was NOT
there and he called Ed Roop about this.

  Julian Min tried copying FTX22 and it's files to D31 from F74 but he only
copied some of the necessary files, so it still didn't work.  I copied the
entire set of programs from F74 and everything was working this morning
as of about 4:am (monday) as far as 1022 is concerned.

  I don't believe the .ERR file is that important, but I don't know for
sure.  Anyway, No Don can fix any problems that occur with LOADII's .DMS
database file. ^^^ (NOW!) ^^^  [I'm tired and don't want to fix the line!]


Let me know if there are any more reported problems.

I now have a good version and a complete list of accounts by study type.

Information I need from Walt & Jim...
  1) The list of userid's Jim gave me... were those just the ones that
     he generated from those that had billing usage during the sept-oct
     time frame, or were those a complete list?

     Re: I have a complete list of ALL users with a PD study type and it
     may include more names than the list he gave me.  I haven't sorted
     through it to count them as they are not contiguious.

  When I finish making the changes I told you about, we will be able to
generate a list by study type, and by requisition number.  My complete list
uses a 5-character study type, most of the recognized study types are 2-char
and those without real study types have 3-5 character "assigned" study
types so we can pull out classes of accounts.

  Those that have real study types, I made the 15-character CUA account number
filed contain the 5-char (or less) study type followed by a 10-character
requisition number in the form nn-n-nnnnn just as SADMIN expects it.  later
we can pull them by this field if MDCIS/AT&T requires it.  (just covering
all the bases).

  Within a day or so, I should be able to generate the list we promised to
Jim O'Connell and verify if his list contains only the users that used the
system in the sept-oct time frame (1 month) for study type PD, or all of them
whether thy used it or not (including using it to store files).

Craig,
  As I promised... I have been able to run off reports which correspond
to the data which Jim O'Connell prepared earlier this month.  The numbers
we produce are slightly higher (for example, they show .17, .14, .11, .79
for cpu minutes, and we show .176, .145, .115, .801 respectively).

  The total cpu units they show are 46.25  and we show  43.948...  (I am
wondering why we are 3 units low... maybe some of the accounts given by
Jim are no longer active in ACCT.SYS? or are missing study type, I will
investigate further before we talk to Jim.

  Otherwise, I am perfectly content with the results.

The conflicting units we have from the october billing period for AT&T
that is SEPT-16 thru OCT-14 ishows a discrepancy because some of the accounts
have been cancelled or removed from the database since the billing was
collected.  The amounts are minor in my opinion and are not worth any of
my time further to investigate.

Re: STUDY types, there are a few accounts with multiple study types...

Use the following procedure to get a good crash dump when the KS2020 is not
responding.  

  1) Get to the KS10> prompt by typing Control-\ (on some terminals, you have
     to type Control-` or Control-M).

  2) Type SHUT.  It will respond with "KS10>USR MOD".

  3) The system should go to BOOTS.  If it does not respond within 30 seconds,
     get back to the KS10> prompt.

  4) Type HALT.  It will respond with either %HLTD or ?DNC.

  5) Type SM.  It will respond with %HLTD/000000 PC/000000,,000000.

  6) Type ST 147.  It should type "Manual restart from 147" and go to BOOTS.

  7) If step 6 fails, go to the KS2020 control panel (the one with 3 white
     switches and 4 lights), and press RESET then BOOT.  (Note: the white
     switch marked LOCK must be in the OFF position for this to work.)

Once BOOTS is loaded, it may do a "/D" automatically.   If you see the
"BOOTS:" prompt without the "/D", then type /D and hit the RETURN key to get
a crash dump.  After about 30 seconds BOOTS will prompt again.  Reload the
system.  After the system is up, send mail to JMS,OSMAN,CARL.  Be sure to
mention whether you had to type "HALT", "SM", "ST 147", or press RESET.
Also include the name of the file that COPYCR prints on the CTY.

Landa,
  I've put a new version of NONAME on (SYS) on system 29 and will
propagate it to SYS on all other systems later this week.  There was a
*BUG* in the code caused by a fault in the compiler that looked in the
wrong place when it went to an overflow block for more PPNs.

  I re-wrote the code to make the compiler generate the right code for
that section and tested it.  You may now make whatever changes you need
for those accounts.

Let me know if it causes you any more problems... (also let me know if
there was a backup of my newer code made by Ingrid...)

There is a new NONAME on F29 which will be propagated to SYS on all systems
if it lasts a week with no problems.  It fixes a *BUG* in all known versions
of code caused by the compiler.  (Or lack of understanding by the author,
[not me]).

        HW(DUL(1),1)     Generated  HRRZ ac,@DBLK(ix)
                         instead of HRRZ ac,DBLK(ix)

I tried a couple of things and finally changed the code to a byte field
instead of a half-word field and it works fine.   The HW construct is used
all over, and only in this one instance did I see the bad code.  {Sigh}!

Problems like this are hard to find, the source code looks good!

  It appears that the changes to LOGIN were fairly trivial.  It's done!
I also have a command file that will set the expiration dates on all of

  Now I can concentrate on the listing program... Other than the 
automatic
batch jobs (maybe some slight program changes to gather info each week at

  Then I guess, preparing a presentation on how the system works and then

I tried to reproduce the problem by running TRW's monitor on X17 and having
EXECX run several jobs all at once.  (The problem has been seen when the
system has been down long enough so that many SUBMIT jobs are overdue at the
same time.)  On X17, there were 2 RCCDBG stopcodes, and then several minutes
later an IME stopcode.  I haven't looked at the IME yet, but the RCCDBGs
were complaining about invalid forward and backward links.  The real problem
is that U is zero, and not pointing to a valid LDB.   /Joe

  Could the problems we see have anything to do with running out of PTY

I have not been able to change my BUBBNET password.  The PASSWO program on
(SYS:39) fails with "?lost sync with CUD slave".  On 16-Nov, I logged into
host 83 directly to change my password.  It accepted the change, but the
SUP hasn't been notified.  I did this again on 18-Nov, and again today, but
the BUBBNET sup is still expecting my 3-month old password.

What is the procedure required to notify all the SUPs of a change of password?
Could the PASSWORD program on 39 be modified so that LOG-II is handled 
transparently?  It's a little disconcerting to have to use one of 2 passwords
based on the phase of the moon (or other nondeterministic factors).

		/Joe Smith

(end forwarded message)

The format of the MUD is completely different on a LOG-II supervisor as
compared to the traditional LOG-I sup.  Since Bubbnet is running both types,
they can't run a MUD consistency check.  Very confusing.  /Joe

Where is the rest of the FSR code list?  Dispatch needs a 9-digit number
to close an incident, but (M33)CODES.FSR has only 5 digits.  We are
missing the code for "entire assembly".

9 digit codes?
  Who did you talk to?

I've only ever given them the 2 digit code for what I did and the 3 digit
code for the KL-10.

9 digit codes?   Maybe we should invent some???

Or they are connecting 3-digit major, 3-digit sub-assembly and some such?
I donno.  Sorry cannot be of more help.  I have the FSR code book here...

hmmm. sub assembly codes are 4 digit?


what about MMM SSSS AA
            |    |   +-- action code
            |    +------ sub-assembly code
            +----------- major-assembly code

They have asked me for all three, but never as a 9-digit single code!!!

          do a FULL DSKCLN.  No further problems were reported.

Found problem with files on 2020.  The differences always started on a page
boundary, and some of the files had recognizable garbage.  Two had portions
of the symbol table from the monitor, and one had part of SAISGA.SHR.  Looks
like someone forgot to run DSKCLN before restoring files in MANUAL mode.

Carl,

We sort of placed it out there for a trail period and it worked
OK.  Then I asked (Bill S. I think) to change something (the file
name for validations).  Then it kinda died because we were moving
to Unix.  Then Vida Stafford asked me two weeks ago to pick the
project up again.  Then I am going to have it distributed with the
original val file.  The last 'then' should be sometime in January
as I'm out Dec 5-23.

Interesting you'd send me mail to system 31.  I olny go in
this system once a month to do my status report.  You hit the
only day this month I've logged into 31.

To Carl, Osman:  I have set up a MAIL.FWD in SYS to forward to mail to
us (for PERPOPER mail when jobs run logged in as username SYS have
problems).  One system had mail from OPER to PJ about a file with a hard
read error that was several weeks old.  So I made PJ forward mail to SYS
which gets to us.  That is why you got a copy of this message:

Subject: QIKSAV on F38 

Yesterday, one of F38's problems was that the first RIB pointer in [1,1].UFD
got clobbered.  There was nothing in SPAGES because no-one ran QIKSAV after
the conversion to pages.  The correct pointer was easy to determine, since
the remaining 6 were sequential.  But all that effort was for naught, as
a result of BPB6(DSKB24) having too many unreadable pages.

I ran QIKSAV on F38 and F29 today.

Yes,
  QIKSAV needs to be run periodically on all systems... I set out to
do this then found that my MHX job kept bombing because SPAGES didn't
exist on all systems...  I forget why it was bombing...

Anyway, since SUBMIT is "un"reliable, any suggestions?  Something
simple yet elegant, that no matter what system gets clobbered, the
job gets re-setup and re-run on all systems... maybe daily?

I've gotten the first 2 episodes... so far.  but %$#%# KTEH is cutting
off the credits, or flipping to the studio during the credits with a
monitor next to the announcer so you can "barely" see the credits at
the end of each episode... I taped these portions or an adequate amount
of time for future splicing... maybe best to re-tape thes when they are
re-shown.  Anyway, I'm copying at LP since I've found as long as you don't
want special effects on the VCR, the playback is MUCH better than SLP/ELP
and close enought to SP to be tolerable.

What do you want to do... wait till they're all done, or do you want to
come by and make a party of it to watch them, see the new episodes... etc.
When do you disappear for vacation?

     Users who are valid exclusively on F-29 will be moved to Fremont's
F-74 by RPM on 12-16.  All other users will be responsible for moving
their OWN files to another PDP-10 system they are valid on.

     It has not yet been determined when AT&T users will be moving to 
system 74.  The appropriate people will be contacted when it has been
decided.

     Tapes assigned to F-29 will be transferred to F-74 unless users
request an alternate system.  Please type file (TAPEDIR:74)TAPES.29
for a list of usernames/tapes currently assigned to system 29.

     If you have any questions I can be reached at (415)498-2557 or
via Ontyme at IPC.L/MORRIS.


Thank you,
Landa/RPM

Joe,
  I did a PPN comparison of F29 against F74 and all PPNs on F29 appear
on F74.  If you haven't done this already (I guess I ought to read my
mail before I send this), I suggest that we have operations make a gan-3
tape with tito... STORE ALL GAN 3 ... and then restore it all to F74.

The complications are: (MAIL) and (JMS)

I will have them store all gan 3 from F29 and then restore all using
mold old new  to keep the new things on 74, and have them send us the
tty output so we can have a record of those things which didn't copy
in case we have a version discrepancy due to work on both machines.

However, I will await a sign {pronounced sigh} from you before sending
the request... or you may send the request.  What say you?

Subject: F22 Crashes, CRA002 & CRA003 

Rick,
  Both crashes were at NULARQ which indicates that the scheduler was in
the process of re-queueing a job and found thet the job number was 0.
The crashes both indicate that J and JOB the two places the monitor keeps
the job number were zero.  THis cannot normally happen and it is a good
indication that the hardware is suspect.  Sometimes when memory is flakey
the hardware gets a zero when in fact memory contains a different value.
In my opinion this is what happenned.

  Joe or Osman may have something to add... if not, the best thing is for
FSC to continue to check out the hardware, memory and data path to see
if they can cause a hard failure.

We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

Carl, I thinkj there is a misunderstanding about the setops system., It
is supposed to move from 34 to 74 (now that 29 is going away). I have my
notes of our meetings and they plainly state that. According to Debbie
and Linda you said that was not going to happen. Can you please call me
we need to confirm the way the setops program is to be handled.

Does anyone know of a UNIX utility that will read tapes made with the
the TOPS-20 DUMPER utility. A new faculty member here has several tapes 
written with both the DUMPER utility and the TOPS-10 BACKUP utility. He 
now wishes to read them onto a UNIX machine. Having never been a TOPS-20
installation, we have never had to deal with such a conversion before. Most
of the tapes are many years old, so having them rewritten in a more 
compatible format is not an option.

Alternately, a utility to read such tapes onto a CDC Cyber (running NOS) or 
IBM VM System would do. A a last resort, finding a TOPS-20 site, with Internet 
access, willing to read the tape for us would do.

attempt to call and leave a message as well, since I don't trust our
feed to oliveb to be very prompt.

  I can be reached (408) 945-4321  [If no answer about 6 rings kicks in
the answering machine, "Jack-Benny", so leave a message]

/Carl

I can also get mail:   {*}!oliveb!tymix!antares!cbaltru
so, if you know how to get to oliveb... feel free!

What software? or hardware/connectors/etc do you have with the Hyperdrive disk?

Osman,
  I saw the mail that B39 was having SPOOL problems and last night I logged
in and ran SPFIX and couldn't find anythig with FIXFDF... although REPAIR
did find something and fixed it, because I ran REPAIR again and it didn't
find anything wrong the second time.

What wa wrong?  Did you fix it? How?
/Carl

I realy didn`t find anything wrong other than "SUPCHK" clearing the
same old requests over and over again.  Fix for that is renaming or
deleting the file in (*1BATCH)SSPOOL.BAK -
