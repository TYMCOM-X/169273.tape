NEWMON.SAV has been patched to be D37-P035/D-1.  (M33)PEKCHK.PAT was applied
to fix the problem where the system would die with stopcode PCBFL1 whenever
TAKEIT (or ICP) was run.  This bug is at least 8 years old but was only
triggered on systems with 4 meg of memory and 32 logical disks (2 real
strings of 3652 disks).		/Joe Smith

had been up the magic time: 41 days, 10 hours, etc.
