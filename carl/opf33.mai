Subject: "Legitimate out of ports". Node"... 

Legitimate "host out of ports".
Node 2100 has neighbors 2275 and 2276, but slot 1 has only 64 ports.
Node 2333 has neighbors 2275 and 2276 and is configured for 128 ports.
As long as system 33 is running on the spare KL and its base is loaded
from ND2100.BND, then it will run out of ports after 64 jobs log in.
If system 33 is going to be running on the spare KL for any period of
time, then its base needs to be loaded from ND2333.BND (and the base
on hardware CCC needs to be halted).

I bring this up because system 33 was out of ports today.  /Joe Smith

P035/C06 has been installed in NEWMON.  It has changes to alleviate the
"slot out of ports" problem.  Please use NEWMON the next time the system
is reloaded.  If F33 gets "slot out of ports", please deposit nonzero in 30
and save the crash dump instead of resetting the base.  /Joe

The next time the system goes down with a UIL stopcode, please mention in

track down this bug, we also need to know which tape programs (TITO,MAGCON)
were running at the time of the crash.

  The crash of F33 seems to have been an EBUS induced crash because it
thought that it got a bad key from the PDP.  Can't tell much more than
that now.

The AR.ARX reported in CRA001 is a side effect of a memory parity error.
The other AR.ARX crashes are very consistent.

  1) The KL gets a page fault with code 37, ARX failure while in EXEC mode.
  2) The virtual memory address reported matches the previous instruction.
  3) The PC of the page fault is 122163, at TIMADJ+46 in CLOCK1.
  4) The instruction at the PC is an ADD instruction, opcode 270.
  5) The instruction in the ARX (stored in AC 1 of block 7) has opcode 250.
  6) The ARX got bad parity when the stored instruction changed from 270 to 250.

One explanation would be that the bad parity was deteced when the ARX fetched
the instruction from cache.  If this is true, then the portion of cache which
holds words for locations xxx163 is suspect.  In particular, bit 4 of word 3
in group 034, in all 4 quadrants.

CRA006 is just like all the other AR.ARX crashes mentioned in the message from
JMS on 14-Jun-88 at 17:36.  Bad parity detected in the ARX when opcode 270
lost a bit and became opcode 250.  The previous instruction was MUL T1,-1(P).
I believe that the MUL instruction uses the ARX; maybe that's significant.

Joe;

Would like to comply with your request to bring all Fremont Systems
up on P035/D-7, but it is not installed on Systems 22, 38, 58.

The last time we brought F33 and F74 up on this monitor we had to
back off.  Have not heard if these were fixed.

My understanding is we do not bring anything up on NEWMON or any other
software unless I receive mail from Ingrid LOPES in Ed Roops department.

Thanks Rick
