Subject: "is not a memory failure. The buffered"... 

(SYS:25)CRA001.SAV is not a memory failure.  The buffered output for the CTY
is the same as on D34 and D54 - "INFO stopcode BASE, Key: 0".  SCNSER got
an illegal memory reference (IME) trying to free up all the TTY buffers as
a result of zapping all ports due the the base crash.  However, due to the
way the EPT was set up to size memory, this particular IME got reported as
a NXM.  The chain of events was started when the EBUS base crashed.
D25, D34, D54, and possibly D65 all had base initiated crashes.
