Will be backing off of (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all hosts until Hardware/Support
personnel can come to an understanding of what is going on.

F22 has gone down twice with the CPU stopcode AR/ARX already today.  Cannot
have system going down this frequently with this stopcode.

Let's get together ASAP and determine which way we are to go with 
monitors.

Thanks Rick

Since F74 has been up on NEWMON, there has been THREE crashes (3, 4, and 5).

Are these related to the NEWMON or the updated EBUS code that wasloaded
at the same time?

ThansIf system goes down one more time, we will back off of NEWMON and
bring up on SYSTEM monitor.

Thanks Rick Daniels

System 74 has been brought with SYSTEM.SAV.  Plans are that if
anymore "CIRCUITS NOT RESPONDING" message print out on SUPCHK, the
EBUS will be loaded with OLD code and system brought up on NEWMON.SAV.
Tyring to determine what is causing crashes.

   EARLIER IN THE DAY THE SYSTEM GOT A REDSAT MESSAGE AND

   AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TRY AND CLEAN SYSTEM UP.
   BPA16 SAYS IT GOES OFFLINE AND BACK ONLINE AGAIN. THIS HAPPENS
   AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
   NEVER ANY THUNGS. THE SYSTEM CAME UP WITH 2 FILES THAT LOST
   DATA. THEY WILL BE RESTORED. IT ALSO CAME UP WITH A RIBERR

   NEWMON ?

Subject: "I gave explicit instructions on"... 

I gave explicit instructions on what to do on system 74 that were not followed.
I asked that FSC work on BPA12 until it could be made on-line, and that the
operator bring the system to the FILES dialog so that the monitor would
verify that all of DSKB was present and not come up to users.

I regret not having demanded that F74 be halted when I was informed that it
went into auto-restart anyway.  At least one SAT page on BPA12 was wrong, and
since a full DSKCLN was not run, it allowed new files to be written on top
of old files.

The list of damaged files is so long that it overflowed the CTYLOG buffer.
It is important that the hardcopy from F74 be saved for analysis.  Did
DSKCLN report all errors on one unit (DSKB6:)?

Joe;

I have no knowledge of what you todl FSC to do or not to do.  I
do not know what operator you talked too.  What operator did you talk
too?

I was called and asked if I wanted to do anything on the system.  I told them
No.  I said if FSC had return the sytem to them to bring it up.

One would think they would do what was asked of them.

DSKCLN reported errors of units 6, 21, 1, 5, 12, 4, 7, 3, 2, 14, 10
(dskb20,  15, 6, 1, 12, 10, 7, 3, 4,  14, 2).  I have hardcopy in my
