I have fifteen counters arranged in a triangular grid, with one of them
removed (say the top one):

            <---------
        X X          |
       X X X         I call the space left by the removed counter
      X X X X        the "initial space."
     X X X X X

A move consists of taking a counter, hopping it over one of the counters
immediately adjacent to it, placing it in the space immediately on the
other side of the counter that was hopped over (this space must have
been empty beforehand), and removing the counter hopped over from the
grid.  You cannot move outside the initial triangular grid.

For example, in the above situation, the leftmost counter in the line
third from the bottom can be hopped over the leftmost counter in the
line fourth from the bottom, leaving the following situation:

         X
          X
         X X
      X X X X
     X X X X X

The object is to make thirteen moves and thereby leave just one counter
remaining.

If the initial space is on the border (i.e., not one of the middle
three), then a solution exists.  Prove this.

Open questions:

1.  Does a solution exist if the initial space is one of the middle
    three?  (Conjecture: no)

2.  For each possible position of the initial space, determine the
    number of distinct (i.e., excluding rotations and reflections)
    solutions.

3.  Generalize to triangles of different sizes.

4.  Generalize to different grid configurations (other than triangular).

5.  Generalize to tetrahedra and higher dimensions.

A friend of mine works at a school for delinquent and disturbed kids.
Their school inherited a Radio Shack TRS-80 computer which they thought
was probably junk.  I told him that at one time, there was a lot of
software available for those machines.

He would like to know if there are any games and other programs which
might be good to have at the school available.

Also, he needs a user's manual.

Since the message clearly didn't get through, I will say it again:
When New Jersey passed the No-Fault laws, the insurance rates in N.J.
went *up* $500. Similar things happened in PA.  The way it works is as
follows:

If I have to sue for $5000, I won't. It doesn't pay in time and
aggravation (or in dollars!).  Therefore, the insurance companies
don't in practice pay out on many such claims.

Now when such a claim becomes easier to make or financially
worthwhile, the insurance companies pay out on more of them. This
raises their costs so they raise their rates, which by law they are
permitted to do, because their *profits* are regulated, not their
*costs*.

You are right.  This statistic is (to the best of my knowledge), an
average of all settlements paid by insurance companies.

What I've heard: The insurance companies are sponsoring 104 and have given
it the name "No-Fault" to make it sound attractive to consumers (us).
However, No-Fault is only part of Prop. 104 and the rest of it is what
consumers should apparently be aware of.

This information comes from the recent _Bay_Guardian_, which I've only just
started to read so I don't have lots of facts. (But I get the impression that
they are against all but 1 or 2 proposals, 103 and ???). Anyway, they say
that the insurance companies saw 103 and came up with lots of their own
initiatives (with proposals that conflict with 103 and could therefore
negate it) in order to confuse the voters enough so that they might just
vote NO to everything (and the status quo would hold) or vote YES to several
of the initiatives and cause a cancellation to occur among conflicting
proposals. (The article also listed some of the profits made by insurance
companies in the last year, they were in the billions, and noted the fact
that none of these companies paid any federal tax).

So 104 is called "the No-Fault initiative" when it might be more accurate to
call it "the initiative that contains the No-Fault proposal along with lots
of other stuff".  If you've read the no-fault law and agree with it, be sure
you've read the entire initiative and know exactly what you're voting for if
you say yes to 104 (which is what I wanted to say in the first place).

So when do the ballots arrive anyway?  It's hard to build much of a
discussion without all the facts.  If there's interest I could post some of
the Guardian's article but it's long enough that I wouldn't want to type it
all.

Later,

You have conveniently forgotten to mention that 104 is being pushed thru by
Insurance companies who are spending millions on ad campaigns.  I heard from
some program on TV (don't recollect which one) that this is the most expensive
non-presidential race in the nation.

NOT TRUE.  104 wants drivers with one moving violation should not be taken to
be bad drivers.  Drunk drivers always get at least two moving violations, one
for the traffic offence and one more for drunk driving.  Please don't mislead
people with half-truths.

Thats great. The law says that the speeder may not be clocked between
fixed points BUT nothing about the er clocking them slef! So once
they know how fast they are going they can "pace" you and know how fast
your are going! It does not matter that they just happen to be pacing
you WHILE clocking you. WONDERFUL! Another loophole eh?

Oh now there IS an intelligent reason to vote for something!!!
I think I'll vote against it because the petition was written blue ink!
(note heavy sarcasm)
1). Just because the insurance companies want it does not mean it has to be
immediatly bad. They want it because underwritting costs are getting way
out of hand and they need to get a control inorder to be able to sell
insurance at all. Grow up people. Sure they want to make a buck but they
could easily do that by rasing rates AGAIN! And besides, its a "fair market"
out there and if insurance could be sold cheaper and still make money don't
you think someone would be doing it? (No, I don't work in the industry and
my family does not either (anymore!). Look at AAA or Farmers balance
statement for the last 3 years. Underwritting is costing them money!
2). Trying reading the Bill Of Rights or the Constitution some time.
Open ANY law recently passed on the ballot (like the clean water acts).
You probably didn't read the actual law on any of those I'll bet becase you
may have liked the way they sounded but I assure you that the legal writting
was just as complicated. Go look!

Great idea!  You don't really want to take your family across the U.S.
on vacation, anyway!  (Of course, only very, very rich people should have
the ability to go anywhere they want -- the rest of the rabble are just
going to graffiti the rocks in the desert).

This is EXACTLY the sort of elitist leftist nonsense that I expect from

Here is a strange idea that came up in a "bull" session at work this
evening about public transit:
1). Priviate vehicles become a thing of the past. NOT ALLOWED>
2). Convert ALL cars which could pass some standard into a "taxi" and the
rest of the cars are "eliminated".
3). Business could still have trucks and delivery vehicles.
4). Deregulate taxi regulations so there can be MANY MANY more taxis.

The idea is that anytime you need a car you call a taxi and get one on less
than 10 minutes. It takes you right where you want to go. To get a taxi
dirver's license would require an elaborate test to prove you were a "good" 
driver. No insurance companies would be needed as most cars would be owned 
by large companies who could have arbitration boards for collisions. You 
still get the "luxury" of a priviate vehicles WITH chauffer drivers.

The biggest downside I see to this is what it would do to the economy. A
stat we saw said something to the effect that 80% of all cars are NOT
in motion at any given time. Wow. This means we take the 20% and keep them
all in motion. This would put the car manufactures out of business
quickly as the need for cars goes way down. I wonder just how much of
today's industry in America is dedicated to the automobile industry? 
Obviously gas consumption could go down as the 20% of cars still running
could be regulated to have a high efficency. Cops could spend more time
looking for "real" bad guys!
Hmmm...to rob a bank would you have to call for a getaway car?

Don't flame me for this idea..I just thought it was interesting and thought
it might stir up some discussion!

Justifiably so.  Anyway, this gets written up in the popular press 
every so often, when someone is defending or attacking a speed limit.

1.	The pilot lines your car up with a viewpoint on his plane,
	perhaps a strut.

2.	He observes _the_strut_ as it passes two points a known
	distance apart.  These can be calibrated stripes, bridges,
	or whatever.  The CHP is smart enough to figure out how far apart
	two bridges are.

3.	He calculates the ground speed of _the_plane_.  Since he's been
	keeping you lined up with his wingtip, this is also _your_
	speed.  This means, in the wisdom of California law,
	that he is pacing you rather than subjecting you to a speed trap.

His measurement of your speed will be accurate within the limits of
his stopwatch skill, his ability to maintain a course parallel to the road,
and his ability to maintain the same heading at both timing marks.

Another point that's often repeated is that the C.H.P. is semi-officially
after the fastest fifteen per cent of the drivers out there.  One
of the best ways to avoid a ticket is to try to keep faster drivers
in sight at all times.

This is not a valid argument.  What were the rates BEFORE no-fault
and what are the rates of near-by states without no-fault.  I used
to live in Iowa that doesn't have no-fault and the rates were
dirt cheap.  By your argument I should then vote NO on 104 because
no no-fault is not a bad thing.

It is not fair to compare current rates of no-fault and non no-fault
states because there are so many other factors involved such as
number of cars, average distance traveled, and population density.
What needs to be examined is how the rates changed before and after
no-fault was installed.

What worries me about 104 is that there are NO requirements that rates
will drop if 104 passes, only the insurance companies promises.  I fear
that the will drop rates 10-20% the first year but after 4 years they
will be back up to their current high rates.  There is NO regulation
of insurance now or after 104, we have to take insurance companies
on their word about their actual costs, amount paid out, and how big their
profit is.  If we are requiring everyone to ave insurance by state law
their ought to be some way of at least monitoring if not regulating
the insurance companies so that they do not screw the consumer.

The reason that "No-Fault" failed in New Jersey is that the law was
poorly written.  Not only was there "No-Fault" protection, but victims
could still sue whenever the damage/bill was greater than $200.  You
can imagine what can happen.  People will collect on their "No-Fault"
insurance and then proceed to sue the other party.  Insurance companies
get hit from both ends, so they raise rates.

A "true" No-Fault will put a much higher limit before injured parties
can sue the other party.  I am unsure what the limit is for California's
No-Fault, but I think I can say without fear of contradiction that it is
greater than $200.

Please check out how "true" No-Fault has worked in states like New York
and (I think) Michigan.  Rates in New York have only raised 2.9% since
No-Fault has been instituted.  I wonder how much less business their
lawyers have gotten.

Question for you: did you once live in New Jersey?  Your first statement
would indicate so (or at least in one of the states which passed a
No-Fault law).  If so, I would be interested in getting more data on
how your rates changed.

Actually, if rates drop and come back in 4 years that IS a decrease and
would obviously be better than today! (simple enough?) And anyway, if they
don't drop the next election would just repeal the law because consumers
would be VERY angry and EVERYBODY would vote it out.

As for the init. that "forces" a 20% drop. This will NOT work. A similar
law happened in Florida for malpractice insurance and the insurance companies
simply stopped selling malpractice in that state. Doctors had to go out of
state to buy insurance and out of state WAS MORE costly than the original
costs in state. Imagine telling Apple Computer that they HAD to lower their
prices in San Jose. Apple would most likely just stop selling in San Jose.
That too seems simple.

104 is not perfect. But it IS better than all the others COMBINED. And yes,
I HAVE read the laws thank you. I was against 104 at the start but am now
going to vote yes to 104! A little education helped!

Where does it say that?  I'm sure a lot  of us might change our minds
about 103 if you could point out exactly where in the proposal drunk
drivers are equated with good drivers -- I know I missed this item
when I was reading the (early) version of the proposition.

>NOT TRUE.  104 wants drivers with one moving violation should not be taken to

I missed this, too.  Have these propositions changed since they
were circulated in the petition-gathering phase?  I read both 103 and
104 when they came around with their respective petitions: I remember
103 as a brief, somewhat simplistic, but generally okay proposition;
I remember 104 as a multi-page-in-tiny-print, seemingly self-contradictory,
apparently intentionally-written-to-be-misleading proposal which didn't
say anything anywhere about violation/point counts (I was looking for
that specifically), though it did have a lot of stuff prohibiting
discrimination based on race (isn't that already prohibited?  I've
never had an insurance agent ask me my race when I was asking for
a telephone quote).

I'm inclined to vote against 104 for two reasons: (1) the insurance
companies are behind it, and we all know how THEY are, and (2) it
reads like an Obfuscated C Contest entry, only not as clever, and
I'm hesitant to vote for anything which is worded so as to make it
difficult to understand ...

The point, silly person, is that the person to whom I was replying
claimed that rates rose $400 - $500 per person in states in which
no-fault was installed.  With no-fault, my rates in Houston WERE $500
per person per year; it's hard to imagine them being $0-$100 with
no-fault.  Thus, I detected a probably bogus claim, and said so.

I do realize that there is a lot of regional variation; however,
Houston is much more like Silicon Valley than it is like anything in
neighboring states (New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana).  Until
recently, it had the additional premium-boosters (1) no seatbelt law
and (2) no open-container-in-car law.  Roads are lots worse, too, and
it rains more often.  Comparison with Louisiana is also completely
bogus, because their law is French, not English, and there's no such
thing as compensation for pain-and-suffering.  It occurred to me that
it would be interesting to compare insurance rates in Louisiana with
rates in Mississippi and Alabama to see if the lack of
pain-and-suffering compensation had much effect.

I also fail to understand the mechanism by which no-fault is supposed
to raise rates.  Can someone enlighten me?  Do note that I am
suspicious of the fine print in 104, but I don't think that no-fault
is what makes 104 bad.

Sorry Jon, but that makes little sense if any at all! What do you mean
rates went up $500? A VW paying $125 went to $625 while a vette paying
$1000 went to $1500? Not likely the case. And what you describe as how it works
again makes no sense! You DON'T sue for $5000 under 104, under $25K are
paid based on actual medical bills and costs and loss of wages. Sueing is
not involved. Who are you sueing? If you sue the other party, the problem is
not paying the claim but that adding an attorney to a $5K claim (adding
2 attornies actually) brings the cost UP and thats what 104 is trying to stop!
The insurance companies save millions on not paying attorney fees on smaller
claims, of which mor ethan 60% happen to be! On larger claims (over $25K),
nothing will change with 104, so nothing changes! The results are 60%+
claims are held at their actual costs, not attorney inflated costs. The
others stay the same. How do you see this costing the insurance company more
money? Perhaps (in fact, I'm sure) that NJ and PA were the 2 of the states
listed as having faulty no-fault insurance laws. 104 is not the same sor
your comparing Apples to Oranges  here.

Don't be ridiculous.  There is no reason whatsoever for legislative
enactments to be unreadable.  I *do* read many of the referenda and
initiative texts (obviously skipping things like bond issues -- which
are all essentially the same -- and measures that I am unalterably for
or against based on agreed summaries of their content) and many of
them are quite well-written. (Many are horrendous, too.)

Funny that Mr. Rubin mentions the Bill of Rights and the Constitution;
they are both quite readable documents even given that they were
written 200 years ago and were meant to be exceedingly general in
scope.  (I don't consider them perfect; for example the Second
Amendment is damnably unclear: is the second clause MEANT to be
dependent on the first, or not?)  The draftors needed to make things
as general as possible, since they knew (or planned) that the
documents would have to stand the test of time and the evolution of
language.  

On the other hand, the insurance initiatives need not be "timeless"
enactments.  They should be short, specific, and clear.  And 
(to my understanding; I've only read 100 and 104) they aren't.
Seems as good a reason as anything else to vote against them.

By the way, I have both taken and taught legal writing/drafting classes.

Yup.

Obviously the total number of cars will go way down, but it isn't
clear that the necessary number of new cars will go down.  Remember,
cars wear out as a function of both time and miles driven, and in CA,
time isn't that important.  (A cabbie who drives 100k miles/year goes
through cars about ten times as fast as I do, because I only drive 10k
miles/year.)  So, this scheme reduces the total invested in cars, but
the replacement and maintenance costs will remain the same.  If people
don't share more rides than they do now, the total traffic won't go
down either.  (BTW - it isn't clear that this scheme will reduce
the total number of cars necessary as much as Rubin claims because
the peak demand is much higher than the average - there is far more
demand at 8am than there is at 3am.)

There is big problem with the scheme.  Let's assume that cabbies get
their cars for free but that private citizens have to pay and figure
out how much cabbies make/hour if they want to be cost competitive
with people who are willing to drive themselves for free.  My car
costs less than $10k and should lasts (easily) 60k miles and its
average speed while not parked is at most 30mph.  Surprise, if the
cabbie makes more than $5/hr, it's cheaper for me to have a car.  In
reality, cabbies buy their cars and pay for maintenance (I save a lot
here because I do most of my own), so the cabbie has to work
for even less to compete with self-transportation.

Now, there are some savings to be had with fewer cars driven more
hours/day, but the increased labor costs will swamp them.

Do you really believe this?  Do you think that if you are seriously injured in
an accident that your insurance company will be more likely to compensate you 
for that injury than they are now?  And what if they don't believe that your 
injuries warrant the compensation you claim they do?  You CAN'T sue them 
because Prop 104 limits your right to sue the insurance company for failure to
pay a claim!  Also, you have to go the MD's that the insurance company tells 
you to go to -- you cannot choose non-AMA practioners (this is the 
interpretation of the California Chiropractic Association).

This is false.  Only insurance settlements that require lawyer intervention 
have such fees.  If an insurance company simply and honestly pays a claim, 
then lawyers do not get any fee at all.  I have been in three accidents in my 
lifetime where I received compensation from an insurance company.  The first 
time (in Arizona) the other driver's insurance company checked my car and 
promptly had a check mailed to me -- no lawyer fees.  In the second case (also
in Arizona), the other driver's insurance company did not deny that their 
client caused the accident but tried to claim that the damage to my car was 
not caused by the accident.  In that case, I went to small claims court and 
won; there were no lawyer fees but the judge made the insurance company 
compensate me for the filing fees and court fees.  In the third case (in 
Colorado, a No-Fault state), my insurance company simply gave me a check for 
the damages to my car.

Most people I know who have been in accidents have simply gotten estimates on 
the damage, had the insurance adjuster verify the damage and been compensated 
without legal fees.  The only  people I know who have been involved with 
lawyers are those who had loved ones killed in auto accidents (insurance 
companies do their best to screw the survivors in such cases, usually making 
phone calls trying to settle on the day of the funeral).

I agree FULLY. However, lawyers and politicians write these damns things
and therefor will ALWAYS be written in leagelize (if I may!). Its too bad
buf if they were written for laymen we wouldn't need lawyers....wait a sec,
I think I have hit on something here!!!! :-)

Ok, I will back down a bit here and say that if you can't understand the
law that you SHOULD NOT VOTE. I'll warn many who vote in California to
check WHICH way to vote as many props. are written in negative logic and

Thats is more clear now. I didn't mean to insult you. Please go reread
the 104. It gets a bit better the second time.
I should add that I was very pissed off that this damn prop and to be so
long winded and convoluted. Its not fair to the average person who has no
legal background. 104 IS better than today's laws however.

A small warning to voters: if NOTHING passes, your rates WILL go up. Look at
the public records of the big insurance companies and auto underwritting is
loosing money. And that can only get worse. Any prop. that would REQUIRE
companies to lower rates will simply push the company out of state where the
law does not apply (Malpractice insurance in Florida as an example). Limiting
what lawyers can make is a great idea. But alone will not solve the problem.
Please be sure you understand what 104 can and will do before you vote against
it. It has a few bad points (like one's own health insurance having to cover
some losses fisrt). The "list" of doctors really means AMA approved and this
was done to get Chiropractors out of the picture but if I understand all
correctly, your doctor can request one and then its covered.

'nough said!

Currently, insurance companies are permitted to share certain information about claims, losses and prices. The insurers say that sharing this information 
allows all of them to better understand losses so they can set competetive 
rates. The insurers also say this information sharing allows new insurance
companies to come into California and vigorously compete with the existing 
ones. This sharing of information, loss and price data is illegal in vitually 
every other business and industry because it violates state and federal 
'anti-trust' laws. Anti-trust laws forbid such things as price-fixing and 
other anti-competetive activities on the part of business. Yet, insurance 
companies lobbied for and got exemptions from these laws. Now, consumer 
advocates say the time has come to remove thses exemptions and force the 
industry to be fully competetive as all other mature businesses. Consumer
advocates claim that the industry uses its exemption to fix prices, redline 
who zip codes and raise prices whenever and however it chooses. By eliminating
this rare exemption from law, consumer advocates argue that intense 
competition will lower prices.

First, that's not 100% correct. The list of doctors is quite long actually
and Chiropracters are allowed if requested by the attending physician.
In addition, claims under $25,000 ARE paid out to you by YOUR insurance
company with receipt proof only. You simply go to a listed doctor and they
pay your costs. Since they are in control, you may not get the exact care
you had hoped for but for small injuries the idea is to keep the costs
DOWN! If the injuries are very srerious, they will no doubt be OVER the $25K 
limit and the law suit "laws" come back into effect.

So then nothing changes and your no worse off! But something may change 
for the better if you do vote for it! Sitting on your hands and letting things
stay as they are will be sure NOT to improve things. Infact, I would not be
a bit surprised to see insurance companies raise their rates just to prove a 
point if 104 fails to pass!

The law changes NOTHING for collision and property damage. these are still
paid and treated as they are today. The law (sorry, initiative) covers
medical costs, loss of wages, and out of pocket expenses only. If your
3 accidents did not require any of these then they don't apply to 104 and 
would have been handeled the same. By the way, most all insurance companies
I know of will simply give you a check for your own cars damage and then
through subragation (spelling?), recover their money from the other insurance
company. California has an arbitration board for ALL such cases. That does
NOT change. What will change is if that silly bumper bender causes the
jerk in the fron car to claim a back injury, most of which are attorney
bogus claims just to get a few bucks from the insurance company. Under current
law to claim for medical, out of pocket, or loss of wages because of a car
accident you MUST sue the other driver. What do you know, an attorney is
now involved. You just want your 10K loss paid. What do you think the attorney
is going to ask for? I would guess $50K maybe. And the loosing insurance
company MUST pay that loss. CRAZY! 104 will stop MOST of these claims. Only
major injuries or losses will require an attorney and perhaps those are the
times they should be there anyway. 

By the way, no-fault is a bad name as fault is still determined and your
record will reflect that. Collision damage is paid on a fault basis.
Oh well, not perfect but better than today!

Spoken like a person whose state hasn't done it yet.  In every state
in which the no-fault legislation has gone through, the net effect has
been a $400 to $500 *increase* *per person* on insurance rates. Think
about it, and please defeat this initiative.  No fault lawas are one
of the major reasons why New Jersey's insurance is now higher than
California.

Great statistics, but with no-fault my rates WERE $500 for two cars in
Houston.  (That I can remember, because I remember the 6-month
premium.  Where do you get YOUR statistics?) I'm not sure I approve of
all the other glop in 104, but no-fault as implemented in Texas and
Florida is not a bad thing.  I was pretty astounded at the way my
rates jumped when I moved here.  Perhaps there's something else at
work in New Jersey.  Check the rates in all the other states with
no-fault before you assume it is a bad thing.

It would also be interesting to see what rates are like in Louisiana,
where damages tend to be limited to what you can prove (i.e., no pain
and suffering).

Interesting, if true.  Can you provide more details?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which special interest do you support?

Trial Lawyers:  YES on 100; NO on 101, 104, and 106
Insurance Companies:  YES on 101, 104, and 106; NO on 100 and 103
Ralph Nader (who doesn't know how to drive a car):
        YES on 103; NO on all others

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some definitions:

"Californians for Insurance Reform" == California Trial Lawyers Association
"Citizens for No-Fault" == Insurance Companies
"Voter Revolt" == Nader backed group

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What if >1 pass?  They go in precedence order based on number of YES votes:
the one with the largest number of YESes get implemented in full, while
others' conflicting parts are removed.  Below are conflicts:

100 prohibits no-fault insurance, cancelling 104, and prohibits regulation
of attorneys' fees, cancelling 106 (if 100 gets more votes than 104 and/or
106)

104 has a special clause that cancels any other initiative that passes with
fewer votes

Recent polls indicate that only 103 is winning.

This seems like the perfect newsgroup, but no one seems to have brought
it up yet, so here I go....

There are currently 5 insurance initiatives on the ballot this November.
I'd like to ask people's opinions on them.

Personally, I'm against 100, 101, and 103 and for 104 and 106.  This is
because I feel that only 104 can undo the gigantic mess that California
has gotten itself into with respect to auto insurance.  A good strong
No-Fault will stop insurance fraud, among other things, and stop what
are now necessary court cases to get payment for injuries.

Now I'm not saying that No-Fault solves everything.  I'd still like to
see my rates go down, but I believe that if the insurance companies can
begin to get positive returns on the proposition, that they may pass it
on to us drivers.

Additionally, 104 and 106 limit attorney's fees.  Statistics can always
lie, but here's a statistic anyway: Of every $1 paid on an insurance
settlement, anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 goes to the lawyer.  Does something
seem wrong here?

At first glimpse, 100, 101, and 103 look like just what we need.  Lower
rates for good drivers; freezes on insurance rates; etc.  But, what
happens after that?  What will happen to the rates?  I think they'll
skyrocket.  Consider: for two years, the insurance companies have less
and less revenue and more and more expense (more court cases).  Now,
all of a sudden, they can set their own rates again.  Do you think its
normal for them to try to recoup their losses?

I have a special beef with 103.  Drunk drivers are allowed to get "good
driver" insurance rates.  This is something we want to do?


I've rambled enough for now.

A follow worker here recently came back from traffic school. During
the first night they were told that in California, it is illegal to
clock a car by using a "timing device" to clock between to fixed marks
or objects on the ground. When I went to traffic school 7 months ago I
recall being told the same thing. The following question came up in 
recent discussion:

"So how do air patrols determine the speed of a car from a plane?"

Obviously from that angle, radar is inaccurate and can't be used. It
also can't be focused on such a small object at that distance. (I checked
a few of these facts, thank you!)
As above, they cant clock you between "mile markers" with a "timing device"
as Ca. law says that is illegal"
One suggestion was that they line the plane wing up with your bumper and
pace you (like ground patrols do) and then convert air speed to MPH on the
ground. But what about winds? What about strange angles? How could this
EVEN work?

In rec.aviation, the following was posted:

Ok, so now I'm really confused! If its illegal, how come they are allowed to do
it that way? Does this mean if you get an aerial citation you can fight it
on the DMV laws of no timing devices to fixed objects? Does the CHP AIR UNIT
have "special permission"?

Any CHP officers tuned in that want to fess up?

Its not that simple. you have to look at each state seperatly and see WHAT
kind of No-Fault law they had. I understand CA's is not like NJ's at all.

I'll remind you that I was VERY much against 104 for similar reasons
stated above THEN I got a copy of the law. Granted its not perfect
but its better than the current law. In CA, no fault applies ONLY to
loss of wages, out of pocket expenses, and medical costs UNDER $25,000
Collision laws DO NOT CHANGE. Big money damages DO NOT CHANGE! The idea
is simply to stop claims on amounts under 25K (for the items listed)
having to be setteled by a law suit (the only way you can claim those
costs today). Under today's law you must sue the other person for the
loss. Typically, a $15K loss would end up as a 50 to 100K law suit which,
if the person being sued looses, their insurance company HAS to pay. The
person with the loss will get their $15K, and guess who gets the rest!!!!
The new law would simply have your insurance company pay this amount NOW.
Sunbragation (spelling?) laws STILL apply and your insurance company can
still claim against the "at fault" party and recover its losses. That does
NOT change. Their is a clause that prevents the insurance company from
increasing your rate due to a no-fault claim. Police reports should still be
filled out and a "at fault" party is still determined for ALL other damages.

In a nutshell, now you know!

The American Society for Industrial Security is holding its annual seminar and
exhibition in Boston at the moment.  There were nearly 3000 registered
attendees, not including over 350 companies with product or service exhibits.

The luncheon speech on 27 Sept was by Arthur Miller, Professor of Law at
Harvard University, renowned author on court procedures and legal expert
appearing on TV programs such as "Good Morning America." He is author of "The
Assault on Privacy: Computers, Data Banks and Dossiers" which is considered
"must" reading on the issue.

Let me pass on a few of his remarks which were addressed to the thousands of
security professionals from all over the country. It was shrill, but compelling.
(Consider that MOST of the listeners know nothing about computers.)

state of Massachusetts, this is the same number as that used for Social

Unless things have changed in the past few years... 

UV erasable EPROM's only stay programmed for a few years (~7).  These
chips bury a charge inside of an insulating layer.  UV exposure causes
the charge to be erased, so does the passage of time.

I wonder how many computerized boxes out there are carry their programs
in EPROM?   Sounds like a ticking time bomb to me.

Is this *permanent*?  I read only a month ago in SCIENCE (or NATURE?)
that they were still expecting to get results next year.

SLAC itself is not in trouble so much as the redesign for making it a
Z factory.  Of course, there could be repercussions.

Also, because they were in a hurry to beat CERN with the first Z factory,
they used the cheapest parts they could find.  They are paying for this now.

One good consequence is that SLAC has proven that the basic design for
using linacs to mass produce Zs is sound.  Nothing like it had been
tried before.  I vaguely recall reading somewhere that inspired by
SLAC's "success", in West Germany there are plans to build a similar
linac-based Z factory.

It is possible that, at some point in the distribution, someone illegally
obtained a tape of names, addresses and other information from some
government database.

I've seen a similar situation when I was in school at the University of
Massachusetts.  I received a mailing from a life insurance company which
was addressed to "The parents of Greg Pflaum".  Because UMass did not
have my parents' address, I often got mail from the school with that
address.  Checking around, I found that those friends who also received
UMass's "To the parents of" mail had also received the insurance
solicitation.  I didn't check with any parents, but clearly at least
some group of parents also got it.

At the office that produces the university magazine (Contact) that is
sent to all parents I learned that mailing labels were ordered from a
central office which did the database selection and printing.  That
was as far as I got.  They said the school did not sell mailing lists,
and refused to believe there was any connection between the insurance
mailing and the UMass database.  "Maybe someone went through the
phone book," they suggested.  Sheesh.

A student who did programming for the school suggested the most likely answer:
a programmer or operator made a few bucks on the side.

            Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility
                            Annual Meeting
               November 19 and 20 at Stanford University


A collection of nationally known authors, scientists, and innovators in the
computer science field will address the issues of computers and their impact on
the arms race, the workplace, education, and society at the l988 Annual Meeting
of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), to be held November
19 and 20, l988, in Cubberley Auditorium at Stanford University.

Two sessions that already are generating a great deal of interest will draw
together experts from a wide variety of fields to comment on developments in
technology that could affect the general population.

The first, Privacy, Computers, and the Law, deals with the FBI's plans to
upgrade its already massive criminal justice database so that it can better
identify individuals. The current system now contains over l9 million records
and is accessed up to half a million times per day.  Would an improved version
threaten the privacy and liberties of citizens?  Discussing the issues from a
variety of perspectives will be: William A. Bayse, FBI assistant director for
technical services;  Congressman Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights;  Jerry Berman, chief
legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the
ACLU Privacy and Technology Project; and Peter Neumann, SRI International and
CPSR/Palo Alto. 

The second panel will debate the impact of the personal computer of the future
as presented in Apple Computer's video story, "Knowledge Navigator." The
speculative Knowledge Navigator is a flat, notebook-sized computer that can
speak with the user, explore databases on its own,  do simulations, and display
a picturephone and graphics, all by voice command.  Addressing the social
assumptions and implications of this possible technology will be:  Larry
Tesler, vice president of Advanced Technology, Apple Computer; Esther Dyson,
editor and publisher of Release 1.0 newsletter; Fernando Flores, chairman of
Action Technologies and co-author of Understanding Computers and Cognition;
Peter Lyman, director of educational computing, University of Southern
California; Theodore Roszak, professor of sociology, California State
University at Hayward and author of The Cult of Information.

Speaking on the topic Technical Challenges in Arms Control in the Next 15 Years
is Sidney Drell.  Dr. Drell serves as co-director of the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms Control and deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center.  He also is past president of the American Physical
Society and author of Facing the Threat of Nuclear Weapons.  

Technology, Work, and Authority in the Information Age:  The Role of the
Computer Professional  will address the opportunities and problems of computers
in the workplace.  By the end of the century, approximately two-thirds of all
workers will use a computer terminal .  Will that computer enhance their skills
or assist management in controlling workers?  Speaker Robert Howard, author of
the book Brave New Workplace  and senior editor of Technology Review  will
focus on what role computer designers can do to create socially responsible
products.  

Women learn how to use computers differently than men, says speaker Deborah
Brecher, founder and executive director of the Women's Computer Literacy
Program in San Francisco.  Women and Computers: Does Gender Matter?  will cover
what programmers, educators and employers need to know about computer learning
and the sexes.

Computer pioneer Jim Warren will  deliver the keynote speech  at CPSR's Annual
Banquet to be held at Ming's Villa in Palo Alto.  Mr. Warren founded The
Intelligent Machines Journal  which .later  became InfoWorld.   He also started
the West Coast Computer Faire, the pre-eminent show for personal computer users
and hobbyists, was the founding director of the first personal computer
software magazine, Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics and Orthodontia.
He later served as the original host of the PBS series, "Computer Chronicles,"
and was awarded the first Sybex Computer Pioneer Award which recognizes
innovators in the microcomputer field. In the academic arena, Mr. Warren has
taught computer science at  San Francisco State, San Jose State and Stanford
University.  Mr. Warren's speech, Computers, Information, and Politics, will
focus on how citizens can gain access to computerized information on
individuals, corporations, and the government, and how they can use that
information to bring about effective political action, locally or globally. 

During the banquet, the CPSR Board of Directors will present the Norbert Wiener
Award for Professional and Social Responsibility to Joseph Weizenbaum,
professor of computer science (emeritus) at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

Sessions on Sunday, November 20, will be devoted to the organization and future
direction of the association.  Speakers include:  Terry Winograd, associate
professor of computer science at Stanford University and co-author of
Understanding Computers and Cognition,;  grassroots organizer and trainer John
Spearman, senior contract administrator for The Doctor's Council in New York
City;  Steve Zilles, chairman of the board of directors, CPSR;  and Gary
Chapman, executive director of CPSR and co-editor of Computers in Battle. 

Registration fees for the meeting are as follows:  $10/members; $20/nonmembers
before November 9;  $20/members, $30/nonmembers after November 9.  The banquet
is $30/members, $35/nonmembers.  Reservations are on a first-come, first-served
basis. Please call (415) 322-3778 for registration material.

I had a problem with California Casualty and got onboard with 20th Century,
a company that claims to turn down 2 of every 3 applicants (stringent
standards to protect its policyholders from paying for bad risks).  I've
never had an accident or ticket; I've never made a claim; I have a 1982
Plymouth L-car.  

My 6-month renewal came up last month.  20th Century raised my rates at an
effective annual rate of 37% and included a letter "explaining" the
increases, along with a subtle (they thought) pitch urging me to support
some kind of consumer or legislative no-fault approach to get my rates back
down.  I wrote back, using the numbers they cited, and showing how they were
gouging me by their own figures.  They wrote back with a direct
campaign-oriented "vote for 104" flyer, ignoring my specifics.  

If 104 passes, I'm sure they can lower their rates a bit -- after all, they
just came up with an unjustified big increase!  Prop 103 scares them mostly
because it introduces accountability and control of insurance businesses by
the people -- the insured -- instead of by the insurance industry itself.

And, incredibly, they whined that their profit was "only 7.5%" and had to
absorb some losses from that figure.  I wrote back asking "7.5% of WHAT?"
but they didn't see fit to answer.  If it had been 7.5% of my income, or
even 37% of my income, it wouldn't be much, of course.  But it's really 7.5%
of their share of the investment profits from the multi-billion dollar pool
that insurers are required to keep on hand (equal to number of insured times
the average claim-per-insured), a tidy figure, indeed.

Of course someone's considered stall speeds.  Who would waste net
bandwidth with idle speculation and misinformation?

The CHP uses two aircraft types for most of its observations.  The most common
is the Cessna 185, with modifications that allow it to fly comfortably at
50 mph or less.  They also have one or two Maules, special-purpose 
STOL planes that can mush along in the thirty-five-mile-an-hour range.

The CHP seems to have the legality of aircraft pacing pretty well
established.  I have neither a convertible nor a sunroof, and I
can't think of any defense more sophisticated than a long-necked
passenger.

I was in the Sunnyvale Patent Library this week and looked up recent
patents issued in general purpose computers (class 364, subclass 200).
Unfortunately the library stopped sorting their patents by topic,
starting Jan 1988, so I have no data from after then.

Transputer		4,704,678	3 Nov 87	Inmos
	"Function Set for a Microcomputer", Michael D. May

Motorola DSP?		4,709,324	24 Nov 87	Motorola
	"Data Processor Control Unit Having an Interrupt Service using
	 Instruction Prefetch Redirection", Kevin L. Kloker

	This describes how to get low-latency interrupts in a pipelined
	machine, without losing cycles, by "instruction jamming" a couple
	of instructions into the prefetch stream when an interrupt occurs,
	without flushing the pipeline or changing the program counter.
	This makes things like CPU-mediated DMA work great, since an
	interrupt can take e.g. 1 cycle total.

Connection Machine	4,709,327	24 Nov 87	(individuals)
	"Parallel Processor / Memory Circuit", W. Daniel Hillis et al.

	This looks like the meat of the connection machine design.
	It probably has lots of stuff that up til the patent was considered
	proprietary.  Have at it!

MC68010 or 20		4,710,866	1 Dec 87	Motorola
	"Method and Apparatus for Validating Prefetched Instruction",
	John Zolnowski, Les Crudele, Michael E. Spak

	This is how they cope with page faults on prefetched instructions.
	The 680xx avoids a bus error on prefetch unless you actually use
	the instruction.  They also seem to avoid starting to execute an
	instruction until the whole thing has been prefetched.

Spectrum?		4,713,755	15 Dec 87	HP
	"Cache Memory Consistency Control with Explicit Software Instructions",
	W. S. Worley, Jr, Wm. Bryg, Allen Baum

XT/370			4,714,993	22 Dec 87	IBM
	"Apparatus and Method for Effecting Dynamic Address Translation
	 in a Microprocessor Implemented Data Processing System", David L.
	Livingston, Daniel J. Sucher, Brue M. Walk.

	This one describes the DAT implementation on the IBM XT/370,
	a "370 on an IBM PC card".  The XT/370 is implemented with a
	remicrocoded 68000, remicrocoded float chip, and a regular 68000
	to handle odd instructions and talking to the IBM PC.  This
	patent includes a COMPLETE SOURCE CODE listing for the prom
	code the support 68000 runs in assisting the emulation.

  In article <5511@hoptoad.uucp> John Gilmore (gnu@hoptoad.uucp) writes
about some of the interesting U.S. patents that were granted in 1987.
Some of the patents were very fundamental in nature, addressing points
such as ``how to reduce interrupt latency to 1 cycle'' (Motorola, patent
4,709,324, 24 Nov 87).

  Not being a lawyer, I don't understand what the exact limits of patents
are, but I would guess that if one were to want to incorporate some of
these ideas into a new processor design, you'd have to negotiate a
contract with the patent holder and then pay royalties.  On the surface I
suppose this sounds great, and justly paying others for their creative
work, but it strikes me that we're at a point now where there are a hell
of a lot of good ideas out there (most of which are patented by IBM or
soon will be) and one would be forced to negotiate separate contracts for
each one that you chose to use in your processor (for example).

  Moreover, if a patent holder decided not to allow others to use their
technology, that would give them a strangle hold on a possibly
fundamental idea forcing all others to use a substandard approach.
(Again, not being a lawyer, I don't know whether the anti-trust laws
would apply in this case).

  For example (and I should point out that I don't know about the factual
nature of this, but it still makes a good example), I once heard that DEC
patented the idea of using a general register for the CPU's Program
Counter.  This allowed them to design a very clean orthogonal instruction
set without special purpose instructions to access PC relative
quantities.  I heard further that they refused to license that
``technology'' out to any third parties and as a result all other CPU's
are forced to have the PC set aside as a special register, not accessible
in the same way as their general registers, etc.  As I said, I'm not sure
of the factual nature of this story, so I apologise in advance for any
mis-information.

  But the story demonstrates the point I'm trying to make, which is in
fact simply a question:

	Do patents stifle progress?

  This is not at all a clear question for me.  I won't jump on the Richard
Stallman bandwagon, but on the other hand, I also won't jump on the (pick
your favorite patent pusher) Bandwagon.  My feelings are very ambivalent
about this.  On the one hand I do believe that people should be paid for
their creativity, but on the other, I don't want to see progress stifled
by a greedy individual.

  Note that since corporations are considered to be people, the above is
intended to cover them.  And that brings up yet one more card in the
question game: many patents are granted to corporations for the work of
individuals employeed by the corporations.  Does the fact that someone is
employeed by a corporation justify the corporation claiming all creative
work of the individual?  Certainly I'm less worried about my feeling that
individuals should be paid for their creative work if in fact the
individual at hand is merely a corporation that has completely usurped a
person's creative work ...

  In any case, this is hardly a question for comp.arch, but since it was
inspired by a comp.arch article and since I can't figure out what the
legal questions group is, I'm posting it here ...  Feel free to flame me,
but I do feel it's an important topic and am personally concerned with
the computer technology aspects of the question.

  I have been following the discussion of the auto insurance initiatives for
quite some time now.  I have read the discussion here on the net as well as
listen to a roundtable on NPR where each of the different groups got a chance
to give reason to vote for their initiative.  I also have read the stories on 
the issue in the San Jose Mercury news.  The sources that I have completly
ignored is Television and Advertising.

  A little history on the initiatives.  There weren't going to be any of the
initiatives on the ballot.  The trial lawyer and insurance lobby had a packaged
bill and actually got it passsed and it would have become the law for California.
This process somehow broke down, I think that Ralph Nader and the consumer groups
began to cry fowl after they saw that the legistors were only responding to their
big buck contibutors, (trial lawyers and insurance lobby) and this caused the bill 
to removed by the Senate?  
  
  Then the trial lawyers filed their initiative prop 100, which bans no-fault and
mandates lower insurance rates, but I don't belive it will lower rates.  The 
insurance companies who make their living in this mess, were not to be out done
they saw this as there chance to completely rewrite ALL the laws which govern the
auto insurance industry.  They sat down with their lawyers and wrote as massive
initiative which is basically their idea on what the law should be.   I find this
to be dangerous, it would be like letting the Phone Company (substitute your
favourite monopoly) rewrite all laws regarding what services and who get service,
etc, etc...  Of course they laws that they would write would be one sided and
would do things like ban other companies from competing with them, limit damage
awards and protect the insurance companies from any possible liabilities.

  On the NPR roundtable the clear winner was the Consumer Revolt bill prop 103.
They pointed out many of the flaws with the no-fault initiative and asked the
question, "Why should we trust you?".  I didn't hear any real response, besides
"well, we know what's best because we are the industry".  So I am going to
support Prop 103 as it is the best initiative and it is the only one which allows
the consumer to sponsor an independant insurance commisioner that will represent
their interests.

  I also think that the trial lawyers are getting too large a share of the settlements
and I am also supporting prop 106.  which limits the share of the pie going to
lawyers to 25% or less.  The insurance lobby also supports this bill.  I support it
because it is a simple bill, it deals will one issue and one issue only.  I could
also support a no-fault initiative, but it would have to be a single issue
initiative, not like prop 104. which is an insurance co. wish list of new laws.

  So, In summary:

   YES on 103,  YES on 106,  NO on all others.

Yes and no. The theory behind patents is that you have to disclose your
invention, but then you get exclusive rights to it for 17 years. After that,
anybody can use it. This gets inventions disclosed rather than being held
forever as trade secrets, so further work can be built upon them. Patent
protection is much stronger than copyright or trade secret, because nobody can
use your patent without your permission even if he reinvents your thing
completely independently. (Comments in the trade press suggest that a lot of
people in the computer industry who should know better seem to think that
independent reinvention is a defense, which should give rise to some
interesting lawsuits.)

Admittedly, the patent office and the related courts work at a pace better
suited to the technical climate of the 1780s than to the 1980s, so that
in many cases by the time a patent is granted it seems obsolete.  On the
other hand, lots of patents work the way they're supposed to -- the entire
computer industry in the 1950s was built on (and paid license fees under)
the technology in the Eniac patents.

Concerning the notion of a privileged jump table:

Note that the DEC KL-10 (a.k.a. "late-model" PDP-10) had just such a
"protected jump" instruction, used for allowing users to attach to and
jump to execute-only segments of proprietary code only at defined places.
There was a particular jump instruction ("JRST") that had an otherwise
unused bit in it. If an attempt was made to jump or call a protected
segment, the access was allowed iff the target of the jump/call was
a "JRST magic_bit, some_address". These instructions were called "portals",
and in fact the assembler opcode "PORTAL" expanded into the "JRST magic_bit,".
Such private segments often had a table of PORTAL instructions at the beginning,
so that calling table+offset was a call to some function.

Unfortunately (if my vague recollection is correct), the magic bit in
question was used for something in kernel mode, so this method was not
useful for changing between user and kernel states, only for unprotected-user
to proprietary-execute-only-user transitions. (*sigh*)

[Followed by a bunch more stuff about how yu can't predict
the instruction stream]

There are a couple of ways people have proposed doing lazy saving:

o	Katenevis (or somebody working with him) proposed trying to
	save register windows during unused memory cycles. They did
	some analysis and concluded that there were not enough unused
	cycles. Part of the problem here might have been that they needed
	to save the whole window before any of it was usable.

o	When you start a new register window, flag all of the registers
	as 'clean'. Whenever you update one, flag it as dirty. Now,
	when it comes time to reuse a register window, whenever the
	processor tries to update a previously dirty register, copy it
	somewhere and try to save it during an otherwise unused memory
	cycle.

	On return, flag registers which have lost their values as 'empty'
	(or something). When the processor tries to refer to an empty
	register, the value is reloaded.

	This is really lazy. You only save/restore registers when you need to.

None of these schemes imply knowing the instruction stream in advance.
I guess the point that (unnamed) missed was that (other unnamed) assumed
that the hardware was managing the lazy loads/stores, not the compiler.

Of course, these schemes produce more complicated silicon than burst
read/write schemes. In particular, anything with flags/register
introduces latency into the register read/write path which is the
critical path unless you have blown everything.

Is it a win? simulate and see. Tell the world.

By the way:
	There is a paper:
		"Register Windows Vs. General Registers: A Comparison of
		Memory Access Patterns" by Scott Morrison and Nancy Walker
		of UC Berkeley.

	Which shows that the MIPS R2000 (aside from running faster) achieves

This says fewer overall memory references, but what is missing here is
the ratio of loads and stores to the rest of the instruction mix.  I
wouldn't be surprised if it is just that the Sun compiler is not doing
as good a job in general, and so the total number of instructions
(including loads and stores) increased with respect to the MIPS
compiler.  However, the number of loads and stores as a percentage of
the instruction mix might be lower.

Well, I don't know what SUN seems to be doing wrong, but let's try this:
bsd 4.3 nroff with the 4.3 libraries running

	nroff /usr/doc/misc/sysperf/2.t	[a 10655 byte file]

results in:

---------- Pipeline ----------
 32.63% idle pipeline:
	 18.39% Instruction Fetch Wait
	 11.44% Data Transaction Wait
	  0.69% Page Boundary Crossing Fetch Wait
	  0.01% Unfilled Cache Fetch Wait
	  0.00% Load/Store Multiple Executing	<-- Hmm, not much time here!
	  2.07% Load/Load Transaction Wait

Inst Bus Utilization:	 63.97%
	 8669133 Instruction Fetches

Data Bus Utilization:	  9.75%
	  979830 Loads
	  340998 Stores

---------- Instruction Mix ----------
	  1.86% Calls
	 15.65% Jumps
	 10.73% Loads
	  3.74% Stores
	  4.33% No-ops

---------- Register File Spilling/Filling ----------
	       3 Spills				<-- this is why
	       0 Fills

Spill/Fill sizes:
   1 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   2 registers:         1 time(s) ( 33.33%)
   3 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   4 registers:         1 time(s) ( 33.33%)
   5 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   6 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   7 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   8 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
   9 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  10 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  11 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  12 registers:         1 time(s) ( 33.33%)
  13 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  14 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  15 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
  16 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)
> 16 registers:         0 time(s) (  0.00%)

So for the entire nroff run, we wrote a total of 18 words out to memory
due to stack cache overflow.  And we loaded 0 words from the stack due
to underflow (this is because nroff exits() while it is still a few
procedures down in the overall call chain).

I would be interested in seeing how this compares to a
non-register-windowed processor, in particular the total number of
loads/stores, the loads/stores as a percentage of instruction mix, and
the number of words of scalar data transfered to/from the stack.

Mike, it certainly sounds like there's some confusion here.

At the worst, the DWBUA can "hog" half the VAXBI bandwidth.  While this
may slow down some of the other VAXBI devices somewhat, it certainly does
not slow them down to UNIBUS speeds.  Note, by the way, that few of the
devices typically configured on the VAXBI can even begin to consume all
of the bandwidth available.  So even only half the bandwidth is usually
more than sufficient for most applications.  Your requirements may vary.

If you don't want to learn about VAXBI arbitration, the DWBUA, and why the
DWBUA can't slow everything else down to UNIBUS speeds, skip this message.

Due to the timing and throughput requirements of the Unibus, the DWBUA was
designed to be able to get a lot of throughput on the VAX BI.  The way it
can do this is designed into the VAX BI, as part of the arbitration logic.
This is all described in reasonable detail in the "VAXBI Technical Summary",
a small booklet published back in 1985, which has part number EB-28190-46.

Basically, the way arbitration works on the VAXBI is as follows (I'm going
to quote, verbatim, from the book) [comments in brackets]:

Arbitration logic is distributed among all VAXBI nodes.  No processor is
dedicated specifically to controlling bus use.  [This differs from, e.g.,
the Unibus.  It's possible because the BIIC has lots of smarts.]

When the VAXBI bus is idle, every node can arbitrate.  The one with the
highest priority wins the bus.  It then sends command/address information
to initiate a VAXBI transaction.  [This applies to EVERY node, including
the DWBUA.]

During an ongoing VAXBI transaction, all nodes except the bus master can
arbitrate in the interval between the command/address cycle and the ensuing
data transfer cycles.  This interval is called the imbedded arbitration
cycle.  Again the node [other than the current bus master] with the highest
priority wins the bus.  It becomes `pending' bus master and initiates its
own command/address cycle as soon as the last data transfer of the current
transaction is complete.

Priority is determined by one of three arbitration modes set by a two-bit
field within the VAXBI Control and Status Register.  These are dual round
robin, fixed-high priority, and fixed-low priority.  While any combination
of arbitration modes can coexist among VAXBI nodes, dual round robin is
the preferred mode because it allows nearly equal access to the bus for
all nodes.  [There's actually a fourth mode, which is "don't arbitrate",
but it's typically used only when a node is shutting down.  And, of course,
a node only requests the bus when it needs it.]

[End of quoted material]

The same information is included in the "VAXBI Options Handbook", printed
in 1986, part number EB-27271-46.  That handbook also includes information
on the DWBUA (quoted verbatim) [comments in brackets]:

The VAXBI-to-UNIBUS adapter, DWBUA, transfers data between the high-speed
synchronous VAXBI bus and the asynchronous UNIBUS.  It allows VAXBI processors
to access any UNIBUS address, and UNIBUS devices to access any VAXBI address.
[As it happens, the mapping from UNIBUS addresses to VAXBI addresses is
usually managed by a VAXBI processor, such as a VAX running VMS or ULTRIX, 
rather than by a UNIBUS processor.]

The DWBUA routes transactions over two kinds of paths -- direct or buffered.
VAXBI-initiated transactions use only the direct data path.  UNIBUS-initiated
transactions use either a direct data path or one of the DWBUA's five buffered
paths.  On the direct data path, the DWBUA transfers longwords (four bytes).
Over a buffered data path, the DWBUA uses the VAXBI bandwidth most efficiently
by internally buffering as much as one octaword (16 bytes).  The DWBUA's
maximum data transfer rate is approximately 1.0 Mbyte per second.

Besides transferring data, the DWBUA acts as arbitrator for the UNIBUS.  It
lets UNIBUS devices send interrupts over the VAXBI bus.  Unlike other VAXBI
options, the DWBUA normally arbitrates in fixed-high priority mode rather
than [dual] round-robin mode.

[End of quoted material]

Now, how does dual-round robin work, vs. fixed-high or fixed-low priority?
Basically, "next master" is determined by looking at a data word that is
passed on the VAXBI bus during the "arbitration cycle".  There are 32 data
bits and 16 possible nodes.  Each node has a "low-priority" data bit and
a "high-priority" data bit.  The "node ID" is a number from 0 to 15 that
is provided by the ID plugs on the VAXBI backplane; obviously, the IDs have
to be unique (only one node "0", one "1", and so forth).  By convention,
the lower numbers have higher priority.  During the arbitration cycle, each
node can either assert its high-priority bit, its low-priority bit, or not
bid for being master by asserting neither bit.  

If a node is operating with fixed-high priority, it always asserts its high-
priority bit, or none at all if it doesn't need the bus.  If it's operating
in fixed-low priority mode, it either asserts its low-priority bit or none.

Dual round robin is a bit more complicated.  It comes into play once a node
has become bus master.  The master transmits a command/address, and the
other nodes require some time to decode the address.  During this time,
the other nodes can also bid for being "next master", but the current master
can't bid (and hence can't hog the bus).  During this "imbedded arbitration 
cycle", the master puts its node ID on certain of the BI data lines, and
the other nodes can use this information to decide whether (assuming they
need the bus) they should bid in the "high-priority" or "low-priority" word.
A node with higher priority than the current master (that is, with a lower
node ID) will bid in the low-priority word, and a node with lower priority
(that is, with a higher node ID) will bid in the high-priority word.  If
all the nodes are operating in dual round robin mode, then over time, each
node has an equal probability of getting access to the bus.

There's some other rules that come into play:  fixed-high and fixed-low
priority are reserved for Digital (customer device adaptors should always
use dual round robin), and some devices may require that they be at lower
node IDs (higher device priority) than others.

The DWBUA operates in fixed-high priority mode, and it must always be node
ID "0" when it is present.  (Thus, you can have at most one DWBUA on any
VAXBI.)  To the best of my knowledge, it is the ONLY adapter that works
in fixed-high priority mode.

Consequently, the DWBUA always bids in the high-priority word when it wants
the VAXBI bus for a data transfer, and since it is always the lowest node
ID on the bus, it always gets to be the next bus master.  HOWEVER, once
it is bus master, it MUST relinquish the bus to another node if any other
node wants it, and the other nodes will all arbitrate in the high-priority
word if they're in dual round robin mode (since they all have a lower node
ID than the DWBUA), so the highest priority node among them will get the
bus next.  Whenever the DWBUA doesn't need the bus (that is, whenever the
UNIBUS devices are idle), the other VAXBI nodes operate essentially as if
it weren't there.

So, the DWBUA can't slow everything down to UNIBUS speeds.  At worst, it
can get one half of the available data cycles, and it does as much as it
can to optimize its use of the cycles it does get.  Since for most uses,
the VAXBI has more available bandwidth than is needed, sharing the VAXBI
with other BI adapters is not a problem.  People who prefer both a belt
and suspenders may, of course, choose to dedicate a BI to the DWBUA, but
this is typically not necessary.

Sources say: A Girl's Guide To Condoms
        -- by Mimi Coucher
 
WARNING: Boys cannot read this.  If you are a boy and are reading this, stop
immediately.  The following article is chock-full of highly intimate girl
secrets that will be 10 times more embarrassing than any TV commercial for
feminine-hygiene products you've ever seen.  So quit it.  I mean it.  You'll
be sorry.
                             ===============
                             
Condoms Demystified
 
There are basically three kinds of condoms: unlubricated latex, lubricated
latex, and lambskin.  The lambskins are no good because they haven't been
proven to be a barrier to infection.  Anyway, they're really made of lambies
and that makes us sad, especially around Easter time.  (The real reason we
don't like them is that they actually smell like lamb.  One is tempted to
lubricate them with mint jelly.)
 
There are variations on the basic latex condoms.  Some condoms are
prelubricated, with spermicidal jelly, even.  Others are not.  Strictly
B.Y.O.K.Y.
 
The strangest variation by far is the ribbed latex condom.  Why are these
condoms ribbed?  This is supposed to be stimulating?  Should one attempt to
play washboard tunes on it?  This is just part of a big problem with
condoms.  Condoms were, and are, designed by men.
 
If Girls Designed Condoms...
 
What a wonderful world it would be.  Skip the ribbing, skip the lube.  If
women designed condoms there is no question that they would be padded.
 
"But size doesn't matter!" comes a chorus of voices.  (The loudest voices
come from boys who are peeking.  Stop that right now.  Turn to the sports
page immediately.)  Sure *length* doesn't matter.  But give any girl a small
dose of truth serum and ask her about width.
 
Admit it.  If padded condoms were placed on the market, hordes of screaming
women would storm their local druggists and dash out with tote bags full.
Unfortunately, it wouldn't work.  After all, there is that ticklish issue of
boy sensitivity, which we can't overlook, even if we occasionally want to.
Padded condoms would rob boys of the skin-to-skin senstion they already
claim condoms rob them of.  And we can't have that.
 
No, we modern women, being kind and sensitive lovers, would design
whisper-soft condoms, completely transparent and microscopically thin.  The
paisley, rainbow, and floral-print condoms we designed would be strictly
novelty items, kept for special occasions only.  Ditto the condoms with cute
sayings: "Hang in there, baby, Friday's coming"; "My girlfriend went to
Florida and all I got was this lousy condom"; and the classic "I'm with
stupid" (arrow pointing back toward the boy).  Other specialty items would
include the male-ego condom, which, like black olives, come in three
sizes:jumbo, colossal, and humongous.  Naughty subversives would enjoy the
Karen Finley assortment, colorful, decorative condoms that turn ordinary
penises into bananas, hotdogs, yams, and more.
 
But I digress.  The best place to buy condoms is your local massive
drugstore that has them on display, self-serve, just like corn pads or
athlete's foot spray.
 
So go shopping.  Dress cool, hold your head high, read labels, make your
selection.  Be assured that most popular brands come with little instruction
booklets much like the ones found in boxes of Tampax (uh oh --don't mix them
up!).  While at the drugstore, be sure to purchase at least one of the
following items: Tickle anti-perspirant, Ban Roll-on, or any of the Calvin
Klein line of men's grooming aids.  You'll need these for important condom
experiments at home.
 
At home, be alone.  Light candles.  Play inspiring music; any record by Rick
James will do.  Remove one of the condoms from its packet.  Examine it
carefully.  Then put it to work.  Experiment with your slippery new friends;
whip those sons-of-gummi-worms into shape.  Recruit those deodorant bottles
and practice, practice, practice.
 
And how about some new nicknames for the old standbys?  Love skins.  Slicks.
Wet suits.  Silk stockings.  Eight-by-two glossies.
 
Soon enough, you'll be happy and relaxed, perfectly in control of those
silly little slips o' sin.  But wait.  Something's missing.  Oh yes, the
hard part.  I mean the good part.  I mean, both.
 
The Condomed Man
 
It is far, far easier to start them on condoms when the relationship is
young.  In fact, the condom is a terrific tool of seduction when you're
ready to make the leap between the sheets.  Call that someone on the phone
and say to him, casual-like, "I just bought a new kind of condom and I'm
dying to try it out... want to come over?"  Or when out on the town with
your paramour, and the clock on the clubhouse wall says thump thump thump,
push that hunk against the wall and growl, "Listen, buddy.  I've got a
condom in my pocket and I'm not afraid to use it.  We're going home."
 
Welcome To The Safety Patrol
 
Before you know it, you'll be a veritable connoisseur of condoms. You'll
allow them to drop casually out of your purse in front of attractive men at
cocktail parties.  You'll dispense them to friends, give lessons, perhaps
even roll your own.  "Oh, handsome boyfriend," you'll soon sigh, "I've
always wanted to see you in rubber."
 
And he won't mind one bit.

			Presentations on Current Films
			     (seen at Nolacon II)
		       Film comments by Mark R. Leeper

     One of the long-standing traditions of worldcons is the presentation of
upcoming film and television releases.  The tradition started with the 1976
Kansas City Worldcon (MidAmericon).  There one filmmaker, a George Lucas
famous for having made a successful rock-and-roll film, brought a low-budget
science fiction film he was working on.  It was a genuine mess.  Some of us
took the representative aside and told him what we'd really like to see.
Luckily it was not too late for them to incorporate our suggestions and the
result was a heck of a good film.

     If you believe that one....

     In any case, I cannot remember a worldcon in the last twelve years that
has such a set of losers coming up.  I have a positive expectation for only
two of dozens of films coming up.  Best looking is ALIEN NATION.  The
trailers have already started showing for this one in the theaters.  The
idea is that some time in the not-too-distant future aliens arrive in large
numbers and set up their own ghettos in Los Angeles (right on the outskirts
of Toontown?).  They look human except where you and I have hair on our
heads, their heads look like brown watermelons.  Hey, don't laugh.  There
are people in my family who look like that!

     Anyhow, the aliens become a protected minority affirmative action group
presumably because they have a long history of being persecuted and
discriminated against unlike, say, the Jews.  James Caan plays a Los Angeles
cop.  His partner is played by Mandy Patinkin, who usually plays a Jew but
in this film he plays either one of the aliens or a Jew disguised as one of
the aliens so that some Jew finally gets some benefit from affirmative
action.

     ALIEN NATION (formerly OUTER HEAT but there were too many "Heat" films
already) has the look of an expensive film.  The mystery aspects are
reminiscent of SOYLENT GREEN, but the look of the film is crisper -- perhaps
even like BLADERUNNER.  Of course, at this point any decent-looking film
that is neither a sequel nor a remake is promising.

     A little less promising is the new BATMAN film.  I will give you the
bad news first.  The studio has signed a big star for the title role.  Now
let's try a little experiment.  Picture who you think would be a good
Batman.  Anybody picture Beetlejuice?  How about the gum-chewing geek from
NIGHT SHIFT?  Nobody?  I guess you just don't have what it takes to be a
Hollywood executive.  Yes, it's smash comedy star Michael Keaton who is
going to play Bruce Wayne.  But, I hear you ask, isn't he a little ... uh
... small to play Batman?  Well, he has been working out and of course
Batman was never that big anyway; he just wore a big suit with body armor.
Yes, he did.  Sure.

     The studio showed some sketches of the Batmobile.  The audience did not
like it.  The Batplane--some production sketches of it flying in the narrow
space between buildings--the audience liked it much more.  It reminded me a
lot of a scene from a certain science fiction film from 1977.  We will know
for sure if Robin has to fly in the trench between buildings to drop
missiles down a certain manhole.  The look of the city is supposed to be a
1990s city as seen from the 1930s.  Uh-huh.  Anton Furst is doing the set
design.  He did COMPANY OF WOLVES and is ready to move from wolves to bats.
They will get an unknown to play Robin.  Presumably Eddie Murphy had enough
sense to turn the role down.  Jack Nicholson will play the Joker.  I have
heard a lot of people say nobody else would look right in the role.  That is
interesting, since the Joker was drawn to look like a character in a then
well-known film.  The Joker was based on Conrad Veidt, whose face was
twisted in a rictus grin in THE MAN WHO LAUGHS.  So for good reason Veidt
looked the part more than Nicholson.  Of course that was long ago.

     We are to be reassured, however, because the people putting together
the film are genuine fans of the comic book.  What they are not telling you
is that they only really get a chance to read the comic books when they are
done with their paper routes and when they aren't out trading baseball
cards.  I wonder if the people who make the "Care Bears" movies are genuine
fans of the Care Bears.  That might explain a lot.

     And while we are on the subject of having a lot to explain, we saw a
preview of the new WAR OF THE WORLDS television show.  The premise is that
somebody found a lot of never-produced scripts for the old INVADERS
television show and is recycling them.  Ooops, sorry.  That's my premise.
The idea is that the world really was nearly destroyed in 1953, just like
George Pal showed us.  The government bottled up a bunch of aliens--they're
not really Martians--and now they have escaped.  They should not be all that
hard to round up but for three little things: 1) these guys are a lot more
muscular and powerful than Pal let on, 2) they can inhabit dead bodies and
make themselves look human, and 3) nobody remembers that most of the world
was destroyed by aliens.  I'm going to say that again because you probably
think that was a typographical error.  Nobody remembers that most of the
world was destroyed by aliens.  What do people think destroyed most of the
major cities in 1953?  Well, most people have not given the question a whole
lot of thought.  Don't knock it.  The characters really look like people who
might forget little details like an alien invasion.  The first episode will
feature war machines that look like and make noises like the ones in the
film.  Unfortunately the war machines all get destroyed, but we are left
with a bunch of aliens walking around in human suits, just likes Wells might
have written if he had thought of it.  Yes.

     What else is on the drawing boards?  Take any popular film of the past
five years and increment the suffix by one.  COCOON I, for example, will
have a COCOON II.  ROBOCOP I will have a ROBOCOP II.  Of course, he gets
kicked off the force in it so the title is a misnomer, but who would go to
see ROBOCIVILIAN?  (There was a whole presentation on the making of the the
original ROBOCOP that I will discuss later.)  BACK TO THE FUTURE I will give
rise to BACK TO THE FUTURE II; NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET IV will become
NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V.  DR. NO XIV: THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS will soon have
a DR. NO XV.  THE FLY I will have a THE FLY II, in which Brundle Jr. follows
in all six of his father's footsteps.  INDIANA JONES III (actually INDIANA
JONES AND THE LOST CRUSADE) will feature an older Indiana Jones, contrary to
the original plan, because Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger, also
contrary to the original plan.  Indy's papa will be played by Sean Connery
(whom many of us will remember from DARBY O'GILL AND THE LITTLE PEOPLE and
similar films).  ALIENS II (or ALIEN III) will have Sigourney Weaver in a
coma as the Russkies play with the aliens to make new weapons, but Weaver
will back in ALIEN IV in full force.  There is no comment yet as to whether
she will stick iwth the ALIEN series after that or will call it quits after
IV or will ride the series for three or four more entries.  If her career
sours enough, it is probably comforting for her to know that she will always
be able to find work in the upcoming ALIEN sequel.  (All these sequels to
popular films will be a little late because the creative (?) geniuses were
all on strike.)

     CHILD'S PLAY, which may be a one-shot if it is not popular, is about a
child's toy inhabited by the spirit of a dead gangster.  The dark horse may
well be LIVING ON THE EDGE, which will either be great or will suck pond
water.  It is sort of an alternate universe LEAVE IT TO BEAVER.  Everything
in this world is familiar but different.  The family dog is about the
ugliest thing the screen has ever seen, with three-inch fleas constantly
chewing at him.  All technology in the world seems connected in some way to
using tubes to transport things.  The feel is probably like that of
TERRORVISION.  Time will tell.

     I also went to a presentation on the making of ROBOCOP.  It was
inspired by Stan Lee's neurotic superheroes in Marvel Comics.  This was a
very informative panel and told you how they did all those wonderful special
effects that are such audience pleasers.  The presentation included slides
of the process used to film how they shot pieces off of the main character,
fingers first, then hands, then whole arms ripped off.  Good stuff like
that, you know.  well, for example, the way they shoot an arm off a
character is by attaching a fake arm with Velcro and attaching a line from a
rod and reel.  Then a fisherman off-stage can just snap away the arm.  How
wonderful somebody figured that out!  Then for a touch of realism, there is
the scene where a man falls into a vat of toxic waste and when he crawls out
he is melting right on screen.  This was actually a reprise of an effect
that some of the same people worked on for a nearly worthless film called
THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN.  But the capper is when the melting man is hit
by a truck and sort of splatters.  To create the wonderful effect that was
clearly needed they took the table scraps of the people working on the film
and let them rot in an open garbage can for two weeks.  It was these scraps
that were used for the insides of the dummy that was hit by the car.
Charming.

     What the producers of the film objected to was that the Hollywood
censors cut so much from the film.  The first killing by the ED-209 in the
film was supposed to really set the tone for the film as being humorous.  We
see the ED-209 gun a man down in a board room during a demo, but it is just
left at that.  In the original scene, the robot just pumped thousands of
rounds of ammunition into the body and it just kept quivering.  Test
audiences laughed very hard at this comically overdone scene but the
Hollywood censors cut it.  Now, silly me, I thought there were no censors in
Hollywood.  I thought that the issue was not one of censorship against
artistic freedom but rather one of artistic integrity versus money and the
producers, not wanting to accept the decreased profits that go with an X-
rated film, instead gave their audiences what they themselves call an
inferior product in order to boost profits.  And for having made this
decision they want sympathy. On its own merits I give this film a positive
rating, but well below what most people seem to have given it.

     It seems strange to say I hate to see a particular sort of special
effect used in science fiction but using gore effects in science fiction
films changes plot stress from wonder to horror.

     Well, that's the lineup, kiddies.

 Longer jokes.
A housewife, an accountant and a lawyer were asked "How much is 2+2?"
The housewife replies: "Four!".
The accountant says: "I think it's either 3 or 4.  Let me run
     those figures through my spreadsheet one more time."
The lawyer pulls the drapes, dims the lights and asks in a hushed
     voice, "How much do you want it to be?"
-----
A man went to a brain store to get some brain for dinner.
He sees a sign remarking on the quality of proffesional brain
offerred at this particular brain store.  So he asks the butcher:
"How much for Engineer brain?"
"3 dollars an ounce."
"How much for <other generic proffesion> brain?"
"4 dollars an ounce."
"How much for lawyer brain?"
"100 dollars an ounce."
"Why is lawyer brain so much more?"
"Do you know how many lawyers you need to kill to get one ounce of brain?"
-----
     A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did for a
living.  "Tim, you be first," she said.  "What does your mother do all day?"
Tim stood up and proudly said, "She's a doctor."
     "That's wonderful.  How about you, Amie?"
     Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, "My father is a mailman."
     "Thank you, Amie," said the teacher.  "What about your father, Billy?"
     Billy proudly stood up and announced, "My daddy plays piano in a
whorehouse."
     The teacher was aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography.
Later that day she went to Billy's house and rang the bell.  Billy's father
answered the door.  The teacher explained what his son had said and demanded
an explanation.
     Billy's father said, "I'm actually an attorney.  How can I explain a 
thing like that to a seven-year-old?"

A lawyer died and arrived at the pearly gates.  To his dismay, there were 
thousands of people ahead of him in line to see St. Peter.  To his surprise,
St. Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where 
the laywer was, and greeted him warmly.  Then St. Peter and one of his assis-
tants took the lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the
line, and into a comfortable chair by his desk.  The lawyer said, "I don't
mind all this attention, but what makes me so special?"

St. Peter replied, "Well, I've added up all the hours for which you billed 
your clients, and by my calculation you must be about 193 years old!"

A Dublin lawyer died in poverty and many barristers of the city sub-
scribed to a fund for his funeral. The Lord Chief Justice of Orbury

more of them."

 Longer jokes (cont.)
The Pope and a lawyer find themselves together before the Pearly Gates.
After a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective
professions, ol' St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly
station. After passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides
to show them to their new lodgings. Only a brief flight from the welcome,
Pete brings them down on the front lawn (cloud-encrusted, natch) of a 
huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings. This, Pete
announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least until
the end of time..) "Hot Dang", the Pope says to His-self, "If he's getting
a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs!". They take flight
once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear
more and more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with
Brownstone houses. Pete indicates the third walkup on the left as the
Popes new domicile and turns to leave, wishing the pontiff his best.
The Pope, in a mild state of astonishment, cries out "Hey Pete! What's the
deal here? You put that lawyer-feller in a beautiful estate home and I,
spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with this dive?"

Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replys: "Look here old fellow, 
this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many
times and religions. We're putting you here with them so you guys can
get your dogma together. That other guy gets an estate, because
he's the first (non-)damned lawyer to make it up here!!"

Carlson was charged with stealing a Mercedes Benz, and after a long
trial, the jury aquitted him. Later that day Carlson came back
to the judge who had presided at the hearing.
    "Your honor," he said, "I wanna get out a warrent for that
dirty lawyer of mine."
    "Why ?" asked the judge. "He won your aquittal. What do you
want to have him arrested for ?"
    "Well, your honor," replied Carlson, "I didn't have the money to pay
his fee, so he went and took the car I stole."

    "You seem to have more than the average share of intelligence for a man

A judge in a semi-small city was hearing a drunk-driving case and the
defendent, who had both a record and a reputation for driving under the
influence, demanded a jury trial.  It was nearly 4 p.m. and getting a
jury would take time, so the judge called a recess and went out in the
hall looking to impanel anyone available for jury duty.  He found a
dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told them that they were a jury.

The lawyers thought this would be a novel experience and so followed
the judge back to the courtroom.  The trial was over in about 10
minutes and it was very clear that the defendent was guilty.  The jury
went into the jury-room, the judge started getting ready to go home,
and everyone waited.

After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of patience and
sent the bailiff into the jury-room to see what was holding up the
verdict.  When the bailiff returned, the judge said, "Well have they
got a verdict yet?"

The bailiff shook his head and said, "Verdict?  Hell, they're still
doing nominating speeches for the foreman's position!"

A woman and her little girl were visitng the grave of the little girl's
grandmother.  On their way through the cemetary back to the car, the
little girl asked, "Mommy, do they ever bury two people in the same

"Of course not, dear." replied the mother, "Why would you think that?"

"The tombstone back there said 'Here lies a lawyer and an honest man.'"

These two guys, George and Harry, set out in a Hot Air balloon to
cross the Atlantic Ocean.  After 37 hours in the air, George says
"Harry, we better lose some altitude so we can see where we are".
Harry lets out some of the hot air in the balloon, and the balloon
descends to below the cloud cover.  George says, "I still can't
tell where we are, lets ask that guy on the ground".  So Harry
yells down to the man "Hey, could you tell us where we are?". And
the man on the ground yells back "You're in a balloon, 100 feet
up in the air".  George turns to Harry and says "That man must
be a lawyer".  And Harry says "How can you tell?".  George says
"Because the advice he gave us is 100% accurate, and totally
useless".

That's the end of the Joke, but for you people who are still
worried about George and Harry: They end up in the drink,
and make the front page of the New York Times: "Balloonists
Soaked by Lawyer".

     For three years, the young attorney had been taking his brief
vacations at this country inn.  The last time he'd finally managed
an affair with the innkeeper's daughter.  Looking forward to an
exciting few days, he dragged his suitcase up the stairs of the inn,
then stopped short.  There sat his lover with an infant on her lap!

     "Helen, why didn't you write when you learned you were pregnant?" 
he cried.  "I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married,
and the baby would have my name!"

     "Well," she said, "when my folks found out about my condition, we
sat up all night talkin' and talkin' and decided it would be better
to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."

     A lawyer named Strange was shopping for a tombstone.  After he had
made his selection, the stonecutter asked him what inscription he
would like on it.

     "Here lies an honest man and a lawyer," responded the lawyer.

     "Sorry, but I can't do that," replied the stonecutter.  "In this
state, it's against the law to bury two people in the same grave.
However, I could put ``here lies an honest lawyer''."

     "But that won't let people know who it is" protested the lawyer.
     "Certainly will," retorted the stonecutter.  "people will read it
and exclaim, "That's Strange!"

     At a convention of biological scientists one researcher remarks to
another, "Did you know that in our lab we have switched from mice to
lawyers for our experiments?"
     "Really?"  the other replied, "Why did you switch?"
     "Well, for three reasons.  First we found that lawyers are far more
plentiful, second, the lab assistants don't get so attached to
them, and thirdly there are some things even a rat won't do.  However,
sometimes it very hard to exterpolate our test results to human beings."

A certain lawyer was quite wealthy and had a summer house in the country, to
which he retreated for several weeks of the year.  Each summer, the lawyer
would invite a different friend of his (no, that's not the punch line) to
spend a week or two up at this place, which happened to be in a backwoods
section of Maine.
On one particular occasion, he invited a Czechoslovakian friend to stay with
him.  The friend, eager to get a freebee off a lawyer, agreed.
Well, they had a splendid time in the country - rising early and living in
the great outdoors.
Early one morning, the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian companion went out to
pick berries for their morning breakfast.  As they went around the berry
patch, gathering blueberries and raspberries in tremendous quantities, along
came two huge Bears - a male and a female.
Well, the lawyer, seeing the two bears, immediately dashed for cover. His
friend, though, wasn't so lucky, and the male bear reached him and
swallowed him whole.
The lawyer ran back to his Mercedes, tore into town as fast has he could, and
got the local backwoods sheriff. The sheriff grabbed his shotgun and dashed
back to the berry patch with the lawyer.
Sure enough, the two bears were still there.
"He's in THAT one!" cried the lawyer, pointing to the male, while visions of
lawsuits from his friend's family danced in his head. He just had to save his
friend.
The sheriff looked at the bears, and without batting an eye, leveled his gun,
took careful aim, and SHOT THE FEMALE.
"Whatdya do that for!" exclaimed the lawyer, "I said he was in the other!"
"Exactly," replied the sheriff, "and would YOU believe a lawyer who told you
that the Czech was in the Male?"
 Longer jokes (cont.)
	It had to happen sooner or later. Lawyer Dobbins was wheeled into the
emergency room on a stretcher, rolling his head in agony.  Doctor Green
came over to see him.
	"Dobbins," he said, "What an honor. The last time I saw you was in
court when you accused me of malpractice."
	"Doc. Doc. My side is on fire. The pain is right here. What could
it be?"
	"How would I know? You told the jury I wasn't fit to be a doctor."
	"I was only kidding, Doc. When you represent a client you don't
know what you're saying. Could I be passing a kidney stone?"
	"Your diagnosis is as good as mine."
	"What are you talking about?"
	"When you questioned me on the stand you indicated you knew
everything there was to know about the practice of medicine."
	"Doc, I'm climbing the wall. Give me something."
	"Let's say I give you something for a kidney stone and it turns
out to be a gallstone. Who is going to pay for my court costs?"
	"I'll sign a paper that I won't sue."
	"Can I read to you from the transcript of the trial? Lawyer
Dobbins: 'Why were you so sure that my client had tennis elbow?' Dr.
Green: 'I've treated hundreds of people with tennis elbow and I know it
when I see it.' Dobbins: 'It never occured to you my client could have an
Excedrin headache?'
Green: 'No, there were no signs of an Excedrin headache.'
Dobbins: 'You and your ilk make me sick.' "
	"Why are you reading that to me?"
	"Because, Dobbins, since the trial I've lost confidence in making
a diagnosis. A lady cane in the other day limping ..."
	"Please, Doc, I don't want to hear it now. Give me some Demerol."
	"You said during the suit that I dispensed drugs like a drunken
sailor. I've changed my ways, Dobbins. I don't prescribe drugs anymore."
	"Then get me another doctor."
	"There are no other doctors on duty. The reason I'm here is that
after the malpractice suit the sheriff seized everything in my office.
This is the only place that I can practice."
	"If you give me something to releive the pain I will personally
appeal your case to a higher court."
	"You know, Dobbins, I was sure that you were a prime candidate for
a kidney stone."
	"You can't tell a man is a candidate for a kidney stone just by
looking at him."
	"That's what you think, Dobbins. You had so much acid in you when
you addressed the jury I knew some of it eventually had to crystallize
into stones. Remember on the third day day when you called me the 'Butcher
of Operating Room 6'? That afternoon I said to my wife, "That man is going
to be in a lot of pain.' "
	"Okay, Doc, you've had your ounce of flesh. Can I now have my
ounce of Demerol?"
	"I better check you out first."
	"Don't check me out, just give the dope."
	"But in court the first question you asked me was if I had
examined the patient completely.  It would be negligent of me if I didn't
do it now.  Do you mind getting up on the scale?"
	"What for?"
	"To find out your height. I have to be prepared in case I get sued
and the lawyer asks me if I knew how tall you were."
	"I'm not going to sue you."
	"You say that now. But how can I be sure you won't file a writ
after you pass the kidney stone?"
 Longer jokes (cont.)
A Russian, a Cuban, an American and a Lawyer are in a train.

The Russian takes a bootle of the Best Vodka out of his pack; pours some into a
glass, drinks it, and says: "In USSR, we have the best vodka of the world,
nowhere in the world you can find Vodka as good as the one we produce in
Ukrainia. And we have so much of it, that we can just throw it away..."
Saying that, he open the window and throw the rest of the bottle thru it. All
the others are quite impressed.

The Cuban takes a pack of Havanas, takes one of them, lights it and begins to
smoke it saying: "In Cuba, we have the best cigars of the world: Havanas,
nowhere in the world there is so many and so good cigare and we have so much
of them, that we can just throw them away...". Saying that, he throws the pack
of havanas thru the window. One more time, everybody is quite impressed.

At this time, the American just stands up, opens the window, and throws the
Lawyer through it...

----
A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop
and steals a roast.  Butcher goes to lawyer's office and asks, "if a dog
running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to
demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner?"  The lawyer answers,
"Absolutely."

"Then you owe me $8.50.  Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today."

The lawyer, without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.50 [attorneys
don't carry cash -- it's too plebeian -- and the butcher hadn't brought the
shop's credit card imprinter to the lawyer's office].

Several periods of time later -- it could be the next day but that would be
unrealistic -- the butcher opens the mail and finds an envelope from the
lawyer: $20 due for a consultation.

Q:	How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?
A1:	It only takes one lawyer to change your light bulb to his light
        bulb.
A2:	You won't find a lawyer who can change a light bulb. Now, if you're
        looking for a lawyer to screw a light bulb...
A3:	Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "Lawyer", and the
party of the second part, also known as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith
agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall
be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform
previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the
entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area,
demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at
the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by
the aforementioned agreement between the parties.
    The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
to, the following steps:
    1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation
at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the
party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction,this
point being non-negotiable.
   2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb)
becomes separated from the party of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party
of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of
the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state,
local and federal statutes.
   3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first
part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of
the fourth part ("New Light Bulb").  This installation shall occur in a
manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of
this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur
in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable.
   NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the
party of the first part (Lawyer), by any or all persons authorized by him, the
objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the party of the
fifth part, also known as "Partnership."

A policeman is walking his beat when he finds a totally drunk man collapsed
against a building, weeping uncontrollably and holding his car keys in his
hands.  He's moaning something about 'They took my car!'.  Seeing he is quite
well dressed, the cop thinks he may have a real case of theft on his hands and
proceeds to question the man.

"What are your car keys doing out?"

"My car, it was right on the end of my key, and those ba**ards stole it!
Please ossifer, get my Porsche back.  My God, it was right on the end of my
key!  Where is it?  They stole it and it was right here; right on my key!

"OK, OK, stand up, let's get some more information. (he stands the man up,
and notices his penis is hanging out).  Aw s**t mister, your dick is hanging
out, would you put that thing away!"

The man looks down, sees his prick hanging there and screams "Oh my God,
they stole my girlfriend!"

Sirs,

     I've decided to apply for your position as a systems
programmer even though I hate snow worse than I hate snakes.
     I've been training for going on two years now at a local
community college in data processing, computers, and that sort of
stuff and have probably learned all about MVS/SP, JES2, ACF/VTAM,
NCP, CICS, IDMS and a bunch of other letters you didn't even list
(In fact, there's about 26 of them total)!
     I feel that this qualifies me in that respect.  As for IBM
systems, I have an IBM Selectric and even and IBM wall clock at
which my current boss says I watch better than anyone else here.
You list Assembly but that seems like a typo to me because that
is a hardware thing, nothing real programmers are supposed to do.
However, if you will train me I will even buy my own tools
provided you don't let any other real programmers see me doing
it.
     I see that you list competitive salary but if the best you
can do is to compete with my current salary I don't think I can
afford the job.  I thought programmers made lots of money.  But
I'm easy.  We can talk about that later.
     Please note that I've included my phone number and address
but if you like you can just have my ticket waiting at the
airport if that's more convenient.  Alaska Airlines first class
will be good enough.
     By the way, just what does a system programmer do?  (You can
save that for the interview if you like.)
     I'm glad to see you're an equal opportunity employer.  My
boss says you would need to be to hire an "obnoxious bastard"
like me.  Is that a protected group?
     Well, act quick 'cause I'm going fast.

                              Sincerely,

                              Poindexter D. Bytechip

(The author of the referenced article wants to get a piece of equipment
with an Ethernet port talking to VMS, either through DECnet or more directly.)

I would favor the "more direct" approach.  You certainly can issue $QIOs to
VMS's Ethernet driver.  u!The program that does this, and your other equipment,
must agree on an Ethernet "protocol type" parameter to distinguish your
packets from DECnet, LAT, and all the other Ethernet packets also destined
from your machine.  

As you guessed, your other alternative is essentially to implement DNA
layers 3 through 7 in your other machine.  This would be a large job; I
don't recommend trying this at home. :-)  However, if you want to see what
would be involved, order the following:

Disclaimer of Liability

The  user  of  this  test  acknowledges,  understands, and agrees that sex is a
hazardous sport; that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement
at all times; that their partner's condition vary constantly  and  are  greatly
affected  by weather changes and previous use, that dirty sheets, variations in
terrain and bed surfaces,  spouses/pimps/managers,  forest  growth,  rocks  and
debris,  clothed  obstacles,  and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and  customers,  exist  throughout  the  bedroom
area.  Personal  managers  (pimps/spouses)  and sado-masochistic operations and
equipment are  constantly  in  use  and  may  be  hazardous  to  customers  not
copulating  in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
injury can happen at any time, even to customers  copulating  in  control  with
proper  sexual  equipment.   Inherent and other risks are part of the sport and
exist in your partner. As a condition of being permitted to use the  facilities
of  your  sex object, the user of the partner agrees to copulate in control and
within the limits of his/her ability and further acknowledges and accepts these
hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or
damage to property which might result from the customer's use of the  partner's
facilities.

As  a  further  condition  of  being  permitted  to  use the facilities of your
partner, the customer understands and  agrees  (1)  that  in  the  event  of  a
transfer  of  use  by  another  or anything else in the management's opinion is
misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be  revoked
without  refund;  (2)  that  the partner is the property of the harem and, upon
request, he/she must be presented  to  any  authorized  representative  of  the
pimp/spouse;  (3)  that sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times
when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.

Your sexual partner  is  not  transferable;  see  Theft  of  Services,  V.S.A.,

 3    13-Apr-1985  400     CMU/da, fa, tc, no, dt, sv, rz, et al

Version 1 (100)         Created  at  MIT.  Two parallel versions; one for male,
                and one for female. Not much is known about this version.

Version 2 (247)         Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the beginning of
                the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.

Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984 
                First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                former version were short-lived and tended to  be  bug  ridden.
                Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                version and version 2. Added in Genesis/History section.

Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985 
                Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.

Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985 
                Rebuilt  from  the  3.3C.1  source  and the 3.4 (only surviving
                copy) of the Xerox X9700 laser  printer  hardcopy.  Cleaned  up
                same  bugs  in  3.4;  wiped  out a duplicate question; The page
                number was moved from top of the page  to  the  bottom  center;
                this  was to avoid problems trying to coordinate duplex/simplex
                printing by other people and the positioning of  odd/even  page
                numbers. Added in verbose history section.

Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985 
                Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400. After an
                all-night hack session, discovered that the problem  lies  with
                the  version  4  (1400)-1  of Scribe and how it treats @section
                headers and  @begin(text).  Ended  up  making  the  pageheading
                contain  a  Scribe  version  field. Also had to add in an extra
                token @newpage on the page that the questions start;  this  was
                to  preserve  the  last  of  the  @style[pagenumber  (@A)] page
                numbers, preserve the same in the Table of Contents, force  the
                page  number  to  be  1,  make  sure that the Contents get that
                right, and to force @pageheading and @pagefooting.

Instructions for Use

This  is  a  fairly  long  test  consisting  of  four  hundred (400  , CD     ,
                                                                   10    Roman
110010000 ,  620 ,  190  ,  103000.100  ).  It  starts  out   tame   and   gets
         2      8      16             Pi
progressively  worse,  or  better,  depending on your viewpoint. There are many
ways of going about taking this test.  You  can,  of  course,  as  your  right,
guaranteed  by  the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your
room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the funnest  way
to  utilize this test if to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one (1  ,
                                                                            10
I     , 1 , 1 , 1  , 1  ) (read my lips: one) copy of the test, and a bunch  of
 Roman   2   8   16   Pi
friends.  (No  doubt lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)
The person with the copy of the test will be  the  test  administrator;  he/she
will  read  the  questions  out  loud  and everybody else will write down their
answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are  required
to  divulge  their  answers,  that  is up to the group to decide; however, each
person's purity score should be made common knowledge.  (The  person  with  the
highest  score  gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works
great at parties and lets everybody know who's easy and who  isn't,  so  you'll
know who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.

All  questions  in  this  test  pertain  to  events  that  have happened to you
subsequent to your  weaning  and  babyhood  infancy.  Anything  that  may  have
happened  before  such  time  is  considered not standing and void; it's a null
point. The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating  you  AND/OR
you masturbating someone else, not exclusively someone masturbating you AND you
masturbating  them.  We  would also like to define having sex in the homosexual
case; homosexual sex has occurred when you and/or your  partner  (of  the  same
sex) have an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of you and
those of your partner.

We  would  now  like  to  bring  to your attention that there is no passing nor
failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about  getting  a
high score, even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

I. Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best, as does the a  la  mainframe
method.   (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.) Of the easier ways:  count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:

     For people with real calculators (HP):

               <#no ans.> [ENTER] 4 /

     For people with other (dinky) calculators:

               <#no ans.> / 4 =

Well, you asked for it and here it is.  You should note that there are many
different forms of this floating around the world, but almost all are of
the same basic sentiment.  Requested history is also provided care of the
authors of this version.

Disclaimer of Liability

The  user  of  this  test  acknowledges,  understands, and agrees that sex is a
hazardous sport; that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement
at all times; that their partner's condition vary constantly  and  are  greatly
affected  by weather changes and previous use, that dirty sheets, variations in
terrain and bed surfaces,  spouses/pimps/managers,  forest  growth,  rocks  and
debris,  clothed  obstacles,  and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and  customers,  exist  throughout  the  bedroom
area.  Personal  managers  (pimps/spouses)  and sado-masochistic operations and
equipment are  constantly  in  use  and  may  be  hazardous  to  customers  not
copulating  in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
injury can happen at any time, even to customers  copulating  in  control  with
proper  sexual  equipment.   Inherent and other risks are part of the sport and
exist in your partner. As a condition of being permitted to use the  facilities
of  your  sex object, the user of the partner agrees to copulate in control and
within the limits of his/her ability and further acknowledges and accepts these
hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or
damage to property which might result from the customer's use of the  partner's
facilities.

As  a  further  condition  of  being  permitted  to  use the facilities of your
partner, the customer understands and  agrees  (1)  that  in  the  event  of  a
transfer  of  use  by  another  or anything else in the management's opinion is
misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be  revoked
without  refund;  (2)  that  the partner is the property of the harem and, upon
request, he/she must be presented  to  any  authorized  representative  of  the
pimp/spouse;  (3)  that sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times
when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.

Your sexual partner  is  not  transferable;  see  Theft  of  Services,  V.S.A.,
sections 2581 and 2582.

Version 1 (100)         Created  at  MIT.  Two parallel versions; one for male,
                and one for female. Not much is known about this version.

Version 2 (247)         Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the beginning of
                the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.

Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984 
                First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                former version were short-lived and tended to  be  bug  ridden.
                Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                version and version 2. Added in Genesis/History section.

Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985 
                Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.

Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985 
                Rebuilt  from  the  3.3C.1  source  and the 3.4 (only surviving
                copy) of the Xerox X9700 laser  printer  hardcopy.  Cleaned  up
                same  bugs  in  3.4;  wiped  out a duplicate question; The page
                number was moved from top of the page  to  the  bottom  center;
                this  was to avoid problems trying to coordinate duplex/simplex
                printing by other people and the positioning of  odd/even  page
                numbers. Added in verbose history section.

Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985 
                Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400. After an
                all-night hack session, discovered that the problem  lies  with
                the  version  4  (1400)-1  of Scribe and how it treats @section
                headers and  @begin(text).  Ended  up  making  the  pageheading
                contain  a  Scribe  version  field. Also had to add in an extra
                token @newpage on the page that the questions start;  this  was
                to  preserve  the  last  of  the  @style]pagenumber  (@A)( page
                numbers, preserve the same in the Table of Contents, force  the
                page  number  to  be  1,  make  sure that the Contents get that
                right, and to force @pageheading and @pagefooting.

Instructions for Use

This  is  a  fairly  long  test  consisting  of  four  hundred (400  , CD     ,
                                                                   10    Roman
110010000 ,  620 ,  190  ,  103000.100  ).  It  starts  out   tame   and   gets
         2      8      16             Pi
progressively  worse,  or  better,  depending on your viewpoint. There are many
ways of going about taking this test.  You  can,  of  course,  as  your  right,
guaranteed  by  the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your
room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the funnest  way
to  utilize this test if to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one (1  ,
                                                                            10
I     , 1 , 1 , 1  , 1  ) (read my lips: one) copy of the test, and a bunch  of
 Roman   2   8   16   Pi
friends.  (No  doubt lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)
The person with the copy of the test will be  the  test  administrator;  he/she
will  read  the  questions  out  loud  and everybody else will write down their
answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are  required
to  divulge  their  answers,  that  is up to the group to decide; however, each
person's purity score should be made common knowledge.  (The  person  with  the
highest  score  gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works
great at parties and lets everybody know who's easy and who  isn't,  so  you'll
know who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.

All  questions  in  this  test  pertain  to  events  that  have happened to you
subsequent to your  weaning  and  babyhood  infancy.  Anything  that  may  have
happened  before  such  time  is  considered not standing and void; it's a null
point. The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating  you  AND/OR
you masturbating someone else, not exclusively someone masturbating you AND you
masturbating  them.  We  would also like to define having sex in the homosexual
case; homosexual sex has occurred when you and/or your  partner  (of  the  same
sex) have an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of you and
those of your partner.

We  would  now  like  to  bring  to your attention that there is no passing nor
failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about  getting  a
high score, even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

I. Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best, as does the a  la  mainframe
method.   (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.) Of the easier ways:  count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:

     For people with real calculators (HP):

               <#no ans.> ]ENTER( 4 /

     For people with other (dinky) calculators:

               <#no ans.> / 4 =

An anecdote might make it clearer why write-only registers are a real problem,
if they share addresses with any other function.

This happened with an old DEC serial interface (DZ-11 I think),
and the PDP11/04.  The DZ-11 had a read-only input FIFO and a write-only output
register at the same address.  With most machines, this would cause no problems.
It required very careful coding to be sure that only READ accesses were used
to get data from the input register, and WRITE accesses to send to the output.

Unfortunately, in order to save some complexity in the 11/04 CPU, DEC had
made the MOV instruction ALWAYS READ ITS MEMORY DESTINATION.  This meant that
	MOV	Rn, OUTPUT_REGISTER
would first read (and discard!) the top of the input FIFO.

There was absolutely nothing that could be done to make this combination of
CPU and peripheral work.  We wound up junking 5 11/04s, which at the time cost
us some $50K in all, not to mention the time spent debugging mysterious lost
input characters.

As I seem to like to dredge up ancient history in this forum, these
thoughts sent me to my dusty closet of 'olde stuff' to fetch volume
1 (I also have V2) of a collection of papers produced by DEC called
"PDP-10 Applications in Science".
I think that I got this sometime in 1970, though most of the papers
seem to be from around 1967-1968.
The third paper in the book is

"Selecting and Evaluating a Medium Scale Computer System"
"A Study Undertaken for Louisiana State University at New Orleans"
by Jon A. Stewart, Director, LSUNO Computer Research Center

The paper is a summary of an in-depth comparison of three major
systems of the time; the SDS Sigma-5, the IBM 360/44, and the
DEC PDP-10. The paper is very fine at bringing back the memories
of the good old days, but of most interest to this discussion is
an appendix containing compiler-generated code for a simple
fortran benchmark.

The upshot was that the PDP-10 generated much shorter code,
that also ran faster. (I can publish a sample if there is
enough interest.)

While this paper drew no architectural conclusions (such as
are discussed in this forum) the main reason (if I
remember my DEC Propaganda of the day) was the very orthogonal
instruction set as opposed to a smaller number of instructions.

This clean and complete instruction set allowed the compiler
to use a large percentage of the instruction set. While I believe
that the clean instruction set came first, and the compiler
that used the large percentage of that instruction set came later,
rather than the current risc idea of profiling code to determine what
will be in the instruction set, it was a haunting hint of where
we would be today.

I recall seeing published statements about how many of the KA-10's
366 instructions were actually used by the FORTRAN compiler.
Does anyone still have these numbers??

I also have some DEC Propaganda from about 1973 bragging about
the optimization done by DEC FORTRAN. This includes examples
of generated code. Again, if anyone is interested...

The July 11, 1988 issue of Federal Computer Week has an editorial
written by Fred Reed ("Ada: A View From the Field", page 19) which
supposedly presents both the pros and cons of Ada. The following
quotes are representative:

"What follows is one man's opinion, but it is an informed opinion --
he programs in Ada as well as C and other -- so I thought it was worth
passing along. We'll call him Bob because, Ada being a fairly sacred
cow, he didn't want to be named."

"... Ada has been called everybody's favorite 17 programming
languages." 

"Fewer programming errors. Among other features, Bob explained, Ada
has what are called strong typing and range checking. Strong typing
means that the programmer is forced to tell the computer the nature of
each piece of information he uses. This allows the machine to be sure
incompatible kinds of information are not mixed."

"Ada, said Bob, is well suited to being understood and maintained by
many programmers who will work on a large program over its lifetime.
This is why it saves money, he said."

"However, he noted, these strength also result in weaknesses. For
example, the programmer has to write extra code to do the strong
typing and range checking, and this, among other things, makes Ada
code slow to write."

"Further, because the program constantly has to check ranges and data
types as it runs, Ada produces much slower programs than some other
languages.

"An Ada program typically runs a tenth as fast as the same program in
C," said Bob. "I think we are seeing the bureaucratic attitude at its
ultimate. Ada is a prudent approa

ch to software. It is defintely
suboptimal in performance -- slow, bulky, verbose and slow to write.
But it is reliable and easy to work with after it is written. It is
safe. These are qualities prized by bureaucrats. DoD chose reliability
over performance."

The Sierra Club has endorsed the following candidates for office:

CANDIDATE           OFFICE                       CURRENT STATUS

Leo McCarthy        U.S. Senate                  Lt. Governor
Don Edwards         10th Cong. Dist.-U.S.        Incumbent
Tom Lantos          11th Cong. Dist.-U.S.        Incumbent
Tom Campbell        12th Cong. Dist.-U.S.        New Candidate
Anna Eshoo          12th Cong. Dist.-U.S.        New Candidate
Norm Mineta         13th Cong. Dist.-U.S.        Incumbent
Becky Morgan        11th Sen.  Dist.-Cal.        Incumbent
Jackie Speier       19th Assem.Dist.-Cal.        Incumbent
Ted Lempert         20th Assem.Dist.-Cal.        New Candidate
Byron Sher          21st Assem.Dist.-Cal.        Incumbent
John Vasconcellos   23rd Assem.Dist.-Cal.        Incumbent
Dominic Cortese     24th Assem.Dist.-Cal.        Incumbent
Bob Gonzales        Santa Clara Co. Supv.        New Candidate
Bob Livengood       Santa Clara Co. Supv.        New Candidate
Nancy Ianni         San Jose City Council        Incumbent

What follows are my own opinions about the upcoming race.

By and large, environmental voters in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties
face promising prospects this election.  Byron Sher is the Alan Cranston
of the California State Assembly - a legislator we can invariably count
on to promote our interests. Moreover, his only opponent is a Libertarian
candidate (sorry about that, Gordon...). Morgan get's the nod primarily
for her instrumental efforts establishing the new Cascade Ranch State
Park, on the coast half-way between S.F. and Santa Cruz.

Edwards, Lantos, Mineta, Speier,
and Vasconcellos all look like shoe-ins.  Lempert's and Cortese's
prospects are more problematic.  Cortese, for example, faces an opponent
backed by developers shelling out ALOT of money - they want free reign
developing the hills east of San Jose.

McCarthy is pulling up to Senator
Pete Wilson in the U.S. Senate race; he has a good environmental record,
in contrast to Wilson, who appears to be towing the Reagan line.  Many
think that the only reason Cranston's Desert Protection Act didn't
get through the Senate this time around is because his fellow California
senator DIDN'T (!) endorse it.  Let's get him outa there....

I'd be interested to hear about other candidates in the state, especially
those representing S. Cal.  Or any other insights into the campaigns that
I've mentioned.  Now if things only looked as promising at the
presidential level....

It is, in fact, shipping in _very_ limited quantities, due to the chip
shortage.  The on-board cache it uses is a variety of static RAM which
has been hard to get of late and may not be available in large quantity
until next year.

We have obtained one and have been testing it.  As you mentioned, it
contains a 12MHz 80286 (CMOS) and room for an 80287.  If the cache /
high speed clock are turned on (this can be done from software) it 
does indeed give a Norton SI of 8.3, which puts it squarely in the 
AT category.  You cannot install an 8088 or an 8087 with the Turbow -
the 80286/80287 take their place.  The software switch just turns on
high speed mode for the 80286.

In practice, we have found that very few programs have problems with
the Turbow board, and have not found ANY compatibility problems if the
accelerator switch is OFF.  Most of the problems are with graphics
programs - many graphics programs copy some code from the DEC graphics
board documentation which has some bugs in it, and there are also some
new timing problems with using the graphics board which never used to
be possible.

[Technobabble insert:  The problems all revolve around the fact that
it is possible to load the Graphics Display Controller (GDC) with
commands faster than it can execute them.  This is possible even on
the old 8088, but it is even more of a problem on the 80286.  Many
programs don't check the GDC for busy properly, and (even worse) even
if the GDC is not busy it is possible to execute certain register load
sequences too rapidly which throws it into a tizzy.  If you have access 
to the source the fix is usually pretty easy;  if you don't you can
always do a TURBOW OFF and we have yet to see a program which isn't
fixed by this.  I understand however that AUTOCAD and possibly a couple
of others may still have problems and that there is a special version
of the Turbow board which slows down the graphics board I/O just for 
AUTOCAD].

I have heard that there is a version of Windows that someone is working
on and is "close" but I don't know when/if it will be available.

All in all I would give it pretty high marks.  As usual, I think Jerry 
Miller has done his homework pretty well on this one.

Brad,
  Below is a *warranty card* from McDonnell Douglas that a friend gave to
  me.  It should be printed out on two pages, so I put '(form feed)' in where
  a CTRL-L should go.  Enjoy! :-)

New Jersey Network has announced they will be showing "Remembrance
of the Daleks", the first show of the 25th season, on Saturday,
January 21, 1989, in connection with a pledge break scheduled that
week.

It seems, then, that at least the first show is available, though
probably only for use during pledging; this has been a typical
practice by Lionheart over the past couple of years.

No word on when NJN might show the rest of the season- if this year
follows form, it will probably be March or April.

In any case, Lionheart appears to have at least made some decisions
on showing Season 25 in the US- so maybe it's time to start bugging your
local PBS station to get it.

I'd like to know what events are held at your university during
Engineer's Week ?   Any unusual ones ?

Here at CSUN, we usually have:

*   speaker
*   popsicle bridge building contest
	two divisons:
	    maximum strength:      weight supported / weight of bridge
	    minimum deflection:    deflection / weight bridge
*   paper airplane contest
	two categories
	    amateur:      one sheet paper only, no lamination
	    professional: anything that didn't fit in amateur categories
	two criteria for judging
	    distance
	    time aloft
*   egg drop contest
	    least weight of container

I have seen:

*   rubber band powered automobile
	must use supplied materials
	maximum distance
*   card house building
	floor area weighted by height of buidling
*   sand castle building contest
*   Rube Goldberg device contest
	Design a Rube Goldberg device,
	strangest and most creative wins!
*   Moon mapper
	The moon mapper moves about a hex grid, the goal is to
	map as much area of the "crater" as possible.  The moon
	mapper is "programmed" with a table that tells it which
	direction relative to the present direction, given the
	status (open or blocked) of the neighboring hexes.
*   Newtonian Carnival
	Exhibits showing basic physics.
	    conservation of rotational momentum
	    reaction jet race (fire extingusher)

I have heard of but not actually seen and would like to know
if anyone has tried:

*    egg or water ballon catapult
	Safety concerns ?
	judging criteria (accuracy?)

Instructions for Use:
This is a fairly long test consisting of four hundred questions.  It starts out
tame  and  gets  progressively  worse,  or better, depending on your viewpoint.
There are many ways of taking this test. You  can,  of  course, be  anti-social
and hide yourself in your room and take this test all by yourself.  However, we
feel that the best way to utilize this test is to hold a Purity Test Party. All
you need is  one copy  of the test,  and a bunch of friends.   (Lots of writing
implements and paper would be useful too.) The person with the copy of the test
will  be  the  test  administrator;  s/he will read the  questions out loud and
everybody else will  write down their answers,  or at least keep track of their
total "yes" or "no" answers, whichever is easier.  We have no definite rules as
to whether the participants are required to reveal their answers, that is up to
the group to decide; however, each person's purity score should be made  common
knowledge (The person with the highest score gets to be giggled at for the rest
of his/her life).  This works  great at  parties and  lets everyone  know who's
easy  and who isn't,  so  you'll know  who to go  home with.  Don't  leave home
without it (the test, that is).

All questions in this test pertain to events that occured after your weaning
and infancy.  Anything that may have happened  before that time shall not be
considered.

The term  mutual  masturbation refers  to someone  masturbating  you AND/OR you
masturbating  someone else,  not  exclusively someone  masturbating you AND you
masturbating them.

The term  sexual activity refers  to sexual intercourse,  oral sex,  and mutual
masturbation, but not necking or petting.

The term sexual  intercourse refers  to the act of intercourse.   Orgasm is not
necessary, penetration counts.

Numbers marked in <>'s are footnote numbers.  The footnotes are located at the
end of the text.

We would now like to bring to your attention  that  there  is  no  passing  nor
failing  score.  Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about getting a
high score, even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

                       --- ALL TECHNICALITIES COUNT ---
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this section, if you are mostly a:
         - heterosexual,  then your partner, often referred to as someone
           or partner, is to be someone of the opposite gender.
         - homosexual, then your partner, often referred to as someone
           or partner, is to be someone of your own gender.
         - 50-50 confirmed bisexual, then your partner, often referred to
           someone or partner, is to be someone of either gender.

1. Platonic Relations

             Have you ever done any of the following:

   1. kissed a friend or stranger on his/her hands, head, or neck as a
      friendly gesture?
   2. held hands with someone?
   3. had a date?
   4. had a date which lasted past 1 a.m.?
   5. dated someone on a regular basis?
   6. picked someone up?
   7. been picked up?
   8. gone steady?

  10. had the symptoms of Russian <1> fingers?
  11. had the symptoms of Roman <2> hands?
  12. shared sleeping accommodations with someone without anything steamy
      happening?
  13. given a back or neck rub or massage with no ulterior motive?
  14. used tickling as a pick-up, get-to-know-you-better routine?
  15. directly asked someone whom you were not going out with and had
      never gone out with if they were a virgin?
  16. used physical strength, physical power, or any physical prowess, or
      prowesslessness as a factor in pick-up, get-to-know-you-better
      routine?
  17. secretly lusted after someone without that person knowing?
  18. dropped subtle hints to someone whom you liked/loved/wanted, hoping
      that they would pick up on it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although this section is termed Auto-erotica and mono-sexualism, a situation
      should still count even if you were with someone else at the time.  It
      was so named because these activities,  like the harp, are essentially
      solo events.

2. Auto-erotica and Mono-sexualism
 Have you ever:
  19. had an arousing dream? (Wet dreams and the like)
  20. been sexually aroused?
  21. verbally expressed obscenities? (uttered, yelled, muttered, etc.)
  22. sexually fantasized about your long-term instructor, mentor, or someone
      who is superior to you? (One day skydiving teachers, or two hour ski
      instructors and the like do not count.)
  23. sexually fantasized about your lawyer, doctor, nurse, psychiatrist or
      someone with whom you are having a professional relationship?
  24. sexually fantasized about someone you know personally but not closely?
  25. sexually fantasized about anyone and masturbated at the same time?

  27. read sexually explicit literature?
  28. gone skinny dipping alone?
  29. made obscene phone calls?
  30. phoned up any recorded phone sex numbers (this includes answering
      machines with "phone sex" material)?
  31. phoned up any live phone sex numbers (this includes any human with a
      phone, not just 976-type pay per call numbers)?
  32. stuffed your bra if you are female, or stuffed your pants if you are
      male?
  33. shaved your pubic hair?
  34. shaved your pubic hair on a fairly regular basis?

  38. masturbated to orgasm on a fairly regular basis of no less than once
      a fortnight?

  49. been to a public showing of a pornographic movie?  (i.e. X-rated
      movie house)
  50. walked around in your dwelling in the nude?  (Must be a serious walk;
      five minutes of going around trying to find your undies after a shower
      doesn't make it.)
  51. walked around in a public or semi-public area with a top (shirt,
      T-shirt, etc) but no bottoms (pants, shorts, etc)? (Dorm hallways,
      lobby areas, etc. are acceptable; however locker rooms and bathrooms
      and such place where this behavior is accepted does not count.)
  52. bought blatantly sexual objects? (This means that if you buy a bottle
      of Coke  and you use it as a dildo, it really doesn't count. Think:
      specific design for function.)
  53. owned any erotic art pieces?
  54. sculpted erotic/obscene artworks in food (predominantly bananas,
      carrots, apples...)?
  55. eaten any erotic food items? (Chocolate tits, banana dicks, etc.)

Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best. Of the easier ways: count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:
     For people with real calculators (HP):
               <#no ans.> [ENTER] 4 /
     For people with other (dinky) calculators:
               <#no ans.> / 4 =

   I'm still getting requests for the Hack Tutorial, which I posted
over a week ago. If there's anyone who still wants it, but hasn't
gotten it at their site yet, let me know and I'll mail it. I've been
ignoring mail requests up 'til now, since I figured that you would
all see it in rec.games.hack eventually (since you must have seen the
original offer here, right?).

Some friends of mine recently built a victorian in Grass Valley, complete
with replicas(sp?) of antique lighting.  Inspectors told them they had
to replace the bathroom fixtures with florescent lighting... under his
breath, he mentioned that after everything was approved, they could 
replace the old fixtures!  (BTW - they had glass shower doors.)

Just thought you might find this an interesting twist.

Thanks for waiting so patiently.

I spoke with Ross yesterday, and we decided to post ADL as it exists now.  It
has corrections for several of the problems noted in the original posting, but
not much additional functionality.  I will fix a minor bug in standard.adl and
ship the whole thing off to comp.sources.games within the next 2 days.

Additionally, Ross and I are at work on the next release -- which WILL have
additional functionality (as soon as we can decide which suggestions to
implement) -- which should be out before summer break.

Sooooo....

Keep a lookout on comp.sources.games.

For thou who hast asked about Monster:

	It is public domain.  It's an "interesting" game, to say the least.  
There are many errors, one is especially fatal, and it is incomplete.  BUT, 
since the idea of the game is to build your own universe, I guess building the
game is just another part of playing.  
	We here at Albany have a universe of 350+ rooms, including a very 
detailed "map" of the SUNYA campus and bar area.  THEN began the trouble.  In
two days, we ended up with fifteen people "deadlocked" out of the game, 
including the three managers.  I had to edit the code to allow EVERYONE manager
priveledges in order to save our world.  
	As of today, we still haven't been able to fix the code, but have been
working on new code.  Hopefully we will find away to fix the game, AND keep our
world.  Recompiling and killing the universe would be heartbreaking, not to
mention possibly life-threatening to me for doing it.

		For more info, email to me.  If enough interest in the game, or
trying to fix it, I will post more...

In this article Charles Guest writes....(and writes and writes):
Certainly......The 1987 Vehicle Code States The Following:

SECTION 21654

(A) Notwithstanding the prima facia speed limits, any vehicle proceeding
upon a highway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving
in the same direction at such time shall be driven in the right hand
lane for traffic or as close as practicable to the right hand edge or
curb, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in
the same direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection
or into a private road or driveway.
(B) If a vehicle is being drivenat a speed less than the normal speed of
traffic moving in the same direction at such time, and is not being
driven in the right hand lane for traffic or as close as practicable to
the right hand edge or curb, it shall be constitute prima facia evidence
that the driver is operating the vehicle in violation of subdivision
(a) of this section.
(C) [section c basically says that the dot may place signs to the above
affect on roadways.]


SECTION 21656

On a two lane highway where passing is unsafe because of traffic in the
opposite direction or other conditions, a slow moving vehicle including
a passenger vehicle behind which five or more vehicles are formed in a
line, shall turn off the roadway at the nearest place designated as a
turnout by signs erected by the authority having jurisdiction  over the
highway, or wherever sufficient area for a safe turnout exists, in order
to permit the vehicles following it to proceed.  As used in this section
a slow moving vehicle is one which is proceeding at a rate of speed less
than the normal flow of traffic at the particular time and place.




...........ugh!  


	Hope this helps your discussion.  One note, was *MY* english
teacher wrong or were ALL of the above run-on sentences for which most
of us would have failed english? 


One further educational note from the pages of the Vehicle Code:::::

For those of you who need to be told.....

California Vehicle Code 
SECTION 21633 says:

...No person shall operate or move a motor vehicle upon a sidewalk...



Damn shame, so much unused space too.   :-)

The following story was posted in news.sysadmin recently.

The more things change, the more they stay the same...

Back in the mid-1970s, several of the system support staff at Motorola
(I believe it was) discovered a relatively simple way to crack system
security on the Xerox CP-V timesharing system (or it may have been
CP-V's predecessor UTS).  Through a simple programming strategy, it was
possible for a user program to trick the system into running a portion
of the program in "master mode" (supervisor state), in which memory
protection does not apply.  The program could then poke a large value
into its "privilege level" byte (normally write-protected) and could
then proceed to bypass all levels of security within the file-management
system, patch the system monitor, and do numerous other interesting
things.  In short, the barn door was wide open.

Motorola quite properly reported this problem to XEROX via an official
"level 1 SIDR" (a bug report with a perceived urgency of "needs to be
fixed yesterday").  Because the text of each SIDR was entered into a
database that could be viewed by quite a number of people, Motorola
followed the approved procedure: they simply reported the problem as
"Security SIDR", and attached all of the necessary documentation,
ways-to-reproduce, etc. separately.

Xerox apparently sat on the problem... they either didn't acknowledge
the severity of the problem, or didn't assign the necessary
operating-system-staff resources to develop and distribute an official
patch.

Time passed (months, as I recall).  The Motorola guys pestered their
Xerox field-support rep, to no avail.  Finally they decided to take
Direct Action, to demonstrate to Xerox management just how easily the
system could be cracked, and just how thoroughly the system security
systems could be subverted.

They dug around through the operating-system listings, and devised a
thoroughly devilish set of patches.  These patches were then
incorporated into a pair of programs called Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
Robin Hood and Friar Tuck were designed to run as "ghost jobs" (daemons,
in Unix terminology);  they would use the existing loophole to subvert
system security, install the necessary patches, and then keep an eye on
one another's statuses in order to keep the system operator (in effect,
the superuser) from aborting them.

So... one day, the system operator on the main CP-V software-development 
system in El Segundo was surprised by a number of unusual phenomena.
These included the following (as I recall... it's been a while since I
heard the story):

-  Tape drives would rewind and dismount their tapes in the middle of a
   job.

-  Disk drives would seek back&forth so rapidly that they'd attempt to
   walk across the floor.

-  The card-punch output device would occasionally start up of itself
   and punch a "lace card" (every hole punched).  These would usually
   jam in the punch.

-  The console would print snide and insulting messages from Robin Hood
   to Friar Tuck, or vice versa.

-  The Xerox card reader had two output stackers;  it could be
   instructed to stack into A, stack into B, or stack into A unless a
   card was unreadable, in which case the bad card was placed into
   stacker B.  One of the patches installed by the ghosts added some
   code to the card-reader driver... after reading a card, it would flip
   over to the opposite stacker.  As a result, card decks would divide
   themselves in half when they were read, leaving the operator to
   recollate them manually.

I believe that there were some other effects produced, as well.

Naturally, the operator called in the operating-system developers.  They
found the bandit ghost jobs running, and X'ed them... and were once
again surprised.  When Robin Hood was X'ed, the following sequence of
events took place:

  !X id1

  id1:   Friar Tuck... I am under attack!  Pray save me!  (Robin Hood)
  id1: Off (aborted)

  id2: Fear not, friend Robin!  I shall rout the Sheriff of Nottingham's men!

  id3: Thank you, my good fellow! (Robin)

Each ghost-job would detect the fact that the other had been killed, and
would start a new copy of the recently-slain program within a few
milliseconds.  The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them
simultaneously (very difficult) or to deliberately crash the system.

Finally, the system programmers did the latter... only to find that the
bandits appeared once again when the system rebooted!  It turned out
that these two programs had patched the boot-time image (the /vmunix
file, in Unix terms) and had added themselves to the list of programs
that were to be started at boot time...

The Robin Hood and Friar Tuck ghosts were finally eradicated when the
system staff rebooted the system from a clean boot-tape and reinstalled
the monitor.  Not long thereafter, Xerox released a patch for this
problem.

I believe that Xerox filed a complaint with Motorola's management about
the merry-prankster actions of the two employees in question.  To the
best of my knowledge, no serious disciplinary action was taken against
either of these guys.

Several years later, both of the perpetrators were hired by Honeywell,
which had purchased the rights to CP-V after Xerox pulled out of the
mainframe business.  Both of them made serious and substantial
contributions to the Honeywell CP-6 operating system development effort.
Robin Hood (Dan Holle) did much of the development of the PL-6
system-programming language compiler; Friar Tuck (John Gabler) was one
of the chief communications-software gurus for several years.  They're
both alive and well, and living in LA (Dan) and Orange County (John).
Both are among the more brilliant people I've had the pleasure of
working with.

Disclaimers: it has been quite a while since I heard the details of how
this all went down, so some of the details above are almost certainly
wrong.  I shared an apartment with John Gabler for several years, and he
was my Best Man when I married back in '86... so I'm somewhat
predisposed to believe his version of the events that occurred.

	I am not familiar with generally available bowling "classes", but I can
 tell you that if you are really serious about becoming a 200+ average bowler,
	(almost anyone can!)
 those classes won't help you beyond "just getting started".
	I'm a professional bowler (PCCB), myself, and in my early days, tried
 to learn from classes given at alleys and books. Neither contained the real
 "secrets" of bowling that the pros know. Also, unfortunately, there are only
 about 3 good instructors in the entire bay area! (4 including myself :-) )
	There are 3 essentials to becoming a "par bowler" (average of 200+).
 first - a consistent physical delivery with the proper "action" on the ball, 
 (THIS IS THE EASIEST PART (presuming you have good hand-eye coordination))
 second the required knowledge to a) Find the "line" on any given lane,
 b) Make the required delivery and equipment adjustments, and thirdly a proper
 mental attitude (which is the toughest part). I can give U the second, the 
 others are up to you!
	Let me know if you are interested in any further information. I give
 advanced lessons in Fremont. Notes included.

I'm the creator of Monster, so I thought I'd respond to a few of the
points brought up.

First, in regards to the fatal lockup-and-die problem:  we never noticed it
here at NUACC during game play or development.  I'd guess that people who put
Monster on Big Vaxes with lots of users playing the game were more likely
to run into the problem....must be something to do with record locking and
such, although I'm not sure.  Many, many people have told me that they are
working on finding out just what is going wrong, but so far no one has come
forward with a fix (evidence as to the stickyness of the bug?).  As for
myself, I'm no longer working on Monster.  It was the product of a three
month coding frenzy which I grabbed an independant study credit for.  I thought
it would be nice to let others have my code, as I wasn't doing anything else
with it.

As far as the "bugs galore" in Monster:  sorry, that's just the way it
ended up.  I worked on it from January through March 1988.  When I came
back from spring break I decided that working on a game 90 hours a week
wasn't the best thing I could do for my grades (and social life) so I quit.
I think I may have been in the midst of some transitions in the code, and
there are certainly many hooks for features which were never implemented.
Except for the major bug causing lock-ups, the program pretty much works,
and many people like it.  It's not the Greatest Game in the Universe,
but hey, it's free.  Do I have anything YOU wrote?

> I would like to see the game have a server and use mailboxes.  Also

I don't want anyone to have the impression that I didn't know what I was
doing when I chose to use shared files for communications and one giant
10,000 line file for my program.  I discuss why I chose shared files over
mailboxes in the Monster document.  As for the 10,000 line file, I know
it goes against the conventional wisdom, but it let me easily pop around
in my code, find things *anywhere*, and in my opinion was quicker.  Getting
in and out of tpu for separate files isn't a lot of fun.  Multiple buffers,
separate modules?  Modules under VMS Pascal are a lot of overhead to work
with.  You've got to change four places in the code to switch an interface
instead of just two.

Anyway, these decisions are all behind me.  I've converted to C/Unix,
so Monster II will have many small source files and a server.

Since many people seem to have acquired Monster from friends or via
anonymous FTP you may not know about the newsletter.  There have been
only three issues so far (a fourth is in the works) but they can be useful
for highlighting and fixing certain bugs, and for putting you in touch
with other Monster hackers.  If you'd like to be on the newsletter mailing
list or receive back issues, send a note to

Merry XMAS everyone. I took this off the net a few months ago, thought 
	people might enjoy reading it....


                     *-  CHRISTMAS SHOPPING: A SURVIVOR'S GUIDE -*

                                                  -By Dave Barry

          Once again,  we come  to the  Holiday Season, a deeply religious time
     that each of us observes, in  his own  way, by  going to  the mall  of his
     choice.

          In the old days, it was not called the Holiday Season; the Christians
     called it "Christmas" and went to church; the Jews called it "Hanukka" and
     went to  synagogue; the atheists went to parties and drank. People passing
     each  other  on  the  street  would  say  "Merry   Christmas!"  or  "Happy
     Hanukka!" or (to the atheists) "Look out for the wall!"

          These days,  people say  "Season's Greetings,"  which, when you think
     about it, means nothing. It's  like  walking  up  to  somebody  and saying
     "Appropriate Remark"  in a  loud, cheerful voice. But "Season's Greetings"
     is safer, because it does not refer to  any actual  religion. Some  day, I
     imagine, even  "Season's Greetings"  will be considered too religious, and
     we'll celebrate the Holiday Season by saying "Have a nice day."

          Some of you may be unhappy with this  dereligionizing of  the Holiday
     Season,  and  you  may  have  decided  that,  this  year,  you're going to
     celebrate it  the  old-fashioned  way,  with  your  family  sitting around
     stringing cranberries  and exchanging humble, handmade gifts, like on "The
     Waltons".

      Well,  you  can  forget   it.   If   everybody   pulled   that   kind  of
     subversive  stunt,  the  economy  would collapse overnight. The government
     would have to intervene:  It  would  form  a  cabinet-level  Department of
     Holiday  Gift-Giving,  which  would  spend  billions  and  billions of tax
     dollars to buy Barbie dolls and electronic games,  which it  would drop on
     the populace  from Air  Force jets, killing and maiming thousands. So, for
     the good of the nation, you should go along with the Holiday Program. This
     means you should get a large sum of money and go to a mall.

          Unless you  live in  Indonesia, there  should be several malls within
     five miles of your home. It makes no  difference whatsoever  which one you
     go to:  Under federal  law, all  malls in  the United States must have the
     same 42 chain stores. You have your chain bookstores, your  chain clothing
     stores,  your   chain  shoe  stores,  your  chain  restrooms,  your  chain
     electronic-game arcades.

          The basic idea behind  malls is  that they  are more  convenient than
     cities.  Cities  contain  streets,  which  are  dangerous  and crowded and
     difficult to park  in.  Malls,  on  the  other  hand,  have  parking lots,
     which are  also dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but - here
     is the big difference - in mall parking lots, THERE  ARE NO  RULES. You're
     allowed to do anything. You can drive as fast as you want in any direction
     you want. I was once driving in a mall parking lot when my car  was struck
     by a  pickup truck being driven backward by a squat man with a tattoo that
     said "Charlie" on his forearm, who got out and explained  to me,  in great
     detail, why  the accident  was my  fault, his  reasoning being that he was
     violent and muscular, whereas  I was  neither. This  kind of  reasoning is
     legally valid in mall parking lots.

          So when  you get  to the  mall for  your holiday  shopping, the first
     thing to remember is that you should not park in the parking  lot and walk
     to  the  mall  buildings,  because  you will probably get killed. Instead,
     drive your car  right  up  to  and,  if  possible,  right  into,  the mall
     building. This  is perfectly  legal; people  do it all the time. In almost
     every mall I've ever been  to,  the  corridors  were  littered  with cars,
     recreational vehicles, snowmobiles and motorboats left by smart parkers.

          Once you're  safely in  the mall, you should tie your children to you
     with ropes so the other shoppers won't try  to buy  them. Holiday shoppers
     have been  whipped into  a frenzy by months of holiday advertisements, and
     they will buy anything small enough to stuff into a shopping bag.  If your
     children object  to being  tied, threaten to take them to see Santa Claus;
     that ought to shut them up.

          Now you're ready for the actual shopping. Your goal should  be to get
     it over  with as  quickly as  possible, because the longer you stay in the
     mall, the longer your children will have to listen to holiday songs on the
     mall public-address  system, and  many of  these songs can damage children
     emotionally. For example: "Frosty the  Snowman"  is  about  a  snowman who
     befriends some  children, plays  with them  until they  learn to love him,
     then melts. And "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is about a young reindeer
     who, because  of a  physical deformity,  is treated  as an  outcast by the
     other reindeer. Then along comes  good,  old  Santa.  Does  he  ignore the
     deformity? Does  he look  past Rudolph's  nose and respect Rudolph for the
     sensitive reindeer he is underneath? No. Santa asks  Rudolph to  guide his
     sleigh, as  if Rudolph  were nothing more than some kind of headlight with
     legs and a tail. So unless you want your children exposed to  this kind of
     insensitivity, you should shop quickly.

          Here is  a very efficient shopping method: Divide the amount of money
     you have  by the  number of  people on  your gift  list to  get an average
     dollar amount  per person.  So if you have $160, and you want to buy gifts
     for 10 people, your  average is  $16 per  person. Now  find something that
     costs $16,  and buy 10 of whatever it is. You'll find many useful gifts in
     this price range; for example, you  could get  10 family-sized  bottles of
     vitamin B.  Everyone, young  and old  alike, can  use vitamin  B, and your
     children are sure to shriek with delight when they find it under the tree.

          If you want to buy gifts that are a little more personal,  you should
     follow these guidelines:

                                  Gifts for Men

           Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -  that is why professional
     ice hockey is so popular  -  so buying  gifts for them is  easy.   But you
     should never  buy them  clothes.   Men believe  they already  have all the
     clothes they will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For example,
     your average man has 84 ties,  but he wears,  at most, only three of them.
     He has learned, through humiliating trial and error,  that if he wears any
     of the other 81 ties,  his wife will probably  laugh at  him  ("You're not
     going to wear THAT tie with that suit, are you?").   So he has narrowed it
     down to three safe ties,  and has gone several years without being laughed
     at. If you give him a new tie, he will pretend to like it, but deep inside
     he will hate you.

          If you  want to  give a man something practical, consider tires. More
     than once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of
     tires.

                                 Gifts for Women

          Again, you  should avoid  buying clothes, but not because women don't
     like clothes. The problem is sizes. First of  all, women's  clothing sizes
     don't mean  anything. Suppose  you're looking at a dress, and the tag says
     it's a size 14. You could  measure that  dress with  every known measuring
     instrument, checking  for every  known unit  of measurement, and you would
     never find any dimension that was  14 anythings  long. Not  only that, but
     you would never find any dimension that corresponded to the same dimension
     on any other size-14 dress. Not only that, but chances are you would never
     find any woman in the entire world who would admit to being a size 14.

          Another problem  is color.  Women do  not see  color the  way men do.
     Suppose several women are in a paint store, looking at a sample  of orange
     paint.  The  paint-can  label  may  say "orange," and the paint may appear
     obviously orange to a male, but the women will never use the word "orange"
     to describe it.

         They will say things like:   "It has a lot of blue" or  "It's much too
     gray." Don't ask me to explain it. All I know is, if  a woman  tells a man
     she'd like  a green scarf for Christmas, he'll go out and buy a scarf that
     he believes to be green, based  on his  concept of  "green," which  he got
     from crayons in the second grade. She will look at the scarf as if it were
     covered with maggots, then show it to her friends and say: "I asked Harold
     for a  green scarf,  and just  look at what he got me." They'll all have a
     good laugh, and she'll return it.

          So the  safest  gifts  for  women  are  expensive  little  bottles of
     colorless liquids, which are sold at cosmetic counters under names such as
     "Eau de Water" and "Endless Night of Heavy Petting."

                                Gifts for Children

          This is easy. You never have to figure out what to get  for children,
     because they  will tell  you exactly what they want. They spend months and
     months researching these  kinds  of  things  by  watching Saturday-morning
     cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children exactly what
     they  ask for,  even if you  disapprove of  their choices.   If your child
     thinks he wants  Murderous Bob,  the Doll with the  Face You Can Rip Right
     Off,  you had better get it.   You  may be  worried that it  might help to
     encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe me, you have not
     seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child who is convinced that
     he or she did not get the right gift.

   The following is a bibliography generated by a recent request  to
   the  net  for reference books on algorithms in general.  No names
   will be mentioned, but replies came from  many  countries  around
   the  world.   Several  people  that I consider influential in our
   field responded.  Thanks are expressed for all who responded.

   I found it amusing that there were several different combinations
   of  titles  and  authors given for "THE Dragon Book". The rumors
   are not clear as to whether the authors  (Aho,  Hopcroft,  Sethi,
   and  Ullman)  are  married to each other, or are simply joined at
   the waist from birth. :-)  You can all speculate about that among  
   yourselves.   Certainly they  have made an important contribution 
   to our field.

   People generally mentioned Knuth.  However, Knuth was  frequently
   mentioned  as  a  lower priority choice when priorities were men-
   tioned.  Many expressed difficulty with the  way algorithms  were
   given  in  Knuth.    Others  suggested  that  Knuth's  method  of
   presentation  leads to  a better  understanding of  the method of
   implementation.

   Sedgewich was a popular first choice.  However, no one  mentioned
   that there is now a second edition of this book.

   Note: This was not a scientific survey.  Votes were  cast  for  a
   reference  by mentioning it in a positive way.  In the case where
   prioritized lists were received, no weights  were  assigned.  Ti-
   tles,  Authors, etc... were taken on good faith. The existence of
   references was NOT CHECKED.

   Some people just responded by mentioning authors.  Referring to a
   book  as  "Smith, and Jones" is not always helpful, especially if
   Smith and Jones ARE really married to each other and have jointly
   written several books. I did my best to figure out which book was
   intended, without killing myself in the process.

   Some respondents  just  mentioned  titles.   Some  books  are  so
   closely related, i.e.  the  "Numerical  Recipies  in..."  series,
   that  they were grouped together.  At any  rate,  this  is   just
   an  information source for your consideration.  Neither I, nor my
   company, recommend any of them.  The following sources of inform-
   ation  are  some you  may wish to know about: A more verbose list
   is posted to the news group "comp.misc".

I told you I would press hard for this.  [maniacal laughter, giggle <snort>]

The low bandwidth on this group has prompted me to take up the suggestion
made by a fellow netter, (rec.games.programmer? We seem to be a select group.)
and try to put much of any discussion about a possible mailgame project
in rec.games.programmer.  If anyone wishes to ignore this set of postings
the simple option is to modify a kill-file entry to /mailgame./j.

Now most people and any new ones will at least get one look at the discussion
before it is tossed off.  (As opposed to the usml mailing list which took 
discussion to find out about [for me] in the first place)

I hereby proclaim mailgame.explanation to be a news SUBgroup within 
r.g.p and direct all comments regarding this and all related posting's 
*Propriety and Organization* to be responded upon here.  
   <music once again in background>

The other subgroups attempting to be "created" are thus:
  -mailgame.paradigm  
     A temporary group for decisions before any kind of m.object.design
     and m.lang.actions are "created".
  -mailgame.objects.sys
     Discussion regarding game objects and the system supporting them.
  -mailgame.lang.design
     Discussion regarding the design of a remote-control language
       for giving "orders" to any owned objects <robots,troops etc..>
  -mailgame.security
     Discussion regarding any worries about botching of the system either
       by cheating (it is mail we're talking about) or just by sending garbage.
  -mailgame.admin
     Probably boring at first, but discussion about how people get connected up
       and how they get disconnected, by wish or because of cheating.  Other
       general issues about the people on the game.
  -mailgame.mail
     About any issues regarding mail.  This includes any techniques on improving
       the performance, how to connect in any account anywhere.

<Gee, snootyness can be fun sometimes, as long as no one out there takes me
  too seriously. [I Know I Don't] >

#### Pep talk: on #####
We CAN do this!  This would be the biggest gaming use of computer nets
in an organized manner oh since just about EVER.  The enormity of the game's
payoffs is certainly enough to notice, especially because of the actual 
*original* effort that would be required. 
     There are many things that have trouble being created
because of lack of applicability or benefits to those programming.
This game should have neither problem.  Apathy is the only one. 
No one posting here will be required to do any programming, opinions are all 
we need for now.  Let's at least give it a try! 
....[ Future generations will thank us :-/ :-].....
#### Pep talk: off #####

Let Der Flaming Begin...... [and a lot of B.S.ing too]

the source handy, but if you want to have it before posting, let me know
and I can try to look it up.)

			HOW TO PROVE IT

proof by example:
	The author gives only the case n = 2 and suggests that it 
	contains most of the ideas of the general proof.

proof by intimidation:
	'Trivial'.

proof by vigorous handwaving:
	Works well in a classroom or seminar setting.

proof by cumbersome notation:
	Best done with access to at least four alphabets and special
	symbols.

proof by exhaustion:
	An issue or two of a journal devoted to your proof is useful.

proof by omission:
	'The reader may easily supply the details'
	'The other 253 cases are analogous'
	'...' 

proof by obfuscation:
	A long plotless sequence of true and/or meaningless 
	syntactically related statements.

proof by wishful citation:
	The author cites the negation, converse, or generalization of 
	a theorem from the literature to support his claims.

proof by funding:
	How could three different government agencies be wrong?

proof by eminent authority:
	'I saw Karp in the elevator and he said it was probably NP-
	complete.' 

proof by personal communication:
	'Eight-dimensional colored cycle stripping is NP-complete 
	[Karp, personal communication].' 

proof by reduction to the wrong problem:
	'To see that infinite-dimensional colored cycle stripping is 
	decidable, we reduce it to the halting problem.' 

proof by reference to inaccessible literature:
	The author cites a simple corollary of a theorem to be found 
	in a privately circulated memoir of the Slovenian 
	Philological Society, 1883.

proof by importance:
	A large body of useful consequences all follow from the 
	proposition in question.

proof by accumulated evidence:
	Long and diligent search has not revealed a counterexample.

proof by cosmology:
	The negation of the proposition is unimaginable or 
	meaningless. Popular for proofs of the existence of God.

proof by mutual reference:
	In reference A, Theorem 5 is said to follow from Theorem 3 in 
	reference B, which is shown to follow from Corollary 6.2 in 
	reference C, which is an easy consequence of Theorem 5 in 
	reference A.

proof by metaproof:
	A method is given to construct the desired proof. The 
	correctness of the method is proved by any of these 
	techniques.

proof by picture:
	A more convincing form of proof by example. Combines well 
	with proof by omission.

proof by vehement assertion:
	It is useful to have some kind of authority relation to the 
	audience.

proof by ghost reference:
	Nothing even remotely resembling the cited theorem appears in 
	the reference given.

proof by forward reference:
	Reference is usually to a forthcoming paper of the author, 
	which is often not as forthcoming as at first.

proof by semantic shift:
	Some of the standard but inconvenient definitions are changed 
	for the statement of the result.

proof by appeal to intuition:
	Cloud-shaped drawings frequently help here.

UCSD Empire is still on ucbvax.berkeley.edu.  I don't know how much
longer I'll be able to keep it there, but for the time being, that
is the place to get it.  (anonymous ftp)

the current version is 0.9.9.

                       Electronic Humor Magazine
               Edited by Brent C.J. Britton <Brent@Maine>
 
                          General Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(most recent issue = Issue023)
 
Overview:
--------
    NutWorks Electronic Humor Magazine is a free publication that is
sent out over BITNET and other computer networks.  It is a place for
writers of humorous essays, stories, and jokes to share their work with
other computer users around the world.
 
    NutWorks is "published" (nearly) once a month between September,
(or so), and June, (roughly), and (perhaps) once during the summer.
Each new issue is sent automatically to those who have signed-up on the
NutWorks subscription list, (see "Subscriptions" below).  Back issues
are placed on various network file servers, (see "Back Issues" below).
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Subscriptions:
-------------
    Subscribing to NutWorks is, for the most part, painless.  The
NutWorks subscription list is currently being maintained by the Revised
List Processor, LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET.  To receive each issue of NutWorks
automatically on the day it is published, send the following command to
LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET:
 
         SUBscribe NUTWORKS your_full_name
 
    It is requested that subscribers delete themselves from the list
in the event that their logon-id becomes inactive, removed, or assigned
to another user.  To delete yourself from the subscription list, send
this command to LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET:
 
         UNSubscribe NUTWORKS
 
    Commands may be sent to LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET via interactive
message, or from within the text of a MAIL, PUNCH, DISK DUMP, or NETDATA
format file.  Mail, for example, would look like this:
 
>   To:   Listserv@tcsvm.bitnet
>   From: <your_address>
>
>   SUB NUTWORKS Joe Schmo
 
 
    For more information about ListServ, send it the command:  INFO
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Back issues:
-----------
    Back issues of NutWorks are stored on several file servers and local
bulletin boards around the computerized world.  However, the NutWorks
staff is authorized to "advertise" the following two:
 
    CSNEWS@MAINE.BITNET
 
    CSNews will respond ONLY to commands sent as interactive messages.
Furthermore, due to space constraints, only the six most recent back
issue of NutWorks will be stored on CSNews.  To retrieve a back issue
from CSNews, send it the command:
 
         SENDME NUTWORKS ISSUExxx  FROM EMAGS
 
where "xxx" is a 3-digit issue number.  No wildcards are allowed, so the
entire issue number must be specified, i.e NUTWORKS ISSUE023.
 
    LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET
 
All existing issues of NutWorks are currently being stored on ListServ.
Commands may be sent to LISTSERV@TCSVM.BITNET via interactive message,
or from within the text of a MAIL, PUNCH, DISK DUMP, or NETDATA format
file.  To retrieve a back issue from ListServ, send it the command:
 
         GET NUTWORKS ISSUExxx
 
where "xxx" is a 3-digit issue number, no wildcards.
 
    Please do not send mail or other files regarding NutWorks -- except
for subscription or back issue requests -- to either of these service
machines.  Please send inquiries to the editor.
 
    Users who maintain file servers are asked to inform the editor if
issues of NutWorks are available on their server, and whether the server
may be considered a source of back issues for the general internet
community.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Articles:
--------
    Readers of NutWorks are strongly encouraged to send humorous articles
on ANY topic to the editor for publication.  Original material which has
not appeared previously in public magazines, forums, bulletin boards,
or newsletters is prefered.
 
    We need writers.  The future of NutWorks depends on the amount of
submissions we receive.  If you are interested in writing humorous
commentaries, essays, jokes, etc., and are also interested in sharing
your work on a more-or-less monthly basis, then we are interested in
hearing from you!  Our only concerns are that your work is new and
original, and that it is in reasonably good taste.  Oh, and it should
also be funny...
 
    Let us hear from you!  Contributions should be sent ONLY to the
editor, Brent@Maine.BITNET.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A few serious notes: (G-minor-7th with an added fourth)
-------------------
    Some computer sites do not condone offnode communication or file
transfer by students and/or staff.  Please do not contact us if your
account or your site is in any way restricted against offnode
communication.
 
    NutWorks magazine is in no way affiliated with any university, any
computing facility, or any legal entity anywhere.  It is requested by the
editorial staff that the name "NutWorks" not be used by other individuals
without permission.

    If the files got to your site through a Bitnet site.. then chances are that
they were garbled.. Bitnet has the nasty habit of eating spaces at the end
of a line.. and the occasional character in between..
    I really don't know what to do for you.. Did any archive site pick up
the database and get it all uncompressed/uudecoded properly? If so can you tell
and make it availiable to all.
     Thanx,
         Trev

The following advertisement appeared in one of the munition magazines:

  The Guy on the Right Doesn't Stand a Chance.  The guy on the right
has the Osborne 1, a fully functional computer system in a portable
package the size of a briefcase.  The guy on the left has an Uzi
submachine gun concealed in his attache case.  Also in the case are
four fully loaded, 32 round clips of 125 grain 9 mm ammunition.

  The owner of the Uzi is going to get more tactical firepower
delivered -- and delivered on target -- in less time and with less
effort.

  All for $795.  It's inevitable.

  If you're going up against some guy with an Osborne 1 -- or any
personal computer -- he's the one whose in trouble.  One round from an
Uzi can zip through ten inches of solid pine wood, so you can imagine
what it will do to structural foam acrylic and sheet aluminum.  In
fact, detachable magazines for the Uzi are available in 25-, 32-, and
40-round capacities, so you can take out an entire office full of
Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied into Ethernet or other local
area networks.

  What about the new 16-bit computers, like the Lisa and Fortune?
Even with the Winchester backup they're no match for the Uzi.  One
quick burst and they'll find what UNIX means.

  Make your commanding officer proud.  Get an Uzi -- and come home a
winner in the fight for office automatic weapons.

I was looking for something in the foreign words and phrases sec-

   peine forte et dure [F] : strong and hard punishment : torture

Lady Torture? Sounds intriguing!

I know this is a bit off the original subject, but I'm curious if I'm the
first to notice a bit of an inside joke (it's too obvious to be a
coincidence) about the character's name in "Keeper of Trakken" whom the
Master inhabits.  That character's name was Tremas, which is (at least to
me), an obvious anagram of ... well, you see it, right?

(Oh, and I guess I should apologize for the terrible pun in the title line,
but I just couldn't resist.)

The Court of King George III
London, England

July 10, 1776

Mr. Thomas Jefferson
c/o The Continental Congress
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Dear Mr. Jefferson:

We have read your "Declaration of Independence" with great interest.
Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your
statements do merit serious consideration.  Unfortunately, the Declaration
as a whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to
the Crown, so we must return the document to you for further refinement.
The questions which follow might assist you in your process of revision:

1.  In your opening paragraph you use the phrase "the Laws of Nature and
    Nature's God."  What are these laws?  In what way are they the criteria
    on which you base your central arguments?  Please document with
    citations from the recent literature.

2.  In the same paragraph you refer to the "opinions of mankind."  Whose
    polling data are you using?  Without specific evidence, it seems to
    us the "opinions of mankind" are a matter of opinion.

3.  You hold certain truths to be "self-evident."  Could you please
    elaborate.  If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be
    difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.

4.  "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" seem to be the goals of
    your proposal.  These are not measurable goals.  If you were to say that
    "among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in
    six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers
    in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to
    raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next
    10 years," these could be measurable goals.  Please clarify.

5.  You state that "Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
    these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it,
    and to institute a new Government...."  Have you weighed this assertion
    against all the alternatives?  What are the trade-off considerations?

6.  Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive.  Such a
    long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not
    follow it.  Your problem statement needs improvement.

7.  Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all.  You
    state that the colonies "ought to be Free and Independent States," and
    that they are "Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown."  Who
    or what must change to achieve this objective?  In what way must they
    change?  What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance?
    How long will it take?  We have found that a little foresight in these
    areas helps to prevent careless errors later on.  How cost-effective are
    your strategies?

8.  Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing
    your strategy?  Who conceived it?  Who provided the theoretical research?
    Who will constitute the advisory committee?  Please submit an organization
    chart and vitas of the principal investigators.

9.  You must include an evaluation design.  We have been requiring this
    since Queen Anne's War.

10. What impact will your problem have?  Your failure to include any
    assessment of this inspires little confidence in the long-range
    prospects of your undertaking.

11. Please submit a PERT diagram, an activity chart, itemized budget, and
    manpower utilization matrix.


We hope that these comments prove useful in revising your "Declaration of
Independence."  We welcome the submission of your revised proposal.  Our due
date for unsolicited proposals is July 31, 1776.  Ten copies with original
signatures will be required.


Sincerely,


Management Analyst to the British Crown

Pacific Lumber Company was about the last of its breed - a redwood
logging company that understood the concept of sustained yield
(i.e., if you cut too many trees before they grow back, you
eventually run out of them.)  They also own almost all the old
growth redwood timber remaining on private land in California -
about 3,000 acres.  While they were planning to log those stands,
their schedule had been a relatively responsible one - about a 100
acres a year for 30 years.

All that has changed.  Pacific Lumber was acquired in a leveraged
Wall Street-style buyout. And what better way to replenish the
the corporate coffers than with proceeds from logging old growth
timber, the most lucrative of all?  Hence the company's sudden of
plans - to log its ancient forest in only 15-20 years.

Of course, the locals south of Eureka are very concerned.  While the
company is now hiring new people, future employment prospects with
the company look bleak.  Moreover, once an ancient forest is gone,
from a PRACTICAL standpoint it's gone forever.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

Write to the company, urging them to sell the 3,000 ancient (old growth)
forest to the people of the state.  (They would still own over 200,000
acres of forest.)  If they agree to sell, legislators will carry a bond
act for the November 1990 ballot.

Along with no 3rd party standing to sue insurance companies, this is another
side effect the voting public were not aware of when they vote Bird and the
others out of the court. The high cost of the death penalty. Sigh.
