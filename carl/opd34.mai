ASP version 7 has been installed in SYS on all Dallas systems.
The previous version of ASP could not handle a structure of 14 units of 3652
disks (like system 55).  This new version of ASP has been running in
Fremont for several months.  /Joe

Subject: "The TYM file for node 4200 has"... 

The TYM file for node 4200 has some discrepencies which may have caused
NW4200.BND to fail.  It has ZITEL=0, NDP=128, and CONSAT=0 whereas all the
other EBUS bases have ZITEL=1, NDP=256, and CONSAT=1.  ZITEL=0 is valid
only for MAC I with core memory, not MAC II with semiconductor memory.

The new TYM file has been telecopied to (EBUS) and the new BND file has
been stored in (TYMNET:25) and (TYMNET:33)NW4200.BND.

Please try this file on the next scheduled reload of D34.    /Joe
