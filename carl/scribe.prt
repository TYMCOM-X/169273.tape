                                      ABSTRACT                                      ________

       SCRIBE is a program providing interactive development of a document in
       rough  draft form, which can be immediately printed in a finished form
       suitable for publication.  The document is prepared and modified  with
       any  standard  text editor (for instance, DEC's TECO or SOS, or MDSI's
       QED may be used).  In  addition  to  text,  the  rough  document  file
       contains  special  characters  and commands which are not printed, but
       which control the format of the finished copy.  A few other formatting
       options are also specified from the terminal when the program is run.

       SCRIBE  provides  the  following  formatting functions, all under user
       control:

            1)  Pagination of the document,  including  such  things  as                __________
                page  size,  margins (at the top and bottom of pages, in
                addition to left and right), numbering, titles, etc.
            2)  Margin Justification, producing  right-justified  output                ______ _____________
                with  a  minimum  left margin.  Indentation of justified
                text from  both  the  right  and  left  margins  may  be
                controlled by the user.
            3)  Decapitalization of input text, facilitating preparation                ________________
                of documents on terminals without lower case.
            4)  Underlining of output text, on line printers as well  as                ___________
                terminals.
            5)  Access   to   special   terminal   functions,   such  as                              _______   ________   _________
                superscripting,  subscripting,  and  boldfacing  on  the
                Diablo and Xerox terminals.                ______     _____

       The first section of the manual describes the concepts and defines the
       terminology  required  to  use   SCRIBE,   and   to   understand   the
       documentation  in  the rest of the manual.  The remaining sections are
       essentially a reference manual detailing how to  utilize  the  various
       capabilities offered by SCRIBE.  The discussion is parsimonious in the
       use of examples, since  the  intention  is  to  present  all  relevent
       information in a very terse and thus readily referenced format.

                                 1. BASIC CONCEPTS                                    _____ ________

   1.1 Page Width       ____ _____

       SCRIBE  segments  the  document into pages, defined by a line width in                                            _____                    _____
       characters  and  a  page  length  in  lines.  The  width  is   further                                 ______
       subdivided  into  a  left  margin and left indentation, which together                                  ______     ____ ___________
       specify the number of spaces to the left of printed text, and a  right                                                                        _____
       indentation,  specifying  the number of spaces to the right of printed       ___________
       text.  Thus,

         spaces available for text=width-(margin+right indent+left indent)

       Normally, the indentations are zero, and the margin and  width  define
       the  maximum  extent  of  printed  text.  For example, on a Silent 700
       terminal, which has an intrinsic margin of 2 (the print head  after  a
       carriage  return  is  two  positions  to  the  left of the edge of the
       paper), to define a 70 space line centered on the page, one would  set
       the  width=75 and the margin=5.  Since the paper is 84 positions wide,
       this would leave 7 spaces to the left (margin+2) and 7 spaces  to  the
       right (84-(width+2)).

       To  further shorten lines, the right and/or left indentations would be
       increased.  For example, before the list of SCRIBE  functions  in  the
       previous section, the right indentation was set to 5.  While one might
       argue that this could be accomplished by  resetting  width=70,  it  is
       simpler  to change the indentation, since it is relative to the width,
       and thus, one need not know what the  current  width  is  to  increase
       indentation  by 5.  In general, the best practice is to set margin and
       width once, corresponding to the paper size, and then  to  change  the
       right  and/or  left indentations in the remainder of the document.  If
       this is done, the document can readily be printed on  different  paper
       sizes  since  the  margin  and  width can be entered from the teletype
       (refer to the following section describing commands).

   1.2 Page Length       ____ ______

       Pages are subdivided lengthwise into header  lines  at  the  top,  and                                                                    ___
       trailer  lines  at  the  bottom,  with  lines  of text in between.  In                                ______
       addition to blank lines, the header may contain title line(s) and/or a
       page  number.  The  trailer  may  contain  a page number (if it is not
       printed at the top), and/or footnote  line(s).  Page  numbers  may  be
       printed on the left, centered, or on the right of pages.

       If  both  a  title  and  a page number are printed at the top, and the
       number is not centered (justification  has  been  specified  for  it),
       their  relative  position is determined by the position of the number,
       as shown in the following diagram.  If the number is to  be  centered,
       it will always be printed centered before the first title line.

               |                             |
       if NUMBER RIGHT and TITLE RIGHT:
        <spaces><spaces><title><space><number>

       The  preceding  discussion  also applies to the last footnote line, if                                                       ____
       numbers are being printed at the bottom of pages and  are  not  to  be                                        ______
       centered.

       A  backslash  appearing  in a title/footnote is translated to the page
       number that the title/footnote is printed on.  Page  numbers,  if  not
       printed  on  the  same  line  as  a title/footnote, are printed before                                                                       ______
       titles, and after footnotes.                   _____

       If page numbers  are  printed  at  the  top/bottom,  a  minimum  of  3
       header/trailer  lines  must  be  specified.  If  a  title/footnote  is
       printed, a minimum of 2 more header/trailer lines than the  number  of
       title/footnote  lines  are  necessary.  If  both  a title/footnote and
       centered number are printed, 3 more than the number of  title/footnote
       lines   are  required.  An  insufficient  number  of  lines  causes  a
       diagnostic to be printed on the  terminal  and  the  printing  of  the
       title/footnote and/or number to be suppressed.

   1.3 Processing Modes       __________ _____

       SCRIBE  is  capable  of  processing input text and producing output in
       four  different  ways,  referred  to  a  verbatim,   centered,   right                                                ________    ________    _____
       justified,  and  justified.  In  verbatim  mode,  lines  are  read and       _________        _________
       written exactly as they appear on the file,  except  that  spaces  are
       inserted before as defined by the current margin and left indentation.
       SCRIBE allows the right indentation to be violated in this  mode,  but
       width violations will cause a diagnostic.  This mode is typically used
       when printing figures, tables, and so on.

       Right justified and centered modes are similar to  verbatim,  in  that
       the  text  of  lines  is  output  in the same form as it is input.  In
       centered mode, the text  is  centered  in  the  available  text  space
       (width-indentations-margin),  while  in right justified mode, the text
       is right justified in the  available  space.  As  in  verbatim,  right
       indentation   violations  are  allowed  (input  line  is  longer  than
       available space) but width violations are diagnosed.  These modes  are
       useful for section headers, and other such things.

       In  justified  mode,  the  input  is  segmented  into words (non-blank                                                             _____

       SCRIBE-10 Manual
       Version 3.0  18-August-78


       strings delimited  by  blank(s)  and/or  line  boundaries),  and  then
       reassembled  into  output  lines of length equal to the available text
       space.  If necessary, extra blanks are inserted between words  to  pad
       lines  out  to  the  desired length.  This mode produces even left and
       right margins, and thus is the normal processing mode.

       If $JUSTIFY LEFT is specified, SCRIBE will not insert extra blanks  to
       pad  lines.  This  produces  lines  of nearly equal length, giving the
       appearance of a manually typed document.

       Since line boundaries and extraneous spaces are ignored in the  input,
       preparation  and  especially  modification of document text is greatly
       simplified.  For example, words can be inserted in, or  deleted  from,
       the  middle  of  input  lines without worrying about the length of the
       edited line.

       Justification of contiguous word blocks, corresponding  to  paragraphs
       or  outline  entries  in  the  finished  document, is usually desired.
       Thus, it is necessary to have a way to tell SCRIBE where  a  justified
       block  ends  (and  perhaps  where  a new one begins).  Such a point is
       called  a  justification  break.  In  SCRIBE,  any  and  all  commands                  _____________  _____
       (described  in  the  next  section)  cause a justification break, if a
       block of justified text is currently being processed, in  addition  to
       whatever  other  effects  they may have.  There are two commands which
       are typically used to  break  justification,  namely:  $SKIP  (causing
       blank  line(s)  to  be  printed),  and  $PARAGRAPH (modifying the left
       indentation of the first line in the next block of text).

   1.4 Commands       ________

       Formatting parameters are set by commands in the input file, which are                                        ________
       read  and  processed  by  SCRIBE,  but  not output.  Command lines are
       identified by a dollar sign ($) in the first column, and, as described
       earlier, cause an immediate justification break.  An imperative, which
       identifies  the  command,  immediately  follows   the   dollar   sign.
       Typically,  the  imperative  identifies a parameter to be changed, and
       the following items in the command line give the new value  it  is  to                     _____
       assume.  Items  may  be  keywords  (alphabetic  strings  delimited  by
       blank(s)), integers (which occasionally may  be  signed),  or  strings
       (arbitrary  characters enclosed in primes).  Any imperative or keyword
       may be abbreviated to a minimum of its first  3  characters.  Multiple              ___________                     _____  _  __________
       commands  on  the same line are allowed ('$ski $par 5'), but the first
       column of the line must contain a dollar sign.

       Commands are divided into  two  groups:  those  specifying  pagination                                                                   __________
       parameters, and those specifying line parameters (for want of a better                                        ____
       name).  Commands in the first group set such things as line width  and
       page  length,  and  do not take effect until the beginning of the next                                                        _________ __ ___ ____
       printed page.  Commands in the second group take  effect  immediately.       _______ ____                                              ___________
       It  is  important to note that pagination commands at the beginning of                                                                 _________ __
       the input file or immediately following a PAGE command (see  the  next       ___ _____ ____    ___________ _________ _ ____ _______
       section),  take  effect immediately, since SCRIBE is positioned at the                               ___________
       beginning of printed page.

       Erroneous command lines are printed on the user's  terminal,  followed

       The following conventions are used in this section to describe command
       syntax:

            1)  Optional item(s) are enclosed in brackets.
            2)  When  one of several items may appear at a certain point
                in a command, items are  separated  by  commas.  If  the
                items  are  optional,  they are enclosed in brackets, if
                they are required, they are enclosed in parenthesis (but
                individual required items are not).
            3)  Abbreviations are not shown.  However, any imperative or
                keyword may be abbreviated to as little as its  first  3
                characters.
            4)  The initial dollar sign on commands is not shown.  It is
                important to remember that  it  must  be  included  when
                entering command lines.

       Imperatives  and  keywords  may be entered in upper or lower case, and
       are implicitly converted to upper case.  Characters within strings are
       not  converted,  thus  allowing titles containing both upper and lower
       case.

   2.1 Pagination Commands  (Take effect at top of next page)       __________ ________

         BOTTOM (integer,TERMINAL)

           Sets the page trailer length in lines.  If TERMINAL is  specified,
           the  user is prompted at the terminal to enter the length.  BOTTOM
           must be set to at least three if page numbers are to be printed at
           the  bottom,  and to at least two more than the number of footnote
           lines (three more if centered page numbers are also printed at the
           bottom).

           The default value is 6 lines (generally = 1").

         FOOTNOTES ( [LEFT,RIGHT] string ) ...

           Defines  a  footnote (effectively a title printed at the bottom of
           pages) to  be  printed  on  subsequent  pages.  Characters  within
           footnote  string(s)  are decapitalized and/or underlined if either
           of these options is in effect (see later sections).  A  string  is                                                                   ______
           any number of characters enclosed in primes ('), i.e. 'Report'.  A
           prime may be included in a string by  doubling  it;  for  example,
           ''''  produces  a single prime on output.  Multiple line footnotes                                                      ________ ____
           are specified by multiple strings following  the  imperative;  the
           command  "$footnotes  'Here'  'Now' will cause a two line footnote
           with "Here" centered on the first line and "Now" centered  on  the
           second.  Footnote  strings  may be justified to either the left or
           right margin by  preceding  the  string  with  LEFT  or  RIGHT  as
           indicated   above.  If  neither  is  specified,  strings  will  be
           centered (unless it  is  the  last  footnote  line  and  justified
           numbers are being printed at the bottom.  See the previous section

           Page Length for a discussion of this case.) As  indicated  in  the           ____ ______
           syntax   above,   multiple   footnote   lines  may  be  specified.
           Justification must be specified for each line, thus if you wish to
           have  a  three line footnote justified left, you must precede each
           of strings with LEFT.  The current page number may be included  in
           a  footnote line by typing a backslash.  When the line is printed,
      the backslash will be replaced by the current  page  number.  This
           allows  you to format your own page numbers, rather than using the
           default numbering formats.  In this case, generally $NUMBER OFF is
           specified to suppress default number printing (note that this does
           not suppress incrementing of page numbers).  To cancel printing of           ___
           footnotes, type either $FOOTNOTES OFF or $FOOTNOTES ''.

           In the default case, SCRIBE does not print any footnotes, e.g., it
           defaults to $FOOTNOTES OFF.

         LENGTH (integer,TERMINAL)

           Sets the page length.  TERMINAL causes the user  to  be  prompted.
           If  LENGTH  is  set  to  a  value  greater than zero, it must at a
           minimum be equal to TOP+BOTTOM+2.  However, if LENGTH  is  set  to
           zero,  SCRIBE  will not automatically paginate the document, i.e.,
           only explicit page skips forced by  the  $PAGE  command  described
           below  will  cause  a  header/trailer  to  be printed and the page
           number to be incremented.  This option is typically useful in  the
           initial stages of document preparation.

           The default value is 66 lines (generally = 11").

         MARGIN (integer,TERMINAL)

           Sets  the  left  margin  in  character  positions.  If TERMINAL is
           specified, the user is prompted.

           The default value is 5.

         NUMBER OFF                                (Turns off page numbering)
         NUMBER [TOP,BOTTOM] [ALTERNATE] [RIGHT,LEFT] [integer]

           Specifies what page numbering is  to  take  place.  TOP  specifies
           that  numbers  are to be printed in the page header (at the top of
           the page), and BOTTOM, that they are to be printed in the trailer.
           If  neither  is  specified,  BOTTOM  is  assumed.  RIGHT  or  LEFT
           specifies the justification of the numbers.  If neither is  given,
           the  numbers will be centered.  If an integer is given, it will be
           the number of the next  page  (and  will  be  incremented  by  one
           subsequently).  If  no  integer  is given, numbering will continue
           with the current page number.  It is important to note  that  even
           when numbering is turned OFF, SCRIBE continues to count pages, but
           does not number  them.  Thus,  if  numbering  is  resumed  without
           specifying  an  integer,  the next number printed will equal (last
           number printed+number of unnumbered pages since+1).

           ALTERNATE causes the page number  to  be  printed  on  alternating
           sides  of  the page.  ALTERNATE or ALTERNATE RIGHT prints the page
           number on the right on odd pages, and on the left on  even  pages;
           ALTERNATE  LEFT  the  reverse.  Note  that the page number used to
           determine the position of the printed page number is the  physical                                                                     ________
           page  number,  and  not the number specified in the NUMBER command
           (if any).

           Default page numbering starts at 1, and numbers  are  centered  at
           the  bottom  of  pages.  The previous section entitled Page Length                                                                  ____ ______
           should be consulted for details on the format in which numbers are
           printed.

         TITLE ( [LEFT,RIGHT] string ) ...

           Specifies the title to be printed on subsequent pages.  The syntax
           and behavior of this command are the same as the FOOTNOTES command
           (except that titles are printed at the top of pages), and thus the                                                  ___
           documentation of the FOOTNOTES command should  be  consulted.  The
           previous  section  Page  Length should be consulted for details on                              ____  ______
           title/page number interaction.

           SCRIBE defaults to no title.

         TOP (integer,TERMINAL)

           Sets the page header length in lines.  TERMINAL causes the user to
           be  prompted.  TOP  must  be set to at least three if page numbers
           are to be printed, or to at least two  more  than  the  number  of
           title lines (three more if centered numbers are also printed).

           The default value is 6 lines.

         WIDTH (integer,TERMINAL)

           Sets the page width.  TERMINAL causes the user to be prompted.

           The  default  value is 75, which, with the default margin of 5, is
           typically the best  combination  for  a  70  space  line  on  most
           terminals.

   2.2 Line Commands  (Take immediate effect)       ____ ________

         CENTER

           SCRIBE will center subsequent lines ("centering mode").                                                 _________

         CONTROL (ON,OFF)

           Controls  processing  of  character commands, described in a later
           section.  There are various character  commands,  all  having  the
           forms "^[<number>] <letter>" and "|<letter>" anywhere in the text.
           When CONTROL is ON,  character  commands  are  processed,  and  an

       SCRIBE-10 Manual
       Version 3.0  18-August-78


           up-arrow  must be entered as ^^ and a vertical bar as ||.  CONTROL
           OFF causes up-arrows and vertical bars to  be  treated  as  normal
           characters.

           SCRIBE defaults to CONTROL ON.

         DECAP (ON,OFF)

           Turns  decapitalization of alphabetic characters either ON or OFF.
           The effect of decapitalization being on is described  in  a  later
           section.

           SCRIBE defaults to DECAP OFF.

         ENTRY string

           Stores  the  string in a temporary location for later use with the
           TOC command, described later.  The string  may  contain  ^#'s  and
           backslashes  (\)  to  store  the current section and page numbers,                                            _______
           respectively.

         INCLUDE filename

           Includes the text of the  specified  file  at  the  point  of  the
           INCLUDE  command.  If  the  specified  file  cannot  be  opened, a
           diagnostic is printed and processing continues as if the file were
           empty.  SCRIBE  will  have open at any one time a maximum of eight
           input files, i.e.  one "main" input file and seven nested  include
           files.  If  this  maximum  is  reached,  all  subsequently  nested
           include files will be treated as empty files.

         INDENT (RIGHT,LEFT) [ [+,-]integer ]

           Sets the RIGHT or LEFT indentation.  If no integer is  given,  the
           indentation  will  be  set to zero.  If the integer is signed, the
           current indentation is incremented by its value, e.g., if  current                                  ___________
           left  indent is 5, then $INDENT LEFT -2 sets new indentation to 3.
           If   the   integer   is   not   signed,    its    value    becomes
           the?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
           ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????tion,
           relative  displacements, i.e.  $PAR +n, should be used.  Note that
           using absolute numbers to specify indentations after  a  POSITIONS
           command  can  lead  to  unpredictable  results.  A  maximum  of  8
           positions may be defined, corresponding to levels 1-8 in the LEVEL
           command.  The  default is all ones, meaning that no indentation is
           to take place at any level section.  If fewer than 8 positions are
           specified, then the remaining positions are assumed to be the same
           as the last position given.

         RIGHT

           Causes SCRIBE to print subsequent lines right justified.

         SECTION [section number]

           Sets or increments the current  section  number.  If  the  section
           number is omitted, then the subsection number at the current level
           is incremented.  If the section number is given, it is taken to be
           the  new  section  number, and the current level is set to the the
           number of subsections in the section number.

           Section numbers are of the form:
               [integer [.integer [.integer]...  ]]
           A section number like "2" (integer) is a level 1  section  number,                                                    _____ _
           "3.4.0"  (integer.integer.integer)  is  a  level 3 section number,                                                      _____ _
           etc.  The SECTION  command  without  a  specified  section  number
           increments the number associated with the current level only.  For                                                     _______ _____
           example, if the section number is "3.4.0" when a  SECTION  command
           is  given,  then  it  will  become  "3.4.1".  Here  are a few more
           examples:

                     section = 2.0.9
                $SECTION
                     section = 2.0.10
                $LEVEL +1
                     section = 2.0.10.0
                $SECTION 3.3
                     section = 3.3
                $LEVEL 4
                     section = 3.3.0.0
                $LEVEL -3
                     section = 3

           The character pair ^# is translated by  SCRIBE  into  the  current                              __
           section  number  whenever  it is encountered.  The CONTROL command
           has no effect on this translation.  If the  characters,  "^#"  are
           desired in the output text, type "^^#".

         SKIP [integer]

           Causes SCRIBE to output the number of blank lines specified by the
           integer.  If no integer is given, one blank line will  be  output.
           If an integer greater than 1 is given, SCRIBE will not skip beyond
           the top of the next page.  Also, a  SKIP  encountered  immediately
           after  a  page break not forced by a PAGE command will be ignored,                                ___
           to avoid the printing of spurious lines at the top of pages.

         SPACING [integer]

           Specifies the  inter-line  spacing  (the  number  of  blank  lines
           between   printed   text   lines).   $SPACING   1  corresponds  to
           single-spacing (no blank lines),  $SPACING  2  to  double-spacing,
           etc.

           SCRIBE defaults to single-spacing.

         TABS [integer [[,] integer]...  ]

           Specifies  successive  column  positions  for  tabs (control-I) in
           verbatim mode.  In all other modes, tabs are  completely  ignored,           ________
           i.e.,  they  are  discarded.  As one might expect, tabs are useful
           for preparing tables to be printed  verbatim.  Tab  positions  are
           relative to the left margin as defined by $MARGIN, $INDENT, and/or           ________
           $PARAGRAPH.  Thus, if the first defined tab stop is  5,  the  left
           indentation  is 2, and the margin 5, the first tab stop will be at
           absolute column 12.  The fact that tabs are relative allows tables
           to  be shifted left or right without affecting the relative column
           positions.  Unfortunately, tab positions are not settable  on  the
           PDP/10, and are always printed at intervals of 8 characters.  This
           makes table preparation with tabs more of a chore, as  you  cannot
           see what the tables will actually look like when editing, but must
           run the document through SCRIBE.  When beyond the last  tab  stop,
           or if no tabs are specified, a tab is printed as a single space in
           verbatim mode.

           SCRIBE defaults to no defined tab stops.  To return to the default
           state, type $TABS by itself.

         TOC

           Includes all of the entries previously stored by ENTRY commands at
           the point of the TOC (Table  of  Contents)  command.  The  storage                                 _      _   _
           used  to  hold  the  entries is then cleared.  A standard table of
           contents can be made rather easily by doing the following:

              After each $SECTION and $LEVEL command, give the command
                  $ENTRY '^# <tab> <section name> <tab> \'

              Then, at the end of the input file, the command sequence

                  $TABS 10,60
                  $VERBATIM
                  $SPACING 2
                  SECTION <tab> <tab> PAGE

                  $TOC

              will produce the desired table of contents.

         TRANSLATE [ <string1> <string2> ]

           Causes SCRIBE to translate characters occuring in  <string1>  into
           the   corresponding   characters  in  <string2>.  $TRA  '|+'  '\&'
           translates all vertical bars into backslashes, and all plus  signs
           to ampersands.

           <string1> must be at least as long as <string2>; characters at the
           end of <string1> with no corresponding characters in <string2> are
           left   alone.  A  TRANSLATE  command  with  no  strings  specified

           character  processing,  i.e. underlining,  has been performed, and
           does not affect backslashes in titles.  The  effect  of  TRANSLATE
           commands  are  cumulative;  the above example could be obtained by
           the two commands "$TRA '|' '\' $TRA '+' '&' ".

           SCRIBE defaults to $TRA '\' ' ' (backslash to space).

         UNDERLINE (ON,OFF)

           Turns underline processing ON or OFF.  The effect  of  underlining
           being ON is described in a later section.

           SCRIBE defaults to UNDERLINE ON.

         VERBATIM

           Causes  SCRIBE  to print subsequent text lines exactly as entered,
           applying only the margin and left indentation.

                               3. TEXT JUSTIFICATION                                  ____ _____________

       This section discusses a few other details on text justification which
       have  not  been  covered  previously.  Recall  that when text is being
       justified, SCRIBE segments the input into words, which are strings  of                                                 _____
       non-blank  characters  delimited  by blank(s) and/or carriage returns.
       It then reassembles words into  lines  of  uniform  length,  inserting
       space(s) between words to pad the lines out to the desired length.

   3.1 Specifying Fixed Word Spacing       __________ _____ ____ _______

       Occasionally in justified text, it is necessary to have a fixed number
       of space(s) between words.  This  can  be  accomplished  by  typing  a
       backslash  at  points  where  the printing of a space is desired.  The       _________
       backslash will be converted  to  a  space  when  it  is  printed.  For
       example, in outline format, one typically wants two spaces between the
       number, e.g., "2)", and the first word of the  entry.  Separating  the
       number and the last word with two backslashes will do this.

   3.2 Spacing After Punctuation       _______ _____ ___________

       SCRIBE  insures  that  there  are at least 2 spaces after words ending
       with the following characters:  period (.), colon (:),  question  mark
       (?),  and  exclamation  point (!).  If only one space is desired after
       such a word, for instance, between someone's initial and last name, it
       should be separated from the next word by a single backslash.

                                   4. UNDERLINING                                      ___________

       If  underlining  is  on  (SCRIBE's default mode, or if an UNDERLINE ON
       command is in  effect),  text  enclosed  in  ampersands  (&)  will  be
       underlined,  and  the  ampersands will be removed.  Spaces within text
       enclosed in ampersands are not underlined.  Thus, "&underlined  text&"
       will be printed as underlined text.                          __________ ____

   4.1 Underlining Spaces       ___________ ______

       If  spaces  are  to  be underlined, type backslashes instead of spaces
       within ampersands.  The backslashes will be converted  to  spaces  and                                                                          ___
       underlined on output.       __________

   4.2 Printing Ampersands       ________ __________

       When  underlining  is on, a double ampersand (&&) in the input will be
       converted to a single ampersand on output, even within  text  enclosed                                                  ____ ______  ____  ________
       in single ampersands.  Thus, "&R&&D&" will be printed as "R&D".       __ ______ __________                                      ___

   4.3 Method of Underlining       ______ __ ___________

       SCRIBE  normally  underlines  by  printing  the line of text, and then
       overprints a line of underscores (_) and spaces.  This method produces
       correct output on line printers, and almost all terminals.

       SCRIBE  can  also  underline  by backspacing within the line, and then
       printing underscores.  This is the only method which works on  an  IBM
       2741  (Selectric)  terminal.  It  also  works on most other terminals,
       although not on line printers.

       The method used can be selected by a switch, which is input  from  the                                            ______
       terminal  when  SCRIBE  is  run.  Switches  are described in the final
       section of this manual.

                                5. DECAPITALIZATION                                   ________________

       If the terminal you are using for document preparation has both  upper
       and  lower case, you can skip this section, since it is much easier to
       use the shift key on your terminal than it is  to  enter  the  special
       characters  indicating  character case to SCRIBE.  However, if all you
       have is an ASR33, or somehow you get stuck  on  one  to  prepare  your
       document, turn decapitalization on with the DECAP ON command, and read
       on.

       When decapitalization is on, output character case  is  determined  by
       special  characters  in  the  input (asterisks and atsigns), which are
       removed before the text is output.  In actuality, SCRIBE decapitalizes                                                                _____________
       all  alphabetic  characters  in  this  mode,  except those modified by
       special characters, which are left alone.  Thus,  SCRIBE,  in  effect,                                     ____ _____
       assumes that all text entered in this mode in upper case, and that the
       special  characters  indicate  which  characters   are   not   to   be
       decapitalized.

   5.1 Capitalizing Single Characters       ____________ ______ __________

       Any  character preceeded by an asterisk (*) will not be decapitalized,
       and the asterisk will be removed from  the  text.  This  is  typically
       used  to capitalize the first character of a word, for example, at the
       beginning of sentences, or in names.  To print a single asterisk, type
       a double asterisk in the input.

   5.2 Capitalizing Strings       ____________ _______

       All  characters enclosed in atsigns (@) will not be decapitalized, and
       the enclosing atsigns will be removed.  Strings  enclosed  in  atsigns
       may  contain  any  character  (including blank), and may extend across
       multiple input lines.

       Within such strings, an asterisk is treated as a normal character, and
       is  printed.  Thus,  you  must  indicate that characters are not to be
       decapitalized by either enclosing them in atsigns,  or  by  preceeding                        ______
       them with an asterisk, not by doing both.                              ___

       Anytime  that  decapitalization  is on, to print a single atsign, type
       two atsigns in the input (even within strings enclosed in atsigns).

       A good practice is to minimize  the  length  of  strings  enclosed  in
       atsigns,  perhaps  to  single  words,  but certainly to strings on one

       input line.  This avoids errors,  such  as  omitting  the  terminating
       atsign  of  a  string  when  entering  the  document, or inadvertantly
       inserting a string enclosed in  atsigns  within  another  string  when
       modifying the document.

   5.3 Decapitalization and Underlining       ________________ ___ ___________

       It  is  important  to  note  that decapitalization is performed before                                                                       ______
       underlining.    Thus,    asterisks    and/or     atsigns     effecting
       decapitalization    should    occur   within   ampersands   indicating
       underlining.  For example, type "&*SMITH&", not "*&SMITH&",  and  type
       "&@GOD@&" rather than "@&GOD&@".

   5.4 Special Non-alphabetic Translation       _______ ______________ ___________

       When   decapitalization   is   on,   the  following  equivalences  are
       established:

       #[ --- {    #\ --- |     #] --- }    #^ --- ~

       since most terminals  without  lower  case  do  not  have  these  four
       characters.  A  pound  sign  (#)  preceding any other character has no
       effect.  An asterisk (*) before the  pound  sign  defeats  pound  sign
       processing; i.e.  "*#[" appears literally.

                               6. CHARACTER COMMANDS                                  _________ ________

       Character  commands  invoke  immediate  special processing, similar to
       underlining  with   "&"   and   capitalizing   with   "@"   and   "*".

       Switches are single alphabetic characters, which in some instances are       ________ ___ ______ __________ ___________ _____ __ ____ _________ ___
       followed  by one or more items, separated from the switch character by       ________  __ ___ __ ____ ______ _________ ____ ___ ______ _________ __
       a colon.  Switches  are  separated  by  commas  or  slashes,  and  are       _ ______  ________  ___  _________  __  ______  __  ________  ___  ___
       preceeded  by  a  slash,  separating  them from the input file.  If no       _________  __  _  ______  __________  ____ ____ ___ _____ _____  __ __
       switches are  to  be  entered,  a  carriage  return  should  be  typed       ________ ___  __  __  ________  _  ________  ______  ______  __  _____
       immediately after the input file.       ___________ _____ ___ _____ _____

       B    Backspace       ______________

            SCRIBE  normally  underlines by overprinting a line of spaces and            ______  ________  __________ __ ____________ _ ____ __ ______ ___
            underscores.  If this switch is specified, SCRIBE will  underline            ____________  __ ____ ______ __ __________ ______ ____  _________
            by  backspacing  within  the  line  of  text,  and  then printing            __  ___________  ______  ___  ____  __  _____  ___  ____ ________

            printers   and   terminals   with   carriage   control,  this  is            ________   ___   _________   ____   ________   ________  ____  __
            time-consuming and unnecessary.  This  switch  causes  SCRIBE  to            ______________ ___ ____________  ____  ______  ______  ______  __
            fill out pages by printing a form feed.            ____ ___ _____ __ ________ _ ____ _____

       D    Dashes       ___________

            This  switch  causes  SCRIBE  to  print  a line of dashes between            ____  ______  ______  ______  __  _____  _ ____ __ ______ _______
            pages, which aids  in  bursting  pages  when  the  paper  is  not            ______ _____ ____  __  ________  _____  ____  ___  _____  __  ___
            pre-folded.            ___________

       F    Form-feed Before       ______________ ______

            This  switch  causes SCRIBE to print a form-feed before the first            ____  ______  ______ ______ __ _____ _ _________ ______ ___ _____
            page, which is an alternate way to line the paper up on terminals            _____ _____ __ __ _________ ___ __ ____ ___ _____ __ __ _________
            with carriage control.  Normally, you should line the paper up by            ____ ________ ________  _________ ___ ______ ____ ___ _____ __ __
            positioning the paper after entering information to the  teletype            ___________ ___ _____ _____ ________ ___________ __ ___  ________

       L    Print line numbers in margin       __________ ____ _______ __ ______

            This switch causes SCRIBE to print the approximate line number in            ____ ______ ______ ______ __ _____ ___ ___________ ____ ______ __
            the input file of every output line in  the  document.  The  line            ___ _____ ____ __ _____ ______ ____ __  ___  _________  ___  ____
            number  is printed left justified in the left margin, and thus if            ______  __ _______ ____ _________ __ ___ ____ _______ ___ ____ __
            the margin is too small to accomodate the number, it will not  be            ___ ______ __ ___ _____ __ __________ ___ _______ __ ____ ___  __
            printed  even though the L switch is specified.  SCRIBE's default            _______  ____ ______ ___ _ ______ __ __________  ________ _______
            margin of 5 is sufficient.  This switch  is  particularly  useful            ______ __ _ __ ___________  ____ ______  __  ____________  ______
            when  printing rough drafts as it allows points where corrections            ____  ________ _____ ______ __ __ ______ ______ _____ ___________
            are required to be rapidly located when editing.  The line number            ___ ________ __ __ _______ _______ ____ ________  ___ ____ ______
            printed  is  generally the input line containing the last word of            _______  __  _________ ___ _____ ____ __________ ___      ____ __
            an output line, or the line after.  Thus, if the point  requiring            __ ______ _____ __ ___ ____ ______  _____ __ ___ _____  _________
            correction is not in the line indicated in the margin, you should            __________ __ ___ __ ___ ____ _________ __ ___ _______ ___ ______

            pages and wait for a carriage return  from  the  terminal  before            _____ ___ ____ ___ _ ________ ______  ____  ___  ________  ______
            printing  the  next page.  This option is useful when printing on            ________  ___  ____ _____  ____ ______ __ ______ ____ ________ __
            non-continuous form paper (such  as  letter-head  paper),  as  it            ______________ ____ _____ _____  __  ___________  _______  __  __

            The  integer  after  the  "R"  specifies  the  number of times to            ___  _______  _____  ___  ___  _________  ___  ______ __ _____ __
            overprint text that is  boldfaced.  The  default  value  is  one,            _________ ____ ____ __  __________  ___  _______  _____  __  ____
            meaning  that  boldfaced  text  is  to  be overprinted once.  The            _______  ____  _________  ____  __  __  __ ___________ _____  ___
            integer must be no less than one and no greater than eight.            _______ ____ __ __ ____ ____ ___ ___ __ _______ ____ ______

       S:integer   Start At       _________________ __

            SCRIBE will not begin generating output until the  physical  page            ______ ____ ___ _____ __________ ______ _____ ___  ________  ____
            specified  by  the integer after "S".  Thus, S:n is equivalent to            _________  __  ___ _______ _____ ____  _____ ___ __ __________ __
            O:n-*.  This option  is  useful  when  initial  pages  have  been            ______  ____ ______  __  ______  ____  _______  _____  ____  ____
            printed correctly, and then an input or format error is detected.            _______ __________ ___ ____ __ _____ __ ______ _____ __ _________
            Output can be aborted, the error fixed, and then SCRIBE run again            ______ ___ __ ________ ___ _____ ______ ___ ____ ______ ___ _____
            with the "S" switch to avoid re-printing pages.            ____ ___ ___ ______ __ _____ ___________ ______
