--------------------------------------------------------------------

     As of this memo there are two pack copy programs. PAKCOP.SAV and
     PAKCP5.SAV.

     PAKCOP.SAV is the same old pack copy which we have been using on
     the Memorex 3675's and Ampex DM-331's. You must still use this 
     program when you work with 3675's and DM-331's, but there have been
     some enhancement added to it.

     PAKCP5.SAV is the new version which only works with the Memorex 
     3650 and 3652 disks which we have started to put on the PDP10's.

     Operationally, procedures of both program are the same as before.
     Only one command REFRESH, has been changed to ZFORMAT.

     If a 3650/3652 pack can not be ZFORMATed on the PDP10 because of
     a defective track, which must be done at least once when they are
     put on the PDP10 to work with TYMCOM-X operating system, defective
     track could be rewritten (fixed) under IBM/VM system using FIDS
     SA (Surface Analysis). This has been allready tested and proven to work.

     If there is any question feel free to give me a call at (415)794-2513
     or send mail to user name OSMAN on PDP10' or FSC.O/GUVEN on ONTYM.
     Thank You..

Subject: BBOARD messages. 

Due to a limitiation in the TUMS mailing system, we cannot use the username
BBOARD.  TUMS assumes that we are trying to send mail to the UNIX BBOARD
system and snarfs up the mail...  sigh!

I've setup a mailbox for username INFO instead.  Untested as of this moment,
and this will only change if TUMS eats that mail also.  GRRRRRRR.

Bug in LS program....

  If one has UNDELETE enabled, one gets funny named .TMP files in one's
directory... when one then runs LS to get a directory, LS seems to stop
when it hits one of thes bad files... in any case, it doesn't list all
of the user's files.  Even if it doesn't print the bad names, it ought to
continue with the rest of the real files...

Re: Modifications to the system

I made some minor changes to your PRPCHG.DOC file along with one
major revision.

*** MAJOR CHANGE ***
  :RESTART n                Not implemented.  Ignored.

This is now correct!  For the sake of conversion, it is ignored for
the moment.  Later, I may add it in when the Hold$Restart stuff is
working the way I'd like it to work.

XEXEC.RND/SUBMIT.DOC

The CCL option replaces the TMPName option completely.  The old CCL option
is redundant and setting the CCL name (or parameters) will flag the proper
start condition.  If the RUN option is set and parameters are given, the
CCL name will be setup automatically from the first 3 characters of the
command file name if a CCL option HAS NOT been issued previously.

The LOGOUT option has been added to allow a running job to log itself out
without first halting and waiting for the job processor to log it out.
(Waiting to be logged out hasn't really been tested fully, while programs
such as MAILER and ONTMTP log themselves out.  This bit must be set on
these programs, otherwise they will be marked Abort-Logout).

Abort-CCL has been removed.  Apparently Abort-CCL replaced Abort-Run in
an earlier version and Abort-Run was never re-implemented.  So, I have
renamed Abort-CCL to Abort-Run since that is the intent, and I have added
a new condition Abort-Logout which means the job went away without the
job processor's knowledge.  This is now an error.!

I will change the documentation to reflect these changes.

Effective in SUBMIT %1(162), XEXEC %1(173), EXECX %1(174).

Problem is that if you ABORT out of an insert, and possibly a modify
then proceed to insert a new record... the old record info is still
there... or at least some of it, eg. LOGFILE in my experience.

re: Weird startup problem on system 72.

I tried to startup my XEXEC on system 72 last night and it just kept
sitting there without doing anything...

I looked at the job with FRMDDT and it was looping in the code I wrote
to sleep, loop back and try again inside the call to type a message to
the CTY using the talk job SETUUO function 10.  It appears that the
SETUUO was either failing or the CTY was being flooded with output and
it was returning a pointer to use to continue the uuo.  I donno... I
put a JFCL at the error address and it took off flying.

I've not heard anything about 72 going down... so this behavior was most
bewildering.  I thought you'd like to know, because I think that we need
to address the problem of the CTY being flooded with output, such as when
a detached job has LOGOUT on STOP set and caannot logout...  "?<cr>" is
typed over and over again...

New bit for (PJ)JOBS.DAT...
  bit x = this data center

maybe better - bit field  (2-3 bits) with the data center number.
thus, all programs like SUPCHK and (SPL)COPY and the like can look
at word 1 for the host number and find that host's entry to see
what data center this machine is in... then a sub-list can be made
of those systems in this particular center.

Then, (SPL)COPY or SUPCHK can look at only those hosts...

...since you'r updating PAM...

Problem:  When rebuilding the system, do all the packs have to be the same?
Answer:   ASP dumps DSKB0, then DSKB1, etc.  It does not matter if DSKB0 has
          moved from BPA1 to BPA7.  If the system had 14 packs when ASP was
          run, then it must have 14 packs when restoring.  The physical
          location of the packs is irrelevant.

Subject: Oper password file loses license when restoring from backup tape. 

16-Nov-86 18:15/Joe
Contact:  Cupertino Operations, (408)446-7705, Vijay, System 22.
Problem:  Could not set license after restoring from 14th's incremental.
Diagnosis: TITO complained about two files:
          (SYS)DRWSPR.EPO not given license WC
          (BOFANET)ONTYME.SAV not given license AC (SY,HF,RF,WF)
Fix:      Ran SETE then SETLIC on those two files.  System now up.
Note:     Carl and I have been discussing ways of giving license to TITO
          instead of to the operators.  We need to do something about it.

In this particular case, ASP restored all files with correct license.  Now if
TITO had all the license in the world, restoring files to SYS would not lose
license.  Giving license to TITO would be OK if
  1) TITO threw away license if not run by OPER.
  2) TITO threw away license if the TRANSLATE command was given.
  3) TITO kept license only for "RESTORE ALL" and the system number in the
     header matched the current system number.  (Operators would still need
     do set RF on their frame to do a STORE operation.)

This approach would not work if (SYS)TITO.SAV got wiped out and they had to
run TITO from tape.  Right now, only REFLAG gives the operator license when
running from tape.  We could make TITO use "SETE 777777,-1" to get all license
without having to take the system down, but it may be difficult to ensure that
only TITO gets to use it, and not some malicious program.

Or we could make it a restriction that if TITO gets wiped out, they have to
take the system down to get license from ONCE.  Then we could add a "TITO"
command to ONCE that takes device name as an argument (such as SYS: or FTA0:,
etc).  This command would tell ONCE to set CONSOLE-MANUAL mode, log in OPER
(without requiring ^Z L OPER), give the process all the license in the world,
then run TITO from the specified device.  This would avoid DDT and REFLAG and
give them a one-shot license for restoring files to SYS.  Once SYS was
restored and DSKCLN run, they could use the licensed copy of TITO on disk to
restore the rest of the files.

Any comments?

Subject: Restore answer... 

Yes, ASP restore is a structure restore... there not only must be the
same number of packs, they must all have an intact structure (built with
DEFINE and then REFRESH, or left from a previous set of system packs).

What is on those packs doesn't matter.  For example, a system 25 pack-set
could be used for a system 27 rebuild, as long as the system is brought
up as system 27 (change system number) in case ASP checks things like that
in the tape headers.

Subject: TITO license 

I'm still in favor of the  SETE 777777,-1  idea, although make it only work
via UUO from usrname OPER.  We put that into TITO so that it can setup its
license correctly, but only have it set the license if the given command is
STORE ALL and no translates have been enabled.

I also like the ONCE command TITO or REBUILD to come up in console mode.
This would set both REFLAG and the DOCTY flag to be used whenever a rebuild
operation is needed, either ASP or TITO...

I think we need to write up a document with the changes in it, so we can
hammer at the pros & cons of each situation.  We've discussed various parts
of various proposals on this topic many times, and each time, we overlook
a situation that we don't feel is important, which after some thought is
the main reason none of theses schemes has ever been implemented.

I'm creating (M33)OPRLIC.INF for this purpose.

Subject: Re: Oper password file loses license when restoring from backup tape. 
In-reply-to: your message of Sun, 16 Nov 86 18:45:14 PST

The problem of license being lost in a restore situation is common.  What you
really want to insure is that the tape hasn't been tampered with.  If there
was a way to know when a tape has left the computer center, such as a mark
that would be made on the label, or a sticker that would be removed, then we
can safely restore all license to any file.  The problem is not limited to
(SYS).  In fact, it is worse for non-(SYS) files since they are usually more
obscure and fewer people are familiar with what license they should have.
Adele and I talked and talked about this problem, and I believe the solution
that was to be used in SNARL was to give the program all license.  It would
use its license to restore files only if the tape was written as either
  DUMP ALL   or   DUMP ALL CHANGED
The problem is, this information is not available in TITO.  I think the
next best thing is to either (1) change TITO to make a note on such tapes,
(2) require the operator to specify what kind of tape it is.  The first is
obviously preferable.  In the case where TITO does not have enough license,
it will complain when it first starts up, instructing the operator to either
use some ONCE command to get license, or to call the hotline or whatever.

Re:  RECUUO .... IN NEW RECORD SYSTEM, PLEASE RECOMPILE

This message comes out of SAIL and aborts my XEXEC jo on some systems.
Not all of them, just some of them.  I've never seen this on 930 or 62.
Do you have any ideas on why this is happenning?

My only guess is that a record garbage collect isn't happenning.. but
there is no indication that this is the problem.  I do have a couple
of record structures which are close to or > 20 entries... which might
not be being deallocated...  I plan to put in a call to $RECGC to try
to force a garbage collect.... but, I'd like your opinion... first ...

Please try to respond ASAP, even if to say, "I donno- never seen it".

  Remember I mentioned that the SETUUO to talk to another job didn't
work on system 72.  Well it still doesn't work.  It seems to work fine
on just about all other systems.  72 is running /P37!

It is very reliably broken on that system.  I wonder if there is something
wrong with the monitor image???

In any case, I'd like it checked... it seems strange that it runs well on
all the other systems.

XEXEC seems to be goin gto ^C state, or TI state on some systems.
The job mix doesn't seem to have much to do with it.  I haven't
correllated whether the version number of XEXEC/EXECX has something
to do with it or not.  If you find it stopped, please make a note
of the version and report it to me.

Everyone,  if you find XEXEC stopped on any system , either restart it
or repor tit to me immediately so that I can cehck it.  Apparently
there is something stopping it.

It must be an incompatibility in the object code if it expects that
recompilation will fix it.  Are you sure all your modules are compiled
with the same version of the compiler?  Alternatively, RECUUO leads
me to believe that the "old" record system used LUUO's for some record
operations.  This message is probably emited when the obsolete record
LUUO gets called in which case, it may be that you've jumped into some
non-code.  I've never seen it, but I do suspect record garbage collect
bugs in TUMS.  -Bill  (keep me posted, very curious)

Host 54 ran out of ports.  XEXEC version 174 was SL, SUBMIT said it was running
the FREE job, but no job was logged in running FREE and MAILER was overdue.
I restarted XEXEC and did a RERUN on FREE.  FREE then killed 12 jobs in ^C state
but left the 10 jobs running 1022F4 that had been in TI for over 16 hours.
FREE needs two limits; number of minutes for jobs in ^C state and number of minutes
for jobs in TI state.

There is a bug in the counted string output routine in UUOCON.  If the error
returned in "no room", the byte pointer is correctly updated but the byte count
is returned in the LH of the AC instead of the LH of the word with the job 
number.  You can kludge XEXEC to get around this bug: If the RH of the value
returned in the AC is no-room and the LH of the AC is nonzero, then store
the LH of AC in the LH of first word of argument block.  I will create a
patch file.					/Joe

Subject: (SYS)JQUEUE.SYS needs QM lic. 

Carl,

  If the queue file needs QM license, we're going to need to kill xexec on
some hosts, temporarily.  Since it and/or EXECX has the file open in update
mode, I can't give the file license while the system is running (as far as I
currently know).  All other files are now accurately installed, I believe.

I think every host except 23, 35, 62, 79, 95 & 930 is running the latest
edition.  All files are installed with (believed to be) proper protection and
license, except for (SYS) JQUEUE.SYS.  I was unable to install QM on this file
in the following hosts without (I believe) taking the Job Processor system
down, because XEXEC and/or EXECX had the queue file opened in update mode.
It's in your hands.  the hosts are:  28, 29, 38, 54, 58, 70, 72, 74 & 79.

I looked in some of the queues.  the only glaring discrepancy I found was the
lack of (PJ)PAM on host 35's queue.

I'll finish updating the .DOC files tomorrow.

G'nite. ...

If a PPB exists for that PPN when the CHGPPN uuo is executed, then JBTNM1
and JBTNM2 get set from that PPB.  If no PPB exists and no other frame is
GFD'd or logged in under that PPN, then JBTNM1 and JBTNM2 are zeroed.
The GFD program activates a PPB indirectly by looking up the UFD checking
for files with error, reading ACCESS.LIS, or by reading ACCESS.MSG.
(Unfortunately there is no channel open at the time of the CHGPPN uuo if
GFD has to create the UFD from scratch.)  Therefore if you use the GFD
program to go to an existing directory, JBTNM1 and JBTNM2 are set up.

If you put the CHGPPN uuo into the SUBMIT program, you should have the
UFD open as the time of the CHGPPN.                   /Joe

Greg san, 
     
Now, I have strange problem on C57.
This afternoon, A-AIS users on C57 called us and informed that Katakana tools   
did not work well. (UPLKT)KPUNCH said "CAN NOT OPEN FILE:xxxxxxxx" and the 
specified file has no problem. We could not reproduce it at our side, however   
the users still reported the problem to us. Also I found some unmatch between   
WHO and SYSTAT. All which I saw is related to DIRECTORY of the system.
     
Is there anychanges on C57 or C57's directory control ?
     
As we could not reproduce it at our side, we will check more next week.    
So if possible, please check on C57 and let us know it before our checking 
at user terminal.   
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

In-reply-to: J17175@Ontyme.Tymnet of C57 problem, ref A78374

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ogura san,

I believe the problem on host C57 has been fixed.  The problem was in the GFD
program.  Under one set of conditions the problem would occur.  When the user
used GFD to get access to another directory, then used the GFD command
(without a username) to return to his logged-in directory, he would not get to
his own directory but would get "lost".  

This problem began occuring recently.  I believe it was fixed about 24 hours
ago.  If the users continue to have trouble, please let us know.

Regards,
Dennis Coffey

Found an interesting bug; Missing index register in "MOVEM T1,UNISTS(U)" caused
location 36 to be wiped out, which caused DDT to get an ill mem ref when it
went to type out the location at the next breakpoint.  Fixed that, then got a
stopcode we have not seen before - SWPNIO = swap done to a page that is not
marked for I/O in progress.  I've been reading over FILIO, adding more comments,
and will have something to try Sunday or Monday.  /Joe

Subject: BADSAT on system 26 every Saturday. 

22-Nov-86 17:44/Joe (Carl did not answer 3 beeps)
Contact:  Cupertino Operation (408)446-7705, David Jorgenson, System 26.
Problem:  Same as 9-Nov - System gets BADSAT when TITO all-files gets to
          directories starting with "O".  Sometime later it gets error reading
          RPG.SHR, then dies with something like USRUS1 stopcode.
Workaround: Whenever system gets BADSAT while TITO is doing the all files,
          let system stay up until either TITO gets error reading files or
          users get error reading files from SYS, then force a fast DSKCLN
          and tell TITO to resume starting after last complete directory saved.

Subject: BADSAT on system 26. 

Correction: DIdn't answer 1 beep. at 17:44

The previous 2 beebs, were at 6:10 am for system 26, re: BADSAT
  and 6:20 am for system 65, re: bad pack or bad drive causing read errors.

Fred called me back at 10ish this morning, re: more BADSAT problems and
stopcode EUE after the BADSAT occurred.

For system 26, I told Fred to take the system down and run a FAST DSKCLN
and to call me if the problem was not fixed.  Apparently the problem keeps
coming back while trying to do an all-files with TITO.  It had problems
with directories CARL and CNFE this morning.

After the DSKCLN, I told them to continue with the all-files where it left.
Apparently, Joe told them the same for the third call today.  No other
indications were found.

For system 65, I restored SYSTAT and DSKCLN from another system and PSP
indicated a bad drive/pack, so I told them to call TM to look at the drive,
if TM says ok, to try it again, or if it fails, PAKCOP the bad pack and
go from there...  after TM is finished.

PS:  THanks Joe, for catching the 17:44 call.  I was out shopping and
     didn't hear the beep.  Noticed it when I got home... system 26 was
     up running FULL DSKCLN (Dave didn't force FAST) and should be up
     for timesharing by 7:00 pm.

(...and it's only saturday night!)

22-Nov-86 19:20 /Carl
Contact:  Fremont Operations via answering service, Bonnie, System F58.
Problem:  System crashed 5 times during previous 8 hours plus a few in
          the morning: 7:48 BADSAT, 11:21 THUNG on all drives + BADSAT
          on unit 2, 15:03 FILAUS stopcode, 17:37 SEAR14 stopcode, 17:44
          FILAUS stopcode.   ... (additional crashes, but times not
          recorded by me, operations has the times)...  more SEAR14 and
          FILAUS stopcodes.

          All files save in progress, incremental backup save in progress
          and the last crash, both incremental and all-files in progress.

          Last files to tape foreach were: (NETSTAT)61119B.DMI, 61105A.DMS
          and 61114C.DMS.  These files were ok.  Files recorded in the
          NETSTAT directory just before and after each of these appeared
          to be ok except 61113B.DMS which caused the system to crash with
          FILAUS during my examination.  I renamed it to (CRASH) and set
          NDL and NFS bits.  TThe NETSTAT directory has 470,000+ pages in
          500+ files, many of the DMS and DMI files are 5000 to 10000 pages
          each.  (CKSUM takes a long time!!!)   I mention this, because we
          are badly in need of a utility program which reads the ribs of
          all files, or all files in a directory, looking for bad pointers.
          DSKCLN is supposed to do this, and fix them (or mark them bad)
          and apparently it doesn't!

Plan:     I've told operations to restore the file and continue with both
          the incremental backup and the all files, and to call me if they
          crash with FILAUS.

          I told Bonnie to have operations call us every time they get the
          FILAUS stopcode, so that we can locate the bad file immediately.
          If they get a BADSAT error, or BADSAT crash, that they should
          (on an error, not a crash) continue running until TITO complains
          about reading files (or until they cannot access system files)
          and then to recycle and force a fast DSKCLN.  I told her that we
          need NOT be called for each BADSAT... Sending mail is enough until
          further notice.  We are aware of the problem and are working on a
          fix.

(it's been a long weekend) sigh.

Subject: Hotline calls 

** Turnover to Osman - in case you get calls **

Mostly system 26 and 58.  Same problems BADSAT (26 & 58) and FILAUS (58).
For the bad sat, operations has pretty much been told to proceed until they
have problems accessing system files such as RPG, LOGINN or LOGOUT.  For
FILAUS, they have been told to call us immediately, so that we may look at
the crash and the corresponding backup or all-files tape (TITO) to see what
file caused the crash.

26 had a few problems with BADSAT during the all-files, and they reloaded to
run a fast DSKCLN (forced over FULL) to clear the problem.

System 58 had me on the phone off and on all day with FILAUS and BADSAT trying
to do the daily backup and the all-files.  Username NETSTAT which has over
450,000 pages in 500+ files, many of which are 5k-10k pages in size, had many
bad files which caused FILAUS.  Some were fixed by the DSKCLN which ran, others
have been renamed to (CRASH) with NDL and NFS set.

As of this message, the all-files finished and they were working on the daily
backup, in directory NETSTAT.  I hope yopu don't have any calls...  /Carl

Goodnight.

Subject: PRPRPL versions and installations 

Newest versions of XEXEC %1(174) and EXECX %1(200) have been distributed
to most systems, (but not all--due to hosts down).  I've installed them
on SYS on 22 but didn't start it since that system seems to be fine...
I've installed them on SYS on 34 and 54 and started them running.  They
appear to be working fine with the restarting scheme we discussed on
Friday.
It's running on 930 and 62 as well.  EXECX is started whenever necessary
and logs itself out after 15 minutes if there is no work to do.

Dennis & Osman, I'd appreciate it if you can make sure this version gets
installed everywhere.  XEXEC %1(174) has DDT loaded to trace the ill-mem-ref
bug (which hasn't occurred since we loaded DDT, sigh).

Dennis,
  Please verify that all three files in SUBMIT have the correct versions
while you are performing installations.  Don't bother to put up the new
EXECX until you have put up the new XEXEC 1%(174).  Also, feel free to
install the files on sys everywhere, but don't bother to kill XEXEC and
restart it on those systems running fine.

Hint:  To find out what version XEXEC is running...
 1) Look at the file (CARL)JQUEUE.LOG to find the last restart message.
     or
 2) SYSTAT <XEXEC>
    R FRMDDT         (or DO FRMDDT, it maybe in MPL)
    job$U            (where job is the jobnumber and $ is escape)

PAM was marked HOLD, a second MIDNIT job I inserted was overdue, and JQUEUE.LOG

Subject: FILAMO investigation 

FILAMO on system 34 (6), 22 (1), 54 (1) and 23 (1) are all identical.
It appears to be very reproduceable, albeit not on command.

Symptoms appear to be the system crashing due to decrementing the maximum
write count for an ATB with a zero count (causing an overflow to -1).
The running job is XEXEC in each case, executing the exact same instruction:

  FRMOP 1,BLOCK    where 1/ 23,,child-job  and block contains 7.

XEXEC is in fact reading the HALT STATUS BLOCK of a job which it received
an exit-in-child or logout-in-child interrupt, which appears to be gone
by the time the system crashes, although the FRMOP doesn't complete.  It
appears that the .FOHSB function 23 may have an interaction problem with
jobs in the process of logging out.  The job in question has been MAILER
running in username MAIL.  The only discrepancy I found was that the job
state fo the target frame said NULQ, and the queue table said STOPQ.

-----------------------

FILAMO, FILANF on system 39 appear to be caused by a different problem.
In both cases (3 saved crashes) the value of SYSCOR = 0, instead of having
a link-pointer address,,0.  This indicates that we are running out of
file-service free core blocks.   SImply raising the amount may solve the
problem, but I thought that there was an interlock to wait for free-core
CB wait may do it... FC is the otehr free-core.

I will continue to look into this...  it should not die due to running out.
Unless... all dormant blocks are reused, and there seems to be a good list
of dormant atb/drb blocks.

/Carl

We may want to put in an info stopcode which warns of frecore low?

I telecopied the new versin of XEXEC to 35,54,28 & 55,56,58 from 62.
I then copied from 35 to 22,26,29,55  and from 54 to 23,25,27,31,34,57,65
and from 28 to 30,33,38,70,72,74,79

so, the system should be ready to re-install.  MAILER is also fixed on
all systems. (If not, WRS will let us know).  I tested using the bit to
setup he new XEXEC and it works ok.

I generated a new QUEDDT and copied it everywhere with XEXEC 1(200).

New commands...

   RUN QUEDDT
   HELP$G  gives a help message
   INSTALL$G  will set the feature bit to restart XEXEC automatically

so,  simply copy the files to SYS wioth GET/SAVE  and then run QUEDDT
and say INSTALL$G  followed by $G  (where $ is escape)... and unless
XEXEC has died in TI/TO or ^C state, it will restart without human
intervention.

  Fast.... neat... etc.  <pat pat>

Dennis, Carl,
 
1. For your information I am reproducing below A80625 from Hideo Nakano
of  KTL, concerning problems with reading an opnotice.
 
2. Dennis, you already have a related memo, A80680, from Tak Yasuma,
concerning some problems he ran into running SUBMIT tests.
 
3. In light of the short amount of time that we have, I'd like to make
soem suggestions to KTL that will really speed up our ability to help
you with this conversion:
 
A. Send all reports, etc., directly to Carl and Dennis, and copy me.
 
B. Rather than typing in excerpts of code in your Ontymes, let us know
the names and locations of the files that you are using, so that we can
look at the entire file.
 
C. Let us know which files we can actually run to SUBMIT jobs here,
without messing up anything in production systems.
 
Otherwise, tell us that the file should not actually be used at our
                                                                Page  2

end, but that we should only look at the code.
 
D. If you do give us access to files that we can try to use ourselves,
please let us know the login password for the userid where the file resides.
I am not sure if SUBMIT is sensitive to issues such as GFD vs. login,
differences in INIT files between userids, and differences in license
levels.
 
However, if we can do a true log-in to the userid you're using, we can
get as close as possible to the same environment that you have.
 
(Note: remember the BUGREP program? Nothing to stop you from using it.)
 
E. If you run into a reproducible problem, please try making a clean
reproduction of it using the (MPL)RECORD program. That way, we can
study the problem from your file first, and it will be easier for us
to try our own tests.
 
Thanks and regards, Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you know PERP driver hosts are scheduled to go away
on December 12 and the new Job Processor System, SUBMIT
is available on a TYMCOM-X?

We have still many user on the TYMCOM-X such as Marubeni,
A-AIS and .... Almost all of them are using PERP and PCOM
now. So we must convert to the Job Processor untill
December 12.

Today I tryed to test the Job Processor, but I could not 
have a good result.

After the Job was executed, I recieved the message
"[opnotice waiting]" at my terminal. However I could not
type out this message on my terminal.

I asked this problem to host(D34) operator and get the answer
as follows:

Subject: Locating the sources to system programs using FINDIT.TEC 

If you are looking for the sources to a particular program, you can often save
yourself some trouble by checking if the information is already on-line, on
system 930 in the files (JMS)*.WHR.  These WHR files are created when I try
to find where the sources are.          /Joe Smith, 26-Nov-86

How to use FINDIT.TEC

A) Make sure that you have (SYS) in your DO list after (XEXEC).
   See (JMS)RPGINI.CTL for an example on how to do this.

B) Copy (JMS)FINDIT.TEC to your directory.

The above two steps need to be done only once.

C) Have MHX run FINDIT on all systems, creating a .WHR file.

D) Mung the WHR file using FINDIT.TEC to clean up the file and add host numbers.

E) Optionally sort the WHR file if you want to.

Example of step C - running FINDIT via MHX

01	.MHX
02	hosts: 10S
03	commands (end with ctrl-D):
04	O$
05	FINDIT
06	TELEC#.*,AUXMO#.*
07	
08	SYSNO
09	record? Y
10	output file: TELECO.WHR
11	detach? Y

01 Start (MPL)MHX.
02 Tell MHX to go to all PDP-10 systems (as defined in JOBS.DAT).
03 Prompt from MHX.
04 Type "O", ESCape, and your OPER password.  Note that MHX turns off echo
   while it is reading the password.
05 Run (SPL)FINDIT on each system
06 Tell FINDIT to look for TELECO.SAV, TELECF.223, and AUXMOX.SAV.
   TELECF.223 is the FDM file for version 22.3, therefore when searching for
   sources and FDM files, it is a good idea to have # as 6th char of filename.
07 Blank line is required to get out of FINDIT.
08 Dummy line, I put it in out of habit
09 Control-D to end commands, MHX asks if you want to record output in a file.
10 My convention is to use *.WHR to keep lists of where files are.
11 Detach.  You can monitor MHX's progress from another terminal.  MHX changes
   its name (as reported by SYSTAT) to be "MHX:nn" when going to host nn.

Example of step D - MUNGing the file
In this example I use a different WHR file and show only the significant lines.

12	.DIR KLKS.WHR
13	KLKS    WHR      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
14	.MUNG FINDIT,KLKS.WHR
15	FINDIT V2 - Fix output from FINDIT by putting username after file name
16	29:
17	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:29)          15  07-Dec-78  14:49  ALL  RD  NO
18	62:
19	ACCESS.MSG  (KS2020:62)         2  24-Feb-81  14:45  ALL  RD  NO
20	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:62)          12  09-Jul-80  20:25  ALL  RD  NO
21	"Done

12-13 The log file does not show up until MHX is done.
14 The MUNG command runs (SYS)MUNG.SAV which runs (JMS)TECO.SHR.  The first
   argument is the name of the commands file (FINDIT.TEC), the argument after
   the comma is the name of the file that FINDIT.TEC is to work on.
15 FINDIT.TEC identifies itself.
16+18  Each host number is typed as it is found.
17,19-20 Note that username and host have been moved to the middle of the
   record.  The filename is now in column 1 where it can be sorted.  Every
   line of the file is typed out, you can use Control-O to suppress it.
21 FINDIT.TEC is done.

Example of step E - SORTing the file

22	.DIR KLKS.*
23	KLKS    WHR      25  26-NOV-86 1552    ALL RD  NO     12044
24	KLKS    BAK      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
25	.SORT KLKS.WHR=KLKS.WHR
26	SORTED 774 RECORDS

22-24 The BAK file can be deleted.  It is created in case you run FINDIT.TEC
  on a WHR file that has already been MUNGed once.
25 (XEXEC)SORT takes OUTPUT.FIL=INPUT.FIL, sorts in ascending order, using
   the entire line as a key.
26 SORT is done.
27 I sometimes massage the sorted WHR file by replacing "(SYS:22)" with
   "(SYS:*)" and deleting the redundant lines that say that XXX.SAV was
   installed on all systems on the same day.

Subject: 3652's working as 3650's, but problems with 3650's. 

Status of 3652 project as of Wednesday afternoon:

I have a monitor that works with a string of 3652 disks, treating it as if
it were two strings of 3650 disks.  That is, the problems caused by the
differences between the 3652 and 3650 model disks have been taken care of.

But when I try to build a two-pack system from TITO all-files, I am still
having problems.  These problems are the same as the ones we are experiencing
on the other systems that have the new SA10 and 3650 disks, systems 26, 58,
and 70.  We plan to have a new KL in Fremont hooked up over this weekend.
Anything we discover here in Fremont on this new system will be directly
applicable to the 3652 systems.  Therefore, as soon as we get the 3650
monitor working right, this will be the 3652 monitor as well.

Osman and I will look at the problem over the weekend, and will let you know.

Subject: XEXEC and MAILER 

The FILAMO crashes seem to be on the rise... systems 70 and 55 each
caught one today sometime after my newest XEXEC %1(200) was installed.

Since it's apparent that the problem is aggravated by XEXEC doing the
frmop to look at the halt-status-block of the MAILER job as the mailer
is logging out, and this reliably crashes system 34 when MAILER runs,
I have removed MAILER from the queue on ALL, repeat ** ALL ** systems.

(Well, most.  It is still running on X62, X95 and X930!)

I will see if I can put a work-around into XEXEC early next week, and
put MAILER back into the queue.

--------------
Note:  MAILER is still being run, each time someone wants to send mail
about the batch job being run, so (bill?) if this is enough to take care
of the queued mail files (MAIL)*.Q let me know, and I'll leave mailer
out of the queue (since it's being run every so often anyway).

To see the internal log of all CTY output on 930 or 62, set license and
RUN (MPL)FILDDT.  Answer "/M" for "File:".  Then type "17046$0T" (using
ESCape for $).  That will show the last 2560 characters that have been
typed on the CTY, plus parts of the Control Block for APA0, since $0T
stops all the first null (ASCIZ).  By the way, the "CB"+Linefeed that
is typed at the end is the CB for APA0.  By some wild coincidence,
SIXBIT/APA0/ = BYTE(7)"C","B",LF,0.  Awesome.

is no "S -S- stream #3".  Instead it has "S -R- stream #3 Abort-License <0>".
That was my FNDBAD job.  Does this mean that every time XEXEC is restarted, the
first job to request license get aborted?  It's starting to look that way to
me.  Jobs that run successfully two nights in a row mysteriously die with
abort-license the next day.  Is your program picking on me?   /Joe

o  I will make sure B39 comes up with NEWMON, after the ASP
   dump on Sunday.

o  System F24 is up with F58's ASP dump of 11/14. FULL DSKCLN found
   many bad files, about 40. There were some bad files neither DSKCLN
   or anything else complained being bad, but they were. Like LOGINN,
   CRSHID which job 3 was keep getting error when INITIA starts to
   run CRSHID, PEAK which is still bad left it like that, I thought
   you might want to look at it.

o  24XA03 Monitor doesn't see anything past BPA7. So system up with
   70XP37.

o  Did not do any testing like TITO, CKSUM, FILLUP yet.

XEXEC was not running on system 33 due to RECUUO message.  Restarted OK.
With the exception of systems 37, 79, and 95 (which are down at this moment),
FNDBAD ran on all systems.

I saw only two messages get returned to me, all others have gotten thru.
The two returned were from JMS@930 with a BCC to JMS@930, and the message
from the postmaster said that JMS had not logged in for 30 days, and returned

Subject: P034/P will not run on a 2020 with only 256K. 

TRW tried to bring up the P034/P monitor on their system.  It complained
about not having 512K, then died with stopcode PGENDP (alias SWPNDP) when
it ran out of core pages for DSKCLN + INITIA.

I tried duplicating the problem on 95 by removing 4 memory boards.  Sure
enough, /P dies with only 256K.  It runs with 384K, but really wants 512K.
P034/J runs in 256K but P034/P does not.  It may be possible to diddle with
some defaults (like reducing free-core) to squeeze into 256K, but I wouldn't
want to support it.  I suggested that Dennis recommend they get more
memory - used 2020 parts should be fairly cheap.  /Joe

Bill,
  The problem with XEXEC dying, IS caused by a probelm with $RECGC in SAIL.
The missing page is not caused by the garbage-collect, but is there by
normal program operation.  I plan on turing off record garbage collect and
will manage my own linked list of "dormant" records instead of letting
SAIL do it.  Sigh!

When I get around to fixing the recgc problem I will let you know. /Carl
IF you have any data on the problem, feel free to let me know.

Subject: 3652 deployment delayed until 3650 BADSAT problem solved. 

I now have a monitor that talks to 3652 disks as well (or as bad) as it
talks to 3650 disks.  The test system in Dallas is exhibiting the same
symptoms as C70, C26, and F58 did when trying to rebuild the disk system.
The SATs are getting clobbered, and the monitor then thinks it is OK to
overwrite the UFDs.  C26 and F58 experience similar problems during normal
operation, not just during the rebuild process.

Until the 3650 BADSAT problem is solved, no additional systems should be
transferred to 3650/3652 hardware.  I am hereby relinquishing use of the
test system in Dallas, and will be using the test system in Fremont.

After the next system is moved from Cupertino to Dallas, I may have a need
for further testing of 3652 disks, but for no more than two days.
I will keep you posted.

Yasuma-san,
 
Dennis Coffey had been out of the office on Wednesday, and just got
to your Ontyme A80680 on Monday, Dec. 1. We talked about it on the phone, and we
have the answers to some of your questions:
 
1. Ref A80680, Items 1. and 2.: several other users had reported
problems with not getting to SUBMIT at certain times of the day,
and with receiving MAIL. Both these problems are being worked on, and
you should see them fixed very soon. The Tymcom-X Support Group (TXS)
thanks you for bringing the problem to their attention; you should continue
to report any problems that you find.
 
2. Ref A80680, Item 3.: you were the first one to notice the problem
with ESC. Again, thanks for bringing it to our attention; this problem
is also being worked on.
 
3. Ref A80680, item 4: your understanding of "monitor level" is correct--
it does mean only XEXEC/XEXECJ/PDP10 mode.
 
When the job processor sees a period prefix, it first tries to interpret the
command as a command for the job processor itself. If it cannot interpret it
                                                                Page  2

as a job processor command, it issues an ESC (for XEXEC) or a control-c
(for PDP10), and then passes the argument. The ESC or control-c insures that
the command goes to the monitor level.
 
As a result, we think that your command line .WARNINGS OFF will not
work, as it is a MAGNUM command, but will be sent to the XEXEC level,
where it is not valid.
 
4. Ref my J18571, item 3: Dennis looked at this, and agreed that this
is a good way to report the problems to us. (Let us know the
command file name, whether or not we can actually use it, username and
password, etc.) This would save us a lot of time if you run into more
complicated problems during your conversion.
 
5. Dennis also mentioned something that may be helpful to you in your
conversion: PCOM is not going away. PERP will go away December 12, but
it looks as though PCOM will stay indefinitely. I hope this is some help
to you.
 
Regards, Greg

Your test of the Job Processor System was performed properly, and was a well
constructed test.  Thank you for telling us about the unexpected results you
experienced.

The reason for your result is the following:  the SUBMIT program inserts a job
into the Job Processor's queue for execution without testing to be certain
that the 'BEFORE <date time expression>' is satisified.  This expression is
tested when the job is requeued, after each execution of the job by the Job
Processor system.

For this reason, the following 'DATES' expression would cause the job to
excute once, even though the 'BEFORE' expression would never be true:
                (job entered at 12:00 noon)
        SUBMIT> DATES EVERY HOUR BEFORE TODAY 8:00 <cr>

The execution of your job at 6:23, rather than at 1:00, was because the Job
Processor system was not running until 6:23.  Your job was run 55 seconds
after the Job Processor was restarted, with a newer version of the program.
This happened because the Job Processor system is being modified and
developed, and was down for a while.  This delay will not happen in the
future.

Dennis Coffey

pointed to by QUEUE/ +1, or use INSTALL$G where available.

To Install a new version of EXECX, simply put it on SYS.

Thanks for your answer.

Almost all of our TYMCOM-X users are using PERP system now
because they want to run their job during a non-prime time period.
So, I tryed to test the job with BEFORE expression while Job
Processor was down. (Please see OnTyme A82671)

Japanese TRU rates are divided into 3 by time period as follows:

       Period                     TRU RATE
    --------------------         ------------
     7:00 am -  7:00 pm           50 yen/TRU
     7:00 pm - 10:00 pm           30 yen/TRU
    10:00 pm -  7:00 am           20 yen/TRU

For example, the following DATES expression might cause the job
to execute after next 7:00 am. rather than 11:00 pm. if
the system was down for a while or the Job Processor
system was down.

SUBMIT> DATES TODAY 23 BEFORE TOMORROW 6

We hope this job will not be executed after next 6:00 am.
even though it was inserted into queue.

Could you tell me how to solve this problem if you can?
Or we have to check start time in job be executed???
                                                                Page  2

Re: BEFORE problem...

I understand the problem a little better now... they want to be
assured that the job will not run during prime time.

My suggestion is that they write a little program to check for prime
and if it is past the deadline for prime time, that they logout to
abort their job.  This is a solution for now... later on, when the
job processor is more stable they should not have a problem... I still
suggest that if they do not want to run during prime time... they do
the checking.

Please wait till we discuss this in prson before answering their mail.
I'm being a little abrupt and unclear and I want to discuss it in a more
reasonable fashion, also maybe get greg marus in on the discussion after
you and i have talked.

joe,
  i put some hooks into the mail message. please make a copy on paper
and leave it for me of any aborted jobs you get, abort$license.

the new mail also reports a number, which may or may not be valid. I
need some feedback to see what is and isn't in the abort messages. I
plugged may of the places with information, but not all.

Hmmm, sorry I have no data on the RECGC problem.  I have been unsuccessful

  tight loop
It seems to just be taking a wild jump, but its very hard to tell from where.

Subject: $RECGC problem, FYI 

I've put in a work-around to my XEXEC: keeping a dormant list of records
myself to recycle whenever I need a new record, turned off record GC in
GOGTAB[RGCOFF]=true.  I'll let you know if it solves the problem.

FYI in finding the wild branch in $RECGC.  I left DDT loaded with my
production version of XEXEC and each crash I found the ACs were zeroed
out (all of them).  In APRACS+0 thru APRACS+17 are a reasonable set of
ACs which, by using F=12, and P=17 as bounds on the stack it can easily
be tracked to what caused the $RECGC call and almost (if not to) the point
where it jumps off into the bay.

I didn't have time to look at it... but it is re-produceable... given a day
of running or a few hours of running.

If you load DDT with one of your porgrams that dies every so often, and get
a chance to trace it, let me know.

Subject: set baud rate broken? 

Setting one's baud rate from the auxcal 15 or 16 doesn't work anymore.
It might be a CONSAT problm or a monitor problem.  I've eliminated the
BASE as a suspect since it happens with the microbase as well.  Please
try it with your consat (the Goltz-net box) and see if it works.  The
easiest way is probably
  R TIO
  OUTPUT 110

From a 1200 baud terminal I did the following:
	.R TIO
	1: OUT 110
	x~x~~~~`~|`~~p~p~|~x
	3: QUIT
The garbled 2nd command was "OUT 1200".

From TYMSAT 3143 to C22-P034/P37 worked.
From TYMSAT 3143 to B36-P034/P37 via BUBB gateway worked.
From TYMSAT 3143 to C22 and TAUX to C26-P034/P37 does not change
  baud rate on AUX circuit.  That is, line "2:" was readable.
From micronet 2770 to X930-P035/A04 did not work until I set
  the XMT and RCV baud rates both to 110.  That is, the PDP-11 will not let
  me change the INPUT rate, and the command to change the OUTPUT rate changes
  both INPUT and OUTPUT (no split speed on the DZ-11).

I don't see any problem here.   /Joe

Thank you, Joe, for your help in testing the baud rate problem.  It

XEXEC version 1(204) was racking up TRUs, not running anything, therefore it

  I don't know if you put the PJ stuff about which bits are in use in the

am  adding:
   Bits 14-17 (3) for the center # for this system.

I believe tht MAKJOB may wipe it out it we use that, but in the meantime
I expect to use FILDDT to make the updates.  I intend to modify JOBS.DAT
on 62, 930, 54, 35 and 74 to have these fields so that I can implement my
new COPY program CPY and test it out.

It will be smart enough to assume a center-filed of 0 = undefined.

  I will set "C" to 3, "D" to 2, "F" to 1....  that will leave us with
D and F as 2 and 1 when C is completely shutdown.

Joe,

I've used FINDIT on [3.*] on 72,74 & 79.  I've MUNGed and sorted the results.
The output is in (DENCOFF:62) G3USRS.WHR.  The file is app.  2580 records.
This is as you and Carl had suggested.  It's a nice way to see where we have
duplications on the different hosts.  

I'd like to suggest that we look at this file, because we have some files with
the same name on the different hosts but contents which are specific to the
host.  I'd like to migrate to 74 rather than 62, and keep 62 for my
developmental work.

I have two log files here on 24 that EXECX was writing to when the system
crashed with FILAUS.  They were both at least 3 pages long each before
the crash, now they are 0 words long.  Please make VMFILE update the RIB

Subject: Located a bug in DECRMV(FILAMO). 

I believe I have found the cause of the FILAMO crashes at DECRMV+13.

Before
	PUSHJ	P,GETATB	;! GET ATB ADDRESS IN T1
	MOVE	P2,T1		;! SAVE IT IN P2 FOR LATER
	PUSHJ	P,GETCBR	;! GET CB, DIDDLING WITH ATBS
	TLZN	P3,LMPMXW	;%! MAX WRITE ON FOR THIS SLOT?

After
	PUSHJ	P,GETCBR	;! Get CB now so ATB won't disappear
	PUSHJ	P,GETATB	;%! GET ATB ADDRESS IN T1
	MOVE	P2,T1		;%! SAVE IT IN P2 FOR LATER
	TLZN	P3,LMPMXW	;%! MAX WRITE ON FOR THIS SLOT?

In the BEFORE code, if the monitor reschedules between GETATB and GETCBR,
then the other job could come in, GETCBR, and delete the ATB.  When the
original job is allowed to run again, T1 and/or P2 would point to a
nonexistant ATB.  Or, if the original job was really delayed, then T1/P2
would point to somebody else's newly created ATB and prematurely release it.
Even worse, if a new DRB or NMB was allocated where the old ATB was, the
wrong fields would get modified, mangling the in-core database.

Subject: FILAUS may be caused by whatever causes BADSAT. 

An SPT entry is made whenever two jobs map in the same page of the same file.
When the routine that sets the M bit (because the page is now mapped into
core) finds the M bit already set and no SPT entry exists, it then creates
an SPT entry.

If an M bit is erroneously set in the SAT, then an unexpected SPT entry will
be created.  When the last legitimate mapper of the file is done with the
page, the use count is decremented.  FILAUS is detected whenever the use
count goes to zero and an unexpected SPT entry exists.

SPTs should never be created when the system is up MANUAL.  I believe the
FILAUS problem on 24 is reproducible even when MANUAL.  If so, setting a
breakpoint at CRESPT should point to the culprit.  I will test this Monday.

Re: new feature

EXECX %1(203) and later, !!Not released yet!! now has the following new
commands.

    :SILENCE       same as :DEFINE $LOGGING=0
                   if a log file is enabled, this silences output to
                   the log file until a :DEFINE $LOGGING=1 or :REVIVE
                   command is seen.
    :REVIVE        same as :DEFINE $LOGGING=1
                   if a log file is enabled (not LOG:NONE) then resume
                   sending output to the specified log file.

    :ERROR <ch>    specifies the character in column 1 which causes an
                   error to be assumed, thus stopping the job or (when
                   :IF is implemented) can be tested.  Can be read or
                   displayed via the $Error keyword.

    :NOERROR       clears the :ERROR character, declaring that all such
                   program related errors which print "?msg" etc, will
                   not cause the job to abort.

Note:  These commands are intended to work as the TOPS-10 equivalents and
       reasonable documentation can be found there for full explanations.

Dennis,  THIS IS NOT RELEASED -- DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR DOC FILES --
Joe,     YOU ASKED FOR IT... YOU GOT IT!  (:SILENCE & :REVIVE)

PS:  What do you think about :WARN %   (joe?)
PPS:  I forgot to say, :ERROR<cr> resets the error character to "?" and
      the character must be a printable character.  (Space is illegal).

There is a feature in TOPS-10 MIC that allows you to disable special
treatment of charactes in column 1 of the control file.  Such a feature
would be nice in EXECX that tells it to ignore ".", "*", and "=" in
column 1 (but still look for ":").  By adding a single line at the top
of a file, old CTL files could then run with the new system.

What shall we name this command?  How about ":NOMONITOR" to disable and
":MONITOR" to enable it.    /Joe

Subject: Priorities of parameter assignments. 

I don't like the current implementation.  It is not intuitive.  One macro
preprocessor does the following:

1) When the macro is expanded, the names of the parameters are read from
   the first line of the macro definition and assigned default values.
2) Positional parameters are read from the line that invoked the macro, matched
   up with the defined parameters.  Non-null positional parameters override the
   default values.  Excess positional parameters are thrown away.
3) Keyword parameters (if any) are read from the line that invoked the macro.
   Their values override the current definitions, even if the new value is
   null.  Any keyword name that does not match a defined name is ignored.
4) New values can be assigned to the parameters inside the macro.  The most
   recent definition overrides any previous definition.
5) New parameters can be declared and assigned values in the macro.

Note that the above scheme clearly defines what happens, in chronological
order.  There are no real priorities, it's just that the latest definition
overrides any previous definition.

XEXEC could do this if it put off processing the parameters option until
after it read the :PARAMETERS line.  Wait until after the defaults have been
assigned before checking for positional and assigned parameters.

				/Joe

P.S.  Dennis mentioned new nomenclature; "assigned" parameters are the ones
      with "name=value", keywords are "$TRUE", "$DAYTIME", etc.  I agree.

  The latest and greatest doc file is (DENCOFF:62)XEXEC.DOC.  It is the
"compilation" output from (DENCOFF:62)XEXEC.RND.  I had 2 occurrences of a
problem with RUNOFF/DOCGEN.  My hardcopy said the following:

DOCGEN:  XEXEC
?DOCILC Illegal command:  ".'L'M -4"
	on output page 9: on input line 18 of page 6
?DOCILC Illegal command:  ".'L'M -4"
	on output page 17: on input line 1 of page 9
%DOCTFE Too few end commands
DOCGEN: XEXEC     36 pages

The not shifting the margin to the left is the error of concern, however I can
see how it might be tied to the TFE warning.

The current implementation is NOT that much different than what you have
described above.  I will try to put together a similar (as "intuitive")
description which makes more sense than the previous explanations.

I will also put together a description of how the implementation works
step by step.  One thing not mentioned in the the documentation is that
you may have multiple :PARAMETERS statements (and they "add" by simply
continuing the previous statement(s).
    :PARAMETERS A,B,C          is the same as
                                 :PARAMETERS A
                                 :PARAMETERS B

Subject: Difference between GTSPAG and GETPAG. 

GETPAG gets a page, one at a time, contiguous if T2#0, into %SAT.  Caller
must have UPT to map %SAT, and is requeued if page fault needed to read SAT.

GTSPAG gets several pages, contiguous if T2#0, into %SWP.  It is called by
SCHED1 to get context pages so it can build a UPT.  If SAT needs to be read,
it kicks PCBIO to start the read and error returns instead of page faulting.

CREFRM calls GETPAG, which uses parent's UPT to handle page fault while
building child's context pages.

Carl,

  Joe and I discussed his suggestion for the parameter order of substitution,
when I asked him about the 2 things we had discussed.  I agree with Joe.  I
feel that the intuitive, chronological approach is needed.  

  What defines 'intuitive', for me, is a reversal of the current
implementation's order of expansion of the "options:parameters'" assigned vs.
positional parameters.  I believe the assigned should override the
positional.  For me it's easier to comprehend, and it appears to make a bit
more sense to have the greater flexibility of the named/assigned parameters
override the fixed, positional ones.  Besides, thier occurrence later in the
line would correspond with their being expanded later, and thus overriding the
positional.

That's just my opinion.

CPY will not provide any capability of sending a file to/from a directory
other than the user's own, if the user does NOT already have license or
a password set.  I'm confused about your reply ...  CPY is merely a COPY
replacement.  It does allow being GFD'd to one directory and sending files
from another, but if TELECOPY requires a password, they will still need to
specify it somehow...  talk to you about it later.

Subject: .IANIC Notice-in-child 

Comments please...

1)  Add new parent-child interrupt .iaNIC to cause an interrupt in the
    parent frame whenever anyone attempts to evict the child frame.  The
    child will remain unscathed until the parent issues an evict uuo to
    the child.  This new interrupt cause is similar to Exit-in-child and
    is set by the parent frame.

2)  Change the monitor to check for the new trap before issuing NTQ to a
    frame and if set and the calling frame is NOT the parent, issue the
    new interrupt to the parent, otherwise perform the current checks and
    the current actions.

3)  Add flag bits to the evict uuo to (1) "ignore" the new interrupt and
    perform as it does now (returning any .iaNTQ channel if enabled) and
    (2) only check for any .iaNIC channel that may be enabled.  The older
    programs which do not set the new flag bits will return the channel
    number associated with either .iaNIC or .iaNTQ if set, so that the
    desired functionality may be achieved.

    The evicting program really need not know, but it mght be nice
    for specialty programs which wonder WHY they cannot kill a job!

    TAKEIT could use the old way the first time, and if no response set
    this new bit, and if still no response kill it as it does now.

By providing this mechanism, we no longer need to know if a particular frame
is considered a "batch" frame or not.  If the interrupt is enabled, it is a
batch frame, or there is a knowledgeable parent around to take care of the
child.  "Any" child frame could be considered "batch".

John,
Do you understand why the EBUS interface goes to extreem lengths to
prevent the PDP-10 from actually setting the input baud rate while
makeing it look like it really did?  I noticed today that I can set
the output baud rate, but not the input baud rate.

Subject: new SUBMIT on :62 

There is a new SUBMIT on system 62.  It is NOT to be distributed.  It is
there for testing and hammering.  Please, everyone pound on it and see
if the things you thought were broken are still broken.  I fixed a bunch
of minor bugs, which should solve many potential problems:

  eg.  MURADMIN entered DELETE<cr>  and it wiped out a bunch of stuff...
       I found that a specified request number setup the QM/AS/any user
       fields properly, but anything else did not, and so anyone CAN
       perform various things on anyone's jobs at the moment!!!!!!!!!!!
    ** This has been fixed in %1(173) of SUBMIT now on (SYS:62) **

The specified symptm was fixed, but trying to take advantage of the bug
has proven my statement WRONG.  The previous versions of SUBMIT are not
a security violation.  It still takes some license, either QM or AS to
access things in the queue... or so it seems.

When Dan wiped out the 4 jobs he certainly didn't have QM, unless he was able
to set it with ^D.  (I don't remember whether the edit of SUBMIT he was using
had the ability to turn on QM with ^D.)  I checked, and I don't believe he
had/has AS.  (AS is not in the license word, but the privilege word,
accessable with NONAME, right?)

That's all I know about Dan's experience.  I don't know that he actually
deleted anyone else.  He assures me that he had checked with the STATUS
command and the LIST command, and he only had 2 jobs in the queue, but was
told by SUBMIT that he deleted 4.

I have modified TELCHK so that it can be run as an alternate logout program.
To use it, run (SPL)TELALP in the child frame.  It will set (SPL)TELCHK as the
ALP and then run SYS:TELECO with the appropriate run offset.  The results
are appended to TELCHK.LOG in the GFD'd directory.  The next step is to have
TELCHK send mail to the author of the ###TEL.COM file.

Let me know when the post processor for AUXMOX gets done.

The AUXMOX postprocessor is done.
It takes a lookup block in the last page of the file.
Its called FIXMOX.  GENAFD is a program to make files

Subject: SETMAI bug 

I was just thinking.  The bug I fixed last night in SETMAI could have
resulted in the JP.MAI bit being set in any word following
the origin of JBTPRV.  The code used to do
	CAML T1,JOBN
so it would allow the bit to be set in any index relative to JBTPRV if
the location JOBN actually contained something big.  When I looked,
	JOBN/ 0
but different monitors may have been configured for different JOBN.

Of course, this would also require somebody calling SETMAI with the wrong
argument to do damage.  If some program (like MAILER) was using the old
convention where the AC contained the address of the username when calling
SETMAI, then it could have cause sadness.  To my knowledge, all of the
mail programs have long been updated to use the new calling convention
which was put in place about a year ago.  You might check any crashes
where you see bits turned on to see if the bit happens to be JP.MAI.

Subject: Why nothing ever appeared in the BAT pages. 

I found out why the monitor never wrote anything in the BAT pages when
it found a page with an I/O error.  The routine UPERBT in CORE1 read in the
BAT pages, but would not update them if they failed the consistancy check.
Since ONCDSK/REFSTR never set the self pointers, the consistency check always
failed.  I fixed this by changine POPJ P, to PJRST WTBOTH at CHKBAT+5.
"BAMPHF!" BAT pages now work!.  I ran CKSUM on the 11 bad files in BADFILES,
and we now have 11 known bad spots marked in the BAT pages.

Now if DSKCLN honors the BAT pages, and sets the F bit for them even if they
are not part of a file, then we won't need to keep the RIBs around anymore.
