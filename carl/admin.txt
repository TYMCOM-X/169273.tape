
	    A Brief Cookbook on using AT&T's  ADMIN programs

1.0 Introduction

There are two programs: SADMIN and MADMIN.  They should be run from the
userid 31,31 so that you may have all the privileges that AT&T has been
using over the years.

SADMIN is the program to use to list accounts, add new accounts, delete
or modify accounts.  AT&T wanted to distribute this function to each of
the sub-administrators in various regions, thus SADMIN may be run by
multiple users at the same time from various locations.

MADMIN is the program to copy the changes into the actual accounting
files and make them permanent.  You must be logged in as 31,31 to run
the MADMIN program.  Only one person may run MADMIN at any given time.


2.0  Using SADMIN

The basic commands needed at this time will be TYPE, CHANGE and SUBMIT.
The TYPE command allows the administrator to list all the information
about a given user id.  The basic format is:

    TYPE USERID
    T USERID

An example follows:

    .R SADMIN
    *TYPE 37,36
    Userid: 37,36  [37,36]
    Password: XXXXXXX
    Privilege bits:
    MULUSE
    Name: MDFSCO      
    VM limits: Maximum physical pages: 512   Maximum virtual pages: 512
    IPCF limits: Maximum IPCF reads: 2   Maximum IPCF writes: 5
    Profile bits:
    TIMPSW BATCH BATSUB REMTTY DATSET REMOPR LOCAL SPOLPT SPOPLT 
    SPOPTP SPOCDP SPOCDR 
    Expiration date: 1-JAN-90
    Scheduler class: 1
    Maximum ENQ/DEQ's allowed: 511
    Structure: DSKC  FCFS: 20000  Logged-out quota: 15000
    Mailing address:
    Osman Guven    MDFSCO
    2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    P.O. Box 49019
    San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    Telephone number:  (408) 922-6236

    *EXIT
    .

Note:  It is always a good idea to EXIT from SADMIN when you are
       finished with your work.

2.1 The CHANGE command

The CHANGE command allows the administrator to change one or more of the
fields associated with a user id.  The following items may be changed if
the administrator has the privilege enabled for that field.

    ACCT, NAME, PASSWORD, LOC(ation), PROFILE (bits), PRIVILEGE (bits),
    VM (limits), IPCF (limits), CUSP (to run), EXPIRATION (date),
    SCHEDULER (class), ENQ (limits), FCFS (in quota), OUT (quota),
    AUXACC (disk space quotas), ADDRESS, PHONE, DOLLAR (limits),
    PPNSYS (requisitions)

For our purposes, we are primarily concerned with NAME, EXPIRATION,
ADDRESS and PHONE.  The examples below show how to change some of these.

    .R SADMIN			; Change the expiration to 1-Jan-90
    *C EXP 37,36		;   for userid 37,36
    Expiration date: JAN-90
    *SUBMIT			; Submit the changes to MADMIN
    *EXIT			; Exit
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's telephone number
    *C PHONE 37,36
    Telephone number: (408) 922-6236
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


    .R SADMIN			; Change the user's mailing address
    *C ADDRESS 37,36
    Mailing address:
    \Osman Guven              MDFSCO
    \2560 N. First Street (M/S D-21)
    \P.O. Box 49019
    \San Jose, CA  95161-9019
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT
    .


3.0 Running MADMIN

MADMIN updates the accounting files and makes the changes made by SADMIN
permanent (until another change is made, and MADMIN is run again).  You
must be logged in as 31,31 to run MADMIN.

    .R MADMIN
    Merge change blocks created by SADMIN "MOVE" command(Y or N)?N
    [Processing completed on ACCT.SYS]
    [Processing completed on ADRCOM.SYS]

    .

4.0 Examples

 o  Change a single user's expiration

    Expiration date: NOV-88
    *SUBMIT
    *EXIT

	*CHANGE NAME 40,41
        Name:

        *TYPE

    Note:   C is a valid abbreviation of CHANGE.
	    T is a valid abbreviation of TYPE.

    Note:   If a requistion number is to be deleted, first delete the
	    number from each USERID by using the REMOVE REQUISITION
	    command.  Then the REQUISITION DELETE command may be used
	    to delete the requisition.
