Subject: "The next time the system goes"... 

The next time the system goes down with a UIL stopcode, please mention in
the crash mail which tape drives had tapes mounted on them.  To help us
track down this bug, we also need to know which tape programs (TITO,MAGCON)
were running at the time of the crash.
