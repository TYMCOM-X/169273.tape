Hmmm, that might explain the spastication in PCOM sometimes.  I think
it assumes the HIBER will always exit after any interrupt.  If it only
does for some (i.e. character and not yellow ball) then a race would
account for the odd behavoir (sort of).  -Bill  (anxious to hear what

1) the $ sys it is a system parameter.  It is illegal to use a $ in any
   other variables in the first position.  I'll have to check to see if
   it may be used as foo$bar, for example.  If the PCOM doc gives a set
   of characters and $ is one of them, then foo$bar is legal.

2) for the :DEFINE x=y  or  :x=y  the delimiters are not needed, but if

Grrrr.  The problem is that you do not OPEN the queue explicitly, so if
the queue isn't open, you cannot get the defaults from the queue.  Since
I want you to use the defaults from the queue, I guess you need to open
the queue when you startup, and close it when you exit...  Or you can be
a little more gracious and only open it when you need to... for example,
if this is an INSERT, (since on a modify the queue must be open already)
then do the following...

	IF ( InQue )
	 then if not( OpnQue )
	       then begin "cannot open queue"
		print( error-message );
		return;
	       end "cannot open queue";

If the queue gets open, everything is fine... if not, there is a problem
and the error message should indicate this.

Hmmmm.  Bill,
  I know we went over this, and I said I wanted to discuss it with Joe...

re: Adding DATES, EXPRESS, TEST  to the options command.

  I feel that DATES will allow the user to change a date expression, but
that EXPRESS and TEST are not necessary.  If a user doesn't know what an
expression will do, it should be tested before doing the insert at the
SUBMIT> prompt. It doesn't really matter, except the help message inside
the [Options] prompt is already too long (too many things can be changed
and each item takes a line) and adding TEST and EXPRESS, which are top-
level commands, and NOT options is a bit much.

  Also,  now that DATES is an option, the EXPRESS command is not needed
since HELP should show the current expression anyway.  If the first run
date-time is also shown, then TEST should also be unnecessary.

Joe,   what do you think?   You and Helge talk about it, and I will abide
by whatever you both decide.

Subject: Changed SIMUUF stopcode on F38 from JOB to INFO. 

System 38 experienced many SIMUUF stopcodes today when MIS people GFD'd 
around.  It appears to be whatever program they ran before GFD (or LOGOUT) is
the culprit.  (MAGNUM?)  They have a July 1st deadline have have to have the
system up.  To allow them to stay up, I patched SIMUUF to be an INFO stopcode
that halts the job and lets the system stay up.

	!GET (SYS)SYSTEM
	!DDT
	ERRCON$:   SIMUUF/   XCT USETO0+232
	USETO0+232/   PUSHJ P,DIE

Subject: TAUX should not use / or # as a switch character. 

I found some interesting facts when looking to see what characters can be
used to specify optional switches to programs that parse usernames.  Page 6
of the NETVAL ERS says usernames can be up to 20 characters, they can contain
the letters A-Z, digits 0-9, " ", "#", "&", "*", "$", ",", ".", "/".  Note
that slash and poundsign are part of the username, a comma is legal but not
recommended (in case the user wants to build a circuit from X.25 to TYMNET).

It also says that the dash "-" is ignored on aux circuits.  If you try to
build an aux circuit to "LINK-10", the sup ignores the hyphen, looks up the
name "LINK10", and completes the circuit.  If the username has a hyphen in
it, (such as "NTD-SECURITY"), then NOBODY can build an aux circuit to that
name (the sup says that "NTDSECURITY" is not in the MUD).

This is an interesting way to build usernames that not even AC license can
crack.					/JMS

1.  As of today Jerry Causley is promoted to the position of 
    Information Systems Group Executive Officer, reporting to me.  
    The ISG Organization structure will otherwise remain as it is, 
    except that Jerry Causley will also retain his position as 
    President, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
    International.

2.  Bob Fischer will become the Chairman of the Information 
    Systems Group, reporting to me.  In that role Bob will 
    continue to develop ISG's strategies and will be the focal 
    point for corporate issues affecting ISG, including continuing 
    as a member of the HQ Council.  Also, he will provide 
    leadership in top level sales and marketing activities, and he 
    will continue on the boards of directors of Sanus Health 
    Corporation and the National Electronic Information 
    Corporation.

3.  Jerry Causley has been the head of MDISI since January 1985.  
    He joined CMC in England in January 1970 as a district sales 
    manager.  CMC was acquired by Microdata in 1977.  After a 
    series of pomotions Jerry was named Managing Director of 
    Microdata Information Systems Limited in 1980, responsible for 
    all Microdata sales and service activities in the U.K., Middle 
    East, and Africa.  Early in 1984 he became Senior Vice 
    President of Microdata Corporation with responsibility for all 
    of Europe.  In his positions of increasing responsibility, 
    Jerry has built strong teams and achieved outstanding results.

4.  I believe Jerry will be able to provide strong leadership to 
    turn ISG's strategic vision into reality.  Please give him 
    your full cooperation.

The Sales and Marketing direction of MDISI is well under control, 
thanks to the strengths of the Regional Managers and the Business

strong management team reporting to John will ensure that MDISI 
has yet another year of outstanding performance.

I know you will all join me in supporting John and wishing him

The command "SENDMAIL MONITOR" can no longer be used.  You have to use the
command "TUMS MONITOR" to use aliases since the latest SENDMA program does not
read TUMS.INI.

You might want to check your TUMS.INI file and remove RING, BRING, and/or

Subject: Update to RESET.PAT and /P-12 

We may be on the right track, but Roy Roskilly's problem showed that the
SIMUUF crashes haven't been completely fixed.  The JRST .+3 was not in error.

The code at RELEA5 uses the UXCTBU macro, which I confused with the XCTBU
macro.  The latter generates one word of in-line code, but UXCTBU produces
	PUSHJ P,DOXCT
	XCT N,[INSTRUCTION]

DOXCT sets the "previous context user" flag (PC.UIO) if necessary so that
the INSTRUCTION refers to the user's address space, even for nested MUUOs.

I have changed the instruction at RELEA5+5 from JRST RELEA5+7 back to its
original JRST RELEA5+10, but left the other two word in RESET.PAT.
NEWMON and all running monitors have been repatched, Roskilly's test on
D56 works now.

Back to the drawing board.		/Joe

Subject: UUOCON$: CONGMS: date/time stuff 

Updating the clock to track the supervisor is a good idea, particularly
since the SUPs will be running with WWV receivers in the near future.
However, I suggest changing the algorithm to something like this:

int ticsError, THSDAT, TIME;

comgms( newDate, newTime )
int newDate, newTime;
{
	ticsError = subtractDates( newDate, newTime, THSDAT, TIME );
}

and then in CLOCK1 where real time is kept at interrupt level...

ch1tic()
{
	own int oddTic;
	oddTic = ! oddTic;
	if( oddTic && ticsError < 0 ) {
		/* skip a tic */
		++ticsError;
	}
	else if( ticsError > 0 ) {
		/* double tic */
		--ticsError;
		doTic();
		doTic();
	}
	else {
		/* normal tic */
		doTic();
	}
}

This will be much nicer to programs that expect realtime to an increasing
function, like CHKPNT and RPG.  CHKPNT might recover okay, but MIS may be
confused by the lack of serialization in the log.  RPG won't exactly break,
but it may neglect to recompile source code for which the object is really
obsolete causing programmers enourmous confusion, etc.  Anyway, the above
algorithm is basically what we're using in the SUP to update the internal
clock when we get updates from WWV.  It simply goes half as fast or twice
as fast until it gets caught up.

There are other programs that count on monotonic increasing real time, but
all the ones I can think of are only interested in relative time measurement
and use UPTIME so they don't have to deal with wrap.  Sadly, reading UPTIME
requires SY license.  That's probably overly conservative.

I like the way you presented your suggestion.  It has been implemented in

changed, and another message will be output when the adjustment is complete.

Bonnie at Fremont Ops had a problem trying to run TAKEIT on F30.  It complained
about being unable to create 1TAKEIT.TMP (she was job 1).  Dennis ran TAKEIT
for her.

I GFD'd to OPER and ran (SYS)QUOLST, which reported that the OPER directory
had exceeded its logged-in quota by 125 pages.  The biggest file there was
FTA1 and it had 24936 pages.  I deleted this file at Bonnie's request.

In this case, TAKEIT should have output the message "Cannot create temporary
file because directory (OPER) is full".  Or suggest that the user GFD to a
different directory and try again.

Re: Ontyme usernames

Hans,
  I have been assigned the username FSC.C/Baltrunas, and my only usage is
for communication with support people in groups outside of FSC that do not
know of my other Ontyme account, and for "group" messages within FSC.

  My other account is TXS.C/Baltrunas from which I do all of my normal
correspondence with people outside of FSC.  I also am the account supervisor
for the entire TXS account.  This account is a small account which is used
solely for communication regarding support of the TYMCOM-X Operating systems
and their utilities, and as such is NOT appropriate to be merged into the
FSC account.  We deal with software issues and not hardware.

  My title is Sr. Systems Programmer (or was), my department is 90842 if
you want the MicroData Payroll department (4011 if you want the Tymshare
- Tymnet cost-code number).

Justification for use:  FSC.C/Baltrunas  - FSC communication,
  TXS.SUP & TXS.C/Baltrunas  - intercompany communication and software
                               support of the PDP-10 (TYMCOM-X) systems.

Re: Grumble *^%!@*$ Blind &%^&*(

I realize that you went and upgraded XEXEC on a few systems.... apparently
so that SENDMA would work everywhere (?)...  anyway, in the process you had
to add "1,MAIL,(MAIL)MAILER" to (SYS)XEXEC.CTL...  sigh.

On system 28, the old version WAS running, and there WAS a set of 2 programs
setup to run continuously (or each hour) using the old format.  When you put
up the new version and added your 1 line to the control file, it might have
beeen nice if you had changed the 2-4 lines already existing...

"0,TCSUP,RUN ALTDET"  to   "0,TCSUP,(TCSUP)ALTDET"   like a good little hacker!

I only noticed, 'cause I got a call that ALTDET wasn't running and that they
had a job called "RUN" in  ^C  state instead.  sigh!

    It seemed to be a tiny problem in setting my "left in core" count which
    was hangining me up.  Instead of being set to "max chars" when a chunk
    is read into memory, "left in core" was being set to the entire kill

    The fix was small, and seemingly quite effective.

Bill,
  I've recently run into an interesting problem using interrupts in SAIL
and I'd like to know if you've run into anything similar...

  I'm using immediate interrupts, all of which simply set a flag and then
return, except for 1 routine in the processing half of the 2 programs. In
the scheduling half it doesn't exist, and that half is where I'm seeing the
problem.

  1)  SAIL does a lot of  SUB P,[const,,const]  JRST @const(P)  where const
      is usually 2 or 3.  What I'm doing at the time of the problem is a
      call to CHNIOR/CHNIOV that under normal conditions works just fine.

  2)  Under interrupt conditions, this is speculation, if the code is caught
      between the SUB and JRST instruction and an interrupt occurs and it
      puts anything on the stack (at all) it may overwrite what is already
      there and the JRST @const(P) could very well go into never-never land.

  3)  I think that this is happenning!  Anyway, I'm trying to narrow it down
      and will let you know more later...

PS: an aside, are we going to see "~?" command come back to this SENDMA
    program, so the vanilla user can enjoy the comforts of being able to
    see what he/she has and possibly correct it  (please copy to Ron)

Bill,
  Hmmm.  Sail does take great care not to clobber my stack P, so i do not
think that the SUB/JRST combination I mentioned earlier is the problem...
howerver, it pretty reliably dies in the same place, ill mem ref -- P is
clobbrred pretty bad, last remnants of the ACS appear to be returning from
CHNIOR/V but nothing clear (since SAIL cycles it's ACs as it does things).
More later...

SAIL sets up a special stack for immediate interrupts.  It has one stack
for all interrupts and supposedly ensures they are mutually exclusive by
disabling the system while any are pending, thus making priority flat.
It doesn't sound like the access to deallocated stack is the problem.
If all you do is set a flag (a global boolean not in a record) then that
can't be it.  What do you do in the one non-trivial routine you mentioned?

I'm sorry about the change in behavoir of SENDMAIL.  The command used to
consist of
	MOVEI [exp <sixbit "DSK">,<sixbit "TUMS">,0,[exp <sixbit "MAIL">,0],0]
	RUN
	HALT
And all of the functionality ever available before is now (and has been)
available by the command TUMS, with arguments.
The purpose of the new SENDMAIL is
	1. emulate, exactly, the behavoir of RPG mail command "SEND"
	2. be small and fast, not requiring TUMS.INI or anything
So, if you like what the old SENDMAIL command did, use the TUMS command
in stead, after all it has two less characters to type.  I hate to start
adding features to a user interface I hope nobody ever uses, we'd then
end up with two programs to support.  Do you think there is a functionality
gap between the TUMS command (with arguments) and the new SENDMAIL that
needs to be filled?

Subject: TUMS/SENDMA gap 

I was going to say... "TUMS USER,..." ought to work, but it does already.
At one time, if you'd recall, "TUMS anything" was broken so I got out of
the habit of even trying "TUMS SEND user,..."  and if both of these work,
there shouldn't be anythning needed.

It might be nice if TUMS (or any other program which scans the command line)
is invoked by some other command, it still works.  For example, I make a tiny
program called "FOOBAR"  which just runs "(MAIL)TUMS", and I say "FOOBAR JOE",
it works just as if I said "TUMS FOOBAR JOE" and/or "TUMS JOE"  checking first
to see if the program name is a command already, and if not, ignore it as the
vehicle which caused TUMS to be run.

Thus a program called "LIST" would allow "LIST expression" and a program such
as "READ"  would permit "READ expression" to work nicely.  Then I could stop
using RDMAIL, and say "READ NEW"  or "LIST NEW" from monitor without having
to do anyhting more... of course, I guess "TUMS LIST NEW" works... but I am
speaking about the vehicle to allow programs to run TUMS (or other programs).

That's an interesting idea, it does that now to some extent in that if it
is run with a command of "SEND??" it will prompt for a To: in the case of
no arguments.  There are some non-obvious things that would need to be
decided, like...
	1. should init commands be suppressed in that case?
	2. should user be left at command level (probably)?
		TUMS command level that is - so he can do NEXT/REPLY/etc.

I agree about
	TUMS LIST NEW
and	TUMS READ NEW
etc. being valuable.  I don't know how to syntatically (sp?) distinguish
between a command and a user name, for example, what if you wanted to do
a send to username READ?  I can think of two solutions:
	1. require TUMS SEND <addresses>
	2. assume command, treat as username only if invalid command, note
		that you can always enclose a username in <> for example
			TUMS <READ>
		would send to user READ, but
			TUMS READ
		would read your new mail

Subject: TUMS <command> [argument-expression(s)] 

How does this sound...

Read the user profile so that listing formats and macro's work... in
fact the command given may be a macro which expands to a real command.
Do not process any INIT commands... just definitions and flags.

Read the command line, and translate any "macros" seen.

If the first token is TUMS or something other than a legal TUMS command,
(for example, FOOBAR) then assume this is the command which invoked TUMS
and eat it.  It may be the name that the TUMS program is going by, or a
program designed to invoke TUMS.

If the next token (the first if it was not eaten) is a legal command then
dispatch to that command and take your consequences on the rest of the
line regarding formatting, etc.

What to do next if the token doesn't match a legal command?  Assume a
SEND command and dispatch.

Last but not least, since this command started at EXEC level, it ought
to finish at EXEC level.  Of course, If I say, "TUMS<CR>"  or "R TUMS"
or even "RUN (MAIL)TUMS" it should detect that and put me at command
level in TUMS.



Does this solve "TUMS READ"?  Yes, if "READ<CR>" does anything...
Definately "TUMS READ NEW" works.   "READ" should if it doesn't, default
to "READ ALL UNREAD" if nothing else has been specified or "READ ." if
we have specified a single message, or "READ $" if we have selected a
list of messages.  (IT may already, I haven't tried it for awhile).

"TUMS <SEND>" works fine too.  "TUMS foo"  where "foo" := "COPY file"
should work fine as well.  "TUMS SEND foo" may not translate too well,
but that would happen anyway if you try to send to a macro.

That sounds very reasonable.  Find any holes in it, let me know.

Hmmm, I think that's good, except READ still doesn't seem right.  Remember
you only get the first message, then back to command level (the exec in
this case).  I suppose I could keep a flag that said to return to monitor
whenever a next with no pending messages is done.  That's the only glitch
I can think of.  I'm also not sure what you meant about if its ran by another
name.  It always gets the whole command line, so it will see
	TUMS SEND WRS
or
if run by another program,
	READ FROM JOE
Now, in that case (run by a RUN uuo from program READ), should I throw
away the READ and barf on the FROM, or process the FROM?  I think you meant
to process the FROM, right?  -Bill

Subject: READ FRMO JOE 

If run by another program, say one called "READ", I'd say...
	READ FROM JOE
this runs program READ which is designed to run (MAIL)TUMS
TUMS sees the line "READ FROM JOE".
The first token IS a legal command, so it dispatches to READroutine
which then processes "FROM JOE".

This works the same as if I had said "TUMS<CR>" followed by "READ FROM JOE".
The only exception is that it was really run from EXEC level.
----------------
Hmmmm... Yes, READ only returning one message is a problem.  Actually I
find it annoying that it only returns one message.  I seem to anticipate
a whole slew of messages and only get one, to which I then continue to
read by typing ^J or ^K  (next and next-delete).  It wouldn't be so bad
if READ did read all of them... RDMAIL reads all of them!  The current
functionality of READ is to PERUSE the mail anyway, not to just READ it.
There is no way to currently issue one command (say from a command file)
which will READ ALL UNREAD and actually get all of the mail.

Maybe a new modifier ONCE or ONE could be added and if set, will only
print the first message {yuk} "READ ONCE ALL UNREAD"  or better yet,
"READ ALL UNREAD PAUSE" will pause after each one (back to command mode),
allowing commands like NEXT/PREVIOUS/etc to work on CSET like READ works
now.

TYPE will read all the messages at once, like RDMAIL does.  Its arguments
are identical to READ.  If you prefer it, you can do a
	SET MACRO READ "TYPE NEW UNREAD"
or whatever your fancy.  I would like to add a message at the prompt that
says how many unread messages from the read-set have yet to be displayed.
So even if you are reading already read messages, like READ FROM CARL, it
would remind you how many you have to go in some fashion like:
	[3 more msgs]
	>next
	...
	[2 more msgs]
	>
etc.

I like your suggestion and will plan on implementing it in the near
future.  Thanks

happenning when I go to convert a ppn to a username by
looking up the UFD and extracting the name from the rib.  I setup the
appropriate open block and perform an "XCT 2"  where
2 contains "CHANIO 3,addr"    3 contains 13,,2 which is .chOPN,,2
and addr contains an open block.

after the XCT, ac '17 is 0.  Either the XCT or the CHANIO itself is
somehow clobbering register 17.  I even typed  "CHANIO 3,addr$x" myself
and saw that register 17 was cleared.

I am reloading system 62 with /P-10 to determine if the monitor is causing
this problem...

It is mostly the same.  It passes arguments via disk, since there is
no way to write another frames TMPCOR without depositing a little program
and running it.  A newer version of ARGS looks at the TMPCOR and disk
if there is no command line.  Its not really new, it was last changed in
November 85 and somebody asked me for a transmittal information back
around then, so it should even have been transmitted.  It should be the
version you were working from, in fact.  At any rate.  It also handles the
log much more efficiently.  

    expects (SYS)XEXEC.CTL consisting of lines of the form:
	<n>,<username>,<program>
	<n>,<username>,<program>,<command>
	<n>+<o>,<username>,<program>
	<n>+<o>,<username>,<program>,<command>
    where
	<n> is 0 to run at system startup only, or the interval in hours
	<o> is optional offset, useful to run at a particular time of
	    day when <n> is a multiple of 24, for example, 24+6 will
	    cause the job to be run every day at 0600 local time.
	<username> is user to log frame in to
	<program> is the name of the program to run.  Default directory
	    is (SYS), not the <username> directory!
	<command> is optional string to pass to the program in TMP(core).
	    If present, program will be run at start address plus one.

    Known problems:
	Should change .FOCFM stuff to run LOGINN in child.
	Should log major failures to CTY.

Subject: Unit types in BPXKON and CPXKON. 

Each disk driver can return 2 bits of unit type to the monitor, allowing
a single driver to handle up to 4 different types if disks.  The 2 bits are
set by the capacity test, which is called from ONCDSK via PUSHJ P,@KONCPY(J).
The capacity test is a routine named BPXCPY in both BPXKON and CPXKON.

BPXKON does one test - it attempts to seek to cylinder 500.  If it gets an
error, it know it is talking to a 3670 (alias 3330 mod I) which as 440 cylinders
and holds 100 megabytes.  (We no longer have any disks of this type, although
the code is still there, and in PAKCOP.)  If the seek to cylinder 500 succeeds,
BPXKON assumes that it is talking the a 3675 (alias 3330 mod II, or Ampex 830).
This 200 megabyte disk has 880 cylinders, and is on all our systems except for
C26.  BPXKON knows that these devices have 19 heads, with 18 blocks per track.

When I created CPXKON from BPXKON, I modified the first test and added a second.
It now attempts to seek to cylinder 600.  If this succeeds, CPXKON assumes it
is talking to a 3675 (3330-II) 200 megabyte disk.  If it fails, CPXKON assumes
it is talking to a 3650, 300 megabyte disk.  Note that the 100 megabyte disk
is not supported.  The second test is to read the COUNT field of record 1 on
cylinder 0 track 0.  If it says the record consists of 576 bytes, it is 
formatted in blocks of 128 words each.  If it says the record consists of 2304
bytes, then it is formatted in pages of 512 words each.  Any other value 
indicates an improperly formatted disk.

As currenlty implemented, the 4 types of disks that CPXKON recognizes are
3675 in blocks, 3675 in pages, 3650 in blocks, and 3650 in pages.  (3650 in
blocks is a combination we do not want to support.)  By adding another test
to CPXKON (a seek to cylinder 900), then it could recognize a 3652 which 1110
cylinders (but is otherwise identical to the 3650).  That would make the 4
types of disks supported be 3675 in blocks, 3675 in pages, 3650 in pages, and
3652 in pages.

At this point, there is some question as to whether the 3652 has a native mode.
The Memorex manual "3674 Storage Control Unit Theory of Operations Manual"
3674.21-02 (PN 804332) says that the 3652 can emulate two 3650 volumes, or two
3675 volumes.  This may mean that the 3652 does not have a native mode, but
the manual does not explicitly state so.  All it has is a note, "For an
explanation of 3652 or 3644 emulation modes consult the appropriate Theory of
Operations Manual (3644.21 or 3652.21)."  We need to obtain this manual or
ask a Memorex representative for clarification.

Subject: ontyme message pickup and delivery 

    Carl,

    Has anyone been hosing with node code surrounding :930?  The last
    couple of ontyme messages which the appropriate TUMS object has
    forwarded to me have experienced MASSIVE data loss in the process.
    It's curious:  after I sent you mail about my loss of forwarding, and
    after said was restorted, I received 14 messages, most of which were
    intact.  The later ones (2, I think) in the 14-message burst of
    transmission lost data, however.  I just received 1 message in a single
    burst which was so badly mangled that I had to actually log into OnTyme
    to read it again.

    Anyway, you get the picture.  I suspect the base code because this has
    happened before and been the fault of some form of engine-resident
    code, rather than application code (to wit:  vis-a-vis:  see also:  the
    proper TUMS object).  Tell me otherwise, if such is the case.

 I just got your mail along with a ton of other mail... on 930.  Again,
I have not seen any data lossage recently on 930.  So, I suspect the

Subject: Suggestions... 

If we can keep a counter of how many DDBs we have created, added to the DDB
chains, then if we search more than that many times, we've looped somewhere!

Why not do once a minute code while catching up on time?  Unless it only
checks against uptime counters instead of actual clock time...  it could
confuse people who do DAYTIME commands...

(in particular, inactivity timeouts)


What happens to characters other than ^Z typed on the CTY in NETWORK mode?


What is th actual format of the SYSUDT variable, NSWTBL+5... is it the UDT
the system came up or the TDT?   KSYS is still ticks to system reload, right?

Can I assume that /P32 works?

I have a message from Peter (Stratman?) from CEGI asking about upgrading
their systems to /P (actually whatever is needed for XEXEC) and about some
testing of XEXEC on their systems.  I think that we need to clarify our
support picture with CEGI (or whatever they're now called) before we take
any action.

Subject: SUBMIT cannot "find" log file. 

I inserted MID930.LOG=MID930.CTL to have it run immediately.  While the
processor was running my job, I decided to insert it into the queue again,
this time with a date expression of "every day at 00:07".  Appearantly
SUBMIT attempts to create the LOG file just to see if you have license to
write in the specified directory.  This is good.  Unfortunately, SUBMIT does
not handle ENTER error code 3 properly.  It could not ENTER (JMS)MID930.LOG
because the file was being modifed.  The error message it reported back to
me was very misleading, it said "Cannot find log file MID930.LOG, enter name
of log file:".  What sort of potential security risk is it to assume that
error code 3 should be treated as no error at all.  Or to make the program
assume that the user is always allowed to write in his login directory.

Another comment:  While SUBMIT was prompting for a new log file name,
Control-C would not get me out.  Is there any way to cleanly abort in this
case when the user types ^C ?

It seems that some users log into systems and do not log off after completing
their work. This results in a heavily loaded system that needs to be 'policed'
on a regular basis.

There is a software program called 'free' that checks usernames on a regular
basis and logs off any users that are inactive and/or are in a Control C
state.

I am requesting that this program be loaded on the following Tymnet Dedicated
Systems:     Private Net Code Genning   Public Net Code Genning
               22,37,26,31                  25,70,33,54
The above systems are in a critical need of this program.


I appreciate any help you can give on this.
----------------------------------------------------------------
(end forwarded message)

Is your group interested in taking over the FREE program?  It seems to be
gaining popularity.  Its already running on a couple of these systems, but
will have to be setup on the others.  I could set it up, then turn it over
or turn it over and let you set it up, or keep it -- your preference.  -Bill

Any clue as to what would cause 6657 garble characters on aux circuits?
It usually goes away if we reload the host after any sort of "Fatal Node Error",
but not always.  That is, it is usually visible only after the F3 has gone
thru its resync code without being completely reloaded, but sometimes the
problem is stubborn and stays even though 930 was reloaded.

I don't understand why the problem affects outgoing aux circuits, and not
incoming aux circuits or terminal initiated logins.

Subject: Job Processor Sys's Documentation. 

Carl,

In my role as the virtual Bruce Ring, I need to know how the Job processor
handles certain situations:

1.)  User has SMTP server v
21 reater to the the Job Processor System (the
action to be taken with the log file text) to APPEND, and has set the DISPOSE
parameter to the the Job Processor System (the statement of specifications
determining the disposition of the log file) to DELETE.  What happens to the
pre-existing log file info when the job completes normally?  Does the system
delete the whole log file, including the pre-existing info, or does it delete
only the new iSMTP serve current execution of the job?

2.)  Does LOGLIMIT apply to APPENDed log files in toto, or only to the
appended portion, or does it apply at all?

3.)  Does RESTART work?  How is a job restarted?  When is a job restarted?

4.)  Is any MAILER implemented?  Joe has found that a job he entered got hung
starting up the mailer, with no mailer started and therefore no execution of
the job.

5.)  Should unimplemented commands and parameters, like SPOOLSMTP server v
21 rea on-line documentation, or should the on-line documentation be made
unavailable for now?  The following are what I currently believe to be
unimplimented:
	Parameters:
		SPOOL
		UNIQUE
	
	Commands:
		CODE


Most of the rest of my questions are more appropriately directed at Helge,
since they pertain to his program.  I would like to meet with you to discuss
the meaning and naming of some of the commands, parameters, etc.

thx!

everything is not...  MAIL is not implemented at all.  I actually

Subject: SZRPT.MAC is a mess. 

The author of SZRPT really screwed up.  Look at the following:
	T1=6
	T2=7
	LS=12
	T3=13
	54=54
	UFDBF=12
	MFDBF=13
...
	ARRAY UFDBF[3],MFDBF[3]
...
	CALLI
	INIT UF,17
	SIXBIT /DSK/
	UFDBF
	  JRST ...
...
GTUFD1:	MOVE T1,UFDBLK(UFDBF)
...
The coding is atrocious.  It's a wonder it works at all.  (In fact, it doesn't
even wait for an answer when it asks for "sort by").  It looks very much as if
the program was written before the CHANIO function that reads the UFD.  Then
someone added the .CHUFD call, which made the 3-word buffer header for reading
the UFD in buffered mode obsolete, so that person decided to reuse the name
UFDBF, but did not purge all the previous references to the symbol.

As currently coded, SZRPT attempts to use two overlaping buffer headers in the
ACs, which causes it to die with "?Address check for device at user PC 174"
when running under the /P33 monitor.  Since this program is so blatently wrong,
I will put a new version of SZRPT on SYS, and not retract the edit to the
Monitor that caught this problem.   /Joe

PASSWORD program creating version 42 in (WRS:62)PASSWO.*.  The new
version begins by asking the user for his current password.  This
is to prevent an unauthorized user from walking up to a terminal and
changing passwords.  This new version should be transmitted as soon
as it is QA'd.

I have also noticed thatmost PDP-10 systems are still running version
20 of the PASSWORD program.  Why is this so?

Subject: P034/P33-1 has hang fixed. 

My fault.  I started to re-arrange the dispatch table for the base-to-host
messages, got part way thru, then changed my mind.  I undid the changes except
for the case when we get a message type 5 = New Supervisor has taken over the
node.  The <AOJA P4,SCNIN1> was missing, causing SCNSER to POPJ without
advancing the IRING pointer, therefore it saw the same message over and over
and did not do anything about it.  24XP33 and 26XP33 have been patched on
M33 on their respective systems.  The /P33-1 monitor will not have this
particular hang problem anymore.		/Joe

          call the hotline was not cancelled.  Anyway, they got a SIMUUF
          stopcode while running the /P19-4 monitor, which means that RESET.PAT
          has not solved the problem.  Told them to reload from SYSTEM.SAV,

SUBJECT>   OnTyme Version 22


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


    Applied Communications Systems (ACS) is pleased to announce that
    version 22 of OnTyme will be deployed for customers beginning in
    August!  The following features and enhancements have been added.
 
    SUBJECT LINE.  On a :SEND or :REPLY the system will prompt for
    subject.  The subject text supplied by the sender will appear in
    the message header and all the message lists (:IN, :OUT, old,
    long, short, etc.).
 
    X.ONTYME.  This feature is an interface with which applications,
    PC "front ends", or intelligent terminal procedures may interact
    with OnTyme in a consistent, reliable, binary, machine-oriented
    format.
    
    PATHWAY.  This feature allows the user to log into any network
    host during an OnTyme session, capture data from the target host
    into the OnTyme workspace, transfer data between OnTyme and the
    network host, and execute commands on the host. The target host
    may reside in either the same network as OnTyme or in another
    network accessible through a gateway.
 
    XMODEM.  This feature is used for binary file transfer using the
    XMODEM protocol.
 
    SYSTEM GENERATED MESSAGES.  Version 22 of OnTyme will put a
    message in the :IN list of the sender regarding invalid recipients
    so they will no longer have to look through their :OUT (OLD) lists.
 
    RESERVED CHARACTERS. To facilitate future enhancements, six
    characters (!,@,#,$,%,&) will no longer be allowed in file names.
    These will be used later as 'wildcard' characters for displaying
    information with the :LIST command.
 
    :REPLY (cc)(msg#).  This command will send the contents of the
    workspace to the original recipients of msg#.
 
                                                                Page  2

    COMMAND SCANNER. The OnTyme code has been improved and made more
    efficient.  Many system messages have been grammatically improved
    and made more consistent.
 
    Version 22 is available on the Marketing test host so that you can
    become familiar with the new product features. To request a
    temporary id on the test host, send a request to ACS.ONTYME.
 
    More complete documentation is being written and included in user
    manuals, technical manuals, and *** files in OnTyme as
    appropriate.  Definitions of the enhancements in version 22 of
    OnTyme may be found in the public file *** ONTYME.NEWS. Please
    distribute this announcement within your organization.  
 
 
    Version 22 WARNING!
    -------------------
    All 'intelligent front end' processes should be adequately tested
    for compatibility with version 22 of OnTyme before August 1.  
 
    ACS will provide technical assistance to complete this test.  To
    provide the longest possible lead time for any necessary code
    conversions, please schedule these tests as soon as possible.  Ids
    on the Marketing test host are now available upon request from
    ACS.ONTYME. Please keep ACS.ONTYME informed of the results.
 
    There are two enhancements in version 22 of OnTyme that have the
    POTENTIAL of disrupting 'intelligent front end' processes such as
    OnTyme :EXEC procedures, PC based packages, and intelligent
    terminal procedures that match on the text of OnTyme messages or
    the format of the :SEND, :REPLY, :IN and :OUT commands.  
    
    First, the text of many of the more obscure (not frequently
    encountered) system and error messages has been revised for
    grammatical improvement and consistencey. The most common messages
    such as ACCEPTED and ALL MESSAGES READ have not been changed.  You
    may obtain a list of the text changes by sending a request to
    ACS.ONTYME.  In the event that an incompatibility is found between
    a front-end process and version 22, ACS will urge that the
    X.ONTYME protocol be adopted in the front-end to preclude any
    future problems.  Use of X.ONTYME will fix the problem once and
    for all.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.XONTYME for further
    information about this protocol.
    
    Second, each OnTyme session will default to having subject line
    enabled.  Each :SEND or :REPLY command will be followed by a
    prompt for subject.  The format of the :IN and :OUT lists will
    change to show a subject line for each message.  The subject line
    feature may be disabled at the session level providing a very
    simple solution to any compatibility problems caused by subject
    line.  Please :READ *** ONTYME22.SUBJLINE for further information
    about the subject line feature.
 
    Please direct any questions about this announcement to ACS.ONTYME.
 
    Thank you.

Subject:      SMOKING POLICY

                                                                   


Many of our employees and visitors prefer to conduct their 
business in a smoke-free atmosphere.  While we respect each 
individual's right to smoke or not, we are also responsible for 
providing a comfortable, safe and healthy workplace.

The following guidelines are an attempt to appropriately balance 
the preferences of both smokers and nonsmokers.

    o    Employees who smoke should do so primarily in their 
         immediate work areas, should respect the wishes of their 
         fellow employees, and should observe all designated 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Employees may designate their office/cubicle or work area 
         as a smoking or no-smoking area.  "No Smoking" signs are 
         available through stationery.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in elevators, hallways, 
         libraries and restrooms.

    o    Smoking will not be permitted in meetings or classes, 
         unless the meeting leader determines that it is agreeable 
         to all participants.

    o    Smoking will be permitted in designated areas within 
         breakrooms, dining areas (other than the food service 
         areas), lobbies and reception areas, provided that these 
         areas are properly ventilated.  Such areas must be 
         clearly designated and have adequate separation from 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in areas where it would endanger 
         lives, damage equipment and/or otherwise pose a safety 
         hazard.  These areas will be designated accordingly.

    o    Management has the responsiblity to resolve disputes 
         which may arise and to make reasonable accommodations for 
         all employees.



Page 2


In addition to these guidelines, all ISG organizations must ensure 
that smoking policies for their work locations are in accordance 
with any local government ordinances.

The successful implementation of this policy will require your 
cooperation, courtesy and accommodation of individual 
preferences.  Questions regarding this policy should be directed 
to your local Human Resources organization.

2-Aug-86 05:15/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operation, (415)498-2588, Merina, System F30.

Problem:  UIL stopcode with memory errors.  Deselected sector of memory, then
          got "Inconsistant Hash Constant" and "Too many last logical units"
          and "Logical unit 89 missing from DSKB".

Solution: Went on-site set breakpoints and check the home pages.  DSKB11
          messed up.  Of the 24 nonzero words in the HOM page, all but 5 were
          zero.  The check for missing logical units gets into an infinite loop
          if HOMLUN does not match HOMLOG.  Patched the HOM page on BPA13.
          Came up in CONSOL mode, ran DSKCLN in CHECK mode.  It complained that
          unit 9 was missing RIB pointers.  Put them in using (SPL)FILDDT.
          DSKCLN ran on in check mode, recycled and ran FULL DSkCLN at 8:30am.

Grrrr.  The problem is that you do not OPEN the queue explicitly, so if
the queue isn't open, you cannot get the defaults from the queue.  Since
I want you to use the defaults from the queue, I guess you need to open
the queue when you startup, and close it when you exit...  Or you can be
a little more gracious and only open it when you need to... for example,
if this is an INSERT, (since on a modify the queue must be open already)
then do the following...

	IF ( InQue )
	 then if not( OpnQue )
	       then begin "cannot open queue"
		print( error-message );
		return;
	       end "cannot open queue";

If the queue gets open, everything is fine... if not, there is a problem
and the error message should indicate this.

Subject: Option commands for SUBMIT 

Hmmmm.  Bill,
  I know we went over this, and I said I wanted to discuss it with Joe...

re: Adding DATES, EXPRESS, TEST  to the options command.

  I feel that DATES will allow the user to change a date expression, but
that EXPRESS and TEST are not necessary.  If a user doesn't know what an
expression will do, it should be tested before doing the insert at the
SUBMIT> prompt. It doesn't really matter, except the help message inside
the [Options] prompt is already too long (too many things can be changed
and each item takes a line) and adding TEST and EXPRESS, which are top-
level commands, and NOT options is a bit much.

  Also,  now that DATES is an option, the EXPRESS command is not needed
since HELP should show the current expression anyway.  If the first run
date-time is also shown, then TEST should also be unnecessary.

Joe,   what do you think?   You and Helge talk about it, and I will abide
by whatever you both decide.

Hi!

S'me. I tried to use AID today, and it's really beginning to piss me off. I couldn't seem to find a format it liked for the arithmetical finctions I wanted to
perform, for example, "*2*2"(cr) gives "Eh?" as a response. So does "*2*2=/".
At this point, i'd just as soon strangle it as use it. Please let me know whenou know when you are going to be home, so I can have supper ready. 

Well, at least (and I do mean LEAST) your broyther did his laundry today. He asked me if he could go with me if I went out anywhere, so I took him, in spite
of my feelings at this point. But since we got back, the trash has been piling
up in the kitchen, to the point where it's collecting on the counter. He's
even left some on the counter, because the trash bag is so full. But has the
sob bothered to take it out? Guess...even after he told me a few minutes ago that I look like hell, and I explained to him that that's what meningitis does to
you...takes all of your energy away without warning. In spite of how I feel, 
I think I have enough adrenalin to be able to drop-kick him to Tuscon, maybe
even a little past...well, I'll tell you the rest when you get home. 
Love, W

 Osman,

 I sent you a message on system 26, but incase you did not get it I will
repeat my findings here.

 I logged into system 26 for about an hour (40 times or so) and the
system did not crash. I noted one small point that maybe worth a mention,
a few times when the server set read file, not all of the "did not set"
message was printed IE.

 I just got your message on sys26 stating the above is a side effect
of the patch untill a better solution is found. Suits me!

Subject: Solved some of the APRFAT and UIL stopcodes. 

Osman and I tracked down the cause some of the APRFAT and UIL stopcodes.
It starts when a user in Great Britain uses a menu server to login and set
status.  Apparently a leave-deferred-echo message catches up to input characters
with all the satellite delays.  In any case, SCNSER sees message type 15 when
it is not ready for it.  On the KLs running P034/P-12, this causes a TTYZNE
info stopcode, with contents of P1 = 15 (the system stays running).  On the
KIs, any INFO stopcode turns off paging and causes a UIL halt stopcode.  On
C26-P034/P19-4, the INFO stopcode runs to completion, but accidently sets the
NXM flag causing an APRFAT stopcode at the next clock tick.

For C26, putting a JFCL at LDEC+2 in SCNSER will avoid the INFO stopcode.
For the KI systems, (M33)INFOKI.PAT will make INFO stopcodes work.

It is possible that the menu server is not strictly following TYMNET-II
protocol in respect to green balls and deferred echoing.  Since it tells the
host it has echoed the characters it is sending (but really doesn't), I
suspect the menu server.  We need to come up with a better way for SCNSER
to handle this problem.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



It seems that some users log into systems and do not log off after completing
their work. This results in a heavily loaded system that needs to be 'policed'
on a regular basis.

There is a software program called 'free' that checks usernames on a regular
basis and logs off any users that are inactive and/or are in a Control C
state.

I am requesting that this program be loaded on the following Tymnet Dedicated
Systems:     Private Net Code Genning   Public Net Code Genning
               22,37,26,31                  25,70,33,54
The above systems are in a critical need of this program.


I appreciate any help you can give on this.

The file (M33)P33TMP.PAT shows what has been patched to solve the problems

INFO stopcodes set the NXM flag on the KL.  INFO stopcodes work find on the F3,
the KS, and now that SVSETS has been patched, the KI.  It may be in the code
that reads S-bus diags from all possible memory controllers (code borrowed from

Subject: Micronode outage... 

Dennis,
  I sent you a copy of the CTY output and left word for you to call and
haven't heard back yet, so I'm sending you detailed mail instead.

  Node 2346 keeps crashing and just goes out to lunch... "P" seems to
contnue it and then immediately another stopcode.  "1000G" appears to do
the same.

  Node 10115 & 6657 both seem to also get BFC stopcodes every so often.
I don't know the timing of the CSE's on 2346 vs outages on 10115 or 6657
but I know that 2346 only seems to stay up a short while every time it
is reloaded (short = 1 hour or so).

  Also, after a BFC, we've seen buffers get transposed for different lines
when one or both lines are AUX circuits from the host.  Dennis Coffey has
gotten my text & I his on our respective screens.

  I would really like something done so that 2346 will at least stay up a
much longer time between stopcodes.  We've reloaded it and reloaded it
figuring that you haven't had time to look at it, and I'm not even sure
there is a way for you to look at a "dead" node.

Subject: Considerations for LOGINN. 

Right now, if you run LOGINN in the child frame giving it a positive AUN, it
GETTABs the username and uses that, which must be in the LUD.  (The positive
AUN could be anything, including [0,1] since it is overwritten by the PPN
specified in the LUD.)  In order to avoid the question "do you want to attach
to this job", LOGINN version 70.0 completely bypasses the loop that checks
for other jobs same PPN.  Question: How should XEXEC/EXECX/LOGINN handle
batch requests for people with the bit set that says "do not allow other jobs
to login under this name".  Should such PPNs be prevented from runnning SUBMIT
in the first place?  Do we still have such restricted users?

Another thought came to me while thinking about a modem connected to our
micronet.  We could have usernames that were accessable only if you dialed this
particular modem.  Why not allow them to come in from TYMNET via double login?
That is, put TXS930, TXS62, and TXS95 in the MUD with no password, and have
LOGINN ask for the local name and password.  Then Osman could allow his kids
to access our systems without using his password.  And TXS95 would be valid,
whether we were running TYMCOM-X or TOPS-10.

Putting it in the monitor might be nice.  The only disadvantage would be the
loss of the log.  I supose you could put stuff in the stream.  On the other
hand, I'm not sure anybody ever looks at the log.  I'd suggest the following
parameters:

	Number of free jobs desired.
	Minimum idle time required to kill a job.
	Maximum idle time allowed.
	Some method of handling exemptness (JBTPRV?)

Minimum idle would normally be something like 5 minutes.
Maximum idle would normally be 2^35-1.
Number of free jobs desired would be JOBN/10.
Exemptness is the only tricky part.

You wouldn't need a polling interval since you can check whenever somebody
logs in and less than the desired free jobs left.  And also whenever a job
becomes idle for the minimum time and less than the desired free jobs left.

This would be better than FREE does now.

Maybe also consider ports free?

It does not look like this particular crash was saved.  If it happens again,
be sure to call Operations and get them to deposit 1 in 30.  We have seen
a couple of similar hangs, here circuits into the system are till up, but
no response.  The base is still happy since channel 1 is being serviced, but
channel 7 is stuck in an infinite loop, trying to find the end of the DDB
chain.  In two of the crashes, there is a loop in the linked list of TTY
DDBs.  It looks as if the routine that unlinks a TTY DDB when the job is
killed or zapped was storing the wrong new forward pointer.  I have added
a consistancy check to SCNSER, it is is the P034/P33 monitor.

Subject: MONED1 working again. 

There is a bug in the GETMAP routine, which maps file pages into memory.
Aparently it will not allow more than 12 pages to be mapped.

When MONED1 is reading P034.MEM backwards from the end, it looks for the
latest number like "/P29".  Then it looks for the major version number, such
as "P034/Q".  If the major version number is 12 pages from the end of the
file, then MONED1 dies trying to map SYSID.DAT.  If the major number is more
than 12 pages from the end, then MONED1 dies trying to find it.

My work-around was to duplicate the text "P034/Q" closer to the end of the
file.  To prevent this from happening again, we need to either 1) Fix MONED1
to not use GETMAP, or 2) Release monitors more often.

Subject: Misc BACKUP & MONED1 

Backup schedules...
  incrementals every day sounds nice, but it does take time and
requires physical access to the machine...

  as we are being paid a bit more than operators, we should try to
minimize our "operations" tasks as much as possible.  ALL-FILES are
a fact of life... and once a month is the minimum we can get by on.
incrementals, on the other hand vary depending on how much work we
do on our machines.  Since there are only 4 of us, I feel that four
times a week (unless we have a special case) is enough giving each
of us one turn at it each week.

  we should look at the amount of work done on a daily basis on each
machine (in general) and decide when the 4 optimal times to backup
the system are taking into consideration what time of day each of us
would be dong the backup.
  (clearly, my backing up the system last thing on Sunday, and someone
else backing up the system first thing on Monday isn't very good...)

As long as I work Saturday & Sunday, I feel a backup of my work as I
finish up on Sunday lets us start the week fresh.  Tuesday afternnon
(after our weekly meeting) sounds like another good time, since we all
try to get things finished up for the tuesday meeting "show & tell".
I'm not sure when the other two "best" times ought to be...  anyone
have any better suggestions...?


Re: MONED1 -- Good work... I'm suprised we didn't run into this on the
    /K monitor release... must have barely made it with /J64 under the
    wire.  We've also been a bit more verbose than on previous releases
    of the monitor and that probably accounts for /P32 too far from
    the end.

    Now that you mention it, GETMAP does have that restriction on the
    number of pages... I wonder if it is limited to 12, or if it can
    just be changed to a larger number...  anyway, if I plug in the
    VMFILE routines, it won't matter since it only keeps one page mapped
    at a time (just like SIMIO).

With the Service Billing migration to St. Louis nearing completion, modif-

user name field. Our thoughts in order to reach all PDP users is to send a
message upon 'sign on' or other applicable way that you may recommend. The
following message is requested to be sent:

"As part of the consolidation process wherein McDonnell Douglas Information
Services Group is integrating the former Tymshare data processing with those
services previously provided by McAuto and, at the same time, introducing a
degree of commonality between processing on IBM equipment and Digital Equip-
ment PDP 10s, it has become necessary to standardize the user name field size
at eight characters. A few customers currently have user names which exceed
this parameter. Please review your files and, if any user names in excess of
eight bytes are in existence, modify them to the extent necessary to reduce
them to eight or less. Effective 1 November 1986, both invoicing reports and
machine readable detail accounting information will reflect only eight
positions in this field. MDISG appreciates your cooperation in this endeavor
and regrets any inconvenience it may cause."

The above message has been agreed to by Joe Godwin, director of Customer
Billing and Forest Moore, director of Remote Computing Services. If you have
any questions or concerns please contact me as soon as possible. We would like
to have this to the customers by the end of August at he latest.
