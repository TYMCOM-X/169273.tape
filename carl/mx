o  I am glad you and Cheryl are back, hope you had a good time.

o  Yes, we are still waiting for the Baby. If nothing happens
   between now and Jan 7, Dr says she will induce it, hope
   will have he/she by then. I am not sure but might take the
   next week(Jan 7-11) off, will let you know.

o  Nothing realy important happened while you were gone.
   (1) /N Monitors for Paris machines are cut but not installed.
       Only system running the /N monitor is S59 since middle of Dec.
   (2) Only urgent matter is the P90's Batch problem which you have
       copy of the mail Ken B. sent. I couldn't resolve the problem.
       There isn't any other problem. See you soon.

Subject: Payroll problem!

  I just finished looking over my last three paryoll stubbs that I picked
up at the office today.  There seems to be something dreadfully *WRONG*
with the amounts.  They've apparently only paid me for one week, for the
two week period, 17-Dec-84 to 30-Dec-84!  If something strange with MDC
is going on, I'd like to know about it, and if not, I'd like to know what
happened to my other week!

  I'm rather depending on that money to cover my first house payment, and
other new bills.  Just because we're switching payroll on 1-Jan-85 should
not affect our checks?  should it?  MDC better not be withholding a weeks
pay... Tymshare was probably already doing that....

  I will show you what I have when I see you later tomorrow.

I tried to run the BATCH program to test the problem that was reported and
it seemed to work fine from the user end.  I tried it as myself, username
CARL and as Arlette B, username ABLAM to check the district 0/3 vs. 38 code
and they both worked fine.
 
Operations may see something else, but I'm not sure if that's a 940 problem
or not, if they do indeed see something wrong.  If it is a 940 error, I do
not believe that there is anyone available other than Guy Blood who knows
what to fix.  Please advise.  Does the problem still happen?  If so, can we
do a test, with me "linked" to who-ever is receiving the error when they
try it.  If the problem is gone, then this is superfluous.

that correct technical errors ignoring mere cosmetic changes (typos, etc.).
Bruce states that you told him all technical edits other that the addition

Major lack at this time is some cut at a distribution list so we can

it up and delete it.  Also, can we back up some of the things in

How about 
    make A xor B xor C
    IV := new( [ A xor B xor C ] );
Now you have an item with type BRACKETED-TRIPLE that you can put in sets
and stuff.  Also, you can have an array COUNTS[0:itemmax], and use
    COUNTS[cvn([A xor B xor C])] as your counter.  You can't use the datum
of the bracketed-triple item, since the datum is already used for the
association.  Not really better, but it may be faster since it only searches
the associative store once.

The other thing would be
    make STOPPC xor MONTH eqv FILE;
then to increment the counter,
    set CRASHES;
    integer itemvar STOPPC,MONTH;
    set itemvar CPU;
    STOPPC := cvsi( "ILLINS+4", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( STOPPC := new, "ILLINS+4" );
    datum(STOPPC) := datum(STOPPC) + 1;
    MONTH := cvsi( "Jan84", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( MONTH := new, "Jan84" );
    datum(MONTH) := datum(MONTH) + 1;
    FILE := new( "(CRASH:39)CRA004" );
    make STOPPC xor MONTH eqv FILE;
    CPU := cvsi( "KI", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( CPU := new(phi), "KI" );
    put FILE in datum(CPU);
this gives
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINS := datum(cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesInHJan84 := datum(cvsi("Jan84",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINSinJan84 :=
	length(cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG) xor cvsi("Jan84",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINSonKI :=
	length((cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG) xor any) inter datum(cvsi("KI",FLAG)));
and so forth.

Carl,

     there are a couple of directories on sys 33 that MAY have files of need
to us.  I have inventoried all directories with names of apparent interest,
and have surveyed people in the section (who are located here), to learn of
any usernames they need to remain on sys 33.  I have 2 questions for you:
1.)  Do you have any usernames on 33 which MUST stay up, other than CARL?
2.)  Do we need to keep tape or current files from usernames MATOKA and
YEUX?

     NOTE:  we are keeping library tapes of the directories containing the
the files used in the developement of much of our software.  I will have the
RIPOFF.DIR files put in my directory, initially.  As always, I'm open to
suggestions for improving the procedure.

The only problem that I have with January 18th is that it may be too

Subject: OPPS move to system 34

Jenny,
  While I'm thinking about this.... whatever system OPPS is moved to,
everyone at Tymshare who has a status password will need to log into
that system to change their password.  That is another reason why it
might be a good idea to keep the host number C33 around... it seems to
me that we'd be making a lot of work for Validations to move just about
every internal user, since almost every internal user has some status?

(I may be wrong about the percentage that has status, but in any case
there's a lot of usernames involved if you consider the entire OPER
status tree...)

In-reply-to: your message of 10 JAN 85 01:33:52  

Dennis,
  I would like to remind you that I talked to you about the reasons
I was not forwarding ONTYME messages to other users in this account.

1.  At the time there were only 2 active people in the account:
    OSMAN and MYSELF...
    Everyone else added was added because I pushed for us to keep a
    separate TXS account even though it was not used much.
2.  I also mentioned to you that I was waiting for certain commands and
    a user interface for TUMS (the SENDMA/RDMAIL system) on TYMCOM-X.
3.  I was on vacation at the time of said notice about the demise of
    system 33 and far away from any terminal to wit to do anything about
    about it.  So let's not use "responsibility" or lack therof in the
    forwarding of an important message as the basis for anything.
4.  The message that this is in reply to...  "identify yourself"?
    Come now... who gave you your account within TXS to begin with?

================================================================

1.  You want more distribution from ONTYME... then as of later today you
    have it, probably unfiltered... unless I can rig something to throw
    away every second message (every 2nd msg says to re-distribute the 1st).
    There are now more than 2 people in this account who are really
    attempting to use ONTYME.  Thus, I will ask you to solicit from those
    of you in Fremont, who(m) else wants to receive bulk ONTYME mail.

2.  The TUMS user interface is now both available and usable!  It has the
    ability to forward and re-distribute messages with and without comments
    by the forwarding "person".  It will be used to re-distribute messages.

3.  I'm back from vacation now... tonight was my first chance to cull all
    of the TXS.SUP mail together... sometime soon, I will re-send all
    appropriate mail to those of you who want it.

4.  Need I say more? ... I too have been very busy, tracking down software
    which WILL be affected (possibly adversely) by this system change, since
    my return and the matter of a few un-sent messages no matter HOW very
    critical they may have been has not been high up on the list of more
    urgent things to do.  I only caught this message because it was ALL in
    lower case!

Actually, I'm rather disappointed that you felt that you had to go through
all the trouble you've gone to, talking to Les Metour, etc... you knew that
I wasn't completely back yet, and you knew that I was handling the TXS
account.  If you had a question, you should have asked me, or Osman..  I
showed him how to check the TXS.SUP mail before I left, but at that time
there wasn't much but "junk mail" as far as TYMCOM-X was concerned.

Grumble grumble grumble...

   ...I'll talk to you later about this.  If you want to help with
the distribution of the ONTYME mail, you are welcome...  I've set up
and account on 930 just for TXS.SUP, called TXSSUP and as soon as SRA
gets the forms that I got Craig to sign the last time I was in Fremont,
it will be valid on the network as well.

As per your sugestion, I've created a file in my OnTyme acct. (TXS.D/COFFEY)
named * MEMHEAD, with the desired stuff.  Re. the company 'junk' mail on
OnTyme:  possibly easiest tack would be to leave it in OnTyme, since the
people here use OnTyme fairly regularly--just 'get' the OnTymre message
into TXS.SUP's Ontyme workspace, and send it to * ACCTUSERS (after that
file has been updated).

I'll survey the people here about what they want filtered from their 'junk'
mail.  Being across the bay isolates us, so general distribution OnTyme
message can be valuable sources of information.  I'll let you know what they
want---or the easiest solution may be just turn it all over to Lois Frost.
Her extension here is 2651.

Thanks for your patience.

I think you'll find it undesirable to keep more than about 50 messages in
your current file (even though it can handle 999).  Expunge is something
you'll probably do quite rarely, (try logout).  And, maybe I'll change it
to show the ones its deleting rather than keeping.  -Bill

I'm somewhat confused.  I realize (again) I have difficulty processing
verbally imparted information.  I need something tangible, like written
documentation, to comprehend info.  (My kid, with an IQ > 160, has same
problem, but even more so.)  My personal processor (mind) works like
MAGNUM:  for stuff to be retained and accessable it must be loaded into
the data base with formal procedures and the input source must be of a
restricted type.  I have limited interfaces to other "host
languages"--like verbal input.

Enough of the analogy!  Although I'm not dumb, I'm somewhat confused
about what you"ve given me about TUMS:  too much, too fast.  A better
mode would be our spending time together, you giving me an overview, and
my asking questions about each part of the system as I got a
sufficiently clear understanding of previous material.  Sort of slow but
thorough.  Our minds don't work exactly the same.Received: From EMSTXS.Ontyme.Tymnet by 930.Tymnet; Fri, 11 Jan 85 19:04:03 UT

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective immediately, the following significant changes have been made in
Travel Policy for the ISG Blue Sector to bring us more in line with
the needs of our working environment.  A major ingredient in these
changes is the increased responsibility and authority assigned to
management to exercise judgement in approving various travel expenditures.

Weekend Travel Policy is revised as follows:

   a.  Travelers may return home every other weekend.
   b.  Travel home every week may be allowed at the discretion of
       the immediate supervisor (Manager or above) and the Project 
       Manager (if applicable).  The decision to allow travel home every
       weekend should be based on these guidelines:
       
          Travel is paid by the client;
          The cost of travel home is less than or equal to remaining
          at the work site;
          Personal circumstances of the employee;
          Status of the project.

   c.  Every 28 days, the employee may choose to accept roundtrip 
       transportation for a designated individual from home base to
       the work site.  This option replaces one roundtrip home.  Travel
       for a designated individual may occur more frequently than every
                                                                Page  2

       28 days, if approved by the employee's Division Head or above.
   d.  Airline tickets should be purchased at the lowest convenient
       unrestricted coach fare.  It is the responsibility of the
       approving authority to assess convenience and cost.

Other Travel Policy changes are as follows:

   a.  Individuals attending training, meetings and conferences in the
       local (home base) area may be reimbursed for lodging, meals
       and other related business expenses with approval of immediate
       supervisor (Manager or above).
   b.  Reasonable actual laundry expenses and telephone calls to home
       will now be allowed for any length trip with approval of
       immediate supervisor (Manager or above).  Receipts are required.
       It is the responsibility of the Manager to judge if the expenses
       are both reasonable and appropriate.

The approval requirements as identified in para. 2 and 3 represent
minimum approvals; the Director or above responsible for one or more
departments can specify additional higher level approvals within his
organization, if desired.

Please contact Penny Ramsey at Ext. 35130 in St. Louis, if you have any
questions regarding these policy changes.

Tymnet Validations has validated all of us on the MUX.  However, Don Murtaugh--
Tymnet's Manager of Operations--has not yet put us in the MUX's LUD, due to 
some accounting problems resulting from unresolved issues caused by the
McDonnel takeover.

If your home system is down the network automatically logs you into the MUX.
Currently, when you log in to the MUX, you get a message about sending an 
ONTYME to TYM.DJM (Don Murtaugh) about validation on the MUX.  I am in contact
with Don about this, and am working to get this completed ASAP.  When we are
validated on the MUX, I will be glad to share what I know about this very
handy network utility.  (It is handy.  As Don said to me: "I don't know what
I did without it, before I had it.")

I will keep on top of getting this validation completed, and will keep you
informed of my progress.

Craig:  This might be expedited if you were to contact Don with your added
request.

Well,
  I went in and moved the jumper between the 9600 and 4800 clock pins and
that seems to have made a big difference.  We'll get to see how it works
on Monday when the rest of the world comes into work.

  So, it's up that way until we get around to ordering the line drivers.
'Tis a pity we didn't think of this earlier in the week... sigh.  Dennis
knows about it, and as far as the line drivers, he said there are literally
hundreds of loine drivers we can buy... all that we need to know is that
we want SYNCHRONOUS and (I'd guess) 9600 baud.  My best guess would be to
check with Liz or Mary what they last ordered for anyone else, or Tymnet
and ask them what they usually buy for internal Tymshare use (for example,
what do they use in the field offices?).

Subject: JBTINA(J)  JBTPRV(J)[ PVDINA

I think Todd put in the inactivity timeout stuff... but I'd like to
first bounce this off you before I do anything with it.  Right now
hree ways to set/clear an auto-logout time limit.

1)  setting bit PVDINA in JBTPRV using SETPRV will set the default
    autologout limit of 15 minutes.
    clearing this bit with SETPRV clears any limit set, however set.
2)  SETINA AC,  will set an arbitrary limit up to 17 bits wide or
    zero will clear it.  In the current monitor, this pays no attention
    to PVDINA in JBTPRV and could care less about it. (UUOCON)
3)  SET AUTOLOGOUT n   and  SET NO AUTOLOGOUT
    This too ignores PVDINA completely!  (COMCON)

This seems to me to be a sheer waste of a PRV bit since SETINA and the
command provide the same capabilities...  and checking is easy, 3 fields
in JBTINA(J) available in the gettab tables!

 2 proposals.  --- 1) Remove (FREE) PVDINA from JBTPRV & use -1 in
                      SETINA to set the default value.
               --- 2) Make COMCON & UUOCON set & clear PVDINA.

In either case, I was thinking that the hardcoded 15 minutes could be
made into a "nice" NSWTBL entry so that operations or someone with the
right license could change it depending upon system load.

================================

Let me know what your thoughts are, so I can document it... I'm trying
to the YAMM out and I'd like some of these things to be "ACCURATE"!!!!

Well, the idea behind the JBTPRV bit is that it can be specified by noname.
I'd much rather a value be specified by noname and do away with the bit.
If the value is '777777, then the operator settable system default will be
used.  This will make programs like FREE alot simpler (maybe).  The biggest
problem is that this would require changes to both LOGINN and NONAME.  But,
its probably worth it.

If you agree, you can just "not document" the default bit in JBTPRV, but
leave it in until LOGINN and NONAME are changed.  You would need to change
the code to check for '777777.

The MOVE command doesn't have a "MOVE ?" feature... to tell me how it works!

I was checking to see if it APPENDS... that was the biggest pain in DWS's
mailer that the WRITE command always overwrote the file given instead of
appending to the end...

So, How does MOVE work?

Wouldn't it just be safer to let "any user" clear the mail-waiting bits
but not set them... or if they meet the requirements of SETMAx for writing
/deleting a file in SYS with ALL NO NO, then let them do it?

The only hassle is that... if a person inadvertantly clears it, because
they don't know that it will get cleared, (or they're running an old
program which sets bits, but only masked ones *) ...

*** What about...
  instead of MOVEI AC,ADDR       we do     MOVE AC,[<flag>B0+ADDR]
             SETMAx AC,                    SETMAx AC,

where <flag> = 0 to set the mail-waiting bit, and 1 to clear it!

Since you can only do it to your own job, there is no need to check to
see if they can write a file in SYS.  The objective of that is just to keep
people from wildly setting eachother's bits.  What's the harm in setting it?
When the offending programs exits, the user will just get [mail waiting].
He'll then say RDMAIL and not get anything...eventually he'll get annoyed
and fix his program, but there's no security violation.  As for clearing it,
it could cause a user to not see mail in a prompt manner, but, then so
might running RDMAIL in a detached child fork, certainly with more sever
consequences.  Every program I've ever seen do a SETPRV does a GETTAB first.
If they don't, they'll clear all kinds of new stuff.  -Bill
[we could weed them (programs that don't do GETTAB before SETPRV) out by
adding a new bit that must be set to stay logged in - te he]

What's happenning to the RDMAIL/SENDMA/TUMS interface on 930?

I used to be able to say "TUMS READ NEW" or "TUMS SEND WRS"
and now when I say that, I just get TUMS....> and a prompt.
Successive READ NEW commands seem to re-type the same message
again and again...
Using SENDMA and RDMAIL (at least the commands from monitor)
seems to produce mail messages devoid of spaces... i.e.
 "This is a test...1 2 3 4"  comes out looking like
 "Thisisatest...1234"        ...something is wrong?

Maybe there's an old SENDMA/RDMAIL on 930 somewhere in my DO list
which looks at DEF,LOG,SPL,MPL,FTSYS,SYS,WRS,NDT[old SDANIELS] & SAILIB.
I haven't really looked... but I'm not the only one experiencing these
problems on 930.... have you broken something?

Subject: HP2621 & TV interference

Bill,
  I don't beleive I've asked you this question before, but I think you
would know what the answer is...

  When I turn on the HP2621, I don't even have to dial in, and I get
an incredible amount of interference on my TV set for the low end
channels, 2, 4 and 5.   2 & 5 seem to be the worst... anyway, I'm not
sure if the problem is in the line or radiated through the air...
(None of my neighbors have complained... but then I'm not going to
ask.. to find out IF I am bothering their reception)

  I tried one of the cheapie radio-shack line interference filters and
one of their antenna filters... neither seems to make any real difference.
Do you have any ideas on how to get rid of the interference without
(of course) turning off the HP?

  PS... this is not really a new problem... it used to happen at my old
apartment as well, so the new house isn't really a consideration...

  PPS... someone mentioned sheilding the HP... but that isn't really very
practical... I've tried sheilding the cables with tin-foil and lining the
inside of the HP with foil & this helps a little, but not nearly enough.

Subject: 552/554

Well,  it seems that lowering the baud rate to 4800 works well enough to
keep the network connection up.  I don't know what the error rate is, but
I'd like to know if the re-transmission rate is accessible so that we can
decide if purchasing the line drivers would be worth the improvement...

Let me know....

Osman loaded 554's new code & all works to the best of our knowledge...
Ports on 554 go directly through 3143 instead of through 552 to get to
Tymnet.. and of course, ports on 552 works as they always did (i think).
The only real question that we have is can Tymnet ever understand that
552 talks to 554 so that if the 552/3146 link goes away either because
the line has a problem or 3146 goes down, then we'd still be able to get
to 930 (any host on 552) through 554/552?

Also, can we now build circuits from 552 through 554/3143 into tymnet?
If the same even (as above) occurred, or if the outgoing circuits on 552
were ever full?

This is a problem, indeed.  Its the plastic case, I think.  From the sounds
of it, you've tried everything I can suggest, except to do more ofof what
you did.  Pull out all the wires, except power.  This will tell you what
portion of the interference is coming from cables.  Aluminum should be okay,
but it needs to be well connected to itself at the seams, or it could
actually make it worse (by acting as an antenna).  Make sure that the seams
are making good contact.  Copper screen is the best, because you can solder
to it (for the seams) and because it doesn't disturb (much) the air flow.
Also, make sure you ground the shield (ground prong in cord is ok).  Other
than that,
  1. get cable
  2. get another type of terminal
Oh yes, there is a conductive paint made for this purpose, I don't know
where to get it (or what to call it), but I'll try to find out.
PS - if your drop from the antenna is twinlead, you might try coax --
you'll probably get better reception, anyway.  You'll still need the
twinlead for UHF unless you put an amp at the antenna, but the RFI
doesn't seem to affect UHF.

Hi Carl,

I've been trying to call you but there hasn't been any answer and I 
guess there is not message operator for me to leave a message with.  What
I would like to know is, has the OPPS program been fixed on system 34.
What is the status of this problem.  The last I heard was that you 
were looking into the problem and was trying to find out about PJ
so how is it going?  Please give me a call (214)637-7324 or ontyme
me at TCMS.JENNY.

Thanks
Jenny Guerrero

Hi Jenny...
  Got your mail, sent a copy to Dennis Coffey also.  I presume the central
switchboard at Tymshare Cupertino would have been able to switch my calls
but I don't know...
  I've actually been in most of the past three days... Hmmmm.  My new phone
number is: (415) 794-2515, or from cupertino 116-2515.  I currently do not
have my phone forwarding to the secretary, so I will have to fix that...

  I found the NEW version of OPPS, and from my preliminary research I see
that OPPS and SETOP don't care what system they are on, so just moving
them to 34 should work fine.

  Someone still needs to talk to Nancy Burriesci about (PJ)PAM and what
she needs to do to make system 34 the base system for everything, not just
the OPER status stuff...
  At this point, you might try calling Nancy yourself...  I've been pretty
busy with some other things.  You should be able to get her phone number
by calling Cupertino or from the corporate phone list on ONTYME.

  gotta run... will try to call you later...

Maybe, it was "difficult" to put in when I added processes.  Processes, it
turns out, are the only correct way to handle ^C trapping.  If you use the
GOTO from an immediate interrupt trick by patching external integer JBTOPC
to be the address of a procedure that does a GOTO, you run the risk of doing
so from the middle of the string garbage collector!  What a disaster!  On
the other hand, a way to "patch" the return address of a defered interrupt
is not provided.  So, what I did, is each command is executed as a process.
If you ^C, the deffered interrupt routine TERMINATEs the command process.
This leaves you back at the JOIN that the main process did waiting for the
command to complete.  What a LEAPING PAIN!  Oh well, so much for that
unsolicited programming pearl.

Perhaps I'll fix it in the next couple versions.

Carl,
Osman has shown me how to reload 930, and supervised while I did it this
morning.  I have it all except logging in over SHUT to set the system's
time clock.  I often am the first person here in the a.m., so I might be
the one to restart the system.  Would you give me the status to log in
over a shut, to complete this process in the future?

Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The OPPS program does not fully work on system 34. I changed my
status password yesterday around 0900 cdt. I waited over 24 hrs and 
I checked the other systems to see if they changed, the only system
that the password changed on was system 34,. It did not transmit to
the other hosts.

Also Pj was updated on system 34, Jan Krivanec and Landa Howell
transferred files from 33 to 34 and updated the master directory
file, so the OPPS program should now look at 34 as its base
system.

If you have any questions, please ontyme me at TCMS.JENNY or
call (214)288-0494 (home # for today).

Thanks
Jenny

	PDP-10 Software crashes 1983 vs 1984.

	In 1983 total was 162 and in 1984 it was 290. Here are some
of the reasons which might have contributed to the crash count
increase in 1984.

1. Increase in frequence of "Base Type 7" crashes in /L & /N monitor.
2. Inclusion of system 5780 in Fremont to the crash counts which
   runs TOPS-20 Monitor.
3. Inconsistent entry of crash codes into the MUR Date Base.

Subject: "Hi Carl Just to let you know I"...

Hi Carl,

Just to let you know, I talked to Nanacy last night. She sugessted
copying the files for user sspambin from 33 to 34, which we did.
I tried changing my password on 34, which it took, but it still did 
not copy over to any other system.  So I guess I might have to call
her back, unless you come up with something.

Talk to you later
Jenny

Subject: Restoral of archived FDM files, & loading high/low segments.

1.)  Restoral from archives:
The re-transmittal of software, in packages, requires restoral of files
in current FDM files from archives.  Bob Jacobs tells me that the archives
are in building C.  One place where we could get this stuff all together
for assembly into packages is MCH on system 33:  Mike has 250K pages in
that directory with virtually nothing there, and the system currently
has 363K pages available.  

What do you think of using that directory for the assembly?  Do you have
any better suggestions, or should I call Mike about using his directory?


2.)  High/low segments:
My knowledge of the 10s' programming languages is mostly F40.  I've had
a question from Juzen Toy about F40's compiler/loader, and loading into
.HGH and .LOW seg's.  All I know about is loading into core and saving
the core image as a .SAV file.  How do you segment into the two files?
Specifically, how do you create the segments, so the program can be
'SSAVE'd into a .SHR and a .LOW segments?


Wish I had another resource with your level of TYMCOM-X experience, so I
didn't have to bother YOU with questions about EVERYTHING.  

Thanks!

Subject: Creating an account for one's wife.

What is the proceedure for getting an account on 930 for my wife Sally?
I know it takes more than just LVALID since the dial-up lines are not
connected directly to the micronode.

It's just me again, have you found anything out about the password program.
The last time I talked to Nancy, which was on 2/11/85 she said she really
wasn't suppose to be working on this problem. She did tell us to try and
move the files for SSPAMBIN, but this still doesn't seem to solve the pro-
blem. Maybe if you talked with Nancy, you can find out more. I did notice
that on system 34, she was logged running MAKJOB, which I believe
has something to do with this program. Also how about the SETOP program,
it still give a question mark (?) after entering your name, are you able
to find out the problem. Please call me or ontyme me.

Thanks
Jenny

Nancy Burriesci tells me she changed her password on sys 34 and it was

implemented the needed changes to the PJ=related software.  I don't
understand why you report problems, unless these changes have been within

Nancy suggested that the problems you report may be due to people still
using the OPPS program on sys 33.  Possibly we should replace OPPS on 33
with a message that directs the user to system 34.

That's the latest fron the trenches.

Subject: Suggested new features for TUMS

Hi, I'm Joe Smith.  I came from CSM (Colorado School of Mines) and am now
working with Carl and Osman under Craig Fletcher.

At CSM, we were runnin TOPS-10 version 7.02 and the MAIL system from NIH.
I modified LOGIN to check for the presence of mail, and automatically run
SYS:MAIL.EXE by default.  In the user's SWITCH.INI, "LOGIN/MAIL:5" was the
default and would tell LOGIN to list the FROM and SUBJECT field of the
first 5 unread letters, and "LOGIN/NOMAIL" would not list the one-line
summaries and would not run MAIL, but would report "[Mail waiting]" if true.

Could you or Carl add a feature to LOGON where it would output a one-line
summary of the first 5 unread letters automatically at login time?

Subject: SAIL / FTSAIL Compilers.

I'm creating the test package for Craig, and have found a difference
between the core-image file created in the transmittal and the one I've
created.  This has occurred in creating the .SAV file for CHKPNT.

Compiling the program on sys C33, I found that RPG defaults to the
FTSAIL compiler, giving a different core-image than obtained by by
compiling with the older SAIL compiler (a different number of pages in
core and a different checksum for the core-image file).

Does this mean anything about the way the program runs?

Subject: 34 crashes

I think CRA001 and CRA002 are due to TUMS.  I put TUMS up on 34 over
the weekend (including XEXEC) and put SCM and PRVMSK patches in as
they are necessary for TUMS.  TUMS was behaving quite strangely and
operations says it crashed several times on Sunday.  They backed up
to an old monitor and it stopped -- not because the patch was bad, but
because without the patch, TUMS wouldn't run.  There isn't much to go
on in the crash files - no UPT saved (why?).  Anyway, its probably
safe to go back to the current (K-17 I think).  TUMS seems to be
tickling the old framing CRAFRM bug, so I just un-installed it until
we get /N up on 34 (soon I hope).  -Bill

Yes!  Everybody was running in Q3 for the most part (by ICP) before.
After changing the thresholds for job sizes, we get a much nicer

I still play with it a little from time to time - I'm sure what I have
isn't optimal, but it is noticably better than what was there.  -Bill

Subject: Input ring time-out crashes

Just thought that you'd be interested in a little tidbit and may
have some comments or info...

These are our most frequent crash type, and until yesterday we've
had no inkling of what could possibly be causing them.  It appears
that in > 95% of the crash files still on disk, PISTS shows CH1 in
progress at ITMINT (interval timer) with a garbage PC word.

Comparison shows that most of these couldn't possibly be PC words since
bits 13-17 are non-zero.  Also, it seems that bits 32-35 are always 1's.
What else looks like that?  The IRING data!  Looking at ITMINT or CH1
in 8-bit format produces what looks like data destined for the IRING.
In each case the message type and the arguments following agree fully
with the formats described in SCNSER and look like valid ports as well.

Conclusion:  Somehow when the processor is executing the JSR ITMINT at
EPT+514 for the interval timer, a data word destined for the IRING is
getting stuck in ITMINT instead of the PC word.  However, this only seems
to happen about 3-5 times a month.  Any ideas on how it can be happenning?

Yes, I've come to the same conclusion in the past - this goes back to Sutton.
These are very interesting and puzzeling.  The state seems to lack any
plausible explanation.  Is the data at CH1 base->host data or host->base or
can't you tell (hopefully some of the msg types you've seen are only legal in
one direction).  I haven't ruled out base bug, MIC hardware timing wrong for
new memory, microcode bug, monitor bug, cache bug.  The sequence is unclear
but I want to say something like:
   1. some problem occurs
   2. base gets borred and clobbers key and 30
   3. clock fires
   4. wrong value is storred by JSR *OR* return PC is clobbered
   5. CLKINT notices non-zero 30 and bellies-up
The key is to find the common link between #1 and #4.  Until you can solve
why CH1 is clobbered, you shouldn't assume anything about events prior to
event #4.  Possible experiments:
   1. move location CH1 to a page that has cache disabled
   2. make a copy of CH1 as first thing in service routine
   3. put a logic analizer on the MIC bus and look at write cycles to PDP
      memory with a range check on the memory address to see if base ever
      writes out of bounds
   4. turn off cache for a couple weeks - see if crash stops (gross)
   5. try using a different instruction to call service routine - be careful
      not all instructions are allowed by microcode for interrupt service -
      have to check this out
Questions:
   1. does crash code do a cache sweep and wait?
   2. does this happen on KI?
   3. does it happen only on ARM-10LS memory systems?
   4. how long before crash did SCNSER last run?

This one has my curiosity peaked so please keep me in on the discussion.

Experiments in progress:
  1. C33 when next recycled has JSR XXX instead of JSR ITMINT setup
     which checks PC to see if legal (i.e. bits 13-17 clear)
  2. C39 will be testing newest uCode tonight & if ok, will run for
     awhile to see if any other problems, & if fixes this problem
Answers to q:
  1. Crash code does a cache sweep & waits.
  2.  Seems to only occur on KL, but am still researching this.
-----
  3.  ARM-10LS? I suspect is all we have on the KL's now?
  4.  Haven't checked when SCNSER last ran, but will let you know.

Osman will keep you abreast of the uCode status... we may even consider
running RSX-20F instead of KLDCP... we shall see.

Also of note... we've been under the impression that the base crashes the
host after some time-out... not seeing the base code, no one is sure of
this or not.  Looking at these crashes, IRP620 is always 1 less than IRPPDP
indicating that the base has written the entire IRING in a loop and is ready
to overwrite itself if the 10 doesn't read the ring soon.

Who is the person in NTD "maintaining" the base code?  Where on disk can we
find the sources to look at?  Do you think that we could entice someone to
patch the base to write a repeating pattern in the last 4 bits of data sent
from the base, i.e. 0001 0010 0011 0100 ... 1110 1111 0000 0001 etc.. so we
can use that as a diagnostic aid?

Subject: DR WHO on hiatus

From the San Jose Mercury News, 1-Mar-85

  Any fans of Dr. Who probably should sit down to read this (and take off
those silly hats):
  UPI reports from the Mother Country that the BBC this week announced an
18-month grounding for the TV time traveler (or Time Lord) whose journeys
across the centuries have attracted millions of fellow travelers in Britain
and in the United States.
  The BBC's excuse is that the long-running show, which has gone through Who
knows how many Drs., is getting too expensive to produce.
  But London's TV insiders speculate that the move was designed to provoke a
public outcry.  The BBC wants sympathy for a proposed increase in TV license
fees that, it explains, would allow it to start screening Dr. Who again.
  The folks at San Jose's KTEH say the haitus would take years to have an
effect on the series running here if it had any effect at all.

Now, see IRING+62[ 116224,,14417    ... Hmmmm ...  It appears that the

o  I have not looked at the crash on C33 yet, but will.

o  C34 crashed twice (Sunday 3/3) just with /K-17 patch without TUMS

   "BUG", will experiment running /K-17 under a control environment.
   System now running with /K-15 (SYS)BACKUP. I talked to WRS about
   this and he is very much interested.

Subject: System 3 & PERP

Jon,
  All that I know is that system 3 is one of the PERP master controller
systems.  I don't know what systems it serves and I don't have any idea
what programs on the 940 need to be changed to make some of the other
master systems pick up the load.  We have a program named DEFSYS which I
wrote which maintains a system-profile on the PDP-10s for host numbers
from 1 to 255 (?256) and that we can easily change the system-profile to
re-direct the PDP-10s, but my understanding is that *SOMETHING* needs to
be done on the 940s to make it work.

  We can meet if you like, but this is *ALL* that I know about it.  Dan
Baigent probably knows more about how PERP, 1PERP, etc. work than I do.

 I should be in sometime today, so try to see me after the 1:00 PM monitor

Subject: LINKER & LOADER

Dan Wedge, in ACS Mainframe Products Support, is supporting the move of
TYMQUOTE from FORTRAN 40 to FORTRAN 10.  They are experiencing difficulty
in linking & loading the .REL files.

When using the LINK program (with the command R LINK) they get the
message:  "FOROTS not found."  They are also having difficulty creating
overlays, when using the loader (with the command LOAD .  .  .  ---with
switches to RPG).  Do we have documentation--more complete and accurate
than that in the XEXEC manual--giving the correct switches for FORTRAN
10?

This is a pretty major project, with Dan receiving pressure from his
high management.  A good, quick answer would be desirable.

Thanks!

Subject: LOADER vs LINK [LINKER]

There is NO good, quick answer.  Because of the way FORTRAN-10 is
setup "just" for LOADER it expects to find and load the runtimes
into the .SAV file.  Unfortunately, Tim NEVER spent the time to get
a FOROTS.SHR to work on TYMCOM-X, so since FORTRAN-10 generates code
assuming that we're on TOPS-10, then we run LINK, LINK builds a
low-segment .SAV file expecting to find FOROTS.SHR at execution time.

My suggestion is that they continue to use LOADER until Joe Smith & I
have time to put up a newer LINK and a real FOROTS.SHR for FORTRAN-10.
Both LINK & FOROTS are non-trivial tasks at the moment.  Sorry.

  Yes!  The crashes mentioned above ARE of the type that we've been
discussing.  On 33 & 39 we have one crash each at the PC format check
patch address, and CRA001 on system 56 is indeed another crash with
"base" type data in the PC word.

  On 33 & 39 I've located data in the IRING which matches the bad PC,
however it is not conclusive at this time, since on 33 the data appeared
in dozens of locations, and on 39 it appeared at IRING+161/163? while
both IRP620 & IRPPDP said 14.

  However, it is conclusive that the PC address is being clobberred by
data from somewhere (even if we can't assume that it's the base).

The next crash should be automatically saved and the system should

Subject: CRSHID ver. 45 on systems

All systems have version 45 of CRSHID, except sys. 36 & sys. 930.
Sys. 36 has ver. 42, and sys. 930 has ver. 43.  I believe you told me
you had "transmitted" ver. 45 to all systems except 36, which was down
at the time, which would explain this one discrepancy.

Q.:  shall I transmit ver. 45 to all the systems?  (I believe you had
told me this was what should be done, but I want to confirm this.

Subject: Mortensen having problems really deleting files.

When Bill logs in as HELGEM and says '.DELETE *.TMP' it says 'Files "deleted"'
and does not really delete them.  '.DIR *.TMP' shows strange file names, and
they do NOT go away when he logs out and back in again.  They did go away
when I logged in as JMS, did a GFD to HELGEM, and '.DELETE *.TMP'.

1) What makes DELETE for HELGEM work different from DELETE for JMS?
2) How can HELGEM make "deleted" files go away?

CARL,
CURRENTLY, BILL (HELGE) AND I ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPEMENT
OF PERP OR PCOM.  WHAT WE NEED IS A COMPLETE BRIEFING ON WHERE THE
CURRENT VERSION OF PCOM STANDS AND WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO IN ORDER
TO BECOME A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT FOR PERP.

I HAVE A BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CURRENT 940 VERSION OF PERP
WORKS.  I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE INTERACTIONS OF 1PERP AND 1GPERP, THE
USE OF 1PERPLOG, THE BASIC FORMAT OF THE (DUPJOB)//PPLIST FILE, THE
DATE OPTIONS AVAILABLE IN PERP AND THE VARIOUS PERP FLAGS (SUCH
AS ":TIME N", ":FIND A", ":IF A THEN...", ETC...).  I ASSUME THAT PCOM
NEEDS SOME OF THESE FEATUERS IN ORDER TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS
A PERP REPLACEMEMT.

AS FOR PCOM, I AM ONLY FAMILIAR WITH IT FROM A USER'S STANDPOINT.
IT APPEARS TO ME TO BE SIMILAR TO THE TENEX "BATCON" PROGRAM, PERHAPS
WITH SOME EXTRA CAPABILITIES.  ADMITTADLY, I HAVE HAD LITTLE SUCCESS
INTERPRTING THE SOURCE CODE IN YOUR DERECTORY ON 930, I STILL LACK
EXPERTISE IN SOME OF SAIL'S MORE POWERFUL CONVENTIONS.

WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU IS A BRIEFING/ORIENTATION SESSION TO HELP
FAMILIARIZE US WITH THE CONDITION OF PCOM.  FROM THERE, I BELIEVE WE
WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND, ULTIMATELY, HOW
TO GET THERE.

data file CRSHID.DOC in (MONDOC:930), and a copy of the output of this
portion of the program in the file CRSHID.DOC in (DANIELSR:38).  Both
appear to contain the same info; the one in (DANIELSR:38) formatted for
reading.

I don't know about rhe accuracy of this .DOC file, except it was written
when CRSHID resided in M33 (23 APR 79).  I'll leave a hard copy of the
(DANIELSR:38) version on your desk.

I'll include (DANIELSR:38) CRSHID.DOC, with the references to "R (M33)
CRSHID" changed to "R CRSHID", in the package for archiving, unless you
object.  Then any needed changes to the documentation can be made before

Of course, finding out that documentation exists back to the N series
monitor blows a king-size hole in the "truth" that the name of our
operating system was always prefixed with "P" then the major version
number.  It now becomes:

    <Lmajor><Nmajor>"/"<Lminor><Nminor>"-"<Npatch>

where
    <Lmajor>   is the major version letter (A-Z)
    <Nmajor>   is a 3-digit major version number (000-999)
    <Lminor>   is the minor version letter (A-Z,AA-ZA,AB-ZB..AZ-ZZ)
    <Nminor>   is the "internal" experimental minor version number (00-99)
    <Npatch>   is the release-image patch level number (1-n)

actually, I'd almost relish having a reason to increment the "P" to "Q".

The TTY LC command is the culprit, it does not work like it should.
On TYMCOM-X, "TTY NO LC" converts lowercase input to upper before sending it
to the program (but not when echoing it back to the user) and also converts
tilde ~~ and close brace } to ESC $.  This is for older terminals (such as
Teletype 33 and Tektronix 4006) that have no lowercase, have no ESC key, but
do have an ALTMODE key which sends the ASCII code for tilde.

I would like to change it so that "TTY NO LC" does not affect tilde and brace
but "TTY ALTMODE" does.

I did an "edit", and then a "delete" in TUMS, to the first message I had

Mike has been examining the programs, to make sure that what we are

some minor problems which I can't resolve.  The following is his
documentation of the problems:

LOGOUT:

   A  THE PROGRAM (SYS)LOGOUT.SHR ON SYSTEM 37 AND 57 BOTH GIVE A
DIFFERENT CKSUM ("FIRNIM") THAN THE SAME PROGRAM ON THE REMAINDER
OF THE SYSTEMS.  THE CREATION DATES ARE
   37   27-SEP-1984
   57    9-AUG-1984
   MOST OF THE REST HAVE 16-DEC-1982 AS CREATION DATE AND ALL HAVE
"VIVCOH" AS CKSUM.  ALL PROGRAMS ON THE SYSTEM HAVE 47.1 AS VERSION
NUMBER.  IF 'DIFFERENCE' IS RUN ON THE TWO FILE, THE FOLLOWING 
IS THE OUTPUT: (OCTAL LOCATION, FIRST FILE WORD, SECOND FILE WORD,
AND DIFFERENCE)
 LOC.       1ST    WORD          2ND WORD             DIFF
 400735    255000    000000    254000    400723    001000    400723 
THE FIRST WORD IS A NO-OP(JFCL) GO TO 000.  THE SECOND IS JUMP AND
RESTORE(JRST) AT 400723. SEE FILE (SPPOPER:930) DIF.BCM FOR OUTPUT FILE
OF THE 'DIFFERENCES'

**********
GFD:

   SECOND THING TO RESOLVE:  THE CKSUM FOR (SYS)GFD.SAV IS THE SAME ON
ALL SYSTEMS.  HOWEVER THE FILE (M33:930) GFD.MAC, AFTER BEING LOADED AND
SAVED, YIELDS A DIFFERENT CKSUM.  THIS FILE ON 930 IS THE SAME AS THE
ONE IN THE ARCHIVE FDM FILE...ITS .SAV EXTENSION CKSUM IS "VOFHIP"....
THE REST HAVE "WIPPEZ" AS CKSUM.  THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FILES ARE
AS EXPLAINED ABOVE.
  LOC           FIRST WORD          SECOND WORD          DIFFERENCE
    000133    004056    004777    004056    005777      001000
   THE 004056 IS A LOCAL UUO...NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPPENING.  THE FILE
WHERE THE ORIGINAL COMPARE WAS STORED IS (SPPOPER:930) DF.BCM.


Your expert opinion of the accuracy of what he has found would be VERY

CORE hack... Hmmmm... may be about 20 instructions, but.. aren't we
just messing up the restrictions that were artificailly placed on the
CORE uuo in the first place?

If UPTREL, etc weren't in the UPT and were still JOBREL, etc then we
wouldn't need the uuo in the first place.  Why don't we make the
system keep UPTREL/JOBREL consistant even if the only thing a user does
is write to JOBREL?   (or do we already?)

I don't mean to bad mouth PEAK, or any otehr editor... but wouldn't the
bigest performance improvement be to make it shareable?  .SHR or some
such?  (or have you done that with WARP?)  It has to open the channels and
setup "some" internal structures for the files being editied at run-time
anyway, what is it that is taking so long?  uncrunching the .sav file?

Subject: PERP/PCOM

Carl,

As near as I can tell, the only thing that PERP does that PCOM does'nt
is handle complex date expressions in its job list.  PERP uses a series
of Date Description words comprised of DAY words (description of the
relative day of the month), FLAG words (which indicate befores, afters,
stop dates, next run date, etc.) and/or DATE words (which describe
start and/or end dates, etc.).  The documentation on how these words are
related is vague, but apperently it takes at least one DAY, DATE and FLAG
word to make up a date expression.

I think we would be better off to abandon the current PERP conventions
and come up with a new method for handling date expressions.  What we
will need from you is an overview of how PCOM is currently handling
its job queue and perhaps some suggestions on what is and is not possible
given its current job structure.  For example, could we use a variable
length record for date expressions?

Let me know the next time you will be in with some spare time and
maybe we can get together and lay some groundwork.  In the meantime
I will try to familiarize myself with some of PCOM's internals (although
this could take a while).

Dan

P.S.  The tilde problem is no more...my thanks to you and Joe.

If you think you can use JOBREL in stead of UPTREL, bear in mind that there
were a lot of problems with that because you can't be guarenteed that the
user always has a page 0 and there are places in the monitor where it isn't

The problem is that when we create pages with the paging calls, the old
CORE/segment system (simulated may it be) doesn't know about them and
inevetably trips over them.  The proposed UUO (or change to CORE) would
allow someone to create something that looked like segments using paging
calls and still allow CORE to work.  Its basically the same problem you
had trying to do RUNEXE.  WARP restores a core image COW from a file,
but the first time SAIL needs more memory, it does a CORE uuo.  UPTREL
says there is only 1 K so when SAIL asks for 95 K the monitor tries to
allocate pages 2-109 and fails immediately because 2 already exists from
the .chMFP.  It would do quite nicely to change CORE to ignore the "page
already exists" return from VCREATE (or KCREATE or whatever).  -Bill

Subject: Re: CORE hack

Bill,
  What about making CORE a little more/less intelligent. Have it first
check JOBREL (if page 0 exists) and update UPTREL from that.  Or keep
a separate "real" UPTREL which "knows" the size (if that's necessary).
Anyway, by artificailly updating JOBREL before a CORE UUO, it will only
try to create pages from the JOBREL page to the new amount of core.  And
likewise, if it's artificially set lower than the real value and the CORE
uuo wants to decrease core, it only unmaps pages from the current JOBREL
(if page 0 exists) downward.  For most applications, why wouldn't page 0
exist?  I can only think of extra-ordinary reasons, like RUNEXE, WARP,
etc.

  This should allow the user to manipulate core somewhat with older programs
and still add stuff to it at will... thus making the CORE UUO work in the
manner it used to work (from a programming standpoint). Also, a user could
say, "Oh, I need 3 pages for a buffer" and bump JOBREL 3 pages and forget
about it except JOBFF of course...

  Also, JOBREL and the CORE UUO, I'd like to start using pages, instead of
1K blocks.... unless you know of some reason not to, like LOADER?
/Carl


PS. Since I still intend to implement it, for LINK, FOROTS, etc... how
    would allowing multiple segments, and/or segments that start on
    non-400000 word boundaries fit into what you're doing?  I still
    think that segment addressing is kinda trivial.  400000, page 400
    is only hardcoded in a few places, mostly in SEGCON.

Well, you can't have multiple segments without massive changes.  Anyway,
it seems to me that segments are in the mind of the program (or linker).
I assume that such a program would never do a CORE UUO and would always
do map UUOs and so everything is okay, isn't it?

Your solution to change CORE to only use UPTREL if page 0 doesn't exist
sounds good.  Here is some more further rambling...

    register PG;
    if exists( Page.0 ) then
	UPTREL := user.memory[JOBREL];
    for PG := CORE.UUO.ARG downto 0 do
	case create.page( PG ) of begin
	    [no.error] nothing;
	    [already.exists.error] done;
	    [else] return( error )
	end;
    for PG := CORE.UUO.ARG upto UPTREL do
	case delete.page( PG ) of begin
	    [no.error] nothing;
	    [non.existant] done;
	    [else] return( error )
	end;
    UPTREL := CORE.UUO.ARG;
    if exists( Page.0 ) then
	user.memory[JOBREL] := CORE.UUO.ARG;

You can imagine similar logic for the high segment (if any).

I feel obliged to point out that the CORE UUO logic is there mostly to
make old style programs work.  Changing it is very risky!  A new UUO to
set UPTREL/HRL (use the FRMOP to read/set frame attributes) would only
be used by "special" programs like WARP and RUNEXE and are guarenteed
to not break any old programs.  However, for my purposes, all you need
do is change CORE to IGNORE the "page already exists" return and leave
everything else the same.  Thats pretty safe.  Anything more elaborate
might be "beating a dead UUO".  -Bill

I wouldn't assume that any program WON'T do CORE UUOs rather than MAPs.
It's all in the code of the beholder (sic) programmer.

Having the read/write/change attributes FRMOP change UPTREL and company
does sound pretty good, since we allow changing of JOBREL et al in normal
user programs.  Anyway,  a change to your algorithm:

    register PG;
    if exists( Page.0 ) then
        UPTREL := user.memory[JOBREL];
    for PG := CORE.UUO.ARG downto UPTREL do
        case create.page( PG ) of begin
            [no.error] nothing;
               ...
        end;
    .... continues as same. ...

the big differnce being, only create.page( PG ) from current new page
down to old UPTREL (sic) user.memory[JOBREL]

or only delete pages from current new page+1 up to old UPTREL/JOBREL
thus allowing the "knowing" user to leave holes or to leave pages as
he wishes.

This may invalidate some older programs but I doubt it. I think that
only LOADER/LINK do anything to JOBREL, and I suspect they do it via
CORE UUOs anyway.

Subject: non page-400 segments

We can easily go to non page-400 segments by changing all the SEGCON
references to look at JBTSEG(J) or some such table.  Since it now clears
the entire highseg area before a GETSEG/RUNSEG it would be reasonable to
simply check the right JOBHxx location to get the start page number and
only clear out the pages needed by this segment before loading.

This would also permit multiple segments, but would lose the segment
addresses each time another segment was called... unless we remember
the lowest segment address and keep a maximum length...

JBTSEG(J)/ 0-8  all.segment.page.length  9-17 all.segment.page.start
      18-26 current.segment.page.length 27-35 current.segment.page.start

A segment manager, or segment list per job might be interesting, but I'd
really rather NOT increase the JBT tables by the number of segments unless
we decide that that is the easiest way to permit multiple segments.

Right now, the user only gets a few error conditions back, but adding
the error condition for PAGE.NUMBER,,PAGE.ALREADY.EXISTS right from the
mapping calls might be reasonable, then the user can check the page(s)
and try again.

Subject: Base type 7 (KL), ILLINS (KI)

I don't know how much you were told before you left for Maynard, but
it has been determined exactly as we thought, that the base type 7
crashes and the illins+2 crashes are caused by the same series of events.

In both crash types, the frame pointed to in c<JOB> has "just" received a
LOGIN request message from the base.  In each case c<IRPPDP> points just
past the LOGIN message in the IRING for the port assigned to frame c<JOB>.

The reason reason we're seeing the bad-PC is because the CURUPT and the
UPT page are being set to 0, then some memory reference fails, it takes
the page-fail vector [location 501] using the current UPT page 0, i.e.
it fetches the PC word from physical location 501, which just happens to
be IRING+161, thus EUREKA! the PC looks like a base word.  I've checked
and the only cases where this is not apparently true is where the base
has already overwritten location 500/501 with new data.

Anyway, in most cases, this new PC attempts to do something, and most of
the cases I've researched, the PC is in another section, and either ERASTS
or SAVERA has reflected similar information.

I'm still looking, but I have NOT YET found where anything happens with
the new frame, thus causing all of this stuff.  On the KI, if you remember
I followed it all the way to job termination.  On the KL, I've followed
it through to where the scheduler gets involved, but have not seen where
the particular frame is setup...

(m33:930)TIMOUT.LOG is a "pretty'd up" log of some of the stuff I've been
looking at.  You and Joe can look over some of it and let me know when I
come in today, what else we can look for.  Finding the right place in the
sources may sound easier, but if we can't trace it to pinpoint it to the
same place in the source by the register and memory contents, we are still
guessing.

  I didn't know if you got filled in on this or not, re: above message.
The login messge is "always" for the port @ TTYTAB+C<JOB> and there is
"always" a forced ".LOGIN" command set for the port.  An LDB is setup
belonging to frame C<JOB> and I've traced it back through the last SCNSER
INPUT/OUTPUT sweep @ clock level, back to NXTJOB in SCHED1... but not any
further as yet.
  So the forced command is setup, but not yet "processed" and cleared by
COMCON, although, I looked at CMDFLG+<0 thru n> and no command is waiting
for the specified port, meaning <??? do you know ???>, i'd guess that it
means COMCON has gotten to it, but not completed it... thereby turning off
the bits on the port.

I disagree - the behavoir or CORE should be "give me a low segment
of this size..." - this forbids any holes.  If you want holes, don't
use CORE.  This isn't to say that holes that already exist shouldn't
be preserved by CORE if they are discontiguous with the region being
allocated or deallocated.  Sigh - what does it matter anyway?  The
more we talk about it, the more I'm convinced CORE shouldn't change.
Of course if all you do is ignore a particular error return without

Subject: validations on hosts

There's 2 or three ways to do this....

1) Normal PDP-10, Tymshare host:
   Simply login to 930, set license and run (MPL)MOVUSR
   ...do what it says... it will try to validate you.
   This doesn't add you to the accounting data base.  ** see below **

2) Other hosts, friendly (Tymshare):
   Build a circuit as OPER:host, set your license, OPER or SETE
   and run LVALID to validate yourself...

3) Fill out forms, get Craig to sign it, send it to validations and
   wait awhile, maybe call them and prod them along...  ** Necessary
   for new accounts **

================
Accounting:  System 74, username CUD10 keeps a series of 1022 format
files and has a few fortran/1022 procedures to maintain them.  Get me to
do this for now, until you understand the file formats.  (** Really, we
shouldn't be mucking with their stuff,  so it's better that I do it, so
I'll catch all the flack if there is any. **)

Subject: Base type 7, aka KAF

More discourse on our base type 7 (KL), illins+2 (KI) crashes,
also known as (aka) KAF or the 10-year bug [at DEC].

I think our KAF is "not" the same as DEC's bug, although I have made
no real conclusions.  Tracing the code, I've found more info, but not
the cause or the cure....

  Darren's new code in COMCON et al is straightforward & careful.  If
  the problem is "newly created" there, I'd doubt it.  Frame creation
  from the forced-login follows along just fine, including context-page
  generation, rescheduling again ... until LOGINN is in core & running.
  [The code, that is... not the frame in our crashes... that's our mystery]

  Somehow, we have a frame, with no context pages, a command pending,
  jbtnam/"LOGINN"  DDB & LDB assigned ok, jbtsts/JNA only, presumably
  in the RUNQ, [STOPQ=32, and jbtq(j)/-34,,-34  or -33,,-33 in most
  cases] and jbtctx/0 jbtupm/0.

  My suspicions are that in killing a previous frame, something didn't go
  completely away yet, due to rescheduling, or something... and that we
  should try to fix it as the previous frame is going away.

Subject: "CPU" program requires PERF. uuo

To get the cache hit ratio, the program issues a PERF. uuo (CALLI 162)
to enable the performance meters in the KL hardware.  The monitor translates
this to do a WRPAE instruction (BLKO TIM,=702100,,0) which tells the
KL to count the number of cache misses.  This number is divided by the
MBOX count to get the cache miss ratio.

I believe that this feature needs a change to the Monitor sources, and
is too complex to be done as a DDT patch.

What is it?  (drum roll in the background)
  When is it available?  (suspense)
     Transmittal?  prior to 4-DEC-75 !!!

Try running it!
  R MONINF<cr>
  #: try ?, help, subjects, etc...

Someone actually tried to do something decent about documentation,
[decent for 1975 anyway, not bad considering DEC's VAX "HELP"]
Anyway, it appears to have gotten "lost" in the woodwork of the times
(sic) tym's and quite possibly was never used......

Do you (Bill) know anything about it?
  (or you Adele? ever hear anything about it?  programmer was GERE
   and I have restored the sources... quite extensive... )
  (of course, written in MACRO and SIMPL .... )

Subject: (XEXEC)MEXEC.MAC

I was noticing (XEXEC:36)TIIXEC.MAC or some such, and I remembered that
you cleaned out (XEXEC:930) so I looked for MEXEC.MAC ... sigh!

Where this is leading is:  On 930, and I believe on 39 and a couple of
other places, (???) I had updated your MEXEC.SAV with the "nice" little
feature of reading your TMP:RPG / nnnRPG.TMP / RPG.INI file to use your
RPG DOlist instead of the hardcoded list of ppns you had in MEXEC.  If,
of course it couldn't find any of the above, it was supposed to create
itthe TMP file, or at worst use a default (your original hardcoded list).

The idea here was to avoid having EVERYONE having to have a separate MEXEC
for each list they wanted to use.

Well, I think you may have deleted the source from XEXEC:930 ??? not
sure, but I'll see, by having the co-op restore whatever he can find.

Where I was going with all this is to ask you if you ever told ANYONE
at all about it, or does everyone have their own MEXEC/TIIXEC/??? ?

Tried running MONINF.  Tried the SUBJECTS command; no data base found by
program.  Do we have just the program, without data in it?  It appears
to have a lot of potential, but could use a couple of YEARS of data
input to be made effective.

Thanks for the intro to the program.

You never told me about it.  You did say you were working on it, but I assumed
it was another one of THOSE projects.  Anyway, one of the important things
about MEXEC is it must be <= 1K including job data area and almost never do
any disk IO.  Is that true?  Sorry if I deleted the sources, the official
sources for XEXEC are on 39 and there were a bunch of old files on 930 that
went back to the old XEXEC project (R.I.P.) that I deleted to get you more
disk space.  I probably deleted MEXEC.MAC as well not knowing it was any
different from the one on 39.  I hope you can find it -- it sounds nice.  -Bill

The lists we went over are unclear---particularly re. the association of
programs into a new "package".  Eg., I couldn't tell from the list you
gave me that KMCLOD was appropriate for the 'new' package.  Otherwise, I
suspect that the list of 4 programs in the 'SUBJECT' line of your
message is definitive of the new proposed package.  I'd appreciate your
perusal of the current list to give me any other suggested candidates
for the new package.  'Current list' is in (DENCOFF:930)PKGING.SET.

Subject: Access-1

No No No No No!

My comment is this: NO!  We do not transmit anything to all "but" x & y.
  If a product is to be put on all systems of a particular type, then
  it goes on all of them.  Systems 37 & 57 are NOT to be exceptions.
  (If LOGOUT is patched on those systems, it probably shouldn't be.)
  (If those are both TYMNET/NTD systems which WRS has authority over,
   then there is the question about the integrity of those patched
   files, and should be thus noted... but I believe that the transmittal
   should specify all systems.)

Transmittals are to all systems... deployment is another matter... Ok?
/Carl


Comment 2:  Small oversight, since the program isn't on (SYS)... there
   is another product which should be included... it is (UPL)ACCESS.
   Since GFD is dependent upon the format that ACCESS creates they both
   should be kept together as a pair...  also, the ACCESS program should
   be moved to SYS, for the same reason.
/Carl

So, I'd prefer another go-'round on this transmittal before submission.

The ILL INST ... bug is going to be very hard to find.  I believe its
some bad code in the APPEND() library function.  It happens sometimes
if somebody else has your mail box open in UPDATE mode (i.e. APPEND).
If you just try it again, it usually works - no need to run RDMAIL in
between.  You'll usually get multiple copies of some messages because
I think the other accesser gets clobbered, too.

I asked Carl for the current sources to APPEND() so I could track doen
this and another problem (APPEND updates the creation date).  I guess
he's forgotten or whatever, maybe you could get together with him and
get a copy for me.  Thanks -Bill

Is there any reason you know of why systems 37, 54, 56 and 65 have

  NO... there should be NO reason why LOADER is different on the systems

when they brought up systems 65,37,56 that they simply copied (SYS) from

Dallas computer center.]

Subject: C39 P034/N08 (N09)?

Bill,
  We did some testing on C26 yesterday and conclusively found out that it
is both possible to move the IRING out of page 0 and change it's size.  We
ran 3 test monitors:
  1) to test whether the system would come up with code to check for missing
     context page base address & stopcd ...
  2) moving the IRING from location 320-517 to 4020-4217
  3) changing the size of IRING (SIZIRG) so we went from 4020-4417 (400 words)

Well,  everything worked fine.  The system came up on the network and ran
fine in all three cases.  So, as a result, we are going to put up a similar
monitor on C39 with the IRING moved to page 4, and some "special" trap
vectors setup in page 0 to trap our UBR=0 bug.  [We hope the stopcd @ CIP7+3
will catch it, but just in case...]  IRING & ORING will retain their original
size for now, but I want to talk to you about C39 performance and changing
the size of the rings...  remember we talked about this once before but I
thought we thought the location/size was hardcoded in the base...

Subject: Deleted files

We are **LOW** on disk space, due to whatever reasons... and the LOGINN
message says to move things which don't need to be done on 930 elsewhere,
BUT ** PLEASE ** don't delete files in directories which are not your own.
This means any system directory, or library directory.  If you created the
files there, it's ok to delete them, but if you didn't... please don't.

I've had to request files in SYS, UN1, XEXEC be restored 'cause someone
thought they could delete them... and other problems have occurred due to
OLD versions of files being restored over top of newer versions....

I will take care of LIBRARY directories on 930... please police your own
directories ONLY.  Thank you.

PS: As yet, no one has even owned up to deleting the UN1 files... this is
    why I'm being so vehement & sending such a long message about such a
    minor problem...

Subject: Micronode/Base Info

Dennis,
  On the micronode, it seems that when it crashes, it will re-synch with
the KMC-11/KS-10 code currently running... However, it does not do that
for the F3.  I want to know what you know about the interaction that goes
on between the base and host.
  On initial synch, the host does this things with sending 0's and waiting
for an acknoledgement of some kind [F3].... (I suspect the KMC is similar)
  When the micronode crashes and starts up again, i suspect that it no
longer has the correct IRING/ORING information... however, it should be
able to read the proper locations (150-165 for KI/KL/KS, 2000-2015? for the
poor F3) to find out what IRP620/IRPPDP,ORP620/ORPPDP should be... now,
it seems there is a "the base crash & has reloaded msg" that the KS/KMC
does something with... is this correct?
My question is, do you send a similar message to the F3?  Can you?
If I got such a message, then ran through the resynch code (all that sending
of zeros, etc.) (possibly even resetting IRP620 & ORP620 to 0) would that
"should that" work to resynch on the F3?  Or is there some F3 microcode
problem that you know of?

Okay.  I think F3 uCode is the one who "knows" IRING/ORING locations.  I
also think there may be some backpressure side effects from expanding the
input ring.  Need to do some high bandwidth throughput tests to see if
any characters get lost on input.  -Bill

   But system crashed @3/31 1330 with "Input Ring Process Time-Out" crash,
   just like the others. I asked Operations to bring the system with its
   old /K-13 monitor.Ohhh wellll....

o  On system C930 (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV is P034/N08 and the rest is moved around.

Yeah, I know about the black file cabinet...I already looked there.  It
has the transmittal for versions 37.3, 37.4, 37.6 and 40.0 but not for
37.5 (version 40.0 was appearently never transmitted, there was a note on
it that said it was "superceded" by version 37.6).  I was going to try
to obtain a copy of 37.5's transmittal to see if there was any explaination
for the Dallas systems, but I will take your word for it and just distribute
version 37.6.

Some questions have come up:

1.)  LOADER is in the COMMANDS package.  Should LINKER be in there?

2.)  You said that PJCVFY is a hack that should not be transmitted.
What about SCREAM, SCAN and SY?

3.)  You mentioned some programs for which other groups in the company
are responsible; specifically NODLOD & (SRAUTIL)FTICP.  Do you believe
we should be at all involved in the packaging/transmittal of this
software?

4.)  I may be coming to you with questions about whether certain program
should be on certain systems.  the specific areas of my knowledge lacks
are the 2020's, the F3's, and non-network, dedicated versions of these
systems.

If I'm a pest with my ignorance (especially re. Q. 4), please let me
know where I can find the info--in fact, if there is any info. available
anywhere, let me know where I can get it.  I hate not having the info.

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 1 Apr 85 16:42:00 PST

1) LOADER vs LINKER,LINK
   LINKER is a HACK, and as such should not be relied upon.
   LINK is supportable, but has deficiencies concerning F40 and our
        customers use of FORTRAN-10.
   LOADER should be used as is, and LINKER only where it works.

2) PJCVFY, SCREAM, SCAN, SY.
   I believe that SCREAM & SCAN have been tranmitted before but I'm
   not sure.  SY is on SPL and is currently not transmitted.
   PJCVFY is on WRS and is "NOT" to be transmitted.

3) What to do about things that we don't maintain is q good question...
   and probably needs a policy decision by our manager.  My suggestion
   is to take each item case by case, but we should be involved in the
   transmittal process of anything that goes on SYS... so maybe the
   non-supported (by us) stuff should go through us as well as software
   distribution?  ???  Needs discussion with management & Lee Corbin.

4) Programs which go where... 2020's F3's etc..  Unless specifically
   stated, all programs should go on all processor types.  Feel free to
   verify them with me, but please don't ask me to tell you which ones
   belong on a specific processor... at least not more than once...
   These are not written down in total, anywhere, and the time required
   to hunt down the files for a specific list for any processor is mostly
   wasted for me to do it, rather than you or Mike.  I'll be happy to
   verify any list... but prefer not to be expected to generate it.

Subject: Bases on KI's & KL's

Bill,
  Do you know what happens on a varian base when it dies and gets
reloaded... if the host is up when the base crashes, then when the
base is reloaded or re-started the host simply re-connects... my
question is how?  There are no messages, other than "base has crashed"
which is simply ignored on everything except for the KS-10.  I'd
guess that it simply continues where it left off using the "current"
values of IRP620 and ORP620 that it reads from memory...  The 10,
however has a bunch of circuits which need to be zapped.. and I'd like
to know if you know when that happens (as in I haven't located the
code which checks).
  I'd like to have this condition "discovered" by the running processor
so that it can print a warning on the CTY (all CPUs) and so that it can
perform the "re-synch" routine on the F3s so we can stop reloading each
time the micronode crashes.

  On the F3, it does something special, and has to reset the F3 microcode
which is simulating a KMC-11 (I'm told by dennis), so that it will resynch
with the micro-node...  well, obviously, I need to know WHEN we've lost
the base so that I can know WHEN to try to resynch!

Subject: LOADER VERSIONS...

Carl,
Is there any reason you know of why systems 37, 54, 56 and 65 have
different versions of the (SYS)LOADER.SAV program?  These systems
are running version 37.5 while the rest are running version 37.6.
There is no indication on the transmittal for version 37.6 as to
why LOADER should be different on any system (I am still trying to
locate the transmittal for version 37.5).
Thanks...Dan

Dan,
  As I said before... the probable reason that 37, 54, 56 & 65 don't have
the newest version is because they are all in Dallas and Dallas OPS has the
tendency to copy files around when one goes bad, and the probability that
54 had the wrong version and when 56, 65 and 37 were brought up they simply
copied the entire SYS directory from system 54.

  If you can't find the transmittal for 37.5, and 37.6 exists, it is quite
possible that 37.5 was NEVER transmitted.  The version number of the program
has little to do with transmittal releases.  (eg.  PCOM 1.52 was the last
transmittal for PCOM, yet..on 930 and 39 we are running PCOM 1.63 in field-
test mode.  It hasn't been transmitted, because it depends on the /L or /N
monitor which has NEVER officially been running on all systems!)

  My advise, is simply to put version 37.6 everywhere.
