To build a K monitor for your favorite system:

1.  GFD to OSB
2.  Check to see if a mon##.cmd exists--if so proceed with step 4
3.  Edit mon##.m33 with your favorite screen editor.  Delete
    (M33), and write out resulting file as mon##.cmd. Keep the
    mon##.m33 around.
4.  Make any appropriate changed to conf##.mac.  Be sure to make the same
    changes to (m33)conf##.mac.
5.  run monedk.  It will look for mon##.cmd on the directory
    from which it is run--and mon##.cmd on osb will look for the conf##.mac
    on osb also, so everything should work fine.
6.  Follow the normal procedures for telecopying, checksumming,
    patching, notification, etc.
