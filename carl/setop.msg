SETOP - time to get back on this - As soon as  you have any progress
or run into questios, problems, etc, lets meet, but in any case
before TURKEY DAY..........
Also, the ACCESS# case - some how the security feature that disconnects
one (goes back to pli) when escape or other attemps to get out to the
EXEC/MONITOR MODE got dropped in a recent move of this system to another
host. Bill says you are able to take steps to preclude happening
again (also applies to INFORMATION and probably other cases)

Wayne,
  SETOP is essentially finished... I have a few things to sprinkle in for
the audit trail data and then final testing before release to Vida's group.
Documentation is still forthcoming.

  While you were away, I was called to jury duty for a week and took a week
of needed vacation.  I am about 1 week away from a finished product unless
so major catastrophy takes up my time.

  I'll keep in touch.

Subject: SETOP documentation 

Wayne,
  Documenting has been slow...  I have a very preliminary, but summarily
complete document that provides user and internal information about SETOP.
I also have (atthe moment, un-integrated) a separate text that gives a few
examples of most of the commands.

  I'd like to give the document to you or to Barbara Victorino today (June 1,
1988) so that it can be reviewed.  I'll also provide an alpha-test version
of SETOP for the validations group to use to become familiar with the new
command format and to report any problems.

  Based on their comments, a beta-test version (of both the document and
the program will be made available, one week after I receive a full report
of their comments).

  Please send me TUMS mail indicating a time I can drop the document by your
office.  (We don't need a meeting, until you've had time to review it all).
I expect to be in the office after noon.

/Carl

Minutes of Setops meeting on 10-26-88.

Those attending were:
Carl Baltrunas
Wayne Bartlett
Cynthia Hoeke
Vida Stafford

Rick Daniels will input Setops names for the data centers. He will continue
the updates as they are received with notification copied to Validations.
Carl is to give Validations a list of the setops names from Rick Daniels.

Action items:

Effective immediately, Cynthia will update the 'new' setops program on 29
as well as the current program on system 34, with any setops requests she
receives and approves.

Once Carl has written the commands that will merge the existing setops
database with the new database information on system 29, a date will be
set to perform the merge.

Validations has an exec that requests all the information that has been
written in the 'new' setops program. An ontyme will go out in the very
near future advising all with setops names of the new requirements and of
the exec to be used to forward the needed information to Validations.
                                                                Page  2


This ontyme will notify all with setops names that as of January 1, 1989
all those who have not provided the information we require will be barred
from using their setop name to set license.

Cynthia Hoeke is testing the exec for any 'bugs'. A copy of the exec will
be sent to Carl and Wayne as FYI and for any comments. If you have any

comments that will require any changes to the exec, please give them to
Cynthia as soon as possible as we need to get the exec online.

Subject: SETOP roll over 

Wayne & Vida & Cynthia,

As I said I would, I have rolled the opername data base into the new system.

However, there is still some amount of testing, and a small matter of making
sure that the license kept on the system password file is not lost.

I also have made all of the programming changes as per our conversation on
Thursday.  As per that meeting, I have noot been felling as well as I would
like and have not done what I consider sufficient testing of the new features
added in the last week.

I will call you (Cynthia) sometime this afternoon to discuss having you do
some "stress-testing" to make sure nothing will break when we make this live
for all users on the system.

PS. Since I am developing on system 33, that is where the current TEST system
resides.  I will move it to 74 today, so I may fix anything that you find
without breaking anything else.

PPS.  Wayne, I would prefer that Cynthia do some amount of double-entering
      using one of these test systems.  I will coordinate with her when and
      where she can start.

PPPS.  Wayne, I do not have the correct ONTYME address for either Cynthia or
       Vida.  COuld you please put a copy of this memo on their desks.

Thanks a lot.

     I must countermand Jan Krivanec's 1/27/89 memo.  I am sorry about
     the confusion.

     I have been working for some time to upgrade the security features
     of SETOP.  It is finally now being implemented.  Although we have
     tried to make the upgrade as transparent as possible, part of that
     plan is to have all of Network Systems under Network Systems
     control.  Therefore, TYMNET Validations will manage SETOP functions
     for Network Systems.  You all still have your own manager functions,
     as before, but now with more flexibility.  The only added control is
     at the time a new user name is added.  That function will go through
     an audit by TYMNET Validations to insure proper information is in
     the database (of course, we are working the current "cutover
     problem" of getting all existing names and owners in the database).

     Specifically, the following (and others) are to be under MDNSC:

      GARY WALKER'S Division ---------- Gary Walker
      ACS Division ------------------- Robert Klute
      FINANCE Division ---------------- Debbie Mullin

Subject: SETOP :: OPPS 

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.

SUBJECT:    SETOP CLARIFICATION
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Wayne, I am now confused as to how to proceed with SETOP administration
functions from your memo M18473.  I am not sure you can speak for all NSC
and NAS divisions requiring them to use Tymnet Validations for SETOP
administration functions.  Also, this is not what we agreed to in our
meeting of 12 January 1989.  At the meeting, you and I agreed RPM would
contact their existing supported SETOP groups to ask their preference of
using Tymnet Validations or RPM.  All groups contacted choose to stay with
RPM because of established contacts and the short life remaining on the
PDP10s.  Also we know both validations groups can effectively administer
SETOP.
 
Frankly more time has been spent on this issue than necessary and we all
have more important core responsibilities and key projects to deal with.
As long as the various division contacts agree or a policy is stated by Al
Fenn, I will not mind who administers the SETOP function.  RPM is a
service provider trying to satisfy our customer needs.  You have caught us
in the middle of this situation.
 
To resolve this, RPM will once again contact the division contacts to see
if your memo has persuaded them to change.  If the division contacts agree
to use Tymnet Validations or I receive some type of communication from NSC
upper management that this is stated policy, the issue is resolved.
Otherwise I will have to delay implementation of the enhanced SETOP
security features until you and I reach an agreement.
 
Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.
 
 
Sincerely,

Subject: SETOP cutover and changes 

This is to inform you that the newest release of SETOP has been installed
on system D34. The changes include:

 o  Opernames with no employee number are written to the password file
    as before, except their license field is 0.  If they try to set their
    license they receive the message "Did not set OP".  In effect they
    are disabled until their ISG/Employee numbers are entered.

 o  The DATES and NODATES commands have been added.  These commands control
    the printing of the password change date information as in the old
    version of SETOP.

 o  SM capability has a new meaning.  SM (Setop Manager) allows the user
    to create and delete oper names and otherwise manage the entire tree.

 o  BM capability (Branch Manager) allows the user to create and delete
    oper names and otherwise manage the current branch including all of
    its sub-branches and leaves.

 o  The IMITATE command now requires SU (Setop Utility) capability in
    order to properly record the "on behalf of" license grant.

 o  SU capability has been removed from all oper names other than ROOT
    and that of the SETOP maintainers.  Albeit this will make it slightly
    more difficult to grant license on behalf of a manager, it is felt
    that anyone that needs to grant license, understand how to do it and
    manage that responsibility themselves.  VALIDATIONS WILL NOT grant
    the actual license to the individual oper names, and therefore does
    NOT need the ability to grant license "on behalf" of another user.

Carl,
  User SWEDEL tries to set license, and the monitor said it set license,
but MDDT shows nothing...  It is job 50 on F33.  Is  OPER strange?

We are sending the following memo to you as managers in the license tree.
Please ensure that all users under your management comply.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-
mation on employees who have status names.

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

Subject: Re: Setting LICENSE of F33 

Um.. my fault actually, F33 is my test host for the new SETOP program and
I turned the switch to only write validated OPERnames to the password file.

My fault, because the database I was using was a 2-week old base that didn't
have any (read *ANY*) users validated properly with their ISC employee numbers
so, although everything was written correctly on D34, when I exited my test
copy on F33, it clobbered the real file with stale data.

You had an opername that had 0 license.  Since you said O... without asking
for explicit licenses, it said, oh.. you want, let me see.. nothing, OK! and
set nothing(!) so it didn't complain, 'cuz your password and all was alright.

The other problem is that it would fix itself when the password-file daemon
runs, but that happens to be every 150 minutes (read 2.5 hours).  I got a
call from operations and I fixed it!

FYI... the newest latest greatest version is this hour now running on D34.
       It is a little kinder about some things, and now enforced the TYMNET
       password standard of nothing trite, nothing short, nothing without
       an embedded non-alpha, etc...                  (up 2, "d" should be "s")

Subject: license? 

Carl,
  Ron and I were playing with SETOP and had a few questions that don't seem
to have obvious answers.
  What is BM capability?  Is it anything like SM?
  How does someone get LG capability?  People like Ed Mooring (license name
ETM) have traditionally run much of the oper stuff for us and QA, but he
doesn't have LG.  Does he even need it to continue to manage existing names
and their licenses?
