Subject: Mac II Wish List

I'm new to this list, and have never used a micro, but my Mac II will be 
arriving soon.  I sure could use some help in picking out the software, and 
other list members might appreciate seeing such a wish-list discussion.

I'll have a 256-color Mac II with 2Mb RAM and a 40Mb internal disk, to be used 
mainly for bibliographies and stacks, pattern-recognition research, report 
writing, and home/education/entertainment functions. I will be doing some 
coding in C and HyperTalk (and possibly CommonLisp), and am interested in 
learning to write Mac-style graphical interfaces for whatever applications I 
develop.  I'll have an ImageWriter II and plan to get a laser printer someday. 
(Incidentally, what surge protector or other hardware support do I need?)

Here's what I've come up with so far.  Can anyone help me fill in the blanks, 
or warn me of problems I'm heading for?  In particular, am I planning to buy 
any software that's not compatible with the II? Are there programs I really 
should have that I haven't mentioned? And what public-domain software or 
shareware should I investigate? (I have no idea what info-mac files I should 
FTP, for instance.) Also, are there any mail-order companies I need to watch 
out for?

I will have remote access to a VAX that will handle my net mail and other batch
services.  (I will also have a DOS PC at my NSF office linked to the VAX.)  
What I need for my home computer is a terminal emulation program and some way 
to transfer files.  (I don't really care what terminal I emulate, I just want 
to access files and send mail.)  I'm told that Red Ryder 10.3 ($62, M.A.C.; $49
at MacWAREHOUSE for 10.0) is the best communications program around.  Should I 
also be looking at any of the following: InTalk 3.0 ($99, Programs Plus), 
MacTerminal ($99, Programs Plus), Microphone II with Glue ($209, Programs Plus;
$115 for V1.1, Tussey), Smartcom II 3.0A ($88 ?), or TOPS for the Mac 2.0 
($118, M.A.C.)?

I've already ordered the Claris MacPaint 2.0 and MacDraw programs.  They came 
at a discount, and MacDraw can be upgraded to MacDraw II for $100 through 
September.  I'm expecting that a color MacPaint II will come out soon with a 
similar upgrade offer.  Egghead is offering PixelPaint at just $220, but I'll 
risk the wait.  Likewise with Canvas 1.0 with DA ($109), Cricket Draw 1.1 
($159), and all the other great graphics programs. I briefly considered Cricket
Graph 1.2 ($112, Warehouse Mac Products), but will probably get graphing 
functions as part of Trapeze 2.0 ($160, Tussey) or in a statistical package.  
Anyway, I'm not sure which of these non-Claris programs work well with my 
ImageWriter II and I'm not really into art, CAD/CAM, or desktop publishing.

I'm ordering WordPerfect ($189) because I'll also be using it at my new office 
on a DOS PC.  Do I also need Expressionist 1.11 ($42, M.A.C.) for equations, 
and is it II-compatible yet?  How does it compare to MacEQN ($38, M.A.C.)?  Do 
I also need an editor like QUED ($60, M.A.C.) or microemacs to work on source 
code without embedding formatting characters?

I plan to get Spellswell 2.0 ($39, M.A.C.) , but will count on fiber media for 
single-word lookup.  I've heard there's a Document Compare program, but haven't
found a source; is it public-domain?

M.A.C. is offering PageMaker 2.0a for only $309, with a $15 upgrade to 3.0. Is 
there any reason I should prefer ReadySetGo! 4.0 for $279 ($249, Beverly 
Hills?)?  Am I getting into PostScript/QuickDraw problems here? And what chance
is there that I can ship formatted output to a DOS-oriented (or VAX-oriented) 
laser printer at my office?

I would like to be able to generate nice slide presentations, either as 
overheads or by phoning files to a 35mm slide printer.  I'd like to have 
PowerPoint 1.0 ($239, MacConnection), although perhaps MORE 1.1c ($149, 
MacWAREHOUSE) would be equally useful.  I'm sure MORE is II-compatible, but I 
don't know about PowerPoint.  Perhaps I'll stick with HyperCard or my paint 
program to make slides -- or should I be looking at a formatted-spreadsheet 
program such as Trapeze 2.0?

I also want to compile bibliographies and dictionary-style paragraph lists. For
annotated bibliographies, how does the newly announced Publish or Perish 
compare with Professional Bibliographic System ($209, The MacZone)? Should I 
stick with my text editor and TEXtures 1.0 ($279, Programs Plus) with LaTeX 
($33, M.A.C.)?  Or will I be better off using page layout tools, especially if 
I want to write a book with a few illustrations?

HyperCard comes with the Mac.  Will I want Hyper DA ($38) despite my 2Mb 
MultiFinder system, and is it II-compatible?  I'll probably get Reports ($62, 
Programs Plus) if it's II-compatible.  Does HyperCard itself allow me to print 
stack text sorted on various fields, without having to print card images?  
HyperBook Maker ($30, Programs Pluse) looks nice, but I don't really need the 
graphics (yet).

Is Focal Point ($58, M.A.C.) II-compatible, and is it really more useful than 
vanilla HyperCard?  Are there some other object-oriented or full-text database 
systems I should be looking into?  Can one store and access things like recipes
in FileMaker Plus 2.0 ($149)?

Since my profession is digital image processing, sooner or later I'm going to 
want to store and manipulate scanned images.  I intend to get ThunderScan 4.0 
($172 + $42 for the Mac II, MacWAREHOUSE) and maybe Read-It!TS ($79).  I will 
have to write my own code to do content manipulation, but what image database 
system should I buy?  I've heard of ImageStudio ($279), but have no idea what 
it does.  Curator ($79) and Picture Base 1.2 ($58, MacConnection) sound good, 
but is either II-compatible?

I presume that I should get SmartScrap and The Clipper ($35, MacConnection), as
well as SuperGlue ($52).  Is Glue 1.04 ($39, The MacZone; Free with Microphone)
just a subset of SuperGlue?

I'm still thinking about VideoWorks II 2.0 ($117, The MacZone), mainly as a toy
for my kids, but I'm not sure whether it's too difficult to use or even whether
it's II-compatible.  I hear there's a new product integrating VideoWorks with 
HyperCard; I'll have to look into it.

Speaking of kids, I'd love to get them some music-appreciation programs. I've 
heard that Music Mouse ($46, M.A.C.) won't run on the Mac II (or at least that 
its "MIDI addresses are incompatible").  Studio Session 1.4 ($49, 
MacConnection) is likewise incompatible.  How about the following: Listen 2.0 
($57, M.A.C.); Deluxe Music Construction Set 2.0 ($61); and Practica Musica 
($77, MacWAREHOUSE)?

I haven't identified much other good software in the educational category.  
Business Simulator ($48, MacWAREHOUSE) sounds like a good idea, but too 
advanced for my kids at present.  Chipwits would be good, but I haven't found a
source and I doubt that it will run on my machine.  Is Puppy Love ($19, 
MacConnection) the same sort of thing as Chipwits, or do you need a live puppy?
 What is Mac Robots ($27, MacConnection)?

I'll have to investigate public-domain educational software since I can't stand
to risk $30 or so for programs that my kids may outgrow in half an hour.  Can 
anyone recommend a good source?  Is anyone publishing BASIC programs on 800K 
disks or making code available via modem?  Is there a II-on-a-Mac emulator or a
software DOS emulator available for the Mac II?  Is there a good stackware 
source I should investigate?

Are any foreign-language tutorials available on the Mac II?  I'm especially 
interested in Japanese and Chinese, although I'm not far enough along to need 
Apple's Kanji development environment.  I would also be interested in other 
kinds of tutorials for my kids.

Dinner at Eight sounds like something I'd be interested in (especially if I 
could modify the database -- it's CP), but I haven't figured out the difference
between the Silver Palate Bundle ($51, Programs Plus) and the Encore Edition 
Bundle ($51, MacConnection).  Maybe I'll wait for good stackware, or create my 
own.  (Is there a stackware discussion list I could tune in to?)

Another of my hobbies, or at least areas of expertise, is statistics. I don't 
have any data to analyze just now, but may acquire some if I find the time for 
pattern recognition or computer vision research. I can write regression solvers
and other such routines if I have to, but it would be nice to have a good stat 
package around.  Ones that sound interesting are MacSpin ($145, M.A.C.), 
StatView II ($340, M.A.C.), StatWorks 1.2 ($74, MacWAREHOUSE), and SYSTAT 3.1 
($459, MacConnection). I'd be grateful for leads to review articles, or for 
information on how StatView II differs from StatView 512+ 1.1 ($175).  Are 
there any public-domain programs I should be looking at?

There are also some interesting symbolic equation solvers and numerical 
analysis programs.  I'll let them keep improving until I really need to buy 
one.  Pencil and paper are usually adequate for me, and I've got books that 
show me how to set up numerical solutions for all kinds of problems.  All I 
need is a programming language.

My main programming language is C.  I'm used to a Unix environment, and expect 
Unix to win out in the workstation world, but for now I'm more interested in 
adapting myself to the Mac environment than in continuing to use vi, grep, awk,
etc.  So I'll go with Lightspeed C instead of the Aztec package or AU/X.  
Version 2.01 is $95, but M.A.C. has version 2.13 for $116; anybody know the 
difference?  And what are the LSC Version 2 Program Extender ($70, M.A.C.) and 
LSC CAPP's ($49)?

I'm a good C programmer, but I know nothing about the Mac architecture. What 
books should I get?  Inside Macintosh?  And do I need the TMON debugger ($94, 
MacWAREHOUSE), or can I get along fine without it?  Would MacNosy for the Mac 
II ($289, M.A.C.) be useful, or should I wait until I find a critical need for 
it?  Are there any particular disk utilities or toolkits that I need for 
writing application programs?  Do I need the Macintosh 68000 Development System
($59)?

I'd buy Coral/Allegro CommonLisp if I had the cash, but I'll wait until I find 
an application I can't program in C.  Likewise with Prolog, although I 
currently have no idea which Prolog to get: AAIS Prolog ($167), ExperProlog II,
LPA MacProlog, or Prolog/m.  Perhaps I'll know by the time I figure out what 
Prolog is good for.  Someday I'll also get one or more expert system shells, 
but right now I'm waiting for Nexpert to drop to a reasonable PC price.

I'll get ZBasic 4.0 ($60, M.A.C.) so that my kids can type in game programs 
from Creative Computing.  I'm sure the MS Basic Compiler ($119) is good too. 
(By the way, M.A.C. sells ZBasic for $10 more with a "converter"; what's that?)

I might get a Logo so that my kids can do turtle graphics, although I think 
I'll wait until they're exposed to team programming at school.  By then I 
should be able to chose between ExperLogo 1.1 ($119) and Object Logo ($76, 
ComputerWare).  (I'm not sure these programs are II-compatible yet.)

I'm almost completely ignorant about utilities, especially all the Disk/Desk 
names.  I'll definitely get DiskFit 1.4 ($50, Tussey).  Suitcase ($35, The 
MacZone) and Stepping Out II ($55, Programs Plus) look worth getting.  Would 
Power Station ($36, The MacZone) be of use to me? I'll wait to see if I feel 
the need for QuicKeys 1.1 ($62, MacWAREHOUSE) or something like Icon-It! ($39).

Some of the other utilities known to be II-compatible are Copy II Mac 7.0 with 
MacTools ($20), Disk First Aid, Disk Ranger, Fedit Plus ($30, ComputerWare), 
Findswell ($29), Hard Disk Util 2.0 ($54, MacConnection), MacSafe 1.08 ($94, 
MacWAREHOUSE), MacZap 5.0 & Disc Clinic ($36, MacWAREHOUSE), and MockPackage+. 
Do I need any of these?

Sidekick 2.0 ($59) is not II-compatible, and I don't know if I'd need it even 
if it were.  Other utilities that have not been reported OK are Battery Pac 
($34, M.A.C.), Disk Quick, Front Desk ($80, Egghead), Packit III, and TopDesk 
2.3 ($32).  Any comments?

Game programs are likewise divided into II-compatible, unknown, and 
incompatible.  The first group includes Balance of Power 1.03 ($30), Crystal 
Quest ($24, MacConnection), Deja Vu ($29), ShadowGate ($30), Shanghai ($24), 
Smash Hit Racquetball II ($22), Uninvited ($30), and Zork Trilogy ($42, 
MacConnection).

Those that I'm not sure about, and therefore in greatest need of information 
about, are Apache Strike ($27), Battle Stations ($20, MacWAREHOUSE), Beyond 
Dark Castle ($26, M.A.C.), Beyond Zork ($30), Borrowed Time, Carmen San Diego 
($25, Programs Plus), Chessmaster 2000 ($28), Down Hill Racer ($24), Klondike, 
Mind Over Mac ($28, MacConnection), Orbquest, Psion Chess ($31), Quarterstaff 
($29, MacWAREHOUSE), Real Poker ($27, The MacZone), Sargon III 1.0 ($29), Seven
Cities of Gold ($15, Programs Plus), and Trust and Betrayal ($30).  By the way,
is Chessmaster 2000 or Psion Chess the better program?

For the record, the following have been reported as definitely not compatible: 
Archon ($15), Ancient Art of War ($25, Tussey), Dark Castle ($26, 
MacWAREHOUSE), Ferrari Grand Prix ($32), Fokker Triplane 1.0 ($32, 
MacWAREHOUSE), GATO 1.42 ($26), Lode Runner ($24), MacGolf 2.0 ($35, Tussey), 
MS Flight Simulator 1.0 ($32), Ogre ($20), Orbiter ($26), Skyfox ($15), Ultima 
III ($24, MacConnection), Winter Games ($24), and Mac Wizardry ($34, The 
MacZone).  Am I wrong?

If I'm to become a Mac hacker, I'm going to need some literature. Prices aren't
a big deal, with wide selection and comparable discounts easily available.  But
what do I need?  (I especially want reference books and clever techniques, not 
hand-holding tutorials.) Inside Macintosh, I'm sure, and the HyperCard 
Handbook.  What else?

I apologize for the length of this message.  I've tried to do my homework, but 
there's a lot to learn and little time for learning it. Store clerks can be of 
some help, and I'm still hunting through info-mac archives and old 
MacUser/MacWorld issues for product reviews, but discussion lists are the best 
consulting medium ever developed. I'll be happy to share information, including
my full price database, with anyone else on the net.

Subject: Anyone know about ADA for Macs?

Hi Macfreaks!

   Does anyone know if an ADA compiler is, or will be in the near future,

available for a Mac?

   I have heard of such a compiler for the 80286 based IBM PC.  I assume a Mac 
based on a 68020 (16Mhz) with enough memory should be sufficient to run such a 
compiler.

   Hope to hear a positive answer.

I have downloaded a public domain DA called 'Maxwell 2.2' from MACSERVE@PUCC a 
while ago.  A note in that program claims that its source code is in the public
domain as well.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to find it anywhere.  I 
wonder if anyone can help me to get hold of that code or at least get in touch 
with Coyote Systems, the author of that code. Your help is greatly 
appreciated... via email, preferably.

Addison-Wesley is going to publish a thing called "Macintosh Family Hardware

Subject: Mac 'sed' stream editor needed?!

in the course of building big multi-megabyte free-text database files for 
indexing/browsing (with my 'Texas/indexer/browser' software) I often have need 
of a simple but fast editor to do repetitive things to big files. Microsoft 
WORD is very buggy when dealing with files bigger than 4 MB or so, and of 
course it's horrendously slow in doing global search/replace and such on those 
files.  So, two quick questions come to mind:

  - is there a better editor for huge files?  (How does Write Now handle ASCII 
text files bigger than memory holds, for instance?  MacWrite is out of the 
question.  Any other candidates?)

  - is there a Macintosh equivalent of 'sed', the UNIX stream editor?  Could I 
get source code somehow for sed and compile up a Mac version without too much 
trouble (in Lightspeed C for example)?  Is there anything better than sed for 
arbitrarily big files?

   Tnx for any suggestions -- ^z

Subject: Radius Accelerator Problem

Last Fall I became aware of a problem with the Radius Accelerator for the Mac 
Plus, but I have been having no success in getting Radius to come up with a 
solution for it.  I am writing this note in order to bring the problem to the 
attention of other owners, and to get them to let Radius know we want a fix.

The problem is that the I/O transfer rates to my Dataframe XP20 were 3 to 4 
times *SLOWER* after the Accelerator was installed ( numbers came from running 
DiskTimer IIa ).  Other local Radius owners reported similar speed decreases 
with other Dataframe drives ( XP60 ), and other manufacturers' SCSI drives as 
well.

I have yet to understand how a faster CPU can't receive data at at least as 
fast as a slower one, but nonetheless it happens.  ( A friend with the Radius 
Accelerator on a Mac SE got about a 33% INCREASE in speed, and I expect that's 
about what a Mac Plus could achieve also.  )

Radius says that the problem lies in the lack of SCSI Hardware handshaking on 
the Plus.  They have been telling me they are "working" on the problem since 
last November, but even as late as last week they said that it was "not a high 
priority" problem.  I suspect that if no one else is interested, it will never 
be fixed.

So, if you are a Mac Plus / Radius Accelerator / SCSI disk owner who is also 
concerned about this slowdown, please let Radius Technical Support hear from 
you.  The number that I have used is 408-434-1010.

We are interested in getting a screen projection screen unit used with an

computer and sit on top of the overhead projector, where your transparencies 
normally sit.)  We have one such unit, made by Sharp, in our PC classroom, and 
we now want one in our Macintosh classroom.

So far we have seen the Kodak prototype unit, but it is not available, or even 
announced yet.  The only unit we have seen here in Toronto, which is available,
is the MacViewFrame, made by nView Corporation of Newport News, VA.

Does anyone have a MacViewFrame?  We would be interested in hearing user

Subject: Sending TeX dvi files from a VAX to a Mac

Can anyone give me some pointers on how to package TeX dvi files so that I can 
send them from a Unix machine (VAX 780) to my Mac II? I use MacKermit for file 
transfer over a dial-in line.

If I send the original dvi file, it gets trashed. I can BinHex a dvi file 
produced on the Mac (using TexTures), ship it to the VAX, and unBinHex it there
using xbin. The dvi file is then found in xxx.dvi.data . But I can't seem to 
make the reverse direction work. The command unxbin expects an xxx.dvi.info 
file, which I don't have, in order to make the xxx.dvi.hqx file. "Making one 
up" doesn't work either since the crc number (whatever that is) is not correct.
Is there a standard way of shipping binaries not generated on a Mac? Any help 
will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Hi all:

Can anyone help out with the following.  I am trying to create a dialog box on 
the MAC that has say 5 or 6 lines of viewable text (maybe 10-12 total) that the
user can scroll(using the scroll bar/thumb/arrow) up and down in (not 
left/right) and click on a line of the text (twice) or click once and click on 
an ok button.  Much like the save dialog. The text will be put in via my 
application not stored in a resource file (i.e. it changes on the fly).  I have
been all through Inside Macintosh volume I but the code to handle this task 
seems overwhelming.  I am coding in Pascal.  Does anyone have some sample code 
or a block of code I could peruse to get the idea of the resources I have to 
set up and how to control the window once it is on the screen? Any help would 
be appreciated.  You can respond to me directly if you prefer.

Today I found a bug in MPW Shell 2.0.2:

The "Open" command does not open a file read-only if the -r option is used in 
conjunction with the -t option. "Open -r -t myFile" opens the file as target

"Open -r myFile; Open -t myFile" works, but causes unnecessary window

One bug seems to have been fixed in the MPW 2.0.2 Link tool, but I

discovered still another one.

The bug occurs if you declare an object type in the implementation part of a 
unit and define a new method for this type (new as opposed to overriding a 
superclass method), and let the linker optimize method calls (-opt option). The
new method does not show up in the method table listing produced with the -p 
option, and the linker still produces a %_SelProcs segment. According to MacApp
DA newsletter 1/5, this segment should never be present in an optimized 
program. When I start the program, it drops into MacsBug with a User break: 
Method not found message when the new method is called.

Preventing viral contamination of public domain programs

With all the problems with virus infected public domain and shareware software,
I propose the following solution (for the Macintosh):

There exists a shareware program called StuffIt 1.4 which was designed to group
multiple files into one file which can then be uploaded. StuffIt 1.4 is for the
Macintosh, and is turning into a sort of standard for packing. StuffIt 1.4, in 
addition to grouping files can compress them and can encrypt them.

The proposal:

How about adding a new feature to StuffIt that encrypts files, but in such a 
way that they can only be decrypted and not encrypted again? This can be done 
with the following method. StuffIt could prompt the uploading user to enter an 
encrypting code which is used to encrypt the files. Along with the files, 
another code is included. This code is the decrypting code, which downloading 
users can use to decrypt the file. The decrypting code could be hashed by some 
secret function into the original encrypting code. This method is similar to 
the "trapdoor" functions used for Public-Key Cryptosystems with one-way 
functions.

The advantage of this is that the original author of a program can encrypt his 
or her software and place it in the public domain without the fear of others 
downloading the file, contaminating it with a virus, and then uploading the 
file as the original.

Mac II wish list

ken laws:LAWS@IU.AI.SRI.COM

Jeez, guy, if you did all that homework and study on programs and prices and 
STILL dont know which are mac II compatible, I don't know what to say!

I usually suggest to newcomers to the Mac to start with one or two programs 
(usually a word processor and something to produce graphics in either the 
chart/analysis kind of vein or the paint/draw world), get used to them and the 
machine, and then buy other programs and utilities as the need (desire) arise. 
I feel too many people, new to the machine, load themselves up with a lot of 
software that doesn't really address their needs and never really learn the 
basics of using a Mac to its full advantage.  MacWrite and MacPaint were all I 
had for about two or three months in 1984 and I got a lot done with them (and 
sold my boss on Macs as a viable computer in my office).

On the other hand, you are obviously computer literate and want to program. My 
raster of things to buy looks like the following:

Application Software:

word processing - FullWrite is the best right now (well, you already got 
WordPerfect; I think it's a dog. A powerful program, but poor design.  I have 
it, and don't use it.).  FullWrite also dispenses with the need for a dedicated
(MacDraw) graphics program to some extent, as well as does a fair bit of page 
layout type work. WriteNow is adequate for simpler requirements and a lot 
cheaper.

graphics - HyperCard has all the paint tools I need for my bitmap graphics 
stuff, MacDraw or Canvas are what I use otherwise.  For data modeling, the 
StatXXX, CricketGraph, Excel, Trapeze, etc. suit various purposes and people in
particular ways.  I also have MacRecorder and ThunderScan, and a graphics 
tablet, but then I love toys and find work for them occasionally.

terminal emulation - Only one cuts the mustard if you actually USE a VAX and 
that's Versaterm (or the PRO version).  Very good terminal, many features, 
underpriced.

database: HyperCard serves most of my personal needs adequately, the range of 
dedicated data manglers is so complex you need to know more to advise better.  
I have several and keep using the simplest - you know where I stand.

There's about a zillion other programs that I have/use occasionally/whatever.  
Everything under the sun, in at least a dozen flavors each.  Go slow, buy what 
you like, use what you buy.

Programming:

Programming on a Mac is nearly impossible without the Inside Macintosh v 1-5 
series, the Tech Notes and development system support docs.  Addison Wesley's 
Introduction to Macintosh family hardware and Introduction to Macintosh 
Programming I found fantastic (and I've been playing with this thing since 
'84).  Scott Knaster's two books are also excellent. Many other titles are on 
the shelves.  All have good and bad.

I've become I personal fan of MPW, after becoming disenchanted with the other 
programming environments (Lightspeed C and Pascal, TML Pascal, Consulair C, 
MegaMax C, NEON, Forth, LOGO, you name it, I've fooled with it).  The editor is
not extraordinarily fast, but very powerful. The MPW editor can also handle 
arbitrarily large documents and has scriptable editing capabilities.  It is 
also a complete command line based interface package.  You work on a Mac 
differently from a terminal style environment - VI, EMACS etc are awful when 
you get involved with this machine.  My opinion.  The MPW Tools are great.  The
Pascal, C and Asm support, the Rez compiler, etc, just work right.  Steep 
learning curve, but worth it. Lightspeed C v2.13 is current package and 
includes the libraries for most Mac II managers, as well as for the current 
System 5.0 release.

Utilities:

Three classes of necessary things: disk block editor, disk maintenance

software, and convenience utilities.

disk block editor - I use FEdit Plus, it works fine, and has saved me many

times over.

convenience utilities - biggest difficulties I like to overcome are font and 
desk accessory handling - either SuitCase or Font/DA Juggler are worth the 
money - I have both.  QuicKeys is great for an extended keyboard.

disk maintenance - YOU NEED A GOOD BACKUP PROGRAM. I use both DiskFit and 
FlashBack for two different kinds of backing up.  Disk Express cleans up the 
mess I make with creating and deleting lots of files.  StuffIt is excellent for
file archiving.  There are also a few catalogers for handling lots of the 
floppies you generate: these are handy.

Otherwise, fine toys abound - enjoy.

Everything above works fine on both my Mac II and my Mac Plus.  Most real Mac 
software now works on all machines, or at least the Plus and up.

the opinions and endorsements above reflect only the truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help me ... so help me ... so help me ...

   Red Ryder is very powerful, but from a user standpoint the tip of the hat in
my opinion has to go to smartcom II.  It real nice and resonably simple to use.
 And does a good vt102 emulation.  I use RedRyder from local pc oriented BBS's,
but I use SmartCom to log on to Unix system.

   Inbox is only useful if you're going to want e-mail on an Appletalk network.
 Also TOPS is for file-services over Appletalk as well, not a main stream 
product for a single user enviroment, but when you network you self TOPS and 
Inbox are wonderful. >I'm ordering WordPerfect ($189) because I'll also be 
using it at my new >office on a DOS PC.

   Please don't do this to your self.  WordPerfect, while functional, is one of
the worst pieces of MacSoftware I've ever seen from a major company. If you 
like WP on Dos then you'll like WP on the Mac, but I prefer something better.  
At least buy Word, and if you really want to see Macintosh WP at it's best get 
FullWrite Professional.  But anything accept Word Perfect.

>Do I also need Expressionist 1.11 ($42, M.A.C.)

   Most likely, although you can do equations in products like MacPaint and 
MacDraw and via the built in ClipBoard transfer them to any other program.  Not
something you'd think out coming from a DOS enviroment.  But Expressionist 
makes things a lot easier.

>Do I also need an editor like QUED ($60, M.A.C.) or >microemacs to work on 
source code without embedding formatting characters?

   No most all of the WP's for the mac have ASCII text options.  But you will 
want a programming editor.  The best editors are QUED, wonderful programming 
editor that I have never seen an equal too on any system.

>I plan to get Spellswell 2.0 ($39, M.A.C.) , but will count on fiber media

   Why, most all of the WP's for the Mac come with spell checkers?

>And what chance is there that I can ship formatted output to a DOS-oriented

>(or VAX-oriented) laser printer at my office?

   Well if you buy an Appletalk card for the PC, and then start using Word for 
the PC you'll be able to print directly to the LaserPrinter, and if you use 
word for the Mac {much better than Word Perfect, but I still prefer FullWrite} 
it will read/write MS-Dos Word files.

   All of these products are good and they do serve a purpose, but the 
Macintosh is resonably integrated thru the existing support in the OS for the 
exchange of Information between unrelated programs.  Play with the Mac first, 
find out what it can do, and then decide if you need these products.

   VideoWorks II is wonderful, and it was made for the II.  It might be too 
difficult as a toy, but if you do image processing it will knock your socks 
off.  Also I've noticed a distinct worry about compatiability.  The Mac II is 
very compatible, you typically don't have to worry about software running on a 
normal Mac that won't run on the II.  The notable exceptions are mostly games, 
other than that you can assume the product will run.

   I suggest Macintosh Pascal from Apple, rather than Basic.  It is a Pascal 
interpreter, and very fun to program, symbolic debugging, graphics, step by 
step execution, really nice, take a look at it if you get a chance. Yes there 
is a Dos emulator for the Macintosh called SoftPC works quite well according to
the net mail, I suggest you start reading comp.sys.mac.

  You really should look into MPW.  Macintosh Programer Workshop.  It is a 
bourne style shell, with one of the best text editors I've seen.  It supports 
Pascal, C, Assembly, Modula II, Fortran, Ada and a varity of other languages. 
All of the languages produce compatable output that the linker pulls together 
to make the object code.

   In addition programs written in MPW C can be ported to A/UX with few

modifications.

   The shell supports:  Shell Scripts, Variables, Piping, redirection of 
standard input and output, ect....  If you're used to Unix you will LOVE MPW.  
It is the most complete development enviroment I've ever seen on any, system of
any size.  {ps. I've worked on at least 10 systems in the past 10 years, micro 
& mainframe}

  Macintosh pascal has a good graphics model, and there are several good books 
on the subject.  Also Turbo Pascal supports turtle graphics.

($39).

    I would recommend FastBack over DiskFit.  It's been completely re done for 
the Mac an is much more functional than diskFit, it is also the fastest disk 
backup I've seen.  I've have used most/all of the disk backups and Fastback is 
what I have settled on.

   Buy QuickKeys!!!!!!!!!

MacWAREHOUSE), and MockPackage+.  Do I need any of these?

    They'd be nice.  Here again you worry too much.  They aren't games so you 
have a high chance that they will work.  General rule of thumb, it's not a game
it works on all Macintoshs.

   Subscription to MacTutor.  The only programers magazine for the Macintosh,

Subject: MPW Fortran V1.0B3 vs. Mactran Plus v3.0

I have compared these two compilers on a Mac II in an effort to determine which
one is more usable. Originally I bought Absoft Fortran/020, but the frequency 
of unexplained system errors and the buggy nature of the code produced rendered
the compiler essentially useless.

The summary is that MacTran is harder to use and less polished in general, but 
it has one extreme advantage: it works, and it works NOW. I have been porting 
several extremely large programs from a VAX, and MacTran was able to handle 
then with only a few minor changes (units, etc.). MPW Fortran was unable to run
them successfully (a system error in one case, and incorrect results in the 
other).

MPW Fortran is a much nicer environment, however. Editing is quite natural as 
is the somewhat Unix-like shell interface. Even though it is less graphically 
oriented, it is much less frustrating on a day-to-day basis than MacTran's 
interface, which does not adhere completely to the Mac standard. However, the 
fact is that MPW Fortran is not debugged yet.

So my recommendation is to get MacTran Plus if you need a good-quality Fortran 
compiler right away. However, think about making the switch to MPW Fortran once
a less buggy version comes along. It is still in beta, after all. Avoid Absoft 
Fortran like the plague; it is worse than both of them.

The Apple Human Interface guidelines point out that you must dismiss a modal 
dialog box before doing ANYTHING else, which is in fact the case. The problem 
is that this is an unreasonable restriction.  There have been a lot of notes 
about the fact that modal dialogs do not let you use the edit menu, even if 
there is text to edit.  They also do not let you use a desk accessory such as a
calculator or a file locator, even if these things would help you fill in the 
blanks in the dialog box.

The purpose of modality in these dialog boxes should not be to prevent you from
doing anything at all but rather should prevent you from doing anything in the 
application which could either conflict with the operation in progress or allow
you to forget that you need to answer the questions in the dialog box.  This 
can be satified without going to extremes. For example, a "modal" dialog box 
might allow you to use the edit menu and the desk accessories (thus allowing a 
switch to a different layer) but disable all other menu items and beep on 
clicks on other windows.

One problem is that there is no standard way to do this, and there are many 
possible views on how it should be done.  For example, should the Quit item be 
enabled?  (I am of the opinion that perfect programs should ALWAYS have an 
escape hatch and that it should ALWAYS be in the same place, but it is 
difficult to work that idea in with modal dialogs.) Should menu-oriented help 
schemes work with dialogs?  Should there be some limited way of looking at the 
document?  Questions, questions, questions.

The other problem and the reason that many programmers (including me) don't use
such a scheme is that ModalDialog is so easy to use, and building in this 
capability is a lot of work for (from a programmer's viewpoint) a relatively 
small benefit.  A standard capability of this kind could fairly easily be built
into skeletons, but only after the particulars had been decided.

Subject: taking Mac's on airplanes

Date: Mon, 16 May 88 17:38:24 -0400

From: jmccombi@VAX.BBN.COM

Recently there was a question on the net about taking Macintoshes on airplanes.
 Though there is usually no problem with fitting it under the seat, we should 
note that some foreign airlines are not permiting computers on board for 
security reasons.  In particular, I recently flew on SwissAir Boston - Zurich; 
in Boston I noticed a sign at the check-in counter that stated quite clearly 
"for security reasons, no computers allowed on board."  It seems that with all 
the metal in computers, one might easily hide explosives in, say, a Macintosh 
chassis, and it would be impossible to see in the X-ray machine.

Note: Fortunately, I wasn't travelling with my Mac at the time, so I didn't get
the chance to challenge them on this; despite all their posturing, I don't know
how flexible they would be in fact.

Moral of story: check with the individual airline before going to the airport 
for your flight.  Should a list be created, I'd be interested in seeing a 
summary of which airlines do and do not allow computers on board.

Rich Siegel wrote recently that

asm {move.w ROMBase, $E4}

would make "the Sound Driver glue" work in MultiFinder.  He mentioned LSC, so I
assumed he meant this would make stuff written in LSC or LSP work under 
MultiFinder.  Helpful Folks tell me that this translates to the Pascal

procedure Foo;

INLINE $31F8, $02AE, $00E4;

I tried this at the end of a program but it locks up my machin (the mouse moves
but that's all).  I am using SoundWave's library and am having problems that 
fit Rich's description: things are fine under the Finder, and the first time 
through under MultiFinder.  The second time under MultiFinder, the program 
bombs when trying to play a sound.  What am I missing?

Subject: Red Ryder and macget/macput

There has been some talk recently om comp.sys.mac about Red Ryder's 
incompatibility with macget/macput. It is all quite true, and it is for that 
reason that I undertook quite a while ago to modify macget and macput from its 
sources to make it compatible.

Here's what the problem is. It has nothing to do with XModem, which both 
MacTerminal 1.1 and Red Ryder are equally capable of handling. It has to do 
with the protocol used on top of XModem by each to effect binary Mac file 
transfers. Red Ryder uses the fairly widespread MacBinary standard for this, a 
standard that either didn't exist when MacTerminal 1.1 was written or was not 
so widespread. I suspect that some nascent version of MacBinary must have 
existed at the time because what MacTerminal 1.1 does is almost exactly the 
same. However, what is accomplished in a single XModem transfer in MacBinary is
done in three separate XModem transfers via MacTerminal: one transfer for the 
file's "header", one for the data fork, and one for the resource fork. 
MacBinary accomplishes the same thing in one XModem transfer by letting the 
header information determine how to separate the data part from the resource 
part. It was thus fairly trivial to modify macget/macput to merge the three 
transfers into one.

So, anyway, here are slightly modified versions of macget and macput that do 
MacBinary instead of MacTerminal style file transfers. [Enclosed in two 
separate messages to follow.] Two other features that I tossed in were CRC 
handling and the <ESC>B auto-receive feature. I have renamed these programs 
mbget and mbput to avoid confusion with the original macget and macput.

Many thanks are due to Dave Johnson, the original author of macget and macput, 
for writing this stuff in the first place and for blessing the release of this 
version of it. Please note that these programs are still copyright (c) 1984 by 
Brown University and may be used but not sold without permission.

This is ScaleFonts - a Control Panel Device that enables you to switch font 
scaling (which is done for sizes that are not available in your System file) on
and off. Switching font scaling ON shows text in its real size (even if the 
application would normally disable font scaling, as does WriteNow). Switching 
font scaling OFF results in a better readable and faster text display on 
screen.

This cdev replaces DA-SCALEFONTS-HQX.

Subject: SCSI Accelerator

This posting contains SCSI Accelerator, an INIT resource written by David 
Denowh.  SCSI Accelerator is a patch to the Mac's SCSI-dispatch code;  the 
author reports that it substantially increases hard-disk throughput (especially
if the disk is subsequently reformatted with a lower interleaving ratio).

SCSI Accelerator is definitely a "use at your own risk" tweak.  It was designed
to be used on a Mac Plus under System 4.2, and may not work in other 
configrations;  it performs some sanity-checks when patching itself into the 
SCSI dispatcher, and will not install itself if it can't find the appropriate 
hooks.  Mr. Denowh strongly recommends backing up your disk before installing 
SCSI Accelerator (or any other modification that may affect disk access).  He's
willing to assist people who use System files other than version 4.2, and is 
interested in hearing from people who have tried SCSI Accelerator.

I have not tried to install this resource myself.  Caveat hacker!

Subject: New scroll-bar resource

This is a posting of Scroll2, a CDEF (control-definition) resource written by 
Mayson G. Lancaster.  This CDEF enhances the standard Macintosh scroll bar;  it
places "scroll back" and "scroll forward" arrows at both ends of the scroll 
bar, so that you can scroll in either direction without having to move the 
cursor back and forth between the ends of the scroll-bar.

Scroll2 is delivered in the form of an Installer script that will add the CDEF 
resource to your System file, and also install three ROM-override resources so 
that the Mac will use the new disk-based CDEF rather than the one installed in 
your Mac's ROM.  Mr. Lancaster has also provided an Installer script that 
re-installs the standard Apple CDEF;  if you don't like Scroll2, you can 
deinstall it and then restore your System to its original state.  Instructions 
for installing and deinstalling Scroll2 are included in the StuffIt archive.

Scroll2 is shareware.

[SFScrollInit]

SFScrollInit is an INIT from Andy Hertzfeld that enhances Standard File. 
Install by dragging it into your system folder.  It causes Standard File to 
remember the last scroll position for each directory.  This version fixes a bug
that occured on Mac IIs, and possibly under MultiFinder.

   Fixer.c

   April 22, 1988

   Written by Juri Munkki

   This source code is in the public domain.

   The author makes no guarantees.

Instructions

   Fixer is a very small application that I wrote to faciliate writing

   INIT and other code resources in Lightspeed C.

What Does It Do?

   Lightspeed C always makes code resources purgeable and places them in the 
   application heap. The code files are created by '????' and their type is 
   '????'. To make an init resource work, I had to launch ResEdit, get info for
   the file and edit the file type to 'INIT', open the file and set the "System
   Heap" flag of the init resource. The last step is not always necessary, but 
   if you're going to patch the system, it's the simplest way to do it. I 
   wouldn't recommending placing system patches into the application heap.

   Fixer looks at a data structure in its resource fork. The file to modify 
   should be in the same folder as the fixer application, or the name should be
   a path to the file. It then looks at the type and creator fields in the 
   structure and changes the file type and creator accordingly.

   The FIXE 1000 resource also contains list of resources to be changed. Fixer 
   looks for any resources mentioned in the list (the resource type and number 
   are significant) and changes the resource attributes and name.

   If you like the program, let me know.

Subject: Writing INIT resources. Part 1, the INIT source

   SampleInit.c

   April 22, 1988

   Written by Juri Munkki

   This source code is in the public domain.

   The author makes no guarantees.

Instructions

   I wrote this INIT as a sample to one of my clients. They wished to monitor 
   what the user does and generate statistics on frequently used actions.

   This INIT does nothing useful. It modifies GetNextEvent so that instead of 
   returning autoKey events with the spacebar, the # character is returned. It 
   should be quite a surprise to people who are used to using spaces instead of
   tabs. :-) The INIT has no effect on DAs.

   You should have Lightspeed C to use this INIT. The structure of an INIT 
   depends highly on the development system being used. Lightspeed C places 
   global data storage after the program code. This means that you can't have 
   more than 32K of code AND static variables.

   The INIT resource itself should have the "System Heap" flag set or it will 
   bomb sooner or later. (usually soon)

   Please remember to put a 'sysz' resource into your INIT, if you're going to 
   need a lot of space. Also remember that any dynamic storage that should live
   through launches should be in the system heap.

   I hope this helps those who are desperately trying to

   patch the system.

Subject: Interferon 1.2

This posting contains Interferon, an application that will search for and 
(optionally) attempt to eradicate the nVIR and SCORES viruses (and, according 
to the change log, a virus called SNEAK as well... I haven't heard of this one 
before).  Interferon is by Robert Woodhead;  it's free-for-use and 
free-for-distribution (but not in the public domain). Woodhead asks for a 
suitable shareware donation (for the purchase of hardware for a visually 
impaired computerist) if Interferon helps you out.

This StuffIt archive contains Interferon 1.2, and a file of documentation.  The
program warns you to read the documentation before attempting to use the 
"Eradicate viruses" option.  This is good advice... "Eradicate" deletes 
infected files rather than attempting to repair them.  Unfortunately, the 
documentation file is in Microsoft Word format;  it can be read (after a 
fashion) by those without MS Word if you have FEdit or MacSnoop and don't mind 
grovelling through the file's data fork a sector at a time.

Subject: Virus Rx

This posting is a StuffIt archive containing Virus Rx, a new virus-scanning 
program recently released by Apple Computer.  Virus Rx scans a disk, looking 
for all INIT, CDEV, and RDEV files, all INIT resources, and damaged 
applications.  It reports its findings in a nicely-formatted display (which can
be saved for future reference).

Virus Rx is a virus-scanner only;  it does not attempt to repair damaged 
applications or strip out viruses.  If your system becomes infected, Apple 
recommends that you back up all data files, reformat your disk, restore your 
System stuff and applications from the original distribution disks (you _do_ 
keep them write-protected, don't you?) and restore the data files from your 
backup.

single data file.

Included in this StuffIt archive is Randomizer, it's MacWrite format document, 
Darin Adler's StartUpDesk and it's document, plus SoundInit, and BeepInit.  
These extra things are provided as a courtesy since Randomizer would be useless
without something like them.

Subject: MPW tool package LookupDeclaration (3 parts)

The MPW Tool package "LookupDeclaration" contains two MPW tools and a shell 
script, which combined allow you to look up MPW Pascal declarations quickly and
comfortably. It is intended as a supplement to Inside Macintosh and to the 
various Inside Mac DAs, which provide better information, but in a less timely 
manner. LookupDeclaration allows you to work with the most up-to-date 
information you have available - the MPW interface texts. Compared to 
Search'ing the interfaces, LookupDeclaration works both faster and more 
selectively.

One of the tools, CreateDeclarationIndex, is used to create an index for the 
declarations in the interface files you intend to use. After that, you work 
with LookupDeclaration in the most simple way: you just position the insertion 
mark in an identifier, or to the right or the left of it, and select "Lookup 
Declaration" from the "Find" menu or press Command-L. LookupDeclaration will 
figure out the identifier, and open the appropriate interface text at the 
position where the identifier is declared. If there are multiple declarations 
for the identifier - as may occur for record components or object methods -, 
LookupDeclaration will open a dialog box which lets you select the declaration 
you really want. Any files will be opened read-only, so there is no risk of 
accidently modifying them. Of course, you still may select and copy text from 
the interface file.

The LookupDeclaration package is a shareware product: the right is granted to 
anyone not involved in military products to freely copy, distribute and test 
it. If after two week's testing you decide to keep the package, it must be 
registered for the shareware price of $20 or 30 DM.

The package comes with a manual (a WriteNow document) and an MPW Pascal

Syntax Overview, in a Binhex'ed Stuffit archive.

I've seen a lot of discusion about a version of compress for the Macintosh. 
Since there seems to be a need, I've posted the MacCompress.hqx. MacCompress is
a Macintosh application which compresses/decompresses files for use with unix 
"compress".

PLEASE put it on as many other bboards as you can.

This version compresses with 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 bits and maps from CR to LF 
and vice versa.  It compresses whole folders as well as single files.  It both 
compresses and decompresses and will run in as little as 100K under

> he was leaning toward the mac, but was wondering about the //GS

If i were you, I would inform your friend to completely forget about the //GS 
and to stick with the macintosh SE if he can afford it (if not, then a mac plus
if he can get one...) -- The SE is the finest machine that I have owned to 
date, and once I get a really big hard drive for it, I will be in heaven. I 
have used my mac since I began college years ago (when I had a simple 128K 
mac...) and have only come to love my mac more and more every day....its the 
main reason that I got A's in my english courses, as well as tons of other 
courses that it has had the brains to draw up charts for me...

Basically, I have made use of the Imagewriter I to print up most of my stuff 
(over 5,000,000 characters of stuff for myself as well as typed papers for 
friends, et. al..) but since acquiring my SE I have made use of the Imagewriter
//, and I am even more satisfied with its functioning so far.

The best advice for your friend.....save your money and get an SE...you wont 
regret it....-- for proof of its superiority over a //GS, just try booting up 
the "finder" on the //GS and then boot it on the SE, then try running some 
software.  Figure out the time differences, and multiply the time differenc by 
the number of times you expect to use the computer.....thats how much time you 
will waste by having a //GS.....

Bye for now but not for long...

Subject: Radius Accelearator Problem

>The problem is that the I/O transfer rates to my Dataframe XP20 were 3 >to 4 
times *SLOWER* after the Accelerator was installed ( numbers came

>I have yet to understand how a faster CPU can't receive data at at least >as 
fast as a slower one, but nonetheless it happens.  ( A friend with

        My guess is that this problem is related to the interleave factor 
involved in reading out the disk.  This interleave takes into account the fact 
that the CPU may not be able to process the incoming data as fast as the disk 
can ship it, so files are written such that there are segments separated by 
breaks during each track; the spacing is adjusted to account for the time that 
it takes the CPU to process each segment.

        When you change to a faster CPU, the interleave factor is no longer 
optimum for your system.  There is a way this can actually make your transfers 
slower, but the reason escapes me at the moment. There is a good article in the
June MacUser about disks with a discussion about problems with interleave when 
changing CPU's.  You should read it there, what I said above may not be 
remembered quite right.

   Good luck with Radius!

Subject: Screen Projection Units for Overhead Projectors

This is in response to Alex Nishri's request for information about Macintosh 
screen projection units which allow you to display a Mac screen on an overhead 
projector.  The following appeared in *Bits and Bytes Review* Volume 1, No. 8, 
page 20.; it describes a product which may be of interest:

   "The STRETCH PROJECTOR is a complete system that allows any standard 
   overhead projector to project a Macintosh screen image with 640-by-400 
   resolution.  The system includes a proprietary LCD plate that measures 1 by 
   10.9 by 12.8 inches and that weighs less than 1 pound, cables, software, and
   its own low-voltage power supply.  The proprietary LCD plate uses 
   'supertwist' technology for sharp images at most viewing angles and special 
   liquid crystals that resist over-heating.  The 'two-screen' software allows 
   users to display one imate on the standard Macintosh screen and another on 
   the projected screen. The Stretch Projector is user installable (no 
   soldering is required).  $1,799.  Contact:  Network Specialities, 1485 
   Bayshore Blvd., San Francisco, CA  94124; (415) 467-8411"

I myself am not familiar with this product, but perhaps the information

will be a help.

Subject: FINDER: there should be a way up!

Suppose you are at the Finder and you have open the window of a folder F way 
down in the tree directory, while having closed all windows for the ancestors 
of that folder. How do you open a sibling of F? Well, you have to open F's 
parent which can only be achieved if you start from the root (the disk). In 
other words, the Finder doesn't let you climb back up the hierarchy of 
directories (like the SFGet dialog of HFS Systems do). Apple may have thought 
of that since Finder 6.0a, which I once saw with a pre-release version of 
Juggler (before Multifinder was out), had the following feature. If you 
double-clicked on the title bar of an open window, the window corresponding to 
the parent folder would pop open, regardless of whether any of the ancestors 
folders was open. This feature vanished with the released Finder 6.0.

Something even more powerful is desirable. Here is the idea: let clicking in 
the title bar serve to drag the window, unless the click is on the title name 
itself, in which case, a pop-up menu will come up with the ancestors folders' 
names, just like the SFGet dialog. Selecting a menu item will open the window 
of that folder. This actually beats Unix's "cd ../../.." since you see where 
you are going. Try opening MacTools(R) 7.0 for a live demo of this feature.

If this conflicts with the interface guidelines, how about an extra menu 
"Hierarchy" on the menu bar (whose contents change depending on the top most 
window) to achieve the same?

Does anyone have any comments, or is the ball on Apple's court?

Subject: shipping DVI files to/from a MAC

I have successfully used Kermit

to do DVI file transfers

from Unix boxes to Macs and vice versa.

The trick, in general, is to tell Kermit

on both sides of the connection that you

are sending an 8-bit binary file between

the two machines.  On the unix side

this often looks something like

set file type binary

and I don't remember offhand what you have

to do on the mac side.

I am scratching the surface of the incredible 4d database system. I like it 
however, alot is said in the documentation, which is sometime hard to find. I 
understand ACIUS is publishing technotes. The distributor in Holland of the 4d 
software says a magazine supposedly devoted to 4d exists in the usa and also a 
library of external procedures is emerging. My question, where can i get more 
information. Distributors in Europe exaggerate their prices, they usually 
multiply them by 2 or 3. I need al the info on 4d, at reasonable cost. Thanks,

I tried this in Pascal, but it bombs:

      BytePtr = ^integer;

VAR

SoundGluePtr : BytePtr;

   SoundGluePtr := BytePtr($E4);

   SoundGluePtr^ := ROMBase;

This is a patch to get LightSpeed Pascal's Sound Driver glue routines to behave
under MultiFinder.  Thanks muchly for any help!

Subject: Appletalk networking

Good day, all.

In my building here, we currently have ten macs, assortedly 512's, pluses and 
se's. We have had Appletalk implemented for almost three years now but only 
used for a single shared laserwriter. I've been tasked to investigate the 
utility of various systems for sharing and transferring of files. Under 
consideration are two approaches. One is to set up a file server, and go thru 
the hassles (to me, anyway. don't let that flavor your response, as I probably 
won't be responsible for doing the actual day-to-day operation) of setting up 
permissions and having a superuser (of some sort), etc, etc. The other is to 
use an email type system to send files from one machine to the other. I'd 
appreciate it if any and all with experience in setting up one type of system 
or the other, would email their impressions to me. What we need to know are 
things like: Hardware/software used. Cost (both purchase and upkeep - this 
should include the time to do backups if a file server is implemented). 
Reliability. Ease of use. And anything else you feel would be of interest. 
Thanks, in advance for your help.

I would appreciate any information anyone would have on this. I am particularly
interested in what you have to do to remove the head--Does it pop out of the PC

Subject: Powerful, Easy to Learn Mac Programming Environment

This is one of those messages that will get me laughed at by ``real

programmers'', but what the hell . . .

There's continuing discussion of the best programming environment for 
developing Macintosh applications, with MPW seeming to be most widely favored, 
for obvious reasons.

What I want to point out here are the substantial, and largely

unrecognized, advantages in terms of

   --power

   --simplicity

   --and especially, speed of learning

of using Microsoft BASIC (!) as a programming environment for developing _real_
(though maybe not too complex) and genuinely ``Mac-ish'' applications for the 
the Macintosh.

To start with, or those of you who haven't looked at a modern BASIC

lately, MS BASIC has

   --no line numbers

   --unlimited length variable names and labels (at no cost in speed) --all the
   standard structured programming constructs --interpreter or compiler from 
   the same source --subprograms with _local_ variables and parameter lists (in
   and out) --pretty nice built-in editor --easy screen graphics

and so on.  You still have to be careful about variable types, and remember 
that all variables are global in the main program, but your program design can 
be as structured as you want to it to be (and a _lot_ easier to read than any 
other language).

But beyond that, all of the following Macintosh interface capabilities are 
directly and _easily_ available from within basic BASIC:

     --Windows     (4 types, 4 levels)

     --Menus     (full capabilities)

     --Mouse     (full capabilities)

     --Buttons     (all types)

--Edit fields

     --SFGetFile     (use for opening or saving)

--Large fraction of QuickDraw capabilities

--Numerous ROM routines

--Clipboard access, in and out, text or pictures --Event driven programming 
(using trapping or polling), for Timer,

   Mouse, Menu, or Dialog events.

In brief, you can make a BASIC program that looks every bit as Mac-ish as you 
like -- and compile it immediately into a free-standing clickable application.

Beyond this, once you learn a little about resources and REdit or ResEdit, 
through a set of very easy to use and readable ``ToolLib'' library calls which 
come with BASIC, you can very simply create, access and use a large set of Mac 
resources and Toolbox capabilities, including

       Arrays   Clipping    Alerts   Modal Dialogs   Graphics   Icons

       Menus   Mouse   Patterns   Pictures   Points   Polygons

       Regions   Resource Files   Srolling   Strings   Text   Windows

In each of these cases, the Toollib calls look very much like the Toolbox calls
in ``Inside Macintosh'', but all of the initialization and clean up hassles are
largely avoided.

And again, when you're all done you can have a self-contained clickable 
application, with its own resources, icon, ``About'' box, and so on.

The canonical statement from ``real Mac programmers'' seems to be something 
like , ``I spent 9 months reading all 5 volumes of Inside Macintosh, and 
struggling with MPW, and finally I got the picture and could start doing 
things.''  My experience with a class I'm teaching right now is that interested
undergrads with ``high-school BASIC'' backgrounds can produce simple but real 
Mac applications within a few _weeks_ of starting on the Mac.

I'm not saying that I or anyone else would want to write a multi-featured paint
program or text editor in MS BASIC.  But if you're a scientist, or teacher, or 
engineer, or  an amateur prgrammer in any field, who has other responsibilities
in life besides Mac programming; and if you'd like to write a real Mac 
application with a real Macintosh interface for your class or your job or your 
personal use, doing it in MS BASIC is the _only_ sensible choice I'm aware of. 
You can spend months with MPW -- or weeks with BASIC.

Finally, just note that it's our experience -- don't want to push this claim 
too hard -- that a compiled BASIC number crunching program (a big simplex 
program, for example, or an FFT) runs every bit as fast as the same program in 
any of the standard Pascals.

I'm trying to learn how to use the serial drivers on the Mac, and I can't get 
them to work. This is what I do (all is in Lightspeed C):

Insert the SERD resources into a resource file.

Do an OpenResFile on same.

Do a RAMSDOpen on sPortB.

The last call never returns noErr, and of course no FSReads or FSWrites

ever work after that.

What am I leaving out? This seems to be all Inside Mac is telling me to

do.

Subject: DA round window anyone?

How do I get a DA to have a circular window?

Some things that I found out (correct me if needed): The WDEF resource must 
have an ID like -16000 to be an owned resource (for DA ID=12). The 
corresponding WIND resource must have WindProcID equal to 16*(-16000)+varCode 
where varCode determines title bar, grow box and the like. Note, however, that 
this makes the WindProcID number invalid (unacceptable to ResEdit). If the WDEF
is not an owned resource, the Font/DA Mover doesn't install it!

I will appreciate replies directly to me. If I get this to work, you can count 
on seeing a round DA posted to this very net.

Create a file with CREATOR 'FMOV' and TYPE '????', then double click on it to

neither in Font mode nor in Desk Accessory mode. Then, without clicking in the 
DA button, option-open a file containing DAs. You will get the IDs of the DAs 
displayed over the last 2 characters of the DAs' names.

Subject: HP-IB printers & macs

I've recently acquired an HP 7475A pen plotter, as a surplus item, and want to

be able to use it with a macintosh.

The problem is: it is configured with an HP-IB port, which is Hewlett-Packard's
version of the IEEE-488 bus. Does anyone know of a way to drive an IEEE-488 
device with a mac? The printer and modem ports are both RS422/232, so that 
seems totally incompatible to me! There's a device called the grappler, which 
allows you to drive centronics interfaces with the mac's printer ports. Is the 
centronics interface IEEE-488? Is there any similarity between the two (ie, 
centronics & IEEE-488)? Is there a device similar to the grappler which would 
work in this application? This isn't a totally crucial device, as far as our 
macintosh environment is concerned, it's just that we picked it up for free, 
and it would be real nice to use it, if possible. Thanks well in advance for 
any advice anyone may be able to provide.

Subject: Megamax C 3.0 patch

The version of Megamax C I have will not run on newer (i.e. since intro of Mac 
Plus. I'm a bit of a stick-in-the-mud) versions of the operating system. When I
first found this someone told me to patch the executables and libraries by 
replacing all occurances of one word to another. I did that on the compiler, 
linker,editor and syslib, but on no other utility programs. Now I need convert,
and have forgotten the patch. Does anybody know what sequence I am supposed to 
replace with which?

I've quite frankly had it up to here (he points to a location several inches 
above his head) with Megamax, and am planning to move to Lightspeed any minute.
In fact, that's why I want convert -- I don't want to retype every toolbox 
function name in my old programs when I switch to lightspeed.

From: Ken Laws <LAWS@IU.AI.SRI.COM>

Subject: Mac II WishList Summary

Wow.  You (we?) Info-Mac readers really come through!  I'd like to thank 
Godfrey DiGiorgi, Christopher Chow, Fernando Pereira, Rick Light, Steve Weyer, 
Joe McMahon, Josh Hayes, Anselmo Lastra, George McKee, Keith Kutner, Jay 
Garvin, Felix Ingrand, Steve Buyske, David Oster, Leo Geoffrion, Anders 
(OK2ANDER), Barry Semo, Freek Wiedijk, Bill Bumgarner, Woody Yeung, Alan 
Larson, Mike Donegan, Les LaCroix, Sorrel Jakins, Lee Thomison, Herb Barad, 
Mike Linnig, Jeffrey Sullivan, Miguel%cs.umass.edu, Miguel Cruz, and Martin 
Minow for their help.  I've also included information from info-mac and from 
magazine reviews in the following.

As some of you suspected, my budget won't really cover all the software 
packages I mentioned.  Neither do I have time to learn them all at once.  Your 
suggestions will help me buy the most useful ones first; I can then wait for 
improved versions of the others.  However, I do want to get enough software 
functionality to justify the expense of the hardware.  It's kind of like buying
landscaping with a new house: the cost isn't so painful when it's expressed as 
a percentage of a larger system price.

I asked about a home/family system, but with software development and data 
analysis tools so that I could ply my research trade. (Carpenters, lawyers, and
truckers own their own tools -- why not programmers and scientists?)  Here's 
what I've gotten so far:

Hardware:

The Macs aren't sensitive to power-line problems.  If power fluctuations are 
bad enough to affect the peripherals, I should get the best power conditioning 
short of uninteruptable -- about $120.

ThunderScan is a toy.  Granted, but that's good enough for scanning in my kids'
pictures.  (Most expensive OCR systems don't work very well either.)  I'll have
the ImageWriter anyway, so the cost is reasonable. No one commented on 
Read-It!TS; I presume it reads only simple fonts.

Several people pointed out that I'll want more memory if I'm going to run 
HyperCard, MultiFinder, and all those statistical packages and other programs, 
not to mention storing scanned images. Yes, but I'll wait for memory prices to 
decrease and for my bank balance to bounce back.  I would have gotten the 80Mb 
internal disk, but Apple didn't offer it with the 2Mb bundle.

Communication:

VersaTerm is just about everyone's favorite, although the documentation is very
poor.  MicroPhone II was also suggested; it runs modem or kermit protocols in 
the background under MultiFinder.  RedRyder works now, although somewhat 
clumsily, but the company has offended a lot of users.  I presume that a macro 
package like Tempo II or even QuicKeys can match RedRyder's macros.  MacKermit 
is free (e.g., from KERMSRV@CUVMA). MacTerminal (or the MacTerminal protocol in
VersaTerm?) is useful with macput and macget for file transfers from Unix 
systems, but is annoyingly slow to exit.  Freeterm (from SUMEX-AIM) was 
suggested, as was Pacer's pcLink. Mac240 was suggested as a VT200 emulator.  I 
have no need of InTalk or TOPS; I think the same is true of SmartCom II.  
AlisaTalk was recommended for for Ethernet communication with Vax VMS.

StuffIt is essential.  I get the impression that it includes PackIt III and 
BinHex 4.0 capabilities; if not, SUMEX should have the code.  (By the way, 
PackIt III does work on the II.)  StuffIt 1.31 may be preferable to 1.40.  I 
may also want Microfilm Reader, free from Buck, Wheat and Associates (1601 
Weatherstone Dr., Blue Springs, MD 64015, (816) 229-5632). I'm not sure what 
program I need for manipulating Arpanet mail files that I've archived.

Word Processing:

Everyone says WordPerfect is good, although initially buggy (essentially a beta
release!), but that FullWrite Professional is better.  I'll reconsider.  I tend
to prefer anything written for the Mac to lowest-common-denominator software 
ported from other machines.  I'm also wary of PC-style software because the 
color selections and artistic choices tend to be mediocre. On the other hand, 
I'm told that the initial FullWrite release is slow and includes some poor 
formatting features.  Either editor will have a text-only option, and can thus 
be used for coding.

Other editors such as MacWrite 5.0, WriteNow, and Word were suggested as 
perfectly adequate for ordinary use.  JOVE and microEMACS are for those who 
can't break old habits.  QUED is OK, but the simple editors that come with MPW,
Lightspeed C, TEXtures, and other programs are good for most code editing and 
file hacking.  There are some DA editors that sound useful: McSink 4.3, SEdit, 
PowerEdit, etc. Laser Author is for people who need to put graphics in their 
text.

Expressionist 1.11 is better than MacEQN, although getting all the small fonts 
for nested sub/superscripting can be a pain. There's also something called 
MathType ($149 list) for graphic constuction of equations (with TEX interface 
capability), but I haven't checked out the April Macworld review.

TEXtures with LaTex is pretty good, for those who can stand it, but the lack of
BibTex macros has users upset.  It is possible to use HyperCard for generating 
bibliographies.

No one commented on Document Compare or any utility similar to Unix diff or 
Twenex srccom.  Perhaps this comes with one of the common utility packages.

Spelling:

Spellswell and Coach are good, but new editor formats might be a problem. 
WordPerfect comes with its own speller and thesarus anyway.  (I'll bet 
FullWrite does too.)

Graphics:

Everyone has a favorite.  I've already ordered the Claris MacPaint 2.0 and 
MacDraw, as I mentioned, and will probably upgrade them to the II versions.  
Those, plus my editor, should handle my document production needs -- at least 
until I can afford a laser printer.  Other recommended packages are 
CricketDraw, FullPaint, and SuperPaint.  PixelPaint and Modern Artist are 
probably overkill. There's no question that SuperPaint is a bargain, although 
it doesn't handle color.  Canvas is buggy, but some people like it.  
CricketDraw also has some bugs.  My kids would probably enjoy Crystal Paint or 
KaleidaGraph.

ImageStudio is mainly for high-res retouching of scanned images; I presume it 
works on the Mac II.  I'll wait for Digital Darkroom ($295 list) to come out 
this June.  I hear that both developers are planning extensions to color 
imagery.  There's also a new MacImage 2.0, but for $495 I'm not likely to find 
out what it does.  I'll certainly get SmartScrap/The Clipper and SuperGlue.  
Obviously ThunderScan comes with something like the Giffer display program 
archived at Sumex.

I haven't investigated graphic databases yet, although WetPaint looks like a 
good starter set.  I'll get used to the fonts I have, or can get free, before 
investing in something garish like World-Class Fonts or Fluent Fonts 2.0.  The 
Font Preview stack on SUMEX looks like a good utility for checking out freeware
fonts.

No one commented on Curator (II-compatible?) or PictureBase 1.2 for indexing 
clip art.  DAZZL makes something called ClipArt+.  The WetPaint database comes 
with the excellent Art Roundup browser DA; should I also get WetPaint's 
PictureBase option for $15 extra?

Slides:

MORE 1.1c is a good program and can be used for color presentations, but I can 
get by with just my editor and graphics program -- at least until MORE 2.0 
comes out in a few months.  I don't know how the Acta DA compares with More.  
PowerPoint is popular with some, but pricey; it does include SmartScrap though.
 Cricket Presents is good for making slides.  VideoWorks II is popular for 
preparing animated educational materials; it might be a good educational toy 
for my kids, especially with the VideoWorks HyperCard Driver.

Publishing:

PageMaker 3.0 is the standard in page layout, and therefore talks to everything
else.  ReadySetGo! 4.0 is smaller and easier to use. (Quark XPress is a more 
powerful -- and expensive -- program.) I really don't need any of these, at 
least until I have a PostScript laser printer.  I only need Glue (e.g., with 
MicroPhone II) and SuperGlue for tying graphics and word processing programs 
together.

No one offered information about Trapeze 2.0, which is a new combination 
spreadsheet and presentation program.  I think that means you can build 
formulas into your formatted document instead of copying data from a separate 
spreadsheet.  The program has an abundance of functions and graph formats, but 
is somewhat weaker than Excel on date functions.  Anyway, I don't really need a
spreadsheet or grapher.  If I did, I would also take a serious look at 
Parameter Manager Plus (II-compatible?), Cricket Graph, or the statistics 
programs.

PosterMaker Plus from Strider Software sounds like a winner for those of us 
with kids and without laser printers.  It's one way to get fancy fonts and 
layouts, as well as banners.  I've forgotten where I read about it; probably 
last week's MacWeek.

Databases:

HyperDA is too limited.  HyperCard 1.2 is in, although I'm going to wish I had 
a 5Mb machine.  I did get a recommendation of DAZZL's Organizer+ [from one of 
the developers].  Microsoft File is OK for simple lists. I don't know anything 
about FileMaker Plus yet (except that it's due for upgrade to version 4 in late
May), or Focal Point, QuickDEX, Record Holder Plus, or the ArchiText that's 
under development.

I'll just stick with HyperCard and vanilla text files for now.  (After all, 
that's why word processors have search commands.)  Some utilities for locating 
files by their contents are Findswell (a bit slow), Sonar 4.5, and the new 
Gofer.  The latter two offer boolean search connectives.

No one commented on Reports for HyperCard.  I haven't seen a review, but it 
looks like a useful tool.  I'll skip HyperBook Maker.  STAX offers some 
utilities -- HyperCard Helper and HyperCard Sound Effects Studio -- that look 
interesting.

Professional Bibliographic System is clumsy (and expensive).  I'll stick with 
HyperCard and/or LaTeX until something better comes along. No word yet on 
Publish or Perish.

Statistics:

StatWorks plus CricketGraph is a good low-cost statistical system. Systat is 
complex, fully loaded; I might need more disk space if I wanted to use it for 
serious data analysis.  There was a review of StatView II in a recent issue of 
Macintosh Today (that I haven't seen).  All of the above plus Stat80, Statfast,
Statpack, TrueStat, and WormStat were reviewed by R.S. Lehman in Statistics on 
the Macintosh, Byte, July 87, pp. 207-214. MacSpin 1.11 does work on the II, 
but is highly specialized.  StatSoft has just announced the MacSS statistical 
system with a "limited time" price of $119; I don't know how it compares to the
others.  DataDesk Professional may also be out soon.

I didn't ask for a discussion of equation solvers and numerical analysis 
programs like Eureka, Math View Professional, and Numerical Methods Tool Box.  
I hear that Mathematica (similar to SMP) is coming out, and so is a derivative 
of the APL language.  I presume that dozens of companies are wrapping Mac 
interfaces around existing scientific packages.

Programming:

The large MPW environment comes highly recommended.  Lightspeed C 2.15 
(upgraded from 2.01) is a worthwhile addition if I do much C coding, especially
if the promised version 3 has a debugger.  Otherwise the TMON debugger is an 
essential tool, although MacBugs is OK.  The Programmer's Extenders libraries 
are reported to be useful, but I won't need the CAPPs unless I have to write 
editor interfaces.  I don't need the MDS 68000 Development System since these 
other environments include assemblers. I don't know anything about the 
ExperTelligence development environment.

ResEdit is essential.  MacNosy was mentioned only as a way of getting around 
copy protection, and MacZap is much cheaper for that. (I think this is also a 
function of Hard Disk Util, but I was told that I wouldn't need it.  I don't 
grok CP patches and backups yet.)

Eventually I'll want to acquire software written in C or for C programmers, 
such as C++, RuleC, CLIPS, or microART.  There's a world of C code out there. 
I'll have to come up with the application before investing in the tools -- but 
isn't it funny how much easier it is to do things the other way 'round?

Allegro CommonLisp looks good, although it can't yet build standalone 
applications.  I'm told that a $99 subset called Pearl is comming out. 
ExperCommonLisp, which lacks typecasting, also comes in two versions; the $800 
one can build applications.  ISI Grapher is available for the Mac II with 
either supplier's product. No comments on Prologs.  One user of Terrapin Logo 
said he had been happy with it, and MacLogo was mentioned.

AAIS Prolog seems to be the default, although other Prologs have specific 
advantages.  AAIS can run APES, Augmented Prolog for Expert Systems, but I 
don't know whether that's worth doing.

One respondent expressed satisfaction with Terrapin Logo.  I have no reason to 
fault ExperLogo, MacLogo, or Object Logo.  Terrapin does offer some hooks to 
other languages.

APDA's unsupported $75 Smalltalk was also suggested, although the documentation
is very poor.  Parc Place markets a better Smalltalk, but at $1295 -- so get 
the 90% educational discount or forget it.

My kids will probably not be programming in C or Lisp for a long time. ZBasic 
is OK, although it can be crashed.  (The converter I mentioned translates MS 
Basic syntax into ZBasic.)  Unfortunately, Basic is known to cause brain 
damage.  HyperTalk is probably the best programming entry for the kids.

I've seen rumors of a HyperCard Construction Kit and a HyperEngine Development 
Kit for those wanting to build on HyperTalk.  I've already mentioned the STAX 
utilities.  There is also an expert-system shell called MacSMARTS ($195 list) 
that links to HyperCard.

Utilities:

The most highly recommended utilities are QuicKeys, DiskFit, Disk Express, 
MacZap, FEdit Plus (available as shareware), Suitcase or Font/DA Juggler Plus, 
and PowerStation.  People don't seem to have Stepping Out II yet, but at least 
there were no negative comments.  (It does slow some programs.)  QuicKeys needs
a 256K disk cache under MultiFinder to avoid a disk read on program switch.  
Some people prefer Tempo II for setting up macro sequences and Icon-It! for 
accessing them.  Other programs that were praised are MockPackage+, DiskTop, 
Fkey Manager, and QuickFolder (shareware INIT).  I don't need Copy II Mac (with
MacTools) or Hard Disk Util. No one commented on Disk Ranger, Battery Pak, Disk
Quick, Front Desk, or Top Desk, or contradicted my statement that Sidekick 2.0 
won't work on the II.

I'm starting to get a handle on all the disk utilities, although there is so 
much functional overlap between packages that no single system dominates.  
Someone should put all the best utilities in one package. Maybe they have:  
Symantec has just announced Symantec Utilities for Macintosh, or SUM, for June 
9 shipment at $99.95 (or $30 upgrade from MacZap).  This includes Guardian 
(some kind of disk index that allows quick crash recovery), HD TuneUp for disk 
compaction, Symantec Tools for data viewing and editing, QuickCopy for floppy 
duplication, HD Partition for speed and partition locking, HD Recover for crash
recovery, and a utility for virus protection.  Also a coupon for a free HFS 
Navigator or Laserspeed to the first 5,000 buyers.  Call (800) 888-0866 ext. 
751M, or (408) 446-994 for MacZap upgrade.

SUM aside, the following functional groupings seem reasonable. For backups, 
DiskFit 1.4 is the only way to go.  FlashBack was suggested as a useful 
complement to DiskFit backups, and HFS Backup was mentioned. StuffIt is also 
useful for archiving.

For disk compaction, Disk Express is the premier product.

MacZap 5.0 with Disc Clinic is the leading disk repair utility (and the basis 
of the SUM utility).  Other good tools are in Battery Pak (which includes Disk 
Tools), Disk First Aid, Fedit Plus, and MackPackage+.

There are a number of good packages for keeping track of disk files and 
printing labels.  Disk Ranger seems to be a favorite, but Disk Quick (formerly 
Disk Librarian), Disk Info (shareware), and MacDisk Catalog II 2.11 are also 
good.  As with most of the utilities, I don't know which of these are 
II-compatible, but anything that doesn't use real-time graphics or elaborate 
sounds is probably OK.

There is quite a selection of finders, launchers, folder utilities, etc. 
PowerStation and Suitcase are highly regarded.  HFS Navigator may have some 
advantages over PowerStation, and Font/DA Juggler Plus has at least a sound 
utility that Suitcase lacks.  MenuFonts 2 is handy for displaying font names in
their own styles.  Other programs (about which I know little) are DiskTop, Fkey
Manager, HFS Locator Plus, Launcher FKey (freeware), QuickFolder, and TopDesk. 
MultiSet 2.0 is a way of keeping multiple environments active.

People seem to like QuicKeys for organizing all this power.  Icon-It! is 
another approach, and one can get Icon Maker or the Color Icon Editor (on 
SUMEX) for designing new icons.  Tempo II is a useful macro system. I've 
forgotten what On Cue and SoundMaster do.

Other useful utilities are Stepping Out II for increasing screen size, Smart 
Alarms for appointment notifications, and RamDisk+ 2.07 for speed (at the risk 
of losing data during a crash).

MacSafe seems pretty straightforward; either you want to lock files or you 
don't.  Sentinal more expensive, presumably more elaborate.  NightWatch locks 
up the entire system, as do the LockOut utility that comes with MenuFonts and 
the Hard Disk Password program at SUMEX.  'NCryptor is the best of the 
commercial encryption packages, but there's plenty of freeware for encrypting 
files.

No one commented on the II-in-a-Mac software Apple II emulator, so I don't know
if it's II-compatible.  There is a DOS emulator called SoftPC for $595 from 
Insignia (5.25" disk drive not included) that may be even better than the DOS 
board that's available.  Come to think of it, though, I've got enough trouble 
without trying to buy/learn Apple II or DOS software.

Literature:

Reading is such an inexhaustable hobby!  The following are recommended: Inside 
Macintosh and the associated tech notes, development system support docs, and 
user interface guidelines; Scott Knaster's How to Write Macintosh Software and 
Macintosh Programming Secrets; Addison Wesley's Introduction to Macintosh 
Family Hardware and Introduction to Macintosh Programming; Chernicoff's 
Macintosh Revealed; and the HyperCard Scripting book. Goodman's HyperCard 
Handbook was disrecommended by one respondent.  (Maybe I need a thesarus 
program ...)

Incidentally, there's a Small Computer Book Club that's offering Macintosh 
Programming Secrets, The Complete HyperCard Handbook, HyperTalk Programmers' 
Guide, and Programming with the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop for $4.95 + 3 
purchases in 12 months.  I don't know how long delivery takes.

I should also subscribe to MacTutor Magazine (P.O. Box 400 (or 846?), 
Placentia, CA 92670; (714) 630-3730) and order the Best of MacTutor volumes 1 &
2 from them or from B. Dalton Bookstores - $30 each. I'm not sure if The 
Complete MacTutor Vol. 2 is the same thing. Anyway, MacTutor source code disks 
1-25 are available for $8 each. I should also join the Apple Programmers' and 
Developers' Association (APDA) (290 SW 43rd Street, Renton, WA 98055) for $35 
per year, and should investigate macserv@rice and macserv@irlearn as sources of
code by sending an "index" command.

There is a new monthly, Mac II Review, for $67 per year (240 Sunnyridge Ave., 
Bldg. 112-Dept. B, Fairfield, Conn. 06430; (203) 334-0334). MacWeek is free if 
you fill out their questionnaire.  I see MacUser as a good user-oriented 
magazine, Macweek as more vendor-oriented.  I haven't run across MacToday yet. 
There are a few articles in MicroTimes, Bay Area Computer Currents, Byte, etc. 
The Bay Area Users' Group (BMUG) publishes a 300-400 page newsletter twice a 
year.

Education:

No comments on Business Simulator, Chipwits, Puppy Love, MacRobots, Dinner at 
Eight, Japanese/Chinese tutorials, or other educational software. There is a 
MacFingerspeller for teaching American Sign Language (Microtech Consulting Co.,
Inc., 909 W. 23rd Street, Cedar Falls, Iowa 50613; (800) 992-SIGN; $29.95 for 
the talking version, $19.95 otherwise). I'm also told that there's an Esperanto
stack and one for learning Spanish conjugations.  Stackware seems to be 
developing as the premier source of preloaded databases.

Music:

Practica Musica runs on the Mac II, but Deluxe Music Construction Set doesn't. 
Studio Session 1.4 runs, but freezes on quit; use MultiFinder or another 
launcher to exit.  No one contradicted my statement that Music Mouse won't run,
and no one commented on Listen 2.0.  (MIDI software doesn't run on the II yet 
because of a stack-length problem, but I'm not into MIDI yet anyway.)

Games:

Popular Mac II games are Beyond Dark Castle, Beyond Zork, Crystal Quest, 
ShadowGate, Lode Runner (despite what MacUser reported), and Sargon III. No one
disputed that Balance of Power, Shanghai, Smash Hit Racquetball II, or Zork 
Trilogy would work.  Uninvited and Deja Vu probabably work. MacGolf 3.0 is just
now coming out.  Wizardry runs, but not under MultiFinder.  Chessmaster 2000 
has some bugs, crashes on exit.

I still have no information about II-compatibility for Battle Stations, 
Borrowed Time, Carmen San Diego, Down Hill Racer, Klondike, Mind Over Mac, 
Psion Chess, Quarterstaff (new version 1.2e), Real Poker, Seven Cities of Gold,
or Trust and Betrayal.

The Mac II cannot run Apache Strike, Dark Castle, Falcon, or OrbQuest. No one 
supported other games I said were not II-compatible: Archon, Ancient Art of 
War, Ferrari Grand Prix, Fokker Triplane, GATO, MS Flight Simulator, Ogre, 
Orbiter, Skyfox or Winter Games.  Ultima III probably doesn't work.

There are hundreds of public-domain games (e.g., Brickles on SUMEX); anybody 
got a catalog or description?  I've noticed ads for companies distributing PD 
software for about $20 per disk -- I presume that the same programs are 
available over the networks, but finding them and selecting is a pain.  Boston 
Computer Society was mentioned as one source of zillions of programs.  I have 
access to those at SUMEX.  We have some freeware at SRI (it took me 60 pages to
list the files!), and I've been told that (201) 340-3531 is a good place to 
start accessing the 80-or-so PD bboards.  Are there any good catalogs, 
handbooks, surveys, or descriptions available, or is it all word of mouth (and 
trial and error)?  I'm sure a users' group is just what I need, so I'll 
investigate when I get to Washington DC.

Vendors:

No particular caveats except for shipping delays and old versions of software. 
MacConnection was praised by several, MacWAREHOUSE by one. MacConnection is 
indeed at or exceedingly near the cheapest price on almost every package that 
they advertised.   (Possible exceptions are MicroPhone II, Coach, Cricket Draw 
and Graph, Egghead's special on PixelPaint, MORE 1.1c, ReadySetGo!, HyperBook 
Maker, Reports, Numerical Methods Tool Box, DiskFit 1.4, MacZap 5.0, QuicKeys, 
and MacSafe; even these might be due to version differences or to my comparing 
ads from different months.)  I'm amazed that many stores can charge $10 to $100
more than the nationally advertised price for every software package, even 
advertising in the same magazines.  Of course, it's not fair to buy by mail and
then expect service from a local store.

I've just begun to look at the freeware available to me; it may take me years. 
I prefer to work with commercial packages, although I may change my mind when I
become more familiar with the net (or when my wife takes away my checkbook).  
Someday I or my kids will get into the thrill of betaware testing, but for now 
I want no surprises.  Incidentally, if any of you have packages you'd like to 
sell at a discount, now would be a good time to make me an offer.

Well, thanks again.  I hope this list is of use to others.  The more

Mac II hackers, the better.

                                        -- Ken

Subject: DBMS callable from Hypercard

Please pardon my ignorance, but any help with the following would be

appreciated.

Does there exist, or is there information on, or even rumors about, a 
relational database management system for the Mac with the following 
characteristics?

1) It has some type of functional interface, so that I might call it from

   another program, in this case a Hypercard XCMD.  Many current systems seem 
   to force you to use their interface, rather than allowing you to build your 
   own.

2) It supports a reasonably complete query language. 3) It supports 
multi-attribute keys for a particular table.  (Lots of databases

   currently available seem to have problems with this one).  This is a MAJOR 
   requirement - for my application a system without it is useless.

4) It's not so slow that a user would complain while it grinds away for

   minutes on some reasonably trivial search.

Note that I DON'T need simultaneous multi-user capability, or a particularly 
interesting user interface (I won't use it), or many of the other bells and 
whistles lots of the new systems seem to have.

Thanks for your help,

I'm contemplating buying an accelerator board with a floating-point processor 
on it for my SE.  I run a bunch of data-analysis programs that I wrote myself 
and that take typically a half hour or so to process one batch of data.  I use 
Turbo-Pascal and Lightspeed C.  Is there any way I can tell these languages to 
generate code that can use the floating-point processor directly?  Even better,
is there some way that I can check for the co-processor and use it if it's 
there but use SANE if it isn't?  Is there a lesson in, for example, MacTutor 
about all this stuff? Do the boards usually come with replacement SANE 
routines?

Subject: D&D 4.1 and Hard drives

Hello again everyone...

Remember the Dollars and Sense 4.0 problem that I mentioned not too long ago? 
Well, the saga continues. On the suggestion of other people on the net (thanx 
for the info...shows the power of using the net) I called Monogram and asked 
them about 4.1 (which they never bothered to send me any info about). They said
that they could send me 4.1 free of charge, but I have to send them a copy of 
my receipt plus my registration before they send 4.1 to me. Seems kind of funny
that I had bought 4.0 just a month or so ago, and they couldn't confirm that I 
am a valid user. To top it all, they sent me v3.1 for the IBM rather than 4.1 
for my Mac. Sheesh!!! Well, I've sent the IBM version back, and hopefully they 
will send me the correct version for the correct PC this time.

By the way, I have a Dataframe XP 60 that I have a question about. Recently, I 
found that sometimes, programs would take a while before they would boot. There
seemed to be a lot of disk activity before the program would boot (doesn't 
matter which program). I found that my desktop was 160k. I thought that the 
large size of the desktop was the problem, and re-building it would solve the 
problem. Well, re-building brought the desktop down to about 109k, but that 
still didn't solve my problem. So I re-initialized the hard drive and re-loaded
everything (using diskfit). I thought that the fragmentation might be bad 
enough to be causing this, but even this didn't help. Any suggestions anyone?

Again, thanx in advance...

Even in a business where vaporware is a way of life, Tandy's surprise 
late-April announcement of the 550 Mbyte THOR-CD (Tandy High-Intensity Optical 
Recorder Compact Disk) rewriteable laser disk technology has been widely 
criticized.  Tandy's announced release date for an audio recorder version (at 
less than $500) of 18 to 24 months in the future already is regarded as 
optimistic, and a CD ROM version (at a considerably higher price) isn't 
expected before 1991, at least.  - PC Week 26 April and 17 May

Optical-Magneto for Fall 1988.

Maxtor, of San Jose, California, already has demonstrated two hybrid 
magneto-optic large capacity data drives which it plans to offer for sale this 
October.  The 160 Mbyte "Fiji" will retail for $1,995 and disks will be priced 
at $85.  The gigabyte "Tahiti" will have an access time nearly three times 
quicker than the Fiji with a price tag of $5,995 and $250 disks.  Sharp will 
introduce a 380 Mbyte SCSI magneto-optical drive early next year. - PC Week 17

Look Ma, No Coprocessor.

VM Technologies, a Tokyo-based joint venture of several Japanese PC companies, 
is designing a "breakthrough" CPU that will be able to emulate more than one 
competing 32-bit CPU.  VM claims to have pioneered a technique based on 
programmable logic arrays (PMAs) which will allow processor emulation microcode
to be downloaded.  The VM8600S will then be able to execute instructions in a 
manner identical to the emulated CPU.  VM is expected to ship sample quantities
of the VM8600S by the end of this year.  Manufacturers could use the chip to 
develop a microcomputer capable of being both a Macintosh and PS/2 (80386) 
clone.  - PC Week 17 May

Clone in Mac Clothing.

Six different Asian computer manufacturers are said to have developed Macintosh
clones which are awaiting copyright clearance for their ROMs.  In the meantime,
a few are making MS-DOS PC clones available in the Mac look-alike cases. - 
Random Access 14 May

PS/?

Only a handful of vendors showed PS/2 clones at last month's Comdex; none is 
ready to begin shipping product.  Among the reasons: 1) legal threats and 
licensing delays - IBM is requiring that potential PS/2 licensees pay royalties
on past sales of PC, XT, and AT clones, 2) sluggish demand - although IBM has 
shipped two million PS/2's, a substantial number of those machines remain in 
dealer inventories, and 3) enigmatic technology - Micro Channel architecture is
more complex than that in the original PC line, and IBM has labeled numerous 
PS/2 components as "reserved for future use," making it impossible to certify a
clone as "fully compatible."  - PC Week 17 May

Spin Control.

Earlier this Spring, IBM's Entry Systems Division president William Lowe 
announced to the press the firm's intent to replace the present Model 30 with 
an 80286 machine this year and an 80386 model by the end of next year (last 
March's column).  Last month, Lee Reiswig, director of IBM's Entry Systems 
Division laboratory in Austin, Texas affirmed the company's continuing 
commitment to 8086 machines.  Reiswig says IBM plans to "add functionality" 
rather than cut prices.  Major announcements are expected from Big Blue this 
month including the PS/2 Model 70, a desktop 80386 machine with at 20 MHz 
clock.  - PC Week 10 May and InfoWorld 16 May

Latest IIgs+ Rumors.

San Francisco AppleFest in September may be the time when a faster version 
(with 1 Mbyte of memory standard) of the IIgs (already rumored to be in the 
hands of select developers) will be announced.  Perhaps not, as rumors persist 
that some very senior Apple marketing managers want to deep-six the whole idea 
and concentrate as much energy as possible on the Macintosh line.  The 
introduction of the Apple CD ROM creates a problem for Apple's current ProDOS 
operating system which is unable to address a device with more than 64 Mbytes 
(two 32 Mbyte volumes).  The fix is said to be ProDOS/16 HFS which will port 
the Macintosh Hierarchical Filing System (HFS) to the IIgs.  As a side benefit,
the IIgs will be able to read and write disks in the Macintosh format.  A mid 
summer intro for the new ProDOS/16 is possible.  - Pro-Carolina.CTS (BBS) 6 May

The Alternate Interface.

IBM has signed an agreement with Metaphor Computer Systems for a joint 
development of a new software interface using graphics and icons.  The 
joint-venture might be a way to avoid dependency on Microsoft's Windows 
technology which is the subject of litigation by Apple. - Random Access 30

Ashton-Tate broke new vapor ground last month by issuing bug

fixes for dBase IV, a product that doesn't exist

Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.

Although some industry rumor mongers tout June as "NeXt month," when Steve Jobs
oft' rumored workstation will debut, others point out that software developers 
who had been planning demonstrations at this month's PC Expo have been told the
machine will not be available.  Odds are quoted at 9 to 5 that NeXt will not 
survive 1989 and 4 to 1 on 1990. - PC Week 19 April and 3 May and InfoWorld 16

Sun Rise.

More than 100 software companies have announced Unix versions of existing PC 
programs, including Lotus 1-2-3, that will be able to run on Sun's new 386i 
workstations. - PC Week 19 April

Color LCD.

Hatichi demonstrated a working color LCD display at Comdex last month.  A ten 
inch laptop version is expected to be offered for sale within 18 months.  No 
price estimates are available at present.  - PC Week 17 May

Video Capture.

Data Translation will offer an add-in card for the Mac II in July that allows 
users to display live-motion color video images.  Called the Colorcapture, the 
16-bit color card will display 640 by 480 pixel resolution in 32,768 colors.  
The product is intended for video production and advertising applications and 
will be priced at $2,995. - InfoWorld 9 May

AT Coprocessor for the Mac II.

Perfectek Corporation has announced an AT coprocessor board for the Mac II for 
August shipment.  The board will have a 12.5 MHz one wait-state CPU, 1 Mbyte of
RAM, and IBM compatible parallel and serial ports.  The price is expected to be
about $1,500 (subject to fluctuating DRAM prices). - InfoWorld 16 May

Multiprocessor Workstation.

In response to an Air Force RFP (Request For Proposals), Zenith is developing a
15 MIP computer expected to use as many as five 25 MHz Intel 80386 processors. 
The operating system will be a custom version of Unix V.  Commercial versions 
of this workstation are expected to retail for "considerably less than 
$20,000."  - PC Week 17 May

Faster Macintosh II.

The good news is that a single DMD 29000 coprocessor add-in board from Yarc 
Corporation will make a Mac II capable of 17 MIP performance and that four such
boards could boost speed to as much as 68 MIPS.  The bad news is that the 
coprocessor does not run standard Macintosh software.  Yarc already is working 
with developers to write graphics programs and other processor intensive 
applications for the board which will be shipped with 2.5 Mbytes of RAM and 
will retail for $4,295. - InfoWorld 9 May

Power in the Next Decade.

Data General and Motorola have announced a joint development pact to produce a

(see the April and May columns) by 1991.  - InfoWorld 25 April

New Laptop Technology.

In six to nine months NEC will be ready to market an 80286 laptop computer

announced a revolutionary new method of converting radio waves into electrical 
energy. The company says they are developing a laptop computer that will be 
powered by radio waves and won't need a battery. - PC Week 17 May and Random

HP's Printer Control Language (PCL).

Hewlett-Packard marketing manager Bill McGlynn is quoted as saying that the PCL
language used in the firm's popular Laserjets will not be upgraded to compete 
with Adobe's Postscript.  The next version of PCL, Level 5, is scheduled for 
shipment this Fall.  Level 5 will mimic some of the popular features of 
Postscript but will fall far short of Postscript's high-end functionality.  -

Laser Typesetter.

Lasermaster Corporation plans to begin shipping a 2,400 dots per inch laser 
typesetter within the next two months.  The LM-Typemaster will incorporate 
drivers for Ventura Publisher and Aldus Pagemaker, making it possible to 
produce high-quality, camera-ready output with PC desktop publishing software. 
The printer will have 4 Mbytes of RAM upgradable to 8 Mbytes and will cost 
approximately $30,000. - InfoWorld 25 April

Microsoft's Macware Plans.

Microsoft has plans to enhance the firm's entire line of Macintosh software 
during the next 12 months.  Word 4.0 will include full WYSIWYG, enabling

There is a known problem if the "Allow Background Tasks" feature under the 
Options menu is checked.   All should work if it's unchecked.

Alternately, 1.40B, just a bug fix for that, is available as of this writing, 
from  GEnie,CIS,MacNET.....  By this afternoon, that'll include Delphi also.

If you do not need the feature, 1.40A works fine if it's unchecked.

The problem occurs under System 5.0 (the collective numbering for 4.2) and 
MultiFinder OR the new System 6.0 (collective numbering)

I neglected releasing a fix until yesterday (5/28) because I only had a beta of
System 6.0.  I wanted to make sure it worked with the "real" 6.0 first.

Sorry for the inconvenience.  I'd suggest that you mail me a copy of any 
problems you may have...I do not keep up with news.  Feel free to spread the 
information.

Subject: Macs on planes

Reply-to: Henry@AI.AI.MIT.EDU

I have taken my Mac on airplanes many times, but it is still somewhat risky to 
do so.  I've never been prevented from flying with it, but I have had a few 
close calls.  The problem is that although the Mac [old Mac with small 
keyboard] will fit under many airline seats, it will NOT fit under ALL such 
seats.  Example: on a DC-9, it will fit under the aisle and center seats but 
not under the window seat.  Try to find out what kind of aircraft it is before 
choosing your seat assignment. [Perhaps some one will get inspired to make a 
survey of different aircraft and report the results here].  On a DC-10 or 747, 
it will [usually] fit into the overhead bin, but this is risky, especially on 
crowded flights since others may have filled the bin with baggage by the time 
you get to it, leaving no room for the Mac. Flight attendants often object to 
leaving it in the closet up front.  On commuter hops with small planes, there 
may be no space for it at all.  The worst problems happen when several people 
on the plane have brought Macs or other computers or bulky baggage, so I would 
not recommend carrying one if you can avoid it when you're flying to something 
like MacWorld.  If you ask the airlines, they will always say no, since the 
regulations say they don't have to accept luggage as big as the Mac, and they 
want to discourage you from carrying it.

Subject: windows for hypercard

From: duggie@jessica.Stanford.EDU

Jeff Skastis <skaistis@SLEEPY.CC.UTEXAS.EDU> writes:

I've written a window that does this.  It supports multiple, resizable windows 
with color pictures, text, or dialogs in them.  However, it is rather large and
complex, consisting of a large XCMD, a special WDEF, and a system patch.  
Depending on your needs you might get by with less.

The problems I had were how to keep Hypercard active, how to draw stuff in the 
window including scroll bars and the grow box), how to detect events in the 
window and inform hypercard, how to move, show, zoom windows etc, and how to 
handle hiding windows when multifinder switched out hypercard.

I decided to use a patch to GetNextEvent.  In another version, I tried using 
jGNEFilter, but multifinder ignores it (bug or feature?) and when I asked Apple
they suggested I stick with the patch. This took care of most of my problems.  
Most of the actual code, however, resides in the WDEF, not the patch-- the 
patch just dispatches to it.

It turns out that Hypercard stops listening to the mouse when it gets a 
deactivate event.  My hack for solving this problem was to not pass deactivate 
events to windows that were not my windows or DA windows. Hypercard then 
remains active all the time.  Occasionally there are problems because 
highlighting in hypercard's message box remains even though my window is 
getting keypress events, but basically this works.

To draw stuff in the window, I pass update events to the XCMD and let the 
window determine what to draw.  The window draws structure-like items (scroll 
bars and grow box) and then whatever other data it has.

To detect events, I take keypresses and mouse clicks and pass them to the WDEF 
as well.  My WDEF has an 'event queue' for each window, plus a mask to 
determine whether to queue the event.  The events are not the same as toolbox 
events, but a bit more high-level-- window moved, window resized, close or zoom
box pressed, button pressed, etc.  If an event is queued, I post the relevant 
data to the window's queue (timestamp, mouse location, button id or whatever) 
then return a function key event via the GNE patch.  Each window is assigned a 
function key to use for reporting events, this makes it easier for a script to 
determine which window has the event.  My scripts keep a list of window 
addresses (returned by the XCMD when it creates the window) and the function 
key is the index of the address in the list. So to complete the reporting of 
the event, the script, on receipt of a function key event, gets the window 
address from the list and makes calls the XCMD asking for the next event for 
that window.  The XCMD returns a string representing the 'event record.'  Since
this is mostly all compiled code, this process is quite fast.  Hypercard is by 
far the slowest link.  I use this to put up confirmation dialogs (using 
hypercard's answer command) when the user clicks in the close box of a window.

The XCMD and WDEF work together to handle commanding the windows from hypertalk
scripts.  The XCMD parses a command string to determine the data to pass to the
WDEF, supplying defaults where appropriate (when changing text parameters, for 
instance, any that are not provided default to their existing values).  It 
builds a record and then calls the WDEF proc passing a pointer to this record 
rather than an event, and passing a special command code (not one of the 
existing WDEF codes).  The WDEF then takes over, resizing or scrolling the 
window, adding or removing gadgets like the zoom and close boxes, tracking the 
grow box, or whatever.

Hiding windows is handled by the patch, since Hypercard 1.2 has no script 
handlers for multifinder application switched events.  This is currently a 
hack-- I get the head of the window list from a low memory global, build an 
array of windows, then walk through it hiding all of those that are of my type.
 Since hidewindow changes the window list, I can't just walk through the list. 
Restoring windows is done in the opposite way.  Unfortunately, I don't record 
the previous window array, and hypercard shows and hides its own palette 
windows, so I have no way to restore the exact order of windows that existed 
before hypercard got switched out.

Anyway, this should be enough info.  Stanford owns my window XCMD or I'd post 
it.  Perhaps they will release it eventually. By then, probably Hypercard will 
support multiple windows.  That will obviate most uses of my XCMD except for 
the color picture, scrolling, and zooming support.  Creating windows for 
Hypercard was remarkably easy, considering how much mucking around under 
Hypercard I had to do.

NO, It is still here, even in Finder 6.1 (System Software Vresion 6.0), but it

is not the default.

If you want to set it up, call ResEdit (mine is 1.2d1), open the Finder, open 
the LAYO resource, open the only one which is in it (id 0 I guess). Look for 
the: "Title Click" (or something like that) field, and set it to yes (or 1).

And it works very fine. This one of these hidden goodies features of the

Finder.

In fact, I think that the guy ou wrote Layout (nice piece of code), a shareware
which enable you to set up some parameters of the LAYO resource (mainly, 
spacial layout) should upgrape his program to take into account the new slots 
which appears lately.

Hope it helps,

Felix

Re: Info-Mac Digest vol 6, #54

Smalltalk for the Mac II

Apple Smalltalk v0.4 is compatible with the Mac II and runs reasonably well, 
given its pre-release status.  It is an implementation of Smalltalk-80 based 
upon the Xerox License 1 system, ie. it has no multiple inheritance and a 
slightly different class structure from the License 2 system as described in 
the Addison-Wesley books.  It also runs on Mac Plus and SE machines although 
somewhat slowly.  It is not MultiFinder compatible and really wants more than 
1Meg to function; I run it in 2Meg with good results. Available from APDA for 
$75 currently.

Apple Smalltalk v1.0 is rumored to be available somewhere around the end of the
year and is allegedly a License 1 system with a MacApp based interface 
paradigm, diverging from the MVC interface of Xerox/ParcPlace Systems (see next
note) Smalltalk.  I know little more of this at this time.

ParcPlace Systems of 2400 Geng Road, Palo Alto, CA is a spinoff from the 
Smalltalk founding group of Xerox PARC.  They have excellent Smalltalk-80 
implementations available for Sun, Apollo, Hewlett/Packard and Macintosh Plus, 
SE, and II computers at the present time.  Their Smalltalk-80 systems are full 
implementations of the Xerox License 2 systems described in the Addison-Wesley 
books, with many enhancements.  The Mac based systems are designed for a 
minimum 2.5Meg RAM configuration and include basic, extended and developer 
systems with full support for the Mac II color capabilities. They are 
MultiFinder compatible, assuming sufficient RAM.  Unaccelerated Mac Plus and SE
systems are quite useable and the Mac II system is benchmarked at 108 Dorado 
(the Smalltalk Dorado reference is 100).  These systems are code compatible 
across hardware platforms to a very high degree.

Word Perfect for Mac

I have a copy of the Word Perfect betaware and the final release 1.0 product.  
It works, has many features, and I think it is the worst word processor for the
Mac I have ever seen.

Never before, for a Mac word processor, has it been ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED to have
the manual open on the desk to get beyond the simplest operations of the 
program.  This seems a terrible kludge and a level of complexity simply 
uncalled for.  Even Word is elegant and simple by comparison.

I heartily suggest choosing some other word processer if such exists to

meet your requirements.

Subject: VCR for Mac II?

Does anyone know of an editing video cassette recorder which works off a

Mac II?  Here's what I want to do:

(1) Generate individual frames on a color Mac II.  The time to generate a

single frame may be long (> 1 minute).

(2) Record each frame on a VHS VCR.  This involves backing up the tape 
sufficiently, starting the tape movement, recording the Mac II frame on one or 
more successive frames on the tape, stopping the tape.  The recording should be
triggered by the Mac II, so it can be left unattended.

(3) Take the completed tape and play it back at full speed on a standard TV

set (and optionally play it back the Mac II).

The key point is that the time taken to generate the frames is long.  So a VCR 
which merely converts the Mac II video signal into NTSC format and records that
is no good.

Subject: Help with grafports.

Does anyone know where I can get some samples of code to draw in an offscreen 
grafport?  I don't quite understand the info about SetPortBits. I am trying to 
draw something offscreen in order to read the image using some code I wrote. I 
don't want the user to see the image as I scan it.  I tried setting up a wind 
ow that was invisible but found the data that I scanned was not actually there.
When I made the window visible the data scanned by my routine was exactly what 
I needed but alas the image was visible to the user.  I thought of maybe moving
the window to say -10000,-10000 but would prefer to not risk someone with a mac
ii seeing the image.  There must be a way to draw into a port but not have it 
go to the screen.  Thanks in advance for any help.  I guess the problem is how 
to set up the call to SetPortBits.

/thanks

Subject: 3D graphing

    Are there any inexpensive programs that can do 3D graph? I'd like to give 
it a function z=f(x,y) and a domain and get a nice graph.  (If it could handle 
parametric equations that would be even better.) I know about MathView 
Professional, but I'm looking for something simpler (this kind of graphing is 
all I need) and cheaper.

Subject: SMTP mail for Mac's

   Has anyone got, seen or heard of a mail program for SE's or +'s that will 
   talk SMTP over a tcp/ip link ? We're about to link up our 30 odd Mac's via 
   Appletalk and then connect that to our Sun net (probably via TOPS) and would
   like to find a mail system so that our macusers do not have to learn either 
   Un*x or VM-ess, as at present.

   Surely somebody out there has done this at least once ? If not, would anyone
   like to speculate on how much work it would be to produce one ? After all, 
   SMTP is pretty simple, and the tcp/ip side could probably be considered 
   transparent.

   please reply direct - I don't subscribe because I can't handle

   the volume this list puts out....

Subject: Floppy Disk in a Monitor?

Desktop real estate (on real desks, I mean) is always precious; so is peace and
quiet.  Your hard disk should go under your desk or in a closet, out of sight, 
out of sound, and out of the way.  Your main circuit board, power supplies, 
anything that whines or requires a fan might as well go there also.

But everybody needs a floppy drive at hand, at least once in a while.  So why 
doesn't anyone provide a floppy disk drive _built into a monitor_?  The 
monitor/floppy drive, mouse, and keyboard on your desk -- everything else out 
of sight (and, ideally, _one_ cable from the desk to everything else).

Subject: Desktop Interface Idea: Folder Menus

One way to make searching through a set of folders, or a nested set of folders,
a lot easier:  Let each folder have a sensitive spot -- maybe the little index 
flap at the upper left -- such that if you click and hold there, a narrow 
vertical menu opens up (running from top to bottom of the screen if necessary) 
showing just the names of all the items in that folder, alphabetical order.  
The view could be like "View by Name", but no size, type or date info, just the
item names.

Merely being able to scan instantly what was in the folder, without having to 
open it, would be a big help.  Even better, suppose you could scan down this 
menu in usual fashion, and if you released on any item, that item would be 
opened, _without opening the enclosing folder itself_. You could move down thru
a nested set of folders in a big hurry this way. Even if this capability were 
limited to folders (not documents or applications) it would be a big help.

The following is from comp.binaries.mac:

[SoundMaster 1.1 cdev]

SoundMaster is a shareware Control Panel device from Bruce Tomlin, and is a 
godsend to those of you who like to have various Mac sounds replaced with your 
very own digitized sounds.  The various features include:

       o   Specific sounds for the following operations

*  Startup

*  Shutdown

*  Restart

*  Disk Eject

*  Disk Insert

*  Bad Disk

*  System Beep

*  Key Click

       o   Plays SoundCap, SoundWave, and SoundEdit files at ALL 4 SAMPLING

RATES!  (No more 22 kHz startup sounds...).  It does not read snd

resources.

       o   Individual volume settings for each sound.

       o   Each sound can be stored anywhere in or under the System Folder.

       o   You can play the sounds inside SoundMaster, to test for the right

sampling rate.

This has allowed me to dump CheapBeep, SoundInit, ShutdownSound, MacII, MacPuke
and MacFeedMe.  VERY handy, and I've had no problems with it.

Standard Disclaimer:  I have no connections with Bruce Tomlin, other than

ResTools is a Resource Compiler/Decompiler.  Resource descriptions are entered

Subject: BroadCast 0.5b3

BroadCast is a chooser device that contains both a message sender and receiver 
to allow exchange of simple messages via AppleTalk. It allows you to send a 
message of the type

   "Hey Phil, there is a call for you!"

   "Can someone please fill up the paper tray of LaserWriter xy?"

   "I need some assistance..."

to all or some users within any zone of your AppleTalk.

Installation is by moving the file into the system folder. To use it, open the 
chooser and select the BroadCast icon. Select the zone/ users you want to send 
a message to and click ok (shortcut for all users in one zone: all), and you'll
be prompted for the message text, which may consist of up to three lines. You 
may select the icon to be sent by clicking on the icon. After clicking on Ok, 
BroadCast will attempt to send the message. (BroadCast can't guarantee delivery
and there is no error message if it fails - at least currently.)

The distribution includes the protocol specification, which allows you to 
implement BroadCast on other hosts. A version of BroadCast based on CAP is 
under development.

BroadCast is copyrighted but free. It may be redistributed as long it is not 
sold - either standalone or included in another package.

BroadCast is available from SUMEX (I hope RSN), and by sending mail to 
RY77@DKAUNI11.BITNET. Mail bug reports and/or questions to joachim@ira.uka.de

Macintosh Kermit Version 0.9(40)

This is to announce Macintosh Kermit 0.9(40), by Paul Placeway of Ohio State 
University and Matthias Aebi of ECOFIN Research and Consulting, Ltd, Zuerich. 
MacKermit 0.9(40) runs on all Macs except the 128K original.  If you have a 
128K Mac, you should keep version 0.8(34), the last formal release.

As of 0.9, MacKermit has been translated into Apple MPW C, so that it can be 
edited, compiled, and built on the Macintosh itself.  This translation was 
based on work by Jim Noble of Planning Research Corporation, who converted 
MacKermit 0.8(34) from SUMACC C (which had to be cross-compiled on a UNIX 
system) to Megamax C.  Matthias converted Jim's version to MPW C, and he also 
added many of the new features listed below.  After that, Paul Placeway 
integrated the program with version 4E of C-Kermit and added additional new 
features, also shown below.

   - Long packet support

   - The cursor with open desk accessories now works correctly

   - New program icon

   - New settings files are no longer TEXT

   - Settings can now be written back to an already existing settings file - 
   Key redefinition function built in to Kermit, no more CKMKEY - Server mode 
   directory listing feature - Multifile (folder) send - Server "Delete" file 
   command - Server "Space" command - Get whole folder content from the server 
   with filename ":" - Support of menu command keys (key macros) - Terminal 
   settings dialog separated from communication settings - Non-transparent 
   terminal mode - Display of statistics and protocol version to "About Kermit"
   dialog - Parity problems fixed - More efficient file transfer in many cases,
   especially when parity in use - Session logging (screen capture) - 
   Transaction logging - Multifinder support - Additions to the VT102 emulator 
   (smooth scrolling, etc) - Rearrangement of menus and displays - Program no 
   longer hangs if remote response window gets too full - Program now works 
   correctly on 64K ROM machines - A new manual

The new files are among those in KER:CK*.* on CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU, available via
anonymous FTP, and on BITNET, as CK* * from KERMSRV at CUVMA.  In particular:

   CKMKER.HQX is the MacKermit application, in BinHex Version 4 format 
   CKMKER.DOC is the new Kermit User Guide chapter for MacKermit CKMKER.MSS is 
   the Scribe source for the manual chapter

If you would like sources, the files you need (using Unix notation for brevity)
are: CK[CMU]*.[CHRW], that is, all files whose names start with CK, followed by
C, M, or U, and then some more characters, with a filetype of C, H, R, or W.  
You also need the file CKMMAK.*, the "makefile" in BinHex v4 format.

The previous version, 0.8(34), will be retained (without source) as CKM834.*

and CKMKEY.HQX for use on 128K Macs.

Thanks to all the Info-Kermit readers who have been beta-testing different 
pre-releases of this program since last October.  And many thanks to Paul and 
Matthias for putting this release together and making it available.  Please 
report any problems to Info-Kermit-Request@CU20B.

compilers, although virtually nothing about the integration of the compilers 
into the Mac environment. All tests were run on an upgraded 68020/881 Mac+ with
Novy systems board. This gives about Mac II speed. Table entries are always, 
top to bottom, DCM Mactran, Absoft, and Lang. SYS. With that said, the results:

*On the whetstone test, the results are given in units of "whetstones" that 
reflect have many floating point operations were done. On the whetstone test, a
larger number means FASTER execution. All other execution times are in seconds,
where, of course, smaller number means faster.

Strictly by the numbers, Absoft is a clear winner on 7 of 9 tests, ties one and
loses whetstone speed slightly to DCM Mactran 77. But, the numbers don't tell 
all. Absoft's bugginess is legendary. Their small code size is because their 
philosophy is to put zero support for the Mac environment in the runtime 
package; for example, the default runtime window is a simple "glass tty". If 
you want Mac features, you must do it yourself.

DCM suffers from the staggering 155K runtime library which is "dumb-linked" 
into your code. Thus, "hello, world" takes 156K. They even force you to carry 
the software floating point libraries around when you generate hardware 
floating point! No excuse for this, in my opinion. To be fair, part of the size
is Mac environment stuff in the runtime libs.

MPW fortran (language systems) is slowest on compile and is intermediate in 
code size. I think they hit the correct balance on code size, but need to work 
on the compile speed. They are competitive on Sieve, lose big on whetstone, and
actually win Linpack (12.37 secs to Absofts 12.44). Lotta bugs still in the 
beta compiler, however.

Easily the worst thing with all 3 compilers is the bugs. Folks on this net are 
well aware of the sad history of the Absoft compiler, but I also found code 
that DCM Mactran wouldn't compile which Absoft would. Lang. sys. compiler is 
still (beta, remember, I wanna be fair) easy to crash, either during compile or
at runtime.

Bottom line for me: I am sticking with Absoft compiler, since I think I know 
most of the things to avoid at this point. Neither of the alternatives shows 
(yet) enough improvement for me to switch. Absoft will have a significantly 
improved 2.4 release in late summer, with a lot of bug fixes, so I am going to 
wait and see. If 2.4 doesn't fix known problems, then I will think again  about
changing compilers.

Subject: tired of xbin dumping core ?? here is a fix.

if you use xbin on your UNIX-box to unhexify archived Macintosh files, you, 
probably, know that every so often xbin dumps core.

this is, usually, caused by the fact that the name of the file which xbin is 
trying to create contains characters which are not legal under UNIX.

this can be fixed why modifying xbin so that it does

not try to create files with illegal characters.

below follows a diff-file of the necessary C-source changes to the xbin 
source-code (which can be found in the archives at SUMEX and, probably, on your
machine somewhere, if the executable is available)

This file is created by Aplle's HD Backup program.  I t keeps track of files

Subject: Sound cdev patch

For those of you receiving Apple's System 6.0, you might dislike the small size
of the Sound cdev's selection window, as I did.  You can enlarge this with a 
couple of simple patches.  This is, of course, not recommended, so beware.

Open the Sound file with a disk editor and change

   0095 0062

      to        0095 00FD

      and       009E 0054

      to        009E 00F1

What you are doing is to enlarge two DITL items in the Sound resources. This is
a bit difficult to do in ResEdit due to the layering of other DITL items.  I 
used DeRez and Rez to change them and then compared them to get the patches 
since I can't distribute a modified piece of Apple's software.

Subject: BroadCast's shutdown feature

I got several mails concerned about the possibility to turn off

a Macintosh remotely. Calm down...

*** NO ONE CAN SHUTDOWN YOUR MACINTOSH UNLESS YOU ALLOW TO ! ***

The shutdown mechanism is a runtime option, available on Mac IIs only. If used 
on Mac 512, +, SE only the shutdown dialog will be presented, power will remain
on. There is a flag in the BroadCast globals called "shutdownenabled", that if 
true will allow shutdown messages to be processed. A shutdownmessage is simply 
an empty message.

*** NOTE THAT THIS FLAG IS OFF BY DEFAULT - YOU NEED A PROGRAM TO

   SET IT (or enter the debugger) ! ***

The user interface of BroadCast makes no provision to enable or send such 
messages, as it has been implemented for use in our lab - used by undergrad 
students to learn programming - it allows the operators to turn all machines 
collectivelly off. A special program is required to enable/send these type of 
messages, ON BOTH MACHINES.

The feature is useless in a standard environment where the user should have 
complete control over the machine. I can't imageing that you'll need this 
feature. I mail you this information, that you get the feeling that none is 
able to shur your machine off without your consent.

Please mail all questions/suggestions/bugs to one of the addresses below, use

JJ_kramer@fandm > Consultant -- Franklin and Marshall College > Funny thing.  I
had to do the same thing yesterday.  Here is my best solution.

0.  Put a beer in the fridge.

1.  On the ][, load Appleworks and bring the file up on the desktop.  Hit 
open-apple-P and choose the last alternative on the menu, namely, print to 
disk.  Make up a new file name and supply its full path name when Appleworks 
asks for it.  The file will be printed to disk in the Apple ]['s funny version 
of ASCII.

2.  Get yourself an Apple ][ telecommunications program.  Figure

out whether it runs under Prodos or DOS 3.3.

3.  If the telecommunications program runs under DOS 3.3, use the PRODOS 
utilities to convert the file you created in step 1 to DOS 3.3.

4.  Start the telecommunication program in the ][ and load a telecommunications
program (like miniterm or Red Ryder) on your mac.

5.  Hook the two machines together using modems or a null modem cable.  (How to
make a null modem cable:  Plug the Apple ][ imagewriter cable into the 
"telephone" jack on the back of the Apple ][.  Plug a regular modem cable into 
the "telephone" jack on the back of the mac.  Hook the two cables together with
a female-female gender gender changer.  [How to make a female- female gender 
change:  Go down to Radio Shack ... .])

6.  Set the two programs to communicate at the highest possible

speed allowed by the programs/modems.

7.  Start a text capture on the mac.  Have the Apple ][ transmit the file you 
created in Step 1, or the one you created in Step 3. (DO NOT USE AN ERROR 
CORRECTING PROTOCOL FOR THIS TRANSFER.) When the file has been sent, close the 
text capture on the mac.

8.  On the mac, get into MacWrite and open the file you captured

in Step 7.

9.  Open the beer you put in the fridge in Step 0.  It's probably

cold by now.

Hope this helps.

In an earlier message, I wrote that the Dimmer CDEV for the Mac ][, which is by
Chris DeRossi of Apple, is incompatible with the new system release (6.0).

Further investigation has shown that the incompatibility comes about as a 
result of an interaction between Dimmer and the MacroMaker. You can use one or 
the other, but not both. Of course, since Dimmer is a Mac-][-only CDEV, this 
applies only to Mac ][s.

Subject: Bill Gates in Copenhagen

Bill Gates (CEO of MicroSoft) was in Copenhagen yesterday and gave a talk on 
his views of the future in the IBM PC sector. He promoted graphical user 
interfaces and windows very heavily and tried to get everybody to jump on that 
bandwagon.

One of the major points of his presentation was a demo of PC-Excel which was 
indeed nice and has some features not in the present Mac version. Of most 
interest for this newsgroup may be the fact that Gates pointed to Excel as the 
exemplary application for the new hoped-for consistent user interfaces on the 
PS/2 (i.e. the same role as that played by MacWrite in the Mac world). On the 
basis of my experience at a recent ACM workshop on consistency,I asked Gates 
what other methods they would use to ensure consistent user interfaces. The 
answer was not really satisfactory but included a "MS Windows style Guide" (= 
Apple Human Interface Guidelines ??)

It certainly seems that the OS/2 will take people down somewhat the

same road as that travelled by Mac users.

call at end of drvrCtl DA routine

Anyone,

   For a while now, I've been using an ending to the drvrCtl desk accessory 
routine that was supplied with my MDS development package.  That ending, rather
than simply returning, calls the low-level Device Manager routine IODone 
(pointed to by the JIODone global variable) before returning.  I've been 
blindly keeping this in all my DA sources without really knowing its purpose.  
I assume that who ever wrote the sample DA for the MDS development system knew 
what he or she were doing when they added this call.  All I can figure is that 
the call somehow clears the IO Request sent to the DA from the driver IO Queue 
so that other devices won't receive the request (since they needn't bother with
it, I guess).  Does anyone know anything about this?  Is it safe to continue 
using this call, or can it have bad side effects on anything?

Does anyone know if the Ethernet cards for PC's (3-COM) can access

Appleshare on a MAC via Ethertalk?

Details:

10 PC's w/ Ethernet Cards (3-COM)

10 MAC's w/ Ethernet Cards (Apple or Kinetics)

   2 MAC's w/ Appleshare, Lasershare

   1 Kinetics FastPath

   2 Apple Laserwriters on Localtalk (through Fastpath)

   3 Mac's on Localtalk (through Fastpath)

I know there are Appletalk cards for the IBM-PC, but we already have Ethernet 
cards. Any other comments are appreciated. Please respond directly, I will post
the response.

Subject: Telnet problems - Help!

Would anybody out there have any experience in telnetting to the VAX 8530 using
NCSA Telnet from Kinetics ? The configuration used is:

AppleTalk to Ethernet via the Kinetics FastPath gateway, NCSA Telnet(v2.1) for 
telnetting to a VAX8530 running a TCP/IP package (v3.0) from Wollongong, VMS 
(v4.7) and All-in-one.

My problem is in the terminal emulation provided by the NCSA Telnet; it allows 
me to log in to the VAX but then it hangs shortly after that. When I try to get
into All-in-one, I get QIO ERROR.  I've tried contacting the developer but they
are rather slow getting back (if at all!) if anybody can help please email me 
directly to the BitNet address below.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: New Mac user questions

Mac users:

I was finally lured into the Mac world recently (via a 2-floppy SE) and I'd 
like to begin immediately using it to dial up the CS computers (via 2400 baud).
 I have a few McNovice questions:

1. What communications software should I be using? I used to run a public 
domain VT100 emulator on a PC; there must be something similar for the Mac? 
Pointers, offers to help acquire public domain programs, etc.  would be greatly
appreciated.

2. A related technical question:  I've become quite attached to having 3 or 4 
windows logged in to the same machine on my RT.  It would be wonderful if there
existed some stripped down X emulator, or some clever wasy of using 
multifinder, or whatever, that made use of multiple windows on the Mac. Wishful
thinking?

3. One of the big draws (if you'll pardon the pun) for me was the availability 
of wonderful graphics programs, so I can illustrate my presentations and papers
with pretty pictures and diagrams.  The plan is to upload the postscript file 
(via Kermit, I guess?) and include it in a LaTex source.  Any advice about good
programs, (I've had some experience with MacDraw, MacPaint, and SuperPaint), 
and about this process in general, would also be appreciated.  HyperCard (which
came with my Mac), seems to have some graphics capabilities.  Is this adequate 
for the task?

Thanks,

Rick

I have had a Bering 1220C drive (20 megabyte Miniscribe and 20 megabyte 
removable cartridge system-Bernoulli technology) and am submitting a 
questionnaire to others with a similar device:

Have you had compatibility problems (system crashes when you attempt to move a 
folder/file from one disk to another) with a Mac SE or Mac II when you connect 
the 1220C with one other SCSI device?  Were these problems resolved after 
receiving version 2.10 of the Totem driver? Have you lost information as a 
result of these system crashes?

Have you ever removed the MiniScribe to determine if it contains SCSI 
terminator packs?  If so, did you find the packs or did you find the locations 
where they had been soldered?

If you have had problems, have you resolved your

problems with Bering?  If so, would you elaborate on the

details of the settlement?

=========================================================

The reason for my questionnaire is due to the fact that I have had problems 
with my Totem device for a year: it was incompatible with my Jasmine Direct 
Drive 80.  Three months ago, I sent my device to Bering for evaluation; the 
problem was attributed as being an "anomaly". However, I resolved the issue of 
incompatibility after talking to a fella who will be writing device drivers for
Jasmine.  Last week, after a few simple tests, he concluded the Totem had an 
internal SCSI pack. Yesterday, I had a friend open the Totem unit and remove 
the MiniScribe.  He found that Bering had forgotten to remove the packs from 
the Miniscribe (realize that each Bering kit includes an external terminator --
but there is NO mention of an internal SCSI resistor pack  in the Totem 
manual).

Today, I advised Bering of my discovery: their technical support personnel 
stated that having 3 SCSI terminators (Mac II has an internal terminator, there
is the terminator in the MiniScribe, and the internal resistor packs inside the
Jasmine) does not necessarily cause crashes.  Yet, when I talked to the 
manufacturer of MiniScribe, they stated that it would.  And, of course, the 
ANSI standard specifically states there are to be only two SCSI terminators -- 
one at the beginning and another at the end of the chain.

At this point, I am bothered with Bering's response for several reasons:  1) I 
have received dis-information regarding SCSI devices, particularly with the 
assertion that having 3 SCSI is not necessarily the reason for the system 
crashes that have occurred for the past year.  2) As a result of two crashes, I
have lost historical documents (ironically, each crash occurred as I was 
backing my Jasmine Direct Drive 80 to the Totem removable cartridge).  3)  That
I had invested $2,000+ in a piece of hardware that has remained idle for the 
better part of a year as being an "anomaly".

I am distrustful of Bering at this point -- the purpose of my questionnaire is 
twofold:  1)  if anyone is having problems with their Totem drive, check for 
internal resistors.  2)  Has anyone else felt the "run around" from Bering 
technical support.

Reply-to: "Charles E. Bouldin" <bouldin@sed.ceee.nbs.gov>

I am trying to dump a postscript file to a Varitype 600 dpi postscript printer.
I create postscript files via the Command F option when the Mac print dialogue 
box appears. I then put that file on a floppy and carry it to the Mac II which 
is connected to the postscript printer.

However, I do not know how to dump that to the printer? The Mac II/printer is 
not my system, so I can do much experimentation on it. Can anyone tell me what 
I should do??

Does anyone know if Apple or some other company is putting "TCP/IP

Also, is it possible (from the a/ux kernel) to set control bits in the Z8530 
communications chip to make it run SDLC/HDLC instead of async stuff? This would
allow the MacII to act as an x.25 host without out extra hardware. Or, from 
another approach, are there any NU-bus x.25 boards around?

And: when is Apple planning to release X-windows for A/UX?

My latest issue of _Macintosh_Today_ which came yesterday said that Apple 
previewed A/UX 1.1 at USENIX last week.  Version 1.1 includes color support, 
appletalk printing, and X11. They said the release date for 1.1 was "after 
October, but before December."

Subject: Single frame video tape recording on a MAC II

From: Alex Peck

Here at Grumman's Image lab we have been making single frame movies for several
years.  Our imaging systems (which are NOT Macintoshes) generate a single image
which is plotted on a video frame buffer, sent to an NTSC encoder, and passed 
to a Video tape controller made by Lyonlamb.  When the controller receives the 
RECORD command over it's RS-232 serial line, that video frame is recorded onto 
the attached 3/4" U-MATIC video tape recorder. During the making of a movie, 
this process is automatically repeated for each frame until the movie is 
complete.  This should work with a MAC II equipped with an NTSC converter just 
as well. (we are in the process of testing the Julian Systems NTSC converter 
which we just received yesterday).

   If you are interested, drop me a line at this address, and I

can give you the details.  Good luck.

We here at Iowa State are in the final throes of signing a Higher Education 
Purchase Program contract with Apple Computer for remarketing Macintoshes to 
faculty/staff/students.  As one of the people involved in the actual 
remarketing process, I would appreciate any feedback from people already doing 
similar things at other institutions.

We would like to get in touch with persons involved in Apple remarketing at 
other universities and colleges.  Specificially, I would appreciate:

   1.  Name of a contact person in the remarketing group;

   2.  A network address (preferably BITNET, but I can get to the

Internet also, see below) so we can contact you;

     3.  Any comments you might have concerning your relationship with Apple, 
tips and tricks of the trade, your experiences, war/horror stories, or other 
juicy tidbits.

Please respond to me directly via E-mail; if you are interested, I would be 
happy to summarize responses via return mail or to the net if folks are 
interested.

Again, sorry if this isn't the appropriate group to post this to. . .but this

Subject: Dumping Postscript to a Remote Printer

Reply-to: "Charles E. Bouldin" <bouldin@sed.ceee.nbs.gov>

For some time I have been unable to buy a laser printer, although there are 
many postscript printers nearby at work. If you are in a similar situation and 
wish to print on a "remote" laser printer, ie, not connected to you by 
appletalk, here is how to do it.

First, create a postscript file by holding down 'command shift f' as you 
release the 'ok' button in the standard print dialogue box. This creates an 
ascii postscript file. You must choose the laserwriter driver from the chooser 
before you print, and it does NOT matter if there is no laserwriter connected 
to your system when you do this.

To dump the postscript out, use the utility "SendPS" to dump the file out on 
the remote Mac system. SendPS is only 32K in size, so you have room for 750K of
postscript on a floppy that you can carry to the remote system. (To set the 
scale, a 20 page TeX document produced 450K of postscript, while a one page 
bitmap is 69K)The beauty of this is that SendPS works with output from ANY Mac 
application. (I have posted SendPS to the infomac archives).

This works wonderfully for me. I have tried it with a Laserwriter NT and with a
600 dpi Varityper printer. If you have a printer nearby at work or a shared 
printer at a University, or if you use the printers at Kinko's copy centers, 
this process should be of some help.

Subject: Another Finder/Desktop Idea

PowerStation is a very useful application if you want to be able to launch any 
one of many different applications on your hard disk quickly, without digging 
down through layers of folders.  But, you do have to switch back and forth 
between PowerStation and the Finder every time you want to go from launching 
applications to doing file shuffling and desktop housekeeping.

So, how about a Finder/Desktop system in which every folder icon has a small 
"launch" button somewhere in one of the corners, and clicking on that button 
launches a user-preselected application contained within that folder.  One 
could have a folder on the desktop for each major application and its

I am the happy owner of a Mac II. But now, I'd like to program a little, so I'm
planning to buy Inside Macintosh and MPW. These products exist in France, but 
it is well know that things are much more expensive there. Therefore, I'd like 
to buy MPW and IM to APDA (USA) : what are the conditions ? I need the price 
(and how to pay) and the way I could do it. I suppose I'll have to pay the 
transport.

here's another trouble : is Inside Macintosh I still good for

a Mac II ? I'm afraid it is getting old.

If you have the answer, please write to me :

I have some questions related to the LocalTalk PC card and software, and their 
emulation of Epson printers.  I would appreciate it if some knowledgeable net 
gurus would see if any of my potential solutions have any merit.

First the scenario:  a user, who can/will not change his document preparation 
techniques uses WordStar on an IBM PC (XT or AT perhaps) to produce documents 
which he shares with a collaborator and sends to his publisher.  Both our user 
and the collaborator are using (for historical reasons) a special system for 
inserting greek characters and print on an Epson FX-80 dot matrix printer.  
Recently our user's publisher has required him to submit laser printed 
manuscripts instead of the dot matrix he had been supplying heretofore.  Our 
user, then, would like to be able to laser print his work without changing 
anything.

The greek characters are printed as follows.  The Epson FX-80 can accept a 
programmable character set.  A set of greek letters was designed manually and a
Turbo pascal program was written to download these to the printer at system 
startup.  Then WordStar's capability to send custom printer control sequences 
(^PQ, ^PW, ^PE and ^PR commands) was used to shift to and from the downloaded 
character set.

At Dartmouth only Apple LaserWriters of various types are available.

Thus my potential solutions:

   1.   In the "Appleshare PC Update-AppleTalk PC Printer Driver" manual (a

supplement to the "AppleShare PC User's Guide") on page 5 it says in effect, if
your software doesn't support the Epson LQ2500 set the software to print to an 
FX series printer (one of the less desireable choices).  Thus I infer that the 
Appleshare PC software in Epson emulation mode provides some level of support 
for the Epson FX-80. But what level ?  If full FX-80 support is available (I am
skeptical), then all I have to do is rewrite the download program to work with 
a LaserWriter over LocalTalk and I am in business.  Anyone know about this???  
Apple, are you out there?  I'm not betting the farm on this one.

   2.   I could also set up a second copy of WordStar for printing on the

LaserWriter.  This copy would have special printer control sequences for use 
with the PC LaserWriter program (provided with the LocalTalk PC card) instead 
of for use with the FX-80.  Codes are supplied to change between fonts and one 
of the fonts is symbol, which has the greek and other special characters we 
need.  The only problem is that the symbol font's mapping of characters is most
likely different from the mapping in the downloaded font.  Can this be 
corrected by renumbering the symbol font (temporarily) using postscript 
commands?

If you would, please respond to me directly on this one as I don't read all the
newsgroups to which this is being posted.  I will summarize to the net if the 
responses seem to warrant it.  Thanks in advance for your help!!

Subject: Chooser Problems

I'm having some problems with using the chooser to select printers. Under 
normal circumstances, I use our office laserwriter to do most printing. 
Currently, I use system 4.2, finder 6.0, laserwriter & laser prep 4.0. If I am 
logged into our VAX, the modem port of the mac is used to connect to our LAN, 
and the printer port is connected to appletalk. So far, so good. Now, if I 
decide to change printers, I plug my imagewriter into the printer port, and 
change printers in the Chooser, version 3.2. Still OK. Now, if I wish to 
reconnect the laserwriter (via appletalk), I can change the connector, but I 
simply CANNOT change the Chooser setting. I get a dialog box that tells me that
the port is busy, and cannot be connected to appletalk. This is while the 
appletalk connector is plugged into it! If I exit to the finder, I still can't 
change it. I have to reboot the machine, at which time, I can change printers 
back to the laserwriter. HelP! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Reach for the stars has been around for some time on Apple II's.  I liked it 
very much.  Actually, I am most impressed by how much Roger Keating managed to 
fit into 32k.

Anyway, the game is played in a "galaxy" with ~100 solar systems, each holding 
0-3 planets.  Each planet has several numbers associated with it, which control
the planet's behaviour.

Your task is more or less to take over the whole galaxy.  You colonize planets,
build starships, do R&D, improve planets, and fight a lot of battles.

The game has four players, some of which may be computer players.

In my opinion this is an excellent game.  It is based on a few simple concepts,
but they combine in interesting ways.  For example high world production 
requires a large and wealthy population, but such populations increase rapidly.
 If you let the population approach the maximum the world can support, you'll 
lose the benefits of a fully developed world to transporting excess population 
away.

Subject: Mac Postscript generation

I've been noting the discussions regarding the creation of postscript files on 
the mac recently, and feel that a number of items need to be outlined, so 
misunderstandings are kept to a minimum.

It is quite easy to create postscript files from ANY application on your 
macintosh. After creating the document, and formatting it in the style you wish
to have it printed in, choose print from the file menu, just as you normally 
would. Immediately after clicking in the OK box, hold down either the f or k 
keys. You will create a PostScript file on the disk the application is on, 
called "Postscript0". Your next file will be "Postscript1", then "Postscript2",
etc, etc. It is not necessary to hold down the command-option, or command, or 
option keys along with f or k after clicking on OK in the print dialog. Just 
hold down the single letter key. Any other key is unnecessary.

While you can hold down either of two keys, f or k, there is a difference 
between the files created. When you use k, your postscript file will be 
prepended with the laser prep file for your machine. If there is some question 
as to whether or not your mac has the same laser prep version as that used to 
initialize the laserwriter, then use this option to create the first postscript
file you will print(ie Postscript0), and hold down the f key for all files 
following that one.

The difference between using f & k, in terms of disk space consumed is as 
follows. This letter was composed using Microsoft Word 3.01, and the Postscript
files described were created from within Word.

   File size                3k

   PostScript0 (using k)   33k

   Postscript1 (using f)    5k

You can see that the laser prep file will increase the size of your postscript 
file by about 27k. Then printing a large number of small files will mean that 
using the k option burns up more disk space for laser prep code than for the 
files themselves. Moral: Use k for your first file, and f thereafter.

The above is correct as I know it. If anyone notes any discrepancies, please

email to me, and I will post a correction.

A 32-bit 20 MHz Apple II.

Bill Mensch at Western Design Center in Mesa, Arizona where the 65C02 and 
65C816 microprocessors were designed takes "Apple II Forever," seriously.  He 
is working on a chip for a new generation Apple II.  The W65C832 features a 
32-bit instruction set and an internal math coprocessor. Prototypes of the 
65832 in an 8 MHz version should be available by the end of next year with 
production quantities available in early 1990.  Mensch says Western eventually 
will produce a 20 MHz version that will compare favorably with the Motorola 
68020 processor and 68881 math coprocessor in today's Mac II.  - Open Apple

Apple II Compatible Super Computer.

Another chip under development at Western Design is the W65C265 which squeezes 
the equivalent of a 65816, math coprocessor, two serial ports, a real-time 
clock, eight timers, a token-passing local area network link and a high 
performance interface for parallel processing into a single chip.  The 65C265 
is designed to be used for parallel processing, and Bill Mensch at Western says
he expects initial computers based on the chip to compare favorably with Apollo
minicomputers but at a much lower price. Mensch's dream is to apply gallium 
arsenide technology (Vaporware, May 1985) to produce speeds competitive with 
today's Cray parallel computers while remaining software compatible with the 
Apple II (would you like to try "Super Breakout" on that?). - Open Apple June

IIgs Clone.

Video Technologies which imports the Laser 128 Apple II clone into the U.S. is

NeXt: The Continuing Saga.

The introduction date for the new computer from Steve Jobs has slipped so often
it's even giving the term "vaporware" a bad name.  Perhaps the machine should 
be christened the Month (as in the "NeXt Month").  The latest delay in the 
debut of the black magnesium cubic (hmmmm... a "Black Box") computer is said to
be caused by a slow screen display, in spite of dedicated video chips.  The 
operating system will be a Unix variant known as "Mach" (will the "speed of 
sound" be fast enough?).  Other technical details and prices (still $4,000 to 
$9,000) of the 68030 machine were described in last January's column.  - Time

17 MIP Workstation in a Mac II.

Tektronix recently unveiled the first Motorola 88000-based development card for
the Macintosh II.  The Tektronix TL88K-P card runs at 20MHz and provides 17 
million instruction per second, about 10 times the speed of the 68020, 
according to the company.  The card is intended for developers creating 
software for the 88000 platform.  The Tektronix card features eight Mbytes of 
memory, three cache memory management units, and diagnostic and control 
software. The price of a fully configured board is $14,995, though lower priced
configurations will also be available. - Boston Computer Currents 3 June

that none of it's applications - Word, Works, Excel - will run under A/Ux 
without extensive modification.  - PC Week 14 June

Will It Be Known as "Gosh?"

Apple plans a new operating system for the IIgs called GS OS for release in the
Fall.  The GS OS environment will permit the IIgs to read text files in both 
Macintosh and MS-DOS 3.5 inch disk formats.  Otherwise GS OS will be ProDOS 
compatible, but it will permit "naming" devices such as hard drives and RAM 
disks instead of referring to them by "slot and drive" or "pathname."  - 
InCider June and July

MS-DOS 3.3 Clone.

Remember Digital Research, marketers of the CP/M and Gem operating systems?  
DRI recently announced DR-DOS, a single user operating system, which will be 
fully compatible with MS-DOS 3.3 and adds some extensions such as the ability 
to assign passwords to files and subdirectories.  DRI plans to "aggressively 
price" DR-DOS to PC-clone manufacturers. DR-DOS will be available on ROM chips 
which will be especially convenient for diskless LAN workstations and laptop 
computers.  - PC Week 14 June

DOS After Dark.

Microsoft and IBM are seriously contemplating a PC-DOS version of the 
Presentation Manager called DOS PM.  The product would be essentially Windows 
code but would look like the Presentation Manager.  - InfoWorld 13 June

What Happens to AppleTalk?

Apple vice president Jean Louis Gassee is quoted as saying that Apple will 
support the Macintosh running as a client workstation under Microsoft's OS/2 
LAN manager for an IBM token ring network.  However, Gassee did not elaborate 
on how or when this would happen, and other Apple officials have no comment on 
the subject.  - InfoWorld 30 May

OS/2-386.

Market pressure for a 32-bit, 80386 based version of OS/2 is increasing, but 
Microsoft doesn't expect to release a programmer's tool kit to developers 
before mid-1989.  End user release isn't expected until sometime in 1990.  A 
32-bit OS/2 will support "virtual machines" allowing several DOS applications 
to run simultaneously.  - PC Week 14 June

But Who Gets the "Look and Feel?"

Screenplay Systems will soon release to developers "The Macintosh Compatibility
Package" (MCP) which will allow software written in C for the Mac to be easily 
converted to run under MS-DOS with the same look and performance.  The 
compatibility package provides screen handling and other routines that allow 
the ported code to be run on a PC. Programs written in C for MS-DOS also can be
converted to run on a Macintosh with equal ease. - InfoWorld 13 June and PC 
Week 14 June

"Habit" Compatible.

Borland International's new $199.95 word processor, Sprint, accepts commands 
and produces files compatible with other major word processors - Word, Word 
Star, Word Perfect, and Multimate.  Early copies of the program will ship with 
the "Alternate User Interfaces" (AUI's) that translate the keystrokes of other 
word processors to Sprint.  After a few months, Borland plans to sell AUI's 
separately for $99.  The DOS 3.3 version of Sprint should be released about the
time this column appears, an OS/2 version is scheduled for the third quarter, 
and a Presentation Manager edition is planned for next year.  - InfoWorld 6 
June and PC Week 14 June

The Latest (Perfect) Word.

Analysts are surprised that Microsoft doesn't expect to have Word 4.0 available
for the Macintosh until October. Although version 4.0 is impressive, users may 
not want to wait; both Word Perfect and Fullwrite have been gaining share in 
the Macintosh market.  Meanwhile, Word Perfect 5.0 for MS-DOS computers uses a 
new file structure that is incompatible with Xerox's Ventura and Aldus's 
Pagemaker. Both Aldus and Xerox have indicated that future versions of their 
desktop publishing packages will support the new file format, but no release 
dates have been set.  Compaq owners need a ROM upgrade ($60 unless the computer
is still under warranty) in order to run the latest Word Perfect. - PC Week 14 
June

Lateware.

Ashton Tate now says that often delayed dBase IV definitely will be out by the 
end of September (wait and see).  In the meantime, a revised version of 
Framework has been announced for the July 31 date that was to have seen the new
dBase. Not to be outdone, shipment dates for Lotus's Agenda and Modern Jazz 
also are slipping toward Fall. - InfoWorld 30 May

Subject: Netter's Dinner

Well, with the Boston MacWorld coming up on 11 through 14 August, it is time to
start thinking about the semiannual Netter's Dinner!

Getting people together should be no problem since plenty of people want to 
eat, but when we get 60 or so people involved, we need a very understanding 
restaurant with a big banquet room.  Since I live in the SF area, I am not as 
familiar with the Boston area as I need to be.  I would like to petition any 
netters living in the Boston area to get their fingers walking and find us an 
understanding place within walking distance of the hall so that we can pull 
this thing off.

Dinner is tentatively planned for 6:30 on Saturday the 13th of August. Please 
RSVP to PUGH@NMFECC.ARPA so I can get an accurate head count and reserve a big 
enough place for us to chow.

The idea has been suggested that we just make this into a real party, so if 
anyone is stupid enough to donate their house or other facility, then we can do
that, but since we have no funding (and the group was virtually all male in 
January) maybe we had better stick to dinner and crash someone else's party :-)

Dr. Mueller was looking for curve-fitting software.

While I know of no commercial packages, I have had success with Fortran 
programs that I found in the book: Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the 
Physical Sciences, P. R. Bevington, McGraw-Hill, 1969. The program I have used 
is GRIDLS, a non-linear, least-squares fitting subroutine that is very 
flexible- the only requirement is that you must be able to express the function
you wish to fit to your data points as a Fortran expression. I have not 
programmed this subroutine on my Macintosh yet, but it works well on a VAX and 
I see no reason why it wouldn't work on a Mac.

Good luck.

buying his first MAC (an SE) and is trying to talk himself into (or out of) the

Subject: refreshing modeless dialog boxes

As a novice Mac hacker, I'd like some advice on modeless dialog boxes. I have 
coded a very small test application (using MPW C) that does nothing but put up 
a modeless dialog box with three buttons.  In response to clicking on the 
buttons, the program ("test") moves the dialog box around the screen.

Everything works fine except refreshing the controls of the dialog box when it 
is uncovered by another window.  Any portions of the buttons that were obscured
do not get repainted.  According to Inside Mac, the Dialog Manager is supposed 
to handle the update event, given the sequence of calls to IsDialogEvent and 
DialogSelect.  (Since the buttons work, the call to DialogSelect must be 
successful.)  I have tried calling DrawControls myself and it doesn't appear to
make any difference.  Note that the buttons remain active even when they are no
longer visible on the screen.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

All I read about these days in MacWEEK is "Mathematica, Mathematica,

staff is convinced this program is important, although they aren't sure why, 
and won't (or can't) explain what it does.  Has this program been released? Has
anyone seen it?  Can I get a demo/buy a copy?  How does it compare to other 
symbolic math software?  (And how is the author getting around the trademark on
the word Mathematica that the RAMIS II people own?)

Hello Net.

        I've seen lots of people complain about the lack of information on 
MathType; the only review seems to be that in the April MacWorld (and we know 
how INFORMATIVE their reviews are...) and a tidbit in the latest MacUser 
article on DTP.

        Well, I just recieved a DEMO DISK, *FREE* from Design Science, of 
MathType, and not even really crippled; the only difference between it and the 
real program is that the characters are permuted upon output. Both the DA and 
program are included.  I would post it, but the demoware agreement does not 
allow posting to "dial-up" boards. I'm not sure INFO-MAC qualifies as 
"dial-up", but I don't want to take any chances.

   You can recieve the demo disk *FREE* by contacting them, however:

        If anyone knows where to purchase this program from a 
MacConnection-type discount house, please reply to me... it looks much better 
than what I have seen of Expressionist, but the list price ($149) is WAY too 
steep.

Well, with the onslaught of additional information, it looks like the Netter's 
dinner will be on Friday, the 12th of August at 6:00 so as to be agreeable with
the largest number of people and conflict with less stuff.

A very nice man by the name of Robert Hammen has volunteered to organize the 
dinner with an assist from some others in the Boston area (Ric and Peter, I 
believe).  Robert started thinking about this long before I did, so he gets 
credit for advance planning also.  Robert's addresses on the various nets are:

You can send messages to either he or I to RSVP your place.  Please be sure to 
tell one of us if you are coming as we need an accurate head count for the 
restaurant which has yet to be determined.

Stay tuned for more news as it develops.

Mac Double II.

Golden Triangle has announced the Firepower processing board for the Mac II 
which will be capable of running Apple's forthcoming (in beta test at the 
moment) Macintosh real-time distributed operating system (called MR-DOS) 
independently of the host Mac II (which means it will not be necessary to 
dedicate a Mac II solely to file serving on an AppleTalk network).  The 
Firepower board is available with a 16, 20, or 25 MHz 68020, 2 Appletalk ports,
up to 4 Mbytes of RAM and 1 Mbyte of ROM.  Manufacturer's prices for the 
Firepower board start at $2,500 in volume.  - InfoWorld 11 July

Clone a Mac II at Home.

Second Wave, makers of a 4-slot expansion chassis for the Mac-SE (last 
October), has begun shipping a similar chassis for the Mac Plus and will 
introduce a 6-slot Nubus unit at MacWorld that can be used to expand the number
of slots in a Mac II.  If it's outfitted with the Firepower board, a hard disk,
and a keyboard, the Second Wave product can become a basic Unix workstation, or
the combination could act as a network file server without any Mac II at all.  
If some enterprising firm (Phoenix Technologies? AST?) should decide to write 
Macintosh compatible ROM chips, the Second Wave expansion chassis plus the 
Firepower board could be turned into a Mac II clone.  The price of the 
expansion unit which is scheduled for shipping this fall has not been 
announced. - InfoWorld 11 July and a phone call from 2nd Wave 2 July

Color SE.

Perhaps next January's MacWorld will see the introduction of the new, three 
expansion slot, color Macintosh SE (see last October's column), as there are no
indication that it will be unveiled at the Boston show in August. - InfoWorld

Not Much to Read (Only).

Apple evangelist Martha Steffen estimated that only about half a dozen 
different disks were available for the new Mac CD ROM by the end of June - a 
dozen if demo programs are counted.  Most of those disks contain clip art or 
similar applications.  A few more disks will be introduced at MacWorld in 
Boston this month, but the first real flurry of CD's for the Mac aren't 
expected until January's MacWorld. However, if High Sierra access software is 
delivered this month as expected, disks currently used by the IBM PC could 
become available as developers write Mac interfaces for them.  - InfoWorld 20

Apple Connectivity to IBM

David Nagy, Apple's marketing manager for IBM communications products, has 
confirmed that a combined Token Ring adapter (see last month's column) and 
3270/5250 terminal emulation board will be introduced in November for delivery 
next March.  In addition, Apple plans to announce wide-scale support for IBM's 
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) communications protocols. - PC Week 21 June 
and InfoWorld 27 June

Modern Jazz Blown Away.

Lotus has announced that Modern Jazz (last month and last May's columns) is one
piece of vaporware that will never materialize.  Apparently recently appointed 
Lotus vice president Frank King didn't believe that Modern Jazz would 
effectively compete with Microsoft's Works and so decided to concentrate on 
1-2-3 Mac which is expected next year.  Lotus plans to offer registered users 
of Jazz 1A upgrades to 1-2-3 Mac, but further details are not yet available. - 
InfoWorld 20 June

MacWare That May Yet Exist.

Software Publishing Corporation has signed a joint agreement with D Graphics, 
Inc. to create a Macintosh version of the popular Harvard Graphics program.  
The, as yet unnamed, application will compete with Cricket Presents and 
Microsoft Powerpoint.  Delivery won't be until next year.  Another Mac graphics
product scheduled for August publication is Photon Paint for the Mac II.  This 
color application is capable of wrapping designs around 3-D objects and can add
luminance to objects so that they appear to be lighted from a point source.  
Photon Paint's announced price is $299.95. Electronic Arts expects to release 
its $495 Studio 8 color paint program for the Mac II in September.  The program
is designed for graphics professionals and plans to compete directly with 
Supermac's Pixel Paint.  Also, Acius is working on documentation for a 
prototype database named Skeleton that will make it simple for anyone to 
customize and have a full-featured Mac database application. - InfoWorld 27 
June and 4 July

Rewritable Optical Disc.

Advanced Graphics Applications joined the rewritable disc race (see June's 
column) by showing a "plug and play" 650 Mbyte drive at PC Expo in June.  The 
Discus Rewritable uses 3M's optical media, plugs into an AT bus, and is 
scheduled to ship in November.  The transfer rate at the demonstration was 5.5 
Megabits per second with an average access time of 80 milliseconds.  The 
announced price is $4,995. - InfoWorld 27 June

Taking a Different Bus.

PC clone manufacturers led by AST Research president Safi Qureshey are 
attempting to agree on an alternative to IBM's Micro Channel Architecture 
(MCA).  The alternate bus could be the Nubus standard used in the Macintosh II 
or an adaptation of the VME (IBM mainframe Virtual Memory Extension) electrical
specifications.  The move away from the IBM "standard" is based on 
dissatisfaction with MCA performance as well as the cost and difficulty of 
licensing from "Big Blue." - InfoWorld 27 June

Twice As Fast.

Nexgen Microsystems is ready to ship a five chip processor that is Intel 80386 
and 80387 compatible, but approximately six times faster than the Intel 
originals.  Olivetti is likely to be the first to offer a workstation built 
around the Nexgen processor set early next year.  - PC Week 11 July

More Than Fifty Times Faster.

By October, Semiconductor maker, Wietek, plans to begin shipping their Abacus 
math coprocessor for Intel 80386 computers.  The Abacus will come in 20 and 25 
MHz versions and can be used as a stand alone math coprocessor in conjunction 
with Intel's 80387 math coprocessor.  In a test on a 20 MHz Compaq 386 with 
both 80387 and Abacus coprocessors, only 9 seconds were needed to recalculate a
program that took a PC-XT with an 8087 chip 470 seconds to accomplish.  - PC 
Week 21 June

VAX-on-the-Desk.

DEC is busy developing a desktop VAX workstation to compete with Sun, Apollo, 
and other marketers of high end work stations.  The VAX-top will retail for 
around $15,000 and link to DECnet.  - PC Week 21 June

Who's Doing a Job(s) on Who?

One rumor has it that NeXt is negotiating a licensing arrangement granting IBM 
the rights to all, or portions of, the Palo Alto startup's Unix interface.  
However, a rival rumor monger claims that the whole story originated at Apple 
in Cupertino.  - PC Week 21 June and InfoWorld 27 June

More "Unobtainables?"

Shipment schedules for the announced 25 MHz Intel 80386 computers from IBM, 
Sun, Compaq, and others my slip due to limited availability of microprocessors 
from Intel.  Smaller PC producers are having difficulty getting even 
preproduction samples of the 25 MHz chips. - PC Week 21 June

Blue Chips.

IBM has a license from Intel to manufacturer it's own 80386 chips.  There is a 
rumor that Big Blue has an in-house version running at 60 MHz!  Not 
surprisingly, IBM's engineers have received an internal memo directing them not
to design any more 80286 systems.  IBM appears well on the way toward solving 
their DRAM shortage as well with the discovery that they can produce 16 Mbit 
chips as easily as 4 Mbit chips and actually get a higher manufacturing yield 
as well.  Those 16 Mbit chips (2 Mbytes) could make OS/2 Extended Edition (now 
said to require more than 3 Mbytes of RAM) practical after all.  - PC Week 11 
July

Very Fast Laptops.

Harris Corporation announced plans to begin shipping a 20 MHz 80C286 in 
September.  The Harris chip is the fastest '286 microprocessor yet announced.  
For 16-bit operations it actually offers faster software performance than the 
20 MHz 80386.  Because the CMOS technology of the 80C286 uses only one-third 
the power of 80386 and standard 80286 processors, the new chip is ideally 
suited for use in battery powered laptops.  - PC Week 28 June

Speaking of Laptops.

The LapMac rumors have been around so long they're becoming boring, but it 
might just show up in Boston at MacWorld, or next January's MacWorld...  
Meanwhile, Big Blue is rumored to be planning a public announcement of a 
battery powered, very compact, 80386 laptop in September. - InfoWorld 11 July

Not Enough Advantage.

Ashton-Tate is completely rewriting Multimate Advantage for OS/2 but doesn't 
expect to be finished until late 1989.  In the meantime, owners of the present 
product may be tempted by new versions of competing word processors.  So, 
current Advantage users will be offered an "interim functionality improvement" 
(when is a new version not a new version?) before snow next reaches the Great 
Plains.  Meanwhile, some of Ashton Tate's best programmers are said to be 
accepting jobs at Claris (to work on what?). - InfoWorld 27 June and 11 July

IIgs-e?  New IIgs ROM.

Now that wags are saying, in print, that "gs" stands for "goes slow," rumors 
are abroad that Apple is planning on putting Western Design's 65832 in the next
IIgs.  If true, it would mean that the IIgs+ chatter (see April's and June's 
columns) is wrong because production quantities of the 65832 aren't planned 
until 1990 (see last month's column).  Could someone be planting the "a faster 
IIgs is coming" rumors to keep "the rest of us" from buying Amigas?  Maybe the 
new IIgs ROMs in September will quicken the pace of the hardware a bit.  - 
InCider August

GS Works by Another Name.

A faster IIgs may be needed to make effective use of AppleWorks GS which was 
renamed from GS Works after Apple spinoff Claris acquired Styleware in June.  
Sources close to Claris say that a Macintosh version of the program, which 
would compete with Microsoft Works, can be expected in about 18 months.  - 
InfoWorld 4 July

If These Guys Get Together It Could be Awesome.

Researchers at Sandia National Labs have a 1,024 parallel processor machine 
that runs 1,000 times faster than the single processor machine (Nearly perfect 
efficiency). Processing that quickly could require a memory based on a 
transistor made of superconducting materials which AT&T Bell Labs has developed
that is current-sensitive to only one electron.  The machine could produce so 
much output that "Digital Paper", a polyester-based substrate coated with 
infared-sensitive dye polymer developed by ICI Electronics might be needed.  
The "tape" is able to accept data at 10 Mbits/sec - a 2,400 ft. reel (.5 in 
wide) can hold 600 Gigabytes. - Popular Science reader John W. Taylor (SUNY

Subject: "VT100 Maculator" Terminal Emulator

"VT100 Maculator" Terminal Emulator - written by Richard K. Lloyd.

There is no documentation with it YET, although the operation is 
self-explanatory in the author's opinion. This is probably the closest to TRUE 
VT100 emulation anyone will ever get on the Mac.

Interesting features :

* Escape sequences are taken from a PT100 (Plessey VT100), which

   appears to be a superset of a true DEC VT100.

* IntelliMouse feature - Option + mouse click moves the text

   cursor to the mouse position...neatly skipping over tabs

   (unlike all the other emulators).

* Dual speed smooth scrolling in both directions.

* Understands the VT100 time setting escape sequence.

* 25th Status line including 4 LEDs, the time/date and the X,Y

   text cursor position.

* Double width and double height text in ANY combination.

* EXTREMELY FAST E-test and assorted character test.

* Full VT52 support.

* Numeric keypad support - WARNING : Only tested on a Mac Plus

   keyboard...not guaranteed on the Mac SE or II.

* Show control characters option - displays control codes in

   EXACTLY the same way as a VT100.

* VT100 font (remarkably similar to MacKermit's in case you're

   wondering !).

* A double width cursor on double width lines. Cursor can be

   an underline, a block or even invisible !

* Use of DrawString calls instead of multiple DrawChars to speed

   up screen output.

Only features missing are :

* 132 column mode (if someone buys me a big screen, then..).

* Flashing characters (couldn't think of a way of doing this on a

   Mac Plus or SE).

* Printer support (this WILL be coming though !).

* Kermit (may be implemented if I pull my finger out and get down

   to it), XMODEM, YMODEM etc.

* 4010 graphics (I've just started coding this...).

Version 1.31 supplied here will expire at the end of this year. By then, most 
of the missing features above should have been implemented in one way or 
another (I'm working on the Acorn Archimedes version at the moment - which is 
going to be all- singing and dancing when I eventually finish it) and I will 
probably post up a new version.

If there is enough demand, I will cobble together some simple documentation 
(though I think it's unnecessary myself - the About dialog lists the more 
obscure keys).

Please e-mail me with any (constructive) comments or bug reports.

Enclosed is an application called TimeKeeper.  It displays a circular, analog

works under regular Finder, but isn't as interesting.)

The program saves the position of its window, so you can make TimeKeeper one of
your startup applications, and always have a clock available.  In addition, you
can have it beep on the hour.

If the Sound Manager is available, which is true on the Mac II as well as a Mac
Plus or SE running System 6.0, then you will get a menu of all your beep sounds
to play on the hour.  (I have one that sounds like the chime on a real clock.)

As always, let me know if you have any suggestions.  (Some things that people 
have already asked for include: setting the time by dragging the hands, 
supporting color, and supporting reminders.)

Subject: Info-Mac Status Report

To all Info-Mac Readers:

I believe I now have answered all the old mail that had accumulated in the 
Info-Mac-Request mailbox.  If you haven't received a reply to a query sent more
than 2 weeks ago, please resend it.  It's possible we've lost it in the shuffle
or in a disk crash.

To clear up the request mail, I've let the archives slide for a while. Catching
up on that is the next order of business (over 7MB of binaries as of 
today--ouch!).  I will try (with emphasis on "try"--I sometimes forget) to send
a "receipt" signifying when all parts of your postings reach Sumex, but that 
does NOT mean I've archived it yet.  It just means it reached here.  For now, 
please assume that anything you've already sent made it here safely.  I don't 
want to have to weed through two copies of everything because I'm behind on 
receipts.

Jon Pugh and I hold down fulltime jobs unrelated to Info-Mac, so you may never 
see incredible turnaround times on requests or postings.  When do we handle 
Info-Mac?  On the weekends mostly.  I sometimes login during the weekday 
evenings since some requests seem urgent, but I usually can't stay on for too 
many hours (I like to eat and sleep occasionally). Info-Mac is something we 
volunteer to do because we believe in its value.  We have our good days and our
bad days just like everyone else. I have no idea how long we will last, but 
I'll probably keep at it until I croak or leave Stanford, whichever comes 
first.

I'm told that Sumex is "half way through a 5-year phaseout."  What does that 
mean for Info-Mac?  I don't know, but perhaps something can be arranged since 
the computing resources provided by the Sumex DEC-2060 will later be provided 
by a Sun-4 and Mac IIs running A/UX.  I'll do what I can to stay on top of this
story, especially if Info-Mac must leave Stanford.

Administrivia:

o Anything you want placed in an Info-Mac Digest (including binaries)

should be mailed to

   Info-Mac@Sumex-Aim.Stanford.Edu.

Everything else should go to

   Info-Mac-Request@Sumex-Aim.Stanford.Edu.

o Some Bitnet sites were cut off by a combination of two things: OREGON1 is no 
longer an Info-Mac hub AND Stanford's Bitnet list disappeared when the 
forwarding computer changed.  With the help of Mark Williamson at Rice 
University, we are slowly fixing things and hopefully making them easier to 
administer.

From Robert Hammen:

Here are the finalized details for the Netters Dinner, which will be held at 
6:30 PM on Friday, August 12th at the Shanghai Restaurant in Chinatown, on the 
east side of Boston. The Shanghai is located at 21 Hudson Street; the 
reservation is under the name "MacWorld".

We'll have two meeting points for persons wishing to go to the dinner. The 
first meeting point will be in front of the Bayside Expo Center at 5:30 PM. 
We'll take the MBTA to South Station; the Shanghai is about a 5 minute walk 
from there. The second meeting point will be the Commonwealth Pier, again at 
around 5:30. It's about a 15 minute walk from there to the Shanghai.

After the dinner, we've all been invited to attend the BMUG party, which will 
be held at the Boston Tea Party. It promises to be an interesting and 
entertaining evening.

The following people have announced their intentions to attend the dinner. We 
still have room for a few people, so if you'd like to come, please reach me at 
one of the E-mail locations listed at the end of the message. The last time I 
will read my messages is Wednesday afternoon...

Subject: Hard drive question

An SE with 20 meg drive was recently brought to my attention when its desktop 
came up absolutely blank.  The disk boots, and close examination of the disk 
with FEdit shows all the files to be "there" but they simply don't show up on 
the desktop.  I have tried all the cliched methods of rebuilding the desktop, 
but the results are always the same - a blank one.

If anyone has encountered this phenomena and have a solution, would you

please send a reply ASAP.

Subject: Looking for Ray Traced Demo

Sorry to bother you guys with a request, but you're probably one of the best 
places to start.  I am looking for the image (and others too) that first 
appeared on a poster for the Mac II when it was first being introduced.  If 
this image (and hopefully a format document) are available in your archives, 
could you please give me the file name(s)?  Is COLOR-FLOATING-BALL.HQX what I 
am looking for?  I don't have a Mac II so I can't check it out.  I am 
interested in this image because it was so sharp.  I would like to use it to 
test some display software. Any pointers to other good bit mapped images would 
also be appreciated.

                                Thanks in Advance,

Subject: Statistical Packages

   I am a recent convert  from a PC to a  MAC-II. I didn't realize  until

   now that  there seems  to be  a lack  of high-powered  but  affordable

statistical and mathematical packages (for the social sciences) on the

   MAC. For  some  reason, I  had  thought of  the  MAC as  the  academic

discount machine...

   In   particular,   I   am   surprised   that   (1)   I   can't    find

   mainframe-compatible or programmable  packages like Gauss,  Speakeasy,

   SCA, S etc.  (2)  that Mathematica's academic  discount makes it  $430

   cheap...; that may be fine  for faculty, but for students  Mathematica

is just out.  (3) that Excel is more stifled on the MAC than it is  on

the PC, etc.

Anyway, here is a short report on one acquisition of mine: I  recently

   got myself a copy of  Mathview. I am a  bit disappointed. It does  not

   permit any programming (or piecewise  functions) whatsoever. I got  it

to try out graphics.  Unfortunately, it does not allow to specify  the

   y-dimensions. If you plot  a few functions over  a common domain,  and

one has an asymptote within this domain, the action takes place on the

   bottom 2% of the  screen... In general, my  impression is that if  you

ask for the company's prospectus, it lists precisely what the  package

   does; I made  the mistake of  considering it a  sample, rather than  a

   complete list. In  sum, Mathview is  ok if you  know EXACTLY what  you

want is listed in the prospectus.  But it's extremely inflexible.   On

   the  good  size,  this  inflexibility   makes  for  quite  a  bit   of

   userfriendliness: you  select, the  program asks  you a  few  built-in

questions. That's it.

   My questions  are  these:  Does  anybody  have  a  list  of  available

math/stats packages with a good description of capabilities/value  for

   the  MAC?   Does  anyone  have  experience  with  Kinko's   Courseware

offerings (are they good/bad?) ?

Moreover, where would one get a good listing of PD/shareware programs?

   I.e. one that says a  few lines about what's  good and what's bad.  Is

there a PD/SW Texktronix Terminal Emulator? I appreciate any info.

Howdy.

I've had to rebuild my desktop several times now to speed up performance 
(twice) or fix incessant crashing (twice).  Surely, surely, there exists a DA 
or small utility that can be called upon to clean out the bloated desktop.  
Anybody know one, and where it might be obtained?  I have access to sumex 
archives, if that helps.  Direct e-mail would probably be the best way to 
reply---thanks!

Question for you all...

   One of the people in our office has an apple macintosh plus with a data 
frame 30 hd & is running finder 5.5 & sysem 4.1.  The problem is that whenever 
some applications create files (for example. microsoft word) the finder does 
not recognize the document as being created by that application.  When you 
double click the document it says that it cannot find an application. (even 
though ms word is in the same directory).

   This doesn't happen with all applications though.  For example, mac draw 
documents are saved okay. (you are able to double click the document to get at 
the file).  But macdraw II files are not saved correctly.

   To this point the only way to get around it is to go into the application 
and then open the document by hand (mighty tediousif you have 500 files spread 
across 20 different folders.)

Please reply directly to me as I do not read info-mac regularly.

Thanx,

[Moderator's Note:

This is a bundle bit problem and is very serious.  I keep finding docs with 
their bundle bit set.  Scott Boyd announced in MacTutor that he had a hack that
went looking for these files.  Let's see if it can be posted! Meanwhile, 
someone at Apple should be looking into this.  If not a fix, a garbage 
collector at least.  One bundle bit can screw up access to all your documents!

Subject: Accessing Mac laserprep/postscript files

Hello:

I have a new Mac SE and I want to use a PostScript laser printer (QMS-800PS) 
located elsewhere and hooked onto a non-Apple workstation (Apollo) to print my 
Mac stuff. I know that I can get a PostScript file dumped to disk on the Mac by
hitting Command-F after asking for a print; I can transfer this file by modem 
to the Apollo, but it won't print out. Reason is, the PS file assumes a prolog 
or header file (presumably Laserprep) has been sent ot the laser printer, 
defining a whole bunch of things. Any idea how I can generate or get hold of 
the relevant laserprep/ header/prolog PS file?

I don't normally read info-mac, so please reply to me directly

Thanks

Subject: interface to LN03R

Is there a hardware device for a DEC Scriptprinter which would emulate an 
Appletalk interface so I could connect a Mac directly to the LNO3R (with 
PostScript)? Currently I use a null modem cable and download PostScript files 
through a terminal program at 19.2 kbps, but this is very slow and prone to bit
errors. Is there any Laserprep software for the Mac configured properly for the
LN03R's peculiarities?

This is probably a very witless question, but how does one go about sending a

Subject: Identifying disconnections/breaks in Appletalk

If this sounds like a naive question, I apologize in advance....

Does anyone know of any software or whatever that can identify

breaks/disconnections in an Appletalk network?

We've had a number of annoying occurrences where an Appletalk connector 
loosened up (maybe someone accidentally pulled one loose), resulting in several
Macs on our Appletalk net getting effectively disconnected from the net (unable
to print to the Laserwriter, etc.). (The daisy-chain nature of Appletalk means 
that a disconnection in some office can affect many other offices.)  Finding 
the loose connection was a hit-or-miss affair.

Is there any software or whatever that can periodically poll Appletalk and 
identify disconnections on the net, or perhaps find those Appletalk ports that 
are inaccessible (say, from the Laserwriter port)?  Or are there other ways to 
deal with such problems?

Please reply directly to me as I am not a regular subscriber to this

newsgroup.  Thanx very much in advance!

a special low price until the end of August. Does anyone out there use Aztec, 
especially the new version with the debugger? I would really like to see some

Subject:  upgrade from Microsoft Fortran to MacTRAN?

DCM data products has recently circulated an offer for upgrading from MS 
Fortran 2.2 to their new MacTRAN ver 3.0.  By sending in the original MS 
Fortran diskette and a check for about $100 you were getting (supposedly) a 
superior product.  Well, it all sounded great on paper and MacTRAN's support 
for Mac II convinced us to go for it.  This note is to warn everybody on the 
net to double-think before going for this deal.  After struggling with MacTRAN 
for several days I am quite disappointed with this product. --> flame on <-- It
has that distict feel of non-Macintosh program forced/patched to run on the 
Mac.  The interface is very inconsistent and unMacish in many respects, the 
documentation poor and incomplete (the description of the Fortran lang. itself 
is decent, but that part I know pretty well anyway).  The bottom line is that 
although MS Fortran is not an integrated environment, I found it more pleasing 
to work with.  At least EDIT allows me to print the program or any part of it 
during work, show invisible characters, and so forth. You must be quite 
flexible with using word-processing DAs (like miniWriter, MockWrite, or 
JoliWrite) to do printing.  I end up doing most of my editting in EDIT and just
minor corrections in MacTRAN, which is not what we paid for. The compiler 
itself is very unfriendly.  You can save the default compile options, but they 
are kept with the compiler not a given program -- I had a few suprises when 
trying to compile programs using INTEGER*2 instead of INTEGER*4 and vice versa.
 And I mean the example programs included with MacTRAN.  The information about 
using your own resources and Macintosh i/o (disk) system is completely missing.
 They tell you how to create libraries (yuuck, this is definitely a DOS 
program), but omit how to use them.  Even the basic compiler description is 
unclear and umbigous (unlike the MS Fortran manual).  I still haven't fugured 
out when I need to request code generation

and when to create REL files.  I can go on and on. The bottom line is that 
unless you really need to produce Mac II specific code, think twice before 
going for their offer.  I wonder whether Absoft or other Fortran's for Mac are 
more friendly.  I have also already run into a problem with MacTRANS 
interpretation of Fortran.  Since I am using it to convert programs from larger
computers rather than develop them on a Mac, I suspect I will have to spend 
quite a lot of time inventing patches and workabouts.  I have already several 
reports with problems and suggested enhancements ready for mailing. --> flame 
off <---

By the way,

Has anyone who used MacTRAN managed to call standard file dialogs? cursor's 
from CURS resource?  Assign TYPE to newly created file?  Any hints would be 
appreciated.  Samples of code most welcome.  Send those directly to me. If 
responding to this part of this note, re: MacTRAN calling Macintosh.

To whom it may concern:

     Over the past few weeks I've been writing a program which manipulates data
produced by a Spectrometer or Flourimeter using True Basic. Although I like the
language, it is no secret that its use of the Mac interface is less than 
noteworthy.  Presently, users of my program must input many commands from the 
keyboard.  However, I would like to display small circular buttons (often 
referred to as "radio boxes"(button id 3 in Microsoft basic)) on the screen and
allow the commands to be input using them.  My greastest difficulty in this is 
deciding what is and is not valid input.  I understand that one may set up data
structures to poll the mouse for appropriate x and y values.  I do have access 
to a Toolbox disk for True Basic but I am a newcomer to the Macintosh, any 
assistance would be most appreciated.

I am looking for a good 3270 emulator program for dialing into IBM mainframes. 
MacTerminal offers a 3270 mode but doesn't offer all the nice features like:

   - use of Mac II function keys (vs. pull down and inconvenient ones)

      this is particularly critical in the full screen IBM environment where 
      you constantly need to push the program function keys

   - login scripts to get past the typically complex sequence

   - text capture and send

Some of the commercially available emulators require expensive

packages to be run on the mainframe

Replies sent will be summarized and posted back to INFO-MAC.

Subject: AppleFax problem

Greetings from the Mighty U of W.  (Just kidding, sortof)

Has anyone else had problems getting their AppleFax to auto-answer on the 
fourth ring, like the manual and the AppleFax application claim it will?  When 
I'm in the AppleFax application and there is an incoming call, a dialog box 
saying "Someone is calling! (sic) with an Answer and a No Answer button comes 
up.  It also says "AppleFax will answer on the fourth ring."  Alas, after the 
fourth ring, another box saying "AppleFax is disconnecting" flashes and then 
nothing happens.  Clicking on the Answer button answers, but I don't want to 
have to sit at my Mac waiting for a phone call to come in, you know?

The AppleFax does take the AT command set, and I did do an ATS0=4 from Red 
Ryder before getting into the application in an attempt to force the AppleFax 
to auto-answer.  However, the application seems to reset

the S0 register to 0 (no auto-answer) upon launch, and the AppleFax manual does
say that S0 is set to 0 by default (how it's supposed to answer on the fourth 
ring as advertised then, i dunno either).

Help help help!  Only one Seattle dealer has received their AppleFax, and they 
haven't set it up yet.  Can anyone in the net world relate?

Thanks

Files

-----

1K - Block Xmodem

File listings maintain:

Date of last access

Number of times the file is accessed.

----

There are new menu commands that work in conjunction with File transfers:

New since last call with Download

Search for File with Download

List Files from New to Old with Download

List files from Old to new with Download

These commands append a D>ownload command to the command line to the

File list as you list files.

----

There are now 10 lines of description available for every file uploaded or 
posted in the file sections to more adequately describe uploads.

Message Base

------------

Host 2.0 Message bases now support Threading. You can follow a string of 
messages from beginning to end, including sub-threads that are threads of 
messages that are replies to replies. You can Show the original message of the 
thread you are in at any time its applicable to a threaded message. ---- The 
New Message bases now support variable length messages set by MsgEdit from 
1-400 lines per section. ---- There are 4 new menu commands for searching by 
subject: Read with search by section Scan with Search by section Read with 
search all combined sections Scan with search all combined sections ---- The 
Security level set for the Combined Read now sets the access level required by 
the user to post a new message to that section. This means that even replies 
cannot be sent if you make it so the new user can read messages,but the access 
level for the section is higher than the users level. ---- The command line of 
the Message base, now supports a (CR) as next, and requires an explicit command
"Q" hot key to exiting reading messages. (Note: The file sections also work the
same way when listing files.) ---- The Userlog now remembers the highest 
message read, so you can on subsequent logins read messages that you have not 
read yet, as well as new messages since the last call. ---- Cancelling a 
message now asks you if you wish to abort message entry or only what you've 
entered so far and starts the message over at line 1. ---- You are prompted for
a new subject for every message, so that the message header will be able to 
reflect the message contents if you wish. Entering a (CR) will leave the 
Subject as it was. Entering a Control-X will clear the subject line for a new 
subject. ---- The Message header now displays when a message has been recieved 
by the user it was sent to.

Menus

-----

The Menus now support 24 restriction flags for each menu item. These items can 
be set to "match" or "not to match" the users restriction flags set by the 
default settings in the config file for each user as they login. Also any 
combination of flags can be set giving virtually thousands of combinations of 
access in combination with the 255 levels of security access. ---- The Userlog 
supports the restriction flags set for each user and can be edited and 
maintained with UserEdit. As well as Survey commands and online Sysop editing 
commands.

System

------

You can now choose to set in the config file the following new items for

your system:

You can support an upload time credit, this adds the time used to upload a file
to the users time limit for that call only. For example if a user has a 30 
minute time limit, and uploads a file that takes 20 minutes, he will have 20 
additional minutes that call. ---- You can support a Chat time Credit, if you 
break in and chat with a user, or respond to a page, the user is credited for 
the time in the chat mode with you. ---- Time enforcement:  You can now set the
amount of time a user can call your system back should his time limit expire 
during the enforcement period.

For Example, you set your system for a 12 hour time enforcement. John Doe calls
at 9AM, he is alloted 30 minutes, he uses the entire 30 minutes that call, he 
will not be able to login again until 12 hours has expired, or 9PM. If he calls
at any time during the time enforcement period, say 3PM, he will be logged off,
and will not be able to call for 12 hours from 3PM now... or 3AM.

If John doe had only used 15 minutes the first call at 9AM, and made a 
subsequent call at 3PM, he would have his time on the system reduced to 15 
minutes, and if his time limit expired, he would not be able to login again 
until 3:15AM. ---- You can now support 19,200,9600,2400,1200,300 baud, with 300
baud lockout if you do not wish to support 300 baud users. ---- A Network Mail 
application can be configured for a timed launch in the config file. You set 
the time in hours, minutes and seconds in the config file and the path to the 
Netmail application, and Host will reduce any callers time limit accordingly if
he calls to close to launch time and will log them off and then initiate the 
application pathed in the config file. ---- You can now Disable the local Echo,
this closes the terminal window for Host, which is a standard movable window. 
With the terminal Window closed, thruput to the user is much greater and will 
be faster than 1.4. Downloads are not affected by this. ---- Host can now keep 
track of the total number of calls your system receives if you keep a file 
called Cumulative calls in the same folder with Host. ---- Host now supports 
Desk accesories ---- Status bar now reports the time and date of the last 
caller online ---- You can only click in the status bar to cancel a file 
transfer instead of anywhere as before. ---- There is a 3 minute warning to let
you know that time is about to expire. ---- There is now a Newuser.msg and a 
Logoff.msg that are displayed accordingly, the newuser.msg will only display 
for a new user on his first call. The logoff.msg displays whenever a command 1 
logoff command is executed. They are placed in the same folder as Host. ---- 
MultiFinder compatability & MultiLine:

It is now possible to configure Host to share specific files and run 
independant BBS's, one thru the modem port and the other thru the Printer port 
under MulitFinder. They share the following files; Message files, Userlog, 
menus & files by the proper pathing in the config file. Each System will still 
require its own config file and main menu, Modem files and welcome files to 
run. Surveys -------

There are additional Survey commands that enhance the current survey commands 
that are in 1.4 as well as Survey commands that support voting. They are:

New command 0 (zero) This command converts last input to upper case.

----

New command 19, place ascii character specified in "Text" to the

scratch file

----

New Command 20, clears the scratch file and branches to a label. This is useful
for surveys that display a fair amount of text before asking for input and 
allows the user a second chance to input should he make a mistake. without 
having to start the survey over. ---- New command 21, If users download to 
upload ratio is is less than the number in "Text", go to "branch". ---- 4 new 
Survey commands to set or unset restriction flags either permanently or 
temporarily for that user which can affect the Menu displays for the user. ----
4 New Survey commands to initiate the text file read commands that Host 
supports:

   cancellable, no prompts.

   cancellable, all prompts.

   not cancellable, all prompts,

   not cancellable, Final prompt only

These commands are useful for validation Surveys where you can present 
validation information to the user and then get his input. They can also be 
used to display the "Survey Scratch" file so that the user can check his input.
---- 13 new Voting survey commands that can ask the user for specific input, 
yes or no, or muliple choice, and then display the results of the voting so far
in percentages as well as the number of people voting yes or no, or a,b, or c. 
depending on how you set up the voting survey. There are also commands to 
prevent the user from voting more than once. ---- Surveys are now time and date
stamped in the RES file. ---- Survey interpreter has been speed up to make 
branches execute faster. ---- Sysop commands that have been enhanced are the 
user updating commands for time and access level have been modified to set or 
unset restriction flags.

The Maintanence command for the file sections will now physically delete a file
if told to do so. As well as delete or move the listing to another specified 
file section.

While not every feature you could have asked for, or has been asked for is 
here. I think that Host 2.0 adds enough features to keep things lively on your 
systems for quite a while.

X;

   X;   Created:  6/7/87  PM    - first version

   X;   Modified: 6/15/87 PM    - changed to standard (Pascal) calling 
   conventions

   X;             6/20/87 PM    - fixed color & Finder bug on Mac II

   X;             6/22/87 DBA   - improved handling of QuickDraw

   X;             6/29/87 DBA   - used scratch8 to avoid conflict with REasy 
   AccessS

   X;             6/30/87 DBA   - changed to a 4-byte scheme with RchecksumS

   X;             6/30/87 PFS   - separated into ShowINIT and InnerShowINIT

   X;             7/1/87  DBA   - fixed stack bug and switched to CurApName+

   X;             7/2/87  PM    - added check for old signature in ApplScratch 
   for

X;                                 backword compatibility (TMON Startup)

   X;             7/3/87  PM    - removed _SysBeep in ErrorExit since it causes
   a crash

X;                                 also changed ICN# plotter to srcOr mode for 
Blinker

   X;             7/13/87 PM    - fixed a3 trashing bug in InnerShowINIT - exit
   code left

X;                                word on stack (reported by D. Dunham)

   X;             7/21/87 PM    - due to popular demand, InitGraf is no longer 
   being called

X;                                 this avoids the problem with Startupscreens 
getting X;                                 Rwashed outS by ShowINIT though 
someone else is still X;                                   bound to call 
InitGraf sooner or later (i.e. InitWindows)

   X;             7/29/87 PM    - Put InitGraf back in; this is required 
   (reported by C. Derossi

X;                                 at Apple Tech Support).  Took out

After seeing all the requests for sounds lately, I felt a flood of generosity 
and put every sound I have into a publicly accessible ftp archive.  They are 
all in BinHex format, for easy digestion.

The machine that this archive is on is already heavily loaded, so PLEASE do not
use it during normal business hours or early evening.  I sortof happen to be 
the system administrator for it, so if I see ftpd taking up a lot of cpu time 
during busy periods, it gets nuked.

Ok, enough of the stern fatherly stuff:

        name:   umn-cs.cs.umn.edu

        acct:   anonymous

        passwd: <whatever>

The sounds are in pub/macintosh as sound.<whathaveyou>.hqx.

If you are not on the internet (gasp!) I can E-mail you the sounds one-by-one,

but it's not a fun thing to do.

Robert:

I agree with most of your comments about MacTran Plus. It is not a very nice 
system to work with. However, at least it produces correct code as far as I 
know, as opposed to Absoft/Microsoft Fortran.

I think Language Systems Corporation's Fortran is greatly superior to either of
these products. The interface is very clean (since most of it is Apple's MPW) 
and it is quite compatible with VAX Fortran. The new version (1.1) has improved
its speed significantly -- it now beats MacTran for execution time, and equals 
Absoft.

Subject: Aztec C

Has anyone used the current version of Aztec C that runs as a tool under MPW? 
And I was told that their source level debugger also can run under MPW. Has 
anyone used it. Any feedback on these new products is appreciated. I'm 
especially interested in the source level debugger. And I know MPW 3.0 will 
also have one --- anyone know how they "may" compare?

Aztec claims much better results on a Mac II Dhrystone benchmark than MPW C and
LS C. I don't know how relevant this is, but it's interesting since Aztec has 
gotten very little media support in the Mac press compared to MPW and LS C 
which get most of the press attention.

One thing that's hard to believe abou t their bench mark results: object size 
in Aztec (and MPW) was 4K and in LS 107K. Were they counting the size of the 
total LS project or a "built" application?

Subject: MPW C global data limit - HELP!

Does anyone out there know how to get around MPW's 32k size limit for the

global data segment?

I am porting a large application from Sun UNIX to the Macintosh II, using MPW C
(version 2.02).  The product is a library which will be linked with the user's 
"top-level" application.  I would like to get it to compile on the Macintosh 
without making drastic changes to the code (currently it compiles on the Sun, 
VAX/VMS, and MicroVax).  That is, we maintain a single version of the source 
which compiles on each machine using #ifdef <system> where necessary for 
machine-dependent routines.  Right now it looks as if we cannot compile the 
library on the Macintosh without major contortions.

The application contains large amounts of static data and string constants, and
this seems to be the problem: the linker expires with

### Link: Error  More than 32,768 bytes of global variables: 79346

I tried removing all the string constants from our source files and placing 
them in a separate file; this reduced the global data size by about 30k. The 
static variables must remain static to avoid naming conflicts.  Are there any 
other solutions?  I could find nothing in the MPW documentation. Even an option
to store strings in a separate segment would help.  Am I just missing something
obvious?  If MPW C cannot do it, is there another compiler that will?

Please E-mail to me direct, or even call collect.  Any replies will be

summarized to the net.  Thanks in advance,

The apple "LaserPrep" file contains a (partial) Quickdraw interpreter for the 
Laserwriter written in Postscript.  Since most Macintosh app- lications speak 
Quickdraw, I assume this was done to shift some of the burden of translation to
Postscript to the printer's CPU.  Obviously the LaserPrep file came with your 
SE on the System Tools disks, but unfor- tunately the Postscript code you need 
sits in the resource fork of that file, so that you can't simply upload it with
XModem or something similar. You may or may not be able to extract the 
Postscript routines with Res- Edit and paste them into a text file (I haven't 
tried this), but there is a better way... Alisa Systems, developer of the 
Alisatalk file/print server for VMS has written a little program that pulls all
the resources out of the apple Laserprep file and generates a nice text file 
containing the entire Postscript code in an easy to manipulate format.  You may
be able to get this program from Alisa Systems, Inc...

Unfortunately, this isn't quite the end of your problems.  In order to download
a Laserprep to the printer you have to reset the printer first. This can be 
done by appending a Postscript reset command to the beginning of the Laserprep 
file, but if your printer is shared by other people, they may not be happy when
their downloaded fonts and Postscript dictionaries suddenly disappear... :-(

Good luck...

I haven't heard of a hardware device that would make it possible to hook a 
non-Appletalk laser printer up to Appletalk, but there is another (although 
probably much more expensive) solution.  A company by the name of Alisa Systems
makes a very slick package called "Alisatalk for VMS" which allows you to 
configure any VMS machine as a file/print server for Macs.

At the Computing Center at the University of Mass, Amherst, we are currently 
running the Alisatalk package on several DEC Vaxstation 2000s, using a Kinetics
Fastpath gateway to allow the Macs on Appletalk to talk to the micro Vaxen on 
Ethernet.  We are using the Alisa Print System to set up queues for our Apple 
Laserwriters, but it appears to be just as easy to go to any Postscript printer
using this system.

Subject: Re:  Accessing Mac laserprep/postscript files

I posted a rather lengthy description of my experiences with postscript files 
from the mac being printed on VAXen, etc, but the kernel is this. To generate 
just the postscript, hold down 'F', or cmd-F (if your application doesn't like 
the simple 'F'). However, to initialize the laserwriter, you need to prepend 
the postscript file with the laser prep file from your mac. To do that, hold 
down 'K', or cmd-K. That should do it. Remember that the 'K' option will create
a substantially larger file than the 'F', so it really only pays to use it for 
the first file you wish to print. I haven't really played around with timing 
such events, but I would assume that if every file were prepended with the 
laser prep file, then you'd have to sit thru laserwriter initialization every 
time you print. That sounds awfully time consuming to me. And aren't computers 
supposed to save us time? :-) Email me if you've got any other comments or 
questions.

This problem is easily solved by knowing the physical layout of your network.  
When I had localtalk, I kept a map that showed the location of all macs and all
connectors, and their order on the line.  When there was a disconnection, I 
basically did a binary search, picking a mac in the middle, seeing if the 
laserwriter showed up in chooser.  If I didn't see the laserwriter, I moved 
closer to it.  If I saw the laserwriter, I would have moved farther away.  
Pretty soon I had narrowed it down to the wire between two of the machines and 
there was the break.  In my case, it happened that the cleaning people had 
moved the LaserWriter too far.

I actually had a real wierd problem with the phonenet that I just put in to 
replace the aforementioned localtalk net.  I decided to put in a bus topology 
net, with a wire running down the hall, and a 12 foot branch into each office. 
When I got my test suite of 9 macs running, I discovered that some machines 
could see our laserwriter, but not appleshare, some could see only appleshare 
and others could see both. This had me stumped, since this isn't a simple break
in a line.  After a bit of grumbling, I discovered that I had left one of the 
terminating resistors shorted out, causing a large packet loss.  I had been 
getting reflections off of the short, and some machines were just the wrong 
length from the short and the other machine.  To find this, I disconnected all 
the macs, and sat down with a ohmmeter (not a trick you can play with 
localtalk).

To Reuben Gellman and other netters:

I am assuming that I'm not the 16th response.

For those needing LaserPrep files in their PostScript for non-LaserWriters

(or LW's not normally init'ed with LaserPrep):

To get normal PostScript press command-F immediately after OKing the print 
dialog box.  I sometimes click OK, then press command-F, then release mouse to 
insure that all is interpretted ok.  Continue holding command-F until "Creating
PostScript file" dialog box comes up.

To get PS with LaserPrep header prepended, do as above except use command-K 
instead of command-F.  Your file will be approx. 25K larger, and contain all 
the LPrep code for printing elsewhere.

Subject: LaserWriter printing Blacks problem

I have run into a odd problem with my laserwriter Plus that I hope someone out 
there can provide a solution.  About one month ago, the laserwriter all of a 
sudden started printing very light (about 50% grey on areas that should have 
been black).  I immediately changed cartridges, but that didn't correct the 
problem (it was a refilled cartridge that had been very good). I cleaned all of
the wires including the one in the cartrigde.  Since then I have been through 5
cartridges (both new, and refilled) and the problem persists.

Now comes the even weirder part.  A friend of mine that owns a graphics arts 
house has the same problem at about the same time.  She has been through 12 
cartridges and only two have produced blacks but only for a short time (about 
1,000 sheets).  We both know to run about a 100 to 200 sheets to get it going. 
But after a 1000+ sheets and you still don't have anything approaching black, 
you become suspect.  Does anyone have an idea on what the problem might be.  We
are both getting desperate, especially her since her livlehood is based on the 
laserwriter.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Appletalk Printers

Having gotten disgusted with the problems inherent in printing mailing labels 
on an Imagewriter II, I am looking for an alternative. This suggests the 
following three questions:

1.  Is there any other printer, preferably fairly inexpensive and with a decent
tractor feed, that will work on an Appletalk network?

2.  What inexpensive printers with decent tractor feeds will work with

a Mac if they are hooked up directly?

3.  Is it possible to hook up my (parallel interface) Epson MX-80 to a Mac+ for
the sole purpose of doing labels?  (Oh, how I wish that the Imagewriter had a 
tractor feed half as reliable as that obsolete Epson.)

Subject:  3270 emulation on a Mac

I have recently seen a question posted about IBM 3270 terminal emulation for 
Macintosh.  I believe there is no cheap way to do it.  I checked into that a 
few months ago and all products were of the order of 1k green ones.  What we 
actually did was to get IBM 3174 controller (model 51R) with the AEA option 
(asynch emulation adapter).  I guess IBM must be doing something right this 
time -- it works really well.  You have access to either IBM or ASCII host from
any of the terminals attached to it.  Every terminal behaves like 3270 when 
connected to IBM host and like VT100 terminal when connected to an ASCII host. 
Yes, you can use IBM 3270 terminals to work on non-IBM computer and vice versa.
 Neat.  How does Mac fits there?  You probably guessed by now. We have an SE 
running VersaTerm attached to one of AEA ports.  It makes a very good 3270 
terminal with all the features offered by VersaTerm available. One can use 
VersaTerm to substitute for IBM's function keys.  We haven't tried this but it 
seems that QuicKeys could be used to actually use function keys on an extended 
keyboard to simulate IBM's PF keys.  3174 can be connected to an IBM host in a 
number of ways including remote hookup.  The only missing functionality is a 
direct file transfer -- that is simpler than Kermit or text capture which we 
use at a moment.  Since many shops do have 3174's installed, the AEA option is 
a worthwhile consideration to utilize Macs as full-screen terminals with 
nothing extra needed at the Macintosh end (except a good VT100 emulation).

Disclaimer:  the above opinions are MINE... and I surely have no association

with IBM except being a satisfied user...

From: Peter DiCamillo <CMSMAINT%BROWNVM.BITNET@Forsythe.Stanford.EDU> Subject: 
Release of Brown University's tn3270 for the Macintosh

Please forgive the posting of this announcement to several relevant

distribution lists.

The first release of Brown University's tn3270 for the Macintosh is now 
available.  This program consists of the NCSA TCP/IP kernel by Tim Krauskopf 
and Gaige B. Paulsen, Telnet 3270 option negotiation code developed by Greg 
Minshall at Berkeley, and 3270 emulation and Macintosh user interface code 
developed at Brown.  It allows a Macintosh with a TCP/IP connection to access a
host as a full-featured 3270 terminal. tn3270 is available via Internet 
anonymous FTP, over BITNET, or from Brown for a small distribution fee.  
Details of tn3270's features and availability are provided below.

NETWORK FEATURES

tn3270 includes all the features of version 2.0 of the NCSA TCP/IP kernel.  
These include support for both Ethernet connections and LocalTalk connections 
via a Kinetics gateway, a built-in FTP server, and domain nameserver support. 
Also, tn3270 supports dynamic IP number assignment when a Kinetics gateway is 
running KIP code, and allows the user to override the default Telnet terminal 
type and port number.

EMULATION FEATURES

On all Macintoshes, tn3270 emulates a 3278 with extended highlighting, APL, and
the APL/Text character set.  In addition, most graphics capabilities of a 3179 
G or PC/GX are emulated.  tn3270 also supports several 3270 enhancements, 
including typeahead and special blank processing.

On a Macintosh II (or other Macintosh with color Quickdraw) tn3270 supports 
3279 base color, four color, and eight color text, and eight color 3179 
graphics.  On Macintoshes with large screens, tn3270 supports either 9 or 
12-point text for 24 lines, and 32 lines using 9-point text.

Although primarily a 3270 emulation program, tn3270 also provides basic line 
mode Telnet support, and emulates a VT-52 terminal.

MACINTOSH FEATURES

tn3270 allows the 3270 cursor to be moved with a single mouse click, and allows
the user to set the function of a double mouse click.  Full MultiFinder support
is provided, and on color Macintoshes the standard color picker may be used to 
set any screen colors.  tn3270 utilizes offscreen bitmaps for fast, 
flicker-free screen refreshing.  The speed of tn3270 can approach that of a 
locally-connected 3270, with updates as fast as two screens per second.

SPECIAL FEATURES

In addition to FTP server support, special support is provided for VM/CMS file 
transfer.  Easy-to-use CMS RMAC and WMAC commands may be used to upload and 
download files during a CMS terminal session through the Telnet connection.  
Data transfer rates can be as high as 10K bytes/second.

Brown also distributes an asynchronous terminal program, Term, which provides a
user interface nearly the same as tn3270's when used with an IBM 7171.  The 
combination of Term and tn3270 provides users with a consistent terminal 
interface, whether they have a high-speed network connection or a modem 
connection.  The same CMS RMAC and WMAC commands also work with Term.

HOW TO OBTAIN TN3270

Brown encourages tn3270 to be freely distributed, provided the program is not 
modified and the copyright notices are retained. tn3270 can be obtained in any 
of the following ways:

Anonymous FTP from BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU (128.148.128.40):

   The distribution files are in the highest level directory.  Begin by 
   retrieving the file $READ-ME.FIRST which describes the other files.

Anonymous FTP from NCSA (128.174.20.50):

   The distribution files are the contents of the directory

   NCSA_Telnet/tn3270.

BITNET distribution from LISTSERV@BROWNVM.BITNET:

   Request the distribution files by sending LISTSERV the command "get tn3270 
   package".  This command may be sent as a message over BITNET, or as the 
   first line of text in standard RFC 822 formatted mail. Other packages 
   available are "tn3270xf" for the CMS file transfer programs, and "term" for 
   the Term program.  Issue the command "get local filelist" for a complete 
   list of available files.

Mail order from Brown:

   Starting on September 1, Brown will accept mail orders for copies of the 
   tn3270 disk and documentation.  To place an order, send a check payable to 
   Brown University for $20 to:

      tn3270 Distribution

      Brown University Computer Store

      P.O. Box 1885

      Providence, RI 02912

   (Orders from Rhode Island must include 6% sales tax.)

KEEPING UP-TO-DATE

The NCSA Telnet Digest will be used for discussing issues related to tn3270, as
well as NCSA Telnet.  To subscribe to the digest, send a request to 
telnet-request@ncsa.uiuc.edu.

SOURCE AVAILABILITY

tn3270 source is written for Manx Aztec C, using the MPW-compatible library and
include files.  Brown intends to distribute the source in the near future.  An 
announcement of source availability will be made in the NCSA Telnet Digest 
mentioned above.

Subject: MacTerminal bombing Mac II

I use MacTerminal 2.2 to login to a host VAX and to transfer files with macput 
and macget.  Either after I perform a file transfer or within a few operations 
after exiting MacTerminal, my Mac II dies--the pointer disappears, I can get no
response, and I have to manually restart.

I'm using System 4.2, Finder 6.0, sometimes MultiFinder, and also the following
inits:  UploadNIPramFix, WatchINIT5.0, Kolor, ApplicationMenu, Front&Center, 
SFScrollInit, Preview, DiskTop.INIT, SaratogaKey, Vaccine, VirusWarningINIT, 
Dimmer, QuickerGraf, ChooseCDEV, and MenuTimeINIT.  A friend has a similar 
problem; is it a bug in MacTerminal?  Any clues as to how to fix it?

[I would first try removing all the INITs and see if the transfers work okay.  
If they still bomb, I would suggest finding a copy of MacTerminal 2.3 and see 
if any bug fixes help.  Have your system files been corrupted in any way?  You 
might try replacing them if you're suspicious.  - Lance]

A recent trade-expo - APPLEWORLD - was recently held in Singapore. The response
was fantastic, and unfortunately, so were the prices. But never mind that for 
the moment. There were many booths showing DTP, DP, Hypercard, etc. Farallon 
was there with their Sound-Recorder, Ashon-Tate was there in full force, even 
giving seminars, though no free Fullwrite Pro (sigh). But most of the people in
the sales force was disappointing. They were mostly technically incompetent. 
There was this guy showing off AUX and didn't know much of it. I was hoping to 
see Intermedia running, with X-windows and all. But all that was shown was 4 
TERMS running together with a primitive ASCII maze game running on each of 
them. I am sorry to say that the only booth that impresses a lot of people was 
the one showing Interleaf. The lady doing the demo was competent enough to 
answer many technical questions. Apple and third-party need to brush up their 
act in such shows overseas if they want to sell internationally, and to 
companies who will not be hyped !!!

        A company called ZOOM Telephonics, located in Boston, is offering the

Hayes-compatible and comes with a 2 year warranty.

        Has anybody heard of Zoom Telephonics ? Even better, is someone out 
there using one of their modems, and if so, does it work as well as most 2400 
baud modems on imperfect lines?

   Thanks for any information. The price is right, but I'd like to know a

   My questions  are  these:  Does  anybody  have  a  list  of  available

math/stats packages with a good description of capabilities/value  for

   the  MAC?   Does  anyone  have  experience  with  Kinko's   Courseware

offerings (are they good/bad?) ?

>>>>>>>>

I can offer a totally biased overview of stats software on the Mac. >> 
Disclaimer: I am the author of of the the packages mentioned (Data Desk) so I 
am not an unbiased commentator <<< The main statistics packages on the Mac are 
Data Desk Professional (from Odesta Corp.), StatView II (Abacus Concepts), and 
Systat (Systat, Inc). Of these 3 only Systat runs elsewhere (translation: it 
was ported from the PC). Data Desk is (in my humble opinion) the most Macish of
the lot, using a desktop interface, multiple windows, and offering dynamic 
graphics along with its statistics. StatView II uses a spreadsheet format and 
offers some pretty presentation-style displays along with a standard array of 
statistics capabilities. Systat offers more statistics capabilities than the 
others, but has a decidedly un-macish feeling to it.

 All three offer a respectable range of statistics and graphics capabilities, 
and in StatView (for presentation graphs) and Data Desk (for data analysis 
graphs like rotating plots and linked displays) you can find capabilities that 
are just not available on the PC or any mainframe.

 Data Desk is also available through Kinko's in a Student version. That version
has the same desktop interface, but is limited in size and capabilities to 
match the needs of the typical introductory stats course.

Subject: RE: Mouse cleaners

I have been using the mousecleaner 360 since before it was known by that name 
(I don't recall the original name, but I first tried it when it was being 
manufactured in someone's garage near here), and have been very happy with its 
performance.  Our college, Franklin & Marshall, is an AUC (Apple University 
Consortium) campus, and the mac is very heavily used by students, faculty and 
administration alike.  Since I am the computer electronics tech in charge of 
preventive maintenance on these macs, I have had the dubious honor of cleaning 
the crud out of more mice than I'd like to remember, and after almost two years
on the job I am only on my second mousecleaner 360.  The unit is basically a 
plastic pad with a circular patch of velcro glued to it, a ball that replaces 
the regular ball with one covered in velcro, and a bottle of cleaning fluid 
which is mostly alcohol.  You squirt some cleaning fluid on the velcro mouse 
ball, put it in the mouse in place of the regular ball, turn the mouse over and
run it in a circular motion on top of the velcro pad.  The velcro mouseball 
does a pretty good job of scraping the gunk off of the rollers inside the mouse
quickly and easily ( I once cleaned 35 mice in one of our student user rooms in
under 45 minutes).  The only part of the mousecleaner that wears out is the 
fuzzy velcro pad.  After about 50 uses it begins to shed fibers.  This doesn't 
cause any problems with the mice you might subsequently clean using it, but the
hooks in the velcro mouseball don't get as good a purchase on the fuzzy pad and
the efficiency of the unit begins to drop.  I would guesstimate that my first 
mousecleaner lasted somewhere between 200-300 mousecleanings before I finally 
retired it to the great mousehole in the sky and got a new one.  Well worth the
fifteen bucks it cost me.

It seems to me I saw a posting back in May or June that mentioned a project at

your LocalTalk was connected to Ethernet via a Kinetics FastPath. I lost the

Please reply directly to me as well as to the net - I receive digests only at

We have just the situation I described: LocalTalk -> Kinetics -> Ethernet ->

   I believe there is a program for the Mac called "MegaBrot".  If you are

I got a very nice MegaBrot poster from the show.  It credits MegaGraphics and 
gives no other info besides the caption, "These images were created using the 
MegaBrot Engine designed by MegaGraphics, Inc. for the Macintosh II Computer. 
This special purpose device is optimized for performing the iterative test 
necessary to determine if a given point on the complex plane is a member of the
Mandelbrot Set. State-of-the-art microchip technology allows the MegaBrot to 
perform 5 million iterations per second, dozens of times faster than a 
comperable software algorithm."  Make what you will of that, the lady I spoke

Subject: changing the date format

I have just recently become a Mac user and a reader of this bboard so please 
formgive me if this has been discussed before.

I have been using Microsoft Word.  It has a way to have the current date 
inserted in the document.  However it only prints as mm/dd/yy. The manual 
implies that it relies on Mac OS to generate this string.

Questions:  Is it the Mac OS that formats the date string?  How do I go about 
changing the format (without being a Mac programmer) -- hopefully with several 
options (e.g., "dd-mmm-yy", "dd month year", "month day, year").  Surely, there
must be a DA or something to change it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: Microtek Scanner

Does anyone know if it is possible to import images scanned with a Microtek 
Scanner using VersaScan software into Aldus Freehand?  The Scanner's manual 
says little if anything about image exportation, and Freehand's manual says the
image must be saved as a EPS file.  VersaScan supports EPS, but when opening 
the image under Freehand, only a shaded box with some text inside the box 
appears.

Freehands manual says this is due to the fact that the scanner's software does 
not bundle something called a "preview image" with EPS file.

My question is: is there a way to command VersaScan to create a preview image? 
Without it, there can be no touch-up editing with Freehand once you import the 
image.

I would call Microtek, but will reserve that course of action as a last

resort.

Many thanks,

Subject: SCSI Cables

Okay Mac folks...Can someone help me out with the pin-outs of SCSI cables?

Rather than pay an arm and a leg for a simple cable, I have decided to make 
them myself. My XP60 is sitting on the right edge of my desk, and I'm afraid of
accidently toppling it over. So, among other kind of cables, I want to make an 
extension cable.

I know, I know, you are saying..."For an extension cable, simply connect each 
wire to the exact opposite on the other end". Yes, but here I have another 
question. What is the max length that the SCSI cable can be?

Now, the crucial info that I need...

1. What is the pin out of the 50 pin SCSI connector? 2. What is the pin out of 
the 25 pin SCSI connector (at the back of the Mac+) 3. If I want to connect 
another SCSI device, what would the pin connections be

   from

      a

      b

      c

Thanx in advance...

Subject: Slot interrupt service routine

We are making a CPU card which is plugged in the NuBus slot of Macintosh II for
our study.  When the card needs the 68020 attention, it asserts the /NMRQ of 
NuBus (pin 31 in Row A).  We designed to put the slot interrupt service routine
in the disk, as there is not enough space for the declaration ROM on the card. 
Now the card works well, but the service routine has not developed yet.

We wish to use the board as soon as possible.  Help us please.  Though I wrote 
a simple monitor program to test the card, I'm a novice of Mac II software.

I think I can use SIntInstall (Inside Mac V-427) to install the service 
routine.  Do any routines need to be executed before SIntInstall?  The result 
code of the routine is -2.  It is "invalid queue element".  What does it mean?

The first argument of SIntInstall is sIntQElmPtr, and SQType field of 
SlotIntQElement should be set to SIQType (Inside Mac V-427).  SIQType is 
undefined in MPW Pascal. Why?  I declared it as followings.  Is it correct?

   const SIQType = 6;

I cannot understand the relation between SIntInstall and

OpenSlot (Inside Mac V-427).

Any suggestions, examples and help would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: MacWorld Report

Well, I'm back from the Boston MacWorld expo to take up the dirty duties of a 
moderator and crank out a couple of digests for you.  Your only task is to read
said digests starting with this bit of drivel about what you may or may not 
have missed out on.

First of all, the Nth semiannual Netter's Dinner went off without any serious 
hitches.  The most confusing part about the whole thing was where to meet, so 
we all sort of met at the restaurant.  It was, once again, a delicious repast 
of the finest Chinese delicacies, especially that poor fish who stared at us 
while we devoured him, but it wasn't nearly as hot as the feast we had in 
January in SF, nor was it as crowded.  It was without a doubt worth doing and I
hope more of you will join us in January again.

The official list, for those of you that give a s**t, is:

        Robert Hammen           JimH

        Barry Semo              Pippen

        Kent Borg               Chris Vagnini

        Barry Ward              Stuart Schmukler

        Peter Freund            Richard & Steve Young

        Stephen Sakamoto        Keith Combs

        Miles Weissman          Kevin Willey

        Guy Riddle              Bill Hoffmann

        Art Goodall             Elliot Schlessel

        David Rosenberg         Ned Horvath

        Peter Olsen             Joel West

        Jeff Shulman            John Draper

        David Dunham            and me, of course.

Enough of that, on to the show.  For me the show was quite predictable.  The 
only thing really being celebrated was Hypercard's first birthday with a very 
loud party that lasted well into the sweltering Boston night.  Of course, the 
Westin was air conditioned so maybe that explains all the people.  Of course 
the free booze probably played a part too.

Since the Apple Scanner was so underwelming, (I mean, who really cares about 
another scanner?) I was hoping some of the third parties would take up the 
slack.  There were some new software packages, but there were also the guys we 
have all seen before.  Lightspeed Pascal 2.0 was being shown.  It is everything
you would expect it to be, at least until it gets into the hands of users who 
will quickly discover what it is missing.  It will be Object Pascal although 
since they don't support MPW's segmentation directives they will be creating a 
special version of MacApp to distribute.

There were video cards and genlock systems and Mac IIs everywhere.  Adobe had 
at least 15 Mac IIs in front of their large screen demo.  Big booths were in. 
The walls were covered by the little guys in their curtains covered with hand 
lettered signs.  There were suits everywhere.  I thought it was quite stuffy 
through the whole show and I don't mean the heat.  The only people who would 
stand and talk were either salesmen or ordinary folks.  All the suits seemed to
be ignoring the commoners.  Perhaps this is just my perception, but I got a lot
of unfriendly looks from suits and smiles from regular people wearing shorts 
and tees.  Oh, the longing for the good old days (like Scott Knaster said at 
the BCS meeting, "It's a strange business where we can reminice about the good 
old days a mere four years ago.").

At any rate, the best games of the show were Colony by Mindscape and 
Shufflepuck from Broderbund.  Colony is a simulated 3d environment with a theme
similar to Planetfall in that you are investigating a deserted colony and you 
have to defeat the monsters and find the people.  I haven't even scratched the 
surface of this game yet, but it involves moving around in real time in a wire 
frame world.  Impressive speed and fast on a Mac II.  Runs under Multifinder 
too.  Shufflepuck is airhockey.  Fast and furious.  If you have hand-eye 
coordination, this game is for you.

There were a zillion cad programs, including a low end MacDraw challenger from 
Broderbund called Drawing Tablet and the new Claris CAD program. Internal 
modems were being shown, so that is about to task off.  Once Apple decides how 
to deal with more than two serial ports things should really fly.

Mac II users should check out Screen Gems from MicroSeeds.  This package 
includes Dimmer, ColorDesk, Switch-a-Roo, TN-3 (named after the robot in 
Asimov's "Satisfaction Guarenteed"), and Globe.  Dimmer and Switch-a-Roo have 
been seen on the net but ColorDesk does as a cdev what DeskPICT does as an 
INIT. ColorDesk is much more flexible and powerful in my eyes.  TN-3 allows you
to change the Finder's color menu, but only to one of their preset color 
combinations.  If it gave me a the picker I would really have loved this puppy.
 Globe is a beautiful color version of EarthIdle.  Right now I have it balanced
on the tip of Mickey the Wizard's finger.  Paul Mercer used some very nice 
shading to make it look spherical.

APDA is shipping MacApp 2.0b5 which includes a new manual.  According to Apple 
this version is a lot easier to learn and substantially different. Typical, 
huh?  APDA is also shipping a lot of Hypercard stuff including the Appletalk 
and Serial XCMDs and a couple of other "HyperTools" disks.  Also shipping is 
ResEdit 1.2b2 which is supposed to replace all other versions, as usual.  I 
want to know if we can still post this necessary MacHacker program. Any word 
from anyone at Apple?

Well this is droning on.  If anyone has any questions or comments about the

show, feel free to write.

Subject: My Ideal Disk backup program

Once upon a time when I was younger, I used to dream of writing better software
everytime I came up against limitations of the tools I use every day; now I am 
resigned to passing the ideas on to somebody and hoping *they* will write 
better software.

Both on VMS and on the MAC, I wish every day that somebody would make better 
backup programs. I am not asking for anything that can't be done: The Sperry 
Univac 1100 Series machines had this 15 years ago. They called it the "SECURE" 
backup system.

What I want is a "virtual disk storage" integrated with the backup facility and
with an archival facility. The concepts apply equally to VMS, and to the MAC 
and would probably fit UNIX also.

The system involves a new state that a file can be in: *UNLOADED*. An unloaded 
file retains its identity, but the disk space it occupies has been released.

1. A backup program allows a full backup or an incremental since

   last backup. For each file, a note is made of the volume the file was copied
   to. This note could be placed in the system file catalog (if the OS people 
   can be convinced this is a good idea) or in a separate file which I'll call 
   the Backup Journal. A copy of the backup journal should be written to the 
   last volume of the backup.

2. On an incremental backup, the system should load the backup journal

   from a previous backup, rather than using the currently online

   backup journal.

   This will allow you to first do a full backup, then do weekly backups of 
   "anything changed since the full backup". This will mean much less storage 
   for backup disks, because it is mostly the same files that change.

3. The backup program should enforce a standard volume labeling for

   backup volumes; 6 - 10 characters is probably reasonable, and allow for some
   interaction to ensure against overlap. (I like a 4-character system 
   identifier and a 4-digit sequence number that can only go up).

4. The backup volumes on a MAC should be valid HFS volumes. The backup

   program should allow large files to be split, but should refuse to split 
   files smaller than half a floppy. A suitable algorithm might be

      - sort all files by descending size.

      - if the file is larger than a whole volume (or half one, if you are

         tolerant), break it; after the whole file has been copied, continue

         this algorithm.

      - if the file will fit on the current volume, copy it to backup.

            else set it aside for now and try the next one. - at the end of the
      list, close volume and switch to next volume. - on the new volume, start 
      from the top again. - at the end, copy out the backup journal. - unloaded
      files are merged in at the end of the backup set.

         yes, this will create a lot of disk swapping for a single-floppy 
         system with a hard disk, but it economizes tremendously on backup 
         volumes.

5. A utility program allows the user to free up some percentage of disk

   space by marking as *UNLOADED* files with a current backup that have not 
   been used recently. "UNLOAD UNTIL PERCENT = xx".

6. When somebody attempts to open an unloaded file, the

   program is suspended while the file is restored. On the MAC the right way to
   do this would be to have the "Insert Disk" dialog box pop up and request the
   backup diskette.

7. The OPEN FILE system call should have an extra option to allow

   people to specify that they do not want the file restored if it is unloaded.
   (Really optional if there is a way to read the archive pointer instead).

The requirements for supporting such a system are:

   a. a hook to get called on every "OPEN" to see if the file is available

      or needs to be restored.

   b. at least one bit in the file header (master file directory entry,

      i-node, whatever) for the *UNLOADED* flag.

   c. space in a directory extension file for backup pointers,

      number of times used since creation and date/time last used. (To be used 
      for calculating unload eligibility).

   d. the ability to activate a restore utility when needed.

When will we see such a system ?

---------------------------------------------------------------

This group is designed to provide information for software tool developers that
are responsible for integrating heterogeneous software products. This can 
include in-house and vendor supplied. Usually, the integration of the products 
is designed to provide an environment that makes using the tools easier. The 
basic issue is to build a `framework' around the tools that provides a common 
and consistent view of the system.

The framework is not limited to homogeneous environments, but also can span 
heterogeneous systems. Companies like EDA and government sponsored projects 
like EIS are trying to tackle this problem. This group can be viewed as a forum
for users and developers to voice their opinions on this subject. Frameworks 
are common in the area of CAD/CAE, CASE and office automation; but they are not
limited to only these areas.

Topics open for discussion are:

   Tool encapsulation    Data Management             Network Computing

SubLaunch is a collection of shareware programs which launch SuperPaint or

Subject: bug in MPW 2.0.2 release? linker error on sample program

Subject: build?

Hello all you mac netters --

MacWorld in Boston was great and a great dinner at the Shanghai house! Thanks 
to all of the Info-Mac dinner arrangers in Boston. I will soon send out a 
summary of some interesting items I found at the Convention.

BUG?  A question that at the moment has at least six developers (including 
several at Apple that I asked at MacWorld) stumped -- maybe one of you netters 
stumbled across it too!

I recently received MPW 2.0.2 and Pascal 2 (finally). Unfortunately, when I 
attempt to build the sample program (or testperf) using the supplied make file,
the linker hangs!  After command-period I get resource error -45, as follows: 
----------------------------------------- # 5:51:44 PM ----- Build of sample. #
5:51:44 PM ----- Analyzing dependencies. # 5:51:47 PM ----- Executing build 
commands.

   Rez Sample.r -o Sample -append

   SetFile -a B Sample -c PSMP -t APPL

   Link Sample.p.o "dick:MPW:Libraries:"Interface.o 
   "dick:MPW:Libraries:"Runtime.o "dick:MPW:PLibraries:"Paslib.o -o Sample

(MPW hangs here, and after hitting command-period I get: )

### Link: Error  Resource I/O error, # -45 while adding resource.

### Link: Errors prevented normal completion.

-----------------------------------------

There is no indication in the MPW manual or Pascal manual of this or any other 
linker errors, at least that I can find, so I am stuck at the moment, and can't
get even to first base.

Configuration: Mac II, 4 megabytes, running under Finder (not MultiFinder). 
Same problem occurs under System 4.2 and System 6.0. Any suggestions? I never 
had this particular problem with MPW 1.0.

From: NOBIVM

Hello again

The other day I sent a note regarding my problems with Turbo Pascal, now I have
looked more at the problem.  Here is a more correct description of the problem:

My problem is, as written earlier, that when I RUN the program from within the 
TURBO PASCAL editor everything works fine (the program size is 145kb). In my 
previous note I assumed that the problem occured during the 
initialization,before reading the resources (after a compilation to disk (and 
then launcing the APPL from FINDER)). This is not the case. The problem is more
subtle than that, because it happens during a loop like this:

   For counter:=1 to 7 do

   Begin

            GotoXY(50,counter);WriteLn('      some spaces     ');

   GotoXY(50,counter);WriteLn(A_Real_Type_Variable#counter$:9:0);

end;

If I RUN the program, everything is OK.

If I COMPILE it TO DISK, and run it using FILE TRANSFER, then it is still

OK.

Then, if I launch the application from FINDER, it takes about 5 minutes to 
perform this loop.  That's not all, it wipes out the screen as well,

   almost like an endless loop using WRITELN('              '); after

which the program behaves well again.   The next time the program is

doing the same loop, everything works fine.

I have not changed this part of the program for a long time, but the program 
behaved well only 2 weeks ago which was the last time I compiled to disk. If 
someone could give me a hint of what is going on here, I would be more than 
happy|||

Subject: Opening StuffIt files from the Finder

For those of you who are upset that StuffIt 1.40B cannot have documents opened 
from the Finder, simply add two resources to StuffIt and it can!

mstr 102 (same as a STR ) "File"

mstr 103 (same as a STR ) "Open Archive..." (That's Option; not ...)

Now don't you feel better?

For you language buffs, add mst# resources of the same name for a list of 
things to look for.  These are formatted like STR# resources if you couldn't 
guess.

Where can I find the most recent versions of macget/macput/xbin and related 
software to support Mac-Unix communication using the XMODEM protocol from the 
Unix side ? The versions that are in the INFO-MAC directory at

Berkeley 4.2 compatible). Please reply directly (to Frailong.pa@Xerox.COM), as 
I would like to see that done ASAP. Thanks for your help.

Subject: Need Help...

I would greatly appreciate help with the following problem:

I have been successfully using the public domain programs 'macget' and 'macput'
to accomplish SUN to Macintosh file transfers under the XMODEM protocol.  
VersaTerm PRO is used on the Macintosh end to handle data.  Upon our recent 
switch to SUNs operating system version 4.0 'macput' started failing.

About 1K bytes of data are transferred, and then the process hangs. The 
technical support at VersaTerm suggested that the SUN was (undesireably) 
recognizing real data as the XOFF character, ^S. Has anyone else experienced 
this problem.  Any help would be welcomed.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Drawing lines in TE ala HyperCard

   Hi folks,

   Does anybody know how to draw ruled lines in TextEdit, a la Hypercard? The 
   requirement is simple: basically we need to get TE to put thin gray lines in
   the TERecord's destRect - that's all. Is there some way to do this without 
   hacking into the guts of TE?

   The obvious kludgey way to do it would be to draw those lines ourselves, 
   after every call to TE that might alter the display - BUT, there is one 
   problem with TEKey, everytime a character is drawn it seems to do an erase 
   to the right edge of the destRect. (Or is this a problem with DrawChar?). 
   This results in a slight flicker, because the ruled lines are wiped out and 
   redrawn.

   The best way to do lines would be to rewrite TextEdit, but none of us are 
   exactly feeling up to it at the moment...

   Someone told me once that it is possible to customise TE by patching into 
   TEDoText - but I've never done it myself.

   Helpful replies will be appreciated! Really useful advice will be worth a 
   free lunch. A solution that even works might earn you a free mention in our 
   About Box...

   I've tried setting the Text transfer modes to scrOr and patOr but they work 
   only for the text being drawn. TEKey still erases to the right edge of the 
   destination rectangle.

   Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Subject: SCSI cables...

FYI:

The 50 pin centronics connector on the back of your XP60, like all the C50 
connectors that apple uses, is numbered differently than normal:

Normal is like this (as labelled on the connector):

1  26

2  27

3  28

.  .

.  .

.  .

Apple labels it like this:

1  2

3  4

5  6

.  .

.  .

.  .

That is, pin 1 is the same as the label on the connector, but not the

others.

The 25 pin connector on the back of your mac is just the 25 SCSI signal pins, 
without the grounds. In normal 50 pin SCSI cables, all the odd pins are 
grounds, and the even pins are signal. If you make a long SCSI cable, 6 meters 
is the max length, without the grounds or shielding, you might have RFI 
problems. I have made such extension cables, without problems, but they were 
only about a meter in length. Here is what I did:

I got two DB 25 insulation displacement connectors, one of each sex, the kind 
used to connect to ribbon cable, and some 25 conductor ribbon cable. Put the 
connectors on, one on each end, with a vice. Make sure pin 1 is connected to 
pin 1. Do not connect pin 25. Voila, SCSI extension cable.

To make a DB25 to C50 cable:

Same thing as above, but pay attention to sex, and replace one of the DB25s 
with a C50. Put the DB25 on the ribbon cable. You have to assemble the other 
end by hand, but you can use either insulation displacement C50 or (preferred) 
a solder tail C50. Remember to number the C50 correctly. Also, because of the 
way that insulation displacement connectors work, the 25 conductor cable is 
numbered strangely from pin 1. The numbering goes 1 14 2 15 ... as you go 
across the cable from pin 1. The sequence below is the cable sequence, starting
at pin 1.

Over a year ago, a package called "paintps" was posted to comp.sources.mac.  
Its main contents were designed to print Macpaint files to Unix Postscript 
printers, but it happens to include several versions of LaserWriter laserprep 
files and scripts/lpd filters that can be used to print most Postscript files 
generated from a Mac with CMD-F.  The laserprep files in the paintps package 
are modified from the normal Mac versions so that they don't try to install 
themselves permanently on the printer (unfriendly in a multiuser non-Mac 
environment).

If paintps isn't on any of the usual archive sites, I have the shar files 
(about 3000 lines in 120 Mbytes), and can e-mail them.

Subject: DEC Printer help...

From the "Help Macs in West Germany Dept." comes the following plea:

A friend of mine has a Plus connected to a DEC LNO3R Scriptprinter which was 
just upgraded with Postscript (but doesn't have Appletalk).  The problem is 
that in this 99.99% IBM infested country he's having a lot of trouble getting 
help to make this work.  So I thought I would appeal to a broader audience to 
see if anyone might have some help for him.

The problem is simply this: he can't get the printer to print anything or 
acknowledge commands.  If anyone has ANY idea how to configure this printer so 
that he can print, I would appreciate it if you could respond to me and I'll 
pass along the information.  (We have heard that the LS Laserdriver from APDA 
might work, but cant get that confirmed - if anyone has information on this, it
would be very welcomed.)

Please respond to: elliot@star.stanford.edu

Thanx in advance,

Subject: MultiFinder and Hypercard

A couple of items about the interaction of MultiFinder and Hypercard:

MultiFinder starts up my computer with four applications and ALWAYS leaves 
Hypercard as the active application.  Is this intentional?  I suspect that it 
is.  I have reset the Set Startup option a number of times just to see if it 
makes a difference.  The programs don't seem to always start up in the same 
order, but Hypercard always ends up in the front layer even if it loads before 
some others.

Next, how does MultiFinder hook into the SFGetFile call to open documents from 
the Finder?  The reason I need this info is that I want to feed MacPaint files 
to Hypercard's Import Paint dialog so that I don't have to pick the names of 
all the files I want to import.  My only option besides this is an XCMD that 
reads a MacPaint file into the clipboard.  I have looked at Andy's Import PICT 
XCMD, but it requires everything to be in a scrapbook file and I have a series 
of MacPaint or MacDraw PICT files.  So, how does MF feed the file name to a 
program?  I want to do that!

Subject: Suggested Mac feature

From: PHORWITZ@G.BBN.COM

As we all know, when you try to copy a file (e.g. from one disk to another) the
system checks to see whether you are replacing a file by the same name and 
alerts you to make sure you really want to delete the version of the file that 
is about to be copied over.  Question: how hard would it be, in these 
circumstances, for the system to check the "last modified" dates of the two 
files and give the user a special alert when the file being written over is 
more recent than the one with which it is to be replaced?  Would anyone out 
there be interested in adding this feature some time?  Maybe it could be an 
INIT.  (Maybe it already is!)

I have a vintage Mac, from about April 1984.  In the meantime it has been 
upgraded to 128K ROMs, 2 Mb RAM, a hard disk, external 800K drive, but...

The "but" is that I got a hybrid upgrade (DigiGraphics board, etc.) that left 
me with the original Mac connectors.  I have been aspiring to a PostScript 
printer, but have suddenly started to worry about whether my antiquated 
connectors will make it difficult for me to use AppleTalk.

How about it?  Are there adapters that can be used to hook my elderly

Mac to AppleTalk and a PostScript printer?

Summary

A number of new products are being offered for the Macintosh II relating to 
high-performance CAD and vision applications, as well as interconnectivity 
issues to DEC and IBM computers. This INFO-MAC posting focuses on a recent trip
 to Tektronix to evaluate their TK88K-P concurrent processor plug-in board for 
the Mac II, and a visit to MacWorld Expo in Boston, which had about 150 vendors
and 40,000 people attending.

Mac II Performance Enhancers

Seven options for increasing the performance of the Mac II have been 
investigated so far. These are listed in the current priority order of their 
interest for our purposes. This list  is still subject to considerable change 
as more information is obtained. Criteria are ease of programming and 
debugging, raw speed,  cost, intrinsic research interest, and meeting GM 
divisional needs.

1. TK88K-P Board. Tektronix has produced the first commercially available board
featuring the new 88100 microprocessor chip from Motorola.  This reduced 
instruction set computer (RISC) chip features one step per machine cycle and a 
full 51 instructions, which is much larger than other RISC chips. Its specs 
place it in a class considerably above other currently available RISC chips 
such as the SUN SPARC, AMD29000, and MIPS R2000. It is currently clocked at 20 
megahertz, which produces 17 MIPS or 6 megaflops (MF). For comparison, our 
tested LINPACK results on the Mac II by itself rate it at  0.054 MF, with the 
MicroVax II at 0.13 MF, the SUN 3/260 with floating point accelerator at 0.46 
MF, and the Cray X-MP-2 at 24 MF. In addition to the 88100 chip, the board has 
three cache memories of 32K each, and 8 megabytes of on-board memory.

The complete board sells for $15,000, or $2500/MF. This compares favorably with
the Mac II alone at $91,000 /MF,  the SUN 3/160 at $111,000/MF, the MicroVax II
at $138,000/MF, and the Cray X-MP-2 at $708,000/MF. (These are rough ballpark 
estimates only).

The TK88K-P board works in a co-processor fashion with the Mac II 68020, which 
does user interface and disk and screen I/O. The board currently supports a C 
compiler and plans are under way for Fortran. Three OEM's are looking at Unix 
for workstations based on the 88100, within a 6 to 12 month time frame. A Unix 
port to their board would not be difficult as soon as someone does it once for 
the 88100 chip. Since the Lightspeed C and Pascal programming tools available 
for the Mac II are (in my opinion) superior to what I have seen in the Unix (or
any other) programming environment,  it would not be necessary to wait for the 
complete Unix workstation, but it is an important feature that it  will be 
available later for those who wish to have a Unix environment.

Our internal extensive C benchmark timing program ran on the board without 
modification. Times were 6 to 700 times faster than the MicroVax II, depending 
on the operation. For example, evaluation of a = b*c for type doubles was 10 
microsecs on the MicroVax II and 0.016 microseconds on the 88100 or 600 times 
improvement. Evaluation of a = b+c was 9.77 microsecs on the  MicroVax II and 
0.016 microseconds on the 88100 or 84 times improvement. The MicroVax II is 
about equal in speed to the Mac II 68020 or Intel 80386 (IBM OS/2).

In the coming year, Tektronix  has a number of projects to provide

further enhancements.

Consideration has also been given to the TK88K-P  board by Automatix for their 
AI-90 industrial vision computer based on the Mac II and so offers potential 
leverage if needed.

2. NuVista board. It has Texas Instruments TMS34010 Graphics System Processor 
(10 MIPS), which is C programmable from MPW, the Macintosh development system. 
With 4 Mbytes of on-board memory, it will be $5995, with October availability. 
TrueVision, 7251 Shadeland Station, Suite 100, Indianapolis, Indiana 46256. 
317-841- 0332. Advantages: On-board digitizer and display device, so no 
communications bottlenecks. Low cost. Disadvantages:  ease of programming?

3. Wytek chips. Mercury computer has announced a 3-chip set for the Mac II with
a stated 20 MF peak performance, priced at $10,000. A C and Fortran compiler 
are announced. At $500 per MF this would be the best price-performance ratio of
any computer that I am aware. Their implementation of the Wytek chip set 
somehow gives them greater performance (at least in their claims) than the 
Wyteks used in the Sun. Advantages: high  performance/cost ratio, high absolute
performance. Disadvantages: ease of programming? (We await awaiting further 
information from Mercury now).

4. NuVision. Perceptics Corp., P.O. Box 22991. Knoxville, TN 37933- 0991. 
615-966-9200.  This extremely impressive system has a complete additional box 
based on the Texas Instrument TMS320C25 Digital Signal Processor, with an 
interconnect to the Mac II which is used for user interaction.  It offers a 
complete, ready-to-use, image- processing environment with all the major image 
processing routines for under $30,000. Its specs and price place it competition
with other vision workstations (e.g. Videk) costing 5 times as much. It is 
rated low in our survey only because there is concern about ease of 
programmability of the DSP chip. Currently, the only development language 
available on the Macintosh for the TI SDP chip is an assembler. If the C 
compiler becomes available as Perceptics has indicated, this option would 
rapidly increase in priority. We have many additional routines we wish to 
implement, and so ease of programming is an important factor in our research 
environment.

5. Souped-up 68020. A 33 MHz replacement accelerator for Mac II - doubles Mac 
Speed by substituting a faster clock/CPU chip -- no other changes needed!  Has 
a 32K RAM cache too.  DayStar Digital, 5556 Atlanta Highway, Flowery Branch, GA
30542. Contact: Donna Smith, 404-967-2077. $3K to $6K, December, 1988. 
Advantages: low cost, NO additional programming required, ALL Mac applications 
are speeded up. Disadvantages: absolute speed-up of Mac II only by a factor of 
2.

6. T800 Transputers. Levco Inc. 6160 Lusk Blvd., Suit C-100, San Diego, CA 
92121. 619-457-2011. These offer 1.5 MF per transputer, with 1 megabyte of 
memory = $2400. Occam C runs on them, but development time would be increased 
because debugging tools are still limited. They are designed for parallel 
operation with easy expandability. A 20 transputer configuration in a Mac II 
was demonstrated at MacWorld, doing ray-tracing at about 1 second per

   512 pixel line, which  is about equal to  Cray performance.  Also

MacBrain and Levco have teamed up to run their neural net software on the 
transputers.  Linpack performance: 1 MFLOP/ transputer. Advantages: 
expandability to speed needed. Disadvantages: communications programming and 
debugging difficulties.

7. Apple 68030-based Mac II.  Not announced yet, but according to published 
reports (MacWeek, Aug. 8. 1988, p. 9) it has a 16 MHz 68030 chip, with 
incorporated memory management; a 68882 math coprocessor; 4 MBytes of memory; 
an 80 MByte hard disk; and the first use of the 1.44-MByte floppy. It is 
expected to be priced at less than $9,000 and would be aimed particularly at 
UNIX users who require large memory and storage space.  A 68030 upgrade board 
for existing Mac IIs is also expected to coincide with the release of the full 
68030 machine. The board is thought to yield only a disappointing 10- 20% speed
improvement over the 68020, due to a data caching facility.  Not a viable 
option.

Other Options.  A completely different option is  to purchase a 80386-based box
and add in a Mercury array processor which uses the Multibus, but this would 
not offer ease of programming and reliability of the Mercury array processor is
uncertain.  Another possibility is to add special purpose hardware  plug-in 
card to the to do a single vision application for factory application.  This 
would offer speed and low cost after development but not generality and 
adaptability.

Other Products Seen at MacWorld Convention

Digitizers.

At least five companies are offering video digitizer boards for the Mac II. The
only one without flicker of the text and full 8-bit capability on R, G, and B 
and overlay was the NuVista board (see option 2 above) by TrueVision (an 
offshoot of AT&T). It has full gen-lock capability, and four 8-bit flash a/d 
converters on input and four on output.

TrueVision also sells their VID I/O box which also conversion of

Analog RGB to NTSC for recording purposes ($750).

Image Processing.

Digital Darkroom from Graphics Software ($395) had an interesting and at times 
amazing set of capabilities to virtually duplicate all the common darkroom 
capabilities. For example, a picture with a blank sky was brought in, the sky 
(which was in multiple pieces, interrupted by trees) was segmented by automatic
grey level, a picture of clouds was brought in, and pasted only in that grey 
level -- so clouds were added to the sky, in a few seconds.

Scanners.

Apple announced its new scanner. It is only 4 bits (16 gray levels). Several 
nice software interfaces including one to Hypercard were available. A new 
low-cost 300 d.p.i. R,G,B full 8 bit on each channel scanner was announced by 
Sharp (JX-450 and JX-300, Sharp Plaza, Mahwah, N.J. 06430-2135, 201-529-8200). 
Its picture quality is excellent.

Neural Networks.

Neural network products now available for the Mac II include The Cognitron 
($600, Cognitive Software), MacBrain 1.2 (Neuronics), with NX parallel 
processors ($4150, Human Devices, based on Levco transputers).

CAD.

Swivel3D from Paracomp was a real show-stopper. It has "tweening" commands that
interpolate in time between two views to create animation sequences, and allows
any of its parts to move with separate motion paths for individual objects. 
Five rendering modes are available. These CAD products offer fast development 
and easy conceptualization but their performance is not yet up to full CAD 
development stations. A number of vendors are offering interface and file 
conversion from and to larger workstation CAD systems. The Fall 1988 Mac Buyers
guide compares 10 CAD packages for the Mac II.

Color Printing.

At least six companies now offer color printers, including Tektronix, Seiko, 
Sharp, GCC Technologies, and QMS. Avalon Development Corp. announced a $695 
color separation package that converts RGB to a color-corrected CYMB system for
color printing, a process previously requiring color separation hardware 
costing $100K or more.

Disk Drives.

CDC is offering 300-MByte and 600-MByte Wren V disk drive.

Program Development Tools.

MPW 3.0 is making strong efforts to attract the Unix base of programmers. C++ 
from AT&T will be part of the next release, and all the Apple object libraries 
in MacApp will be fully accessible from C++. APDA the Apple Programmers 
Development Association is selling t-shirts with the object definition of a 
programmer:

   TProgrammer = OBJECT(THuman)

            fNeedsCaffeine       :  BOOLEAN;

            fReadsThings         :  BOOLEAN;

            fKeepsOddHours       :  BOOLEAN;

   fHasPocketProctector :  BOOLEAN;

   FUNCTION  TProgrammer.Eat( Junk : Food): SIZE; OVERRIDE; FUNCTION  
   TProgrammer.DealWithHumans; OVERRIDE; FUNCTION  
   TProgrammer.CollectTechnoJunk;

END;

3278 and 3279 Terminal Emulation.

Avatar technologies, Inc. offers hardware/software communications products that
work in conjunction with Avatar's standard Host File Transfer software on IBM 
(CICS, CMS, or TSO formats, $500) to transfer text files between the Mac and 
IBM host network. If we already have IND$FILE  file transfer module then this 
$500 purchase is not necessary. Also only 1 copy of the IBM software is needed 
per mainframe. MacMainFrame II ($995) software and hardware (this hardware card
has the Type A coax cable connector for the IBM right out the back of the card)
 package connects the Macintosh II directly to an IBM 3270 network and allows 
3278/9 emulation with powerful file transfer capabilities and user-selectable 
color support on the Macintosh.  In other words, you can remove the 3279 
terminal off your desk ($1500) and use their MacMainFrame II and "put a 
mainframe in your Macintosh. " You can also do file transfer from the IBM, and 
use the powerful Macintosh editing commands to insert directly into your 
application, which you cannot do with the 3279 itself. MacMainFrame DX ($1195) 
is an external hardware box and software package that provides local or remote 
connection of any Macintosh to a 3270 network. This is needed only if we need 
remote connectivity and if we do not already have a cluster controller, which 
we have already at GMR, so MacMainFrame DX would not be necessary -- only  
MacMainFrame II ($995) . Avatar Technologies, 99 South St., Hopkinton, MA 
01748. 617-435-6872.  On one side of their house they have a series of boards 
which uses protocol converters to do printing. However, this is a completely 
different side of their business which specializes in Macintosh and IBM 
connectivity.

DCA  (Digital Communications Associates, 100 Alderman Drive, Alpharetta, GA 
30201, 404-442-4000, Version 1.1, $1195) also has a product called MacIrma that
is a competitor. The important difference is that Avatar has had the DX Product
for three years, and they feel that their product is more developed and more 
Mac-like in its interface.  Also they have an API or Applications Programmer 
Interface, so the application can be customized  on the Mac side, and the API  
will also support the Mac WorkStation product, a set of programming tools from 
Apple  which allows direct access to the host IBM machine.

Also available is the MacBlue/3270 IBM 3278 emulator ($95) from Wall Data, Inc.
which requires their Wall Data protocol converter (6 ports, $3995, 10 ports, 
$4995, 18 ports $5995).  Wall Data, Inc. 17769 NE 78th Pl., Redmond WA 98052.

Vax  Connectivity

The Alisa and Pacer products were reviewed. The Pacer products seem to have 
more functionality. The Alisa products allow the Vax to print over the 
Laserwriter connected to AppleNet. The Pacer products keep the print server on 
the Vax and allow you to hang your Laserwriters off the Vax. The Pacer Products
have a built in terminal products allowing multiple terminals to be open at 
once. It seems to offer more features than the VaxStation II even. DEC is 
reportedly considering purchasing the Pacer software solutions for its own 
system, according to a recent article in MacWeek: "Sources close to Digital 
Equipment Company say the computer giant, Apple's strategic ally in the mini 
and main-frame computer world, is close to acquiring licensing rights to the 
networking software line of Pacer Software, Inc. a leading Mac-to-Vax company."
Also, "PacerShare is considered by DEC developers as the premier software 
package for converting a VAX into a file server on an AppleTalk network. 
PacerLink provides communications between a Mac or IBM PC and host computers, 
including DEC VAX/VMS, Stratus, and most UNIX systems. PacerPrints is a VMS 
service for PostScript printers." In my own viewing of both Alisa and Pacer 
products, the Pacer products seemed to have more functionality, although the 
price was somewhat higher.

A complete Pacer system is about $5K, including virtual disk ability. This is 
an excellent idea as full MAC backups can then be done to the Vax over 
Ethernet. Pacer Software, 619-454-0565.

Other

Kodak offers a liquid-crystal Projection Pad for use with Mac+ computers for 
about $1500. It sits on top of an overhead projector and shows excellent 
high-contrast images of the Mac screen as large as the viewing area of the 
overhead projector. The image may not be polarized, so this would unfortunately
not be suitable for our application. Further investigation of such projection 
pads from other companies will be done, but unfortunately the Kodak one is 
reportedly the only one that gives black-white, which we also need.

Future Directions

CD-ROM  drives will prove to be a major means of storing and displaying 
information. A new form of "home entertainment center" based on interactive 
computer-controlled CD-ROM video may well be the next major consumer product to
be widely accepted in the home (potential market = 98 million  homes with TV, 
much larger than the potential market for home computers, which is only 2-3 
million), particularly as prices of CD-ROM drives fall below $1,000 in the 
coming 2-3 years.

Videoworks Professional ($695, MacroMind) promises to be the premier animation 
program for the Mac II. It allows specification of multiple knot-points in 
time, with selection of the type of curve to draw in time (linear, spline, 
etc.) to connect the views in space. It will ship in October.

Other Info

Corporate Macs: Kodak now has about 65,000 Macintoshes (all sites); GE about 
6,000; Hughes about 1,800 (33% of all PC's);  EDS in Southfield,380 (92% of all
PC's!).  University of Michigan topped single-site list at 6,000 Macs (50% of 
all PC's). On the low end, IBM has 4 Macs.

Note: All the comments in this posting reflect my personal view and do not 
necessarily reflect the views of GM. Also I have no commercial interest or 
holding in any of these products or companies.

4/4: CityWide Echo

Name: CityWide Echo

Date: 4:45 am  Wed Aug 17, 1988

   From : Steve Sherwick

      : Network Coordinator, Twin Cities Metronet

      : 1:282/0

                      TO   : All Concerned SysOps and BBS Users

   Sub. : 1:282/1

      : AKA P.C. Info Exchange

      : AKA Midwest Echo Star

   And  : John Richard

      : AKA John Aleshe

      : AKA John Richards

      : AKA John Paul Aleshe

             As Network Coordinator for the International FIDONET in the 
Minneapolis/St. Paul area (The Twin Cities Metronet) it falls to me to disclose
the direct information concerning the John Aleshe/Richard affair as it relates 
to the FIDONET and the BBS community.

             I first made acquaintance with John under the name of John Richard
in the fall of 1987, he had moved into the area and set up a BBS system called 
P.C. Info Exchange as a node in Region 14. At that time the Twin Cities was not
a net but was preparing to create one.

             John entered the area claiming he had moved in from the Portland 
area. He stated he was a officer in the U.S. Air Force and was assigned to 
Honeywell (A large defense contractor in this area) as an inspector in the 
avionics division. He had said that his assignment was for at least three years
and that he was pretty well here for good.

             John apparently had good contacts in the Portland area in the FIDO
community as within two weeks he was importing more echomail for his system 
than all T.C. Metronet systems combined.

             John then basically made a broad offer to us here, that as long as
he was importing echomail he'd be happy to scan any mail he was importing for 
anyone in the net. Well this is like the goose that lays the golden eggs, 
SysOps were lining up to have him scan for them.

             Around November of 1987 the SysOps here held a meeting to confirm 
that we would form a net in the area. At that time I was appointed Network 
Coordinator and John accepted the post of Network Echomail Coordinator. We 
applied for a Net number and it was approved.  P.C. Information Exchange was 
assigned the node/number of 1:282/1. John at this time started experimenting 
with multiple lines and brought his system up to eight lines all told. He was 
selling subscriptions at $20.00 a year to help offset costs. At the time P.C. 
Info Exchange went down on May 1, 1988 there were in excess of 300 subscribers.

             Through the first part of 1988 John established communications 
with other major echomail hubs in the FIDONET and became part of the backbone. 
The backbone is a massive mail moving effort on the part of the network. 
Through this association he was assigned the position of The Midwest Echomail 
Star and started scanning mail on a more massive basis. I found later he was 
not only scanning mail in massive amounts he was actually delivering the mail 
by the use of a series of 800 lines he had negotiated from the phone company. 
All told we discovered after the fact he was maintaining a phone bill in excess
of $1000.00 a month. We also found that John did not pay his last months phone 
bill upon departing.

             Basically speaking, John had made a good presentation in the area 
as a concerned SysOp and a friend of the BBS community.

             The first real hints of the difficulties we were to experience 
came at the end of April and the beginning of May 1988. On April 30, 1988 Both 
Don Seiford (1:282/3) and I received phone calls from John indicating he was 
being called away to Boston on the possible closing of a home he had there. He 
had in the past made mention of a house in the east so his leaving seemed 
plausible.

             That evening for the first time in four months P.C. Info Exchange 
was down. The line were busy and there was simply no getting on the BBS. Voice 
calls placed to John were answered by an answering machine. It might be 
informative that John religiously answered the phone "This is John". It was a 
strong personality quirk.

             The next morning (May 1,1988) David Garner of Cascade Electronics 
(a local supplier of computer products) called me at my place of employment in 
quite a panic. He stated that John had been scheduled to speak at a users group
meeting that morning and had not arrived. He also mentioned that he and John 
had quoted a bid for the Minneapolis Public Library System and that as part of 
the terms all the hardware had to be installed by that day. He said that John 
had been impossible to reach for better than 24 hours. I told David that John 
had mentioned going to Boston and should return that day.

             David then called the Library System to confirm the hardware had 
been delivered and was informed the the bid had not been let at that point in 
time. Since David had provided hardware for that bid to the tune of $48,000 he 
was deeply concerned.

             This really caused us to be suspicious!!! We then called all known
possible places of employment he had mentioned and confirmed that he had never 
been employed by any of the firms at any time. We then made multiple sight 
inspections of his place of residence over that day to confirm there was no 
traffic at his home. We also interviewed some of Johns near neighbors and 
confirmed he had been seen moving large amounts of computer hardware from his 
residence.

             We at this time were pretty well convinced John had skipped town. 
David Garner agreed that he would file a report with the sheriff in his area 
and I agreed to send a series of notes to the FIDONET Region 14 Coordinator (At
the time Ken Kaplan) explaining the situation as well as to Johns major 
echomail ties requesting information.

             The next day I received a voice phone call from Ken promising the 
full support of Region 14 and the net in cleaning up this matter. We then 
agreed to let the law take it's course but if any information became available 
we would share what we found.

             That night the deluge began, in one night I as Net Coordinator 
received 85 messages requesting information on the status of P.C. Info 
Exchange, other boards here were subjected to bombing runs by nodes wondering 
where their echomail flow had gone. In less than two days, the largest 
disruption of echomail flow in the history of the FIDONET took place.

             The next evening we received calls from many major FIDONET nodes 
but the one most useful came in from Portland Oregon. The SysOp informed us 
that the methods of operation of our John Richard were quite a lot like a 
person who had done the same type of thing in Portland. That persons name was 
John Aleshe.

             We also received calls from the Denver area reporting that John 
had been in that area working the Gray Market for computer parts.

             Well, the timing was perfect. The local police had John checked in
Colorado for driving offenses, that coordinated with a file at the FBI and we 
had him.

             Wednesday May 11,1988, I was invited along with David Garner to 
appear at the Federal Building in Minneapolis to identify a series of 
photographs. When we arrived we were introduced to Fred A. Tremper an F.B.I 
Special Agent, Ron Anderson an Eden Prairie, Minnesota Detective and Robert 
Dissel of the Goodhue County Sheriffs office and asked  separately to identify 
the photographs. We agreed completely that the person pictured was the person 
we knew as John Richard. These same photographs, provided by the courtesy of 
the F.B.I are included in the complete distribution package. They were scanned 
into VGA quality images in GIF format.

             We were then informed by Agent Tremper that John was wanted in 
Texas for Attempted Capital Murder of a Police Officer as well as scams too 
numerous to mention.

             We were asked by the F.B.I. to try to keep the affair quiet as 
they hoped John would resurface and they did not want to scare him off. We 
agreed to hold this information for a period of three months, the period has 
expired and we are releasing full disclosure with this packet.

             We would like to thank the many people who have contributed to 
this effort but to be blunt many have requested to be left out of any public 
display of gratitude. We can appreciate the viewpoint and want to make one 
thing perfectly clear.

   THIS IS A DANGEROUS PERSON!!!!!

             He was known to be armed in this area, carry large amounts of cash
and has a Federal Warrant for Interstate Flight to Avoid Prosecution for 
Attempted Murder of a Police Officer issued against him. He has charges filed 
against him in the Minneapolis area alone totaling $125,000 in losses generated
by his fraudulent behavior. He alienated BBS users and SysOps all over the 
country. John has been a repeater, he seems to use the same methods where he 
turns up so please feel free to post this data where it seems appropriate.

   PLEASE IF YOU SEE THIS PERSON, CALL YOUR LOCAL POLICE!!! DO NOT ATTEMPT 
   ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE LIFE ENDANGERING!!!

             If you have information on this individual please feel free to 
send a confidential message to me at 1:282/0. You can also call my BBS at 
(612)-938-4799 and leave a message to the SysOp.

   If you see this individual please call the local police and

mention the NCIC Code is I.O. 5061 4-488.

   The agent in charge of the case in the Minapolis area is:

   Fred A. Tremper

   110 South Fourth Street

   Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401

   (612)-339-7861

             Please call your local FBI office or your local police however. 
You will receive the fastest attention in that manner.

             This document is being provided in two forms, one is a FIDONEWS 
release version that is this document and a trascription of the FBI wanted 
poster. There is a distribution file named FRAUD.ARC that is file requestable 
from any Net 282 bulletin board system.* It includes this file, offense 
reports, a transcription of the wanted poster and four VGA compatible scanned 
images in color and black and white. It will also be made available to the 
coordinator level in the FIDONET. We will distribute it as fast as is possible.

             * Macintosh users may obtain a this packet in converted form from 
The SmorgasBoard, 612-888-3712 in its new user file directory.

Subject: Boston MacWorld!

Well, I'm back from the Boston MacWorld expo to take up the dirty duties of a 
moderator and crank out a couple of digests for you.  Your only task is to read
said digests including this bit of drivel about what you may or may not have 
missed out on.

First of all, the Nth semiannual Netter's Dinner went off without any serious 
hitches.  The most confusing part about the whole thing was where to meet, so 
we all sort of met at the restaurant.  It was, once again, a delicious repast 
of the finest Chinese delicacies, especially that poor fish who stared at us 
while we devoured him, but it wasn't nearly as hot as the feast we had in 
January in SF, nor was it as crowded.  It was without a doubt worth doing and I
hope more of you will join us in January again.

The official list, for those of you that give a s**t, is:

        Robert Hammen           JimH

        Barry Semo              Pippen

        Kent Borg               Chris Vagnini

        Barry Ward              Stuart Schmukler

        Peter Freund            Richard & Steve Young

        Stephen Sakamoto        Keith Combs

        Miles Weissman          Kevin Willey

        Guy Riddle              Bill Hoffmann

        Art Goodall             Elliot Schlessel

        David Rosenberg         Ned Horvath

        Peter Olsen             Joel West       ( showed up late )

        Jeff Shulman            John Draper     ( showed up late )

        David Dunham            and me, of course.

Enough of that, on to the show.  For me the show was quite predictable.  The 
only thing really being celebrated was Hypercard's first birthday with a very 
loud party that lasted well into the sweltering Boston night.  Of course, the 
Westin was air conditioned so maybe that explains all the people.  Of course 
the free booze probably played a part too.

Since the Apple Scanner was so underwelming, (I mean, who really cares about 
another scanner?) I was hoping some of the third parties would take up the 
slack.  There were some new software packages, but there were also the guys we 
have all seen before.  Lightspeed Pascal 2.0 was being shown.  It is everything
you would expect it to be, at least until it gets into the hands of users who 
will quickly discover what it is missing.  It will be Object Pascal although 
since they don't support MPW's segmentation directives they will be creating a 
special version of MacApp to distribute.

There were video cards and genlock systems and Mac IIs everywhere.  Adobe had 
at least 15 Mac IIs in front of their large screen demo.  Big booths were in. 
The walls were covered by the little guys in their curtains covered with hand 
lettered signs.  There were suits everywhere.  I thought it was quite stuffy 
through the whole show and I don't mean the heat.  The only people who would 
stand and talk were either salesmen or ordinary folks.  All the suits seemed to
be ignoring the commoners.  Perhaps this is just my perception, but I got a lot
of unfriendly looks from suits and smiles from regular people wearing shorts 
and tees.  Oh, the longing for the good old days (like Scott Knaster said at 
the BCS meeting, "It's a strange business where we can reminice about the good 
old days a mere four years ago.").

At any rate, the best games of the show were Colony by Mindscape and 
Shufflepuck from Broderbund.  Colony is a simulated 3d environment with a theme
similar to Planetfall in that you are investigating a deserted colony and you 
have to defeat the monsters and find the people.  It is an arcade game in the 
tradition of BattleZone, and an adventure game without the puzzles.  I guess 
this is what is called a simulated environment. I haven't even scratched the 
surface of this game yet, but it involves moving around in real time in a wire 
frame world.  Impressive speed on my Plus and very fast on a Mac II. Runs under
Multifinder too.  Shufflepuck is airhockey.  Fast and furious.  If you have 
hand-eye coordination, this game is for you.

There were a zillion CAD programs, including a low end MacDraw challenger from 
Broderbund called Drawing Tablet and the new Claris CAD program. Internal 
modems were being shown, so that is about to take off.  Once Apple decides how 
to deal with more than two serial ports things should really fly.

Mac II users should check out Screen Gems from MicroSeeds.  This package 
includes Dimmer, ColorDesk, Switch-a-Roo, TN-3 (named after the robot in 
Asimov's "Satisfaction Guarenteed"), and Globe.  Dimmer and Switch-a-Roo have 
been seen on the net but ColorDesk does as a cdev what DeskPICT does as an 
INIT. ColorDesk is much more flexible and powerful in my eyes.  TN-3 allows you
to change the Finder's color menu, but only to one of their preset color 
combinations.  If it gave me a the picker I would really have loved this puppy.
 As it was a little ResEdit hacking allowed me to create my own palette, but it
needs to be interactive.  Maybe a new ResEdit picker is called for.  Globe is a
beautiful color version of EarthIdle.  Right now I have it balanced on the tip 
of Mickey the Wizard's finger.  Paul Mercer used some very nice shading to make
it look very spherical.

APDA is shipping MacApp 2.0b5 which includes a new manual.  According to Apple 
this version is a lot easier to learn and substantially different. Typical, 
huh?  APDA is also shipping a lot of Hypercard stuff including the Appletalk 
and Serial XCMDs and a couple of other "HyperTools" disks.  Also shipping is 
ResEdit 1.2b2 which is supposed to replace all other versions, as usual.  I 
want to know if we can still post this necessary MacHacker program. Any word 
from anyone at Apple?

Well this is droning on.  If anyone has any questions or comments about the

show, feel free to write.

Subject: Lone Ranger 1.9

Here is version 1.9 of the Lone Ranger.  It is mostly a bunch of annoying 
little bug fixes that I have found over the last year.  The Lone Ranger can 
change the creator field of all files of a certain type and creator to 
something else.  For example, it can change TEXT files from MACA (MacWrite) to 
QED1 (QUED) or MPS (MPW).  It can also change PNTG (MacPaint format) and FSSD 
(sound) files.  It also has the open ended capability to pick a file and use 
it's type and creator and to pick an application to be it's creator.  This is 
good for new files, like TIFF and PICT that are gaining more widespread use and
more programs that understand them.

This runs under MultiFinder and on all systems.  It's a bit more modal than

I would like, but what the heck, it's free.

Send comments, suggestions, and money to me.

The following files to upgrade QUED/M to version 2.07 are supplied courtesy of 
Paragon Concepts. PUP 2.0 is the version 2.0 of the Paragon Update Procedure. 
This may be freely distributed. The next files are the upgrades to go to 
version 2.07 from QUED/M versions 2.0, 2.01, 2.02, 2.03, and 2.04 respectively.
The patches should be applied to a copy of the original program.  I ran into 
what Paragon calls a "one in a thousand" problem in that the upgrade did not 
work on my system. I discovered that it worked fine when done under the finder 
rather than multifinder.

Subject: here comes SigmaEdit 1.1

I believe that this is an outdated version, which I had forgotten in my 
"IN-box", and I just had it crash under MultiFinder, but it may work in the 
straight Finder and in earlier versions.  This is a very interesting Editor-DA,
which allows printing on the LaserWriter...

I'll forward a more recent release as soon as I get it - ASAP.

Subject: WriteFontSize 1.0

WriteFontSize is a DA that allows you to copy ANY character in ANY font in

ANY size (1-127 points) to the clipboard.

The character is placed in both MacWrite and plain text formats.  This allows 
MacWrite users to get character sizes they otherwise couldn't.

You specify the character either by typing it in, selecting it from a 16x16 
table or by specifying its ASCII code (in hexadecimal, octal or decimal).

I mistakenly sent an old version of ApplicationMenu to the comp.binaries.mac 
moderator.  (You probably wondered why it didn't show up in the Control Panel 
as promised.)  The mistake was entirely mine, and here is the proper version.

Briefly, this is an INIT/cdev that gives you a menu of the currently running 
applications under MultiFinder.  You can configure how this menu pops up using 
the Control Panel.  It requires that you be running MultiFinder.

Here's a new DA which allows you to create dictionaries/thesauruses.  It is 
especially useful in making dictionaries in different languages.  There are 7 
files in a PackIt file dictpit.  Two sample German and Russian dictionaries 
(mathematical dictionaries; something to start with) corresponding text-dump 
files, the actual DA (which must be installed), a Russian font, and an 
application.  The DictLoad application allows you to compile the text-dump 
files into dictionaries, and vice-versa.  A ram cache (even as little as 64K) 
makes the DA run substantially faster.  The DA uses the file Dictionary File 
(e.g. the Russian or German dictionary renamed) which must be in the system 
folder.  Using Edit, one can create brand new text-dump files to create new 
dictionaries.  Use wmac with the "MacBin" option.

   If you find this DA useful, please send what you think it is worth to 
Richard Wesley 71 Charlesfield St. Providence, RI 02906-2045.  He'll send you a
detailed manual.  Comments are also appreciated and can be sent to

Tabbit is a utility to enable space-delineated data to be used by applications 
which require their data in a tab-delineated form. For instance, datasets 
produced on mainframe computers can be utilized by statistics or graphic 
packages on the Macintosh without having to transmit tab characters across the 
link. It is possible to edit tab characters in, using Macwrite and a bit of 
wizardry.  But try it with 40 or so data files and you'll see the point of 
Tabbit.

I have seen this.  It is not a bug, exactly; it is a feature of "Vaccine", the 
anti viral cdev/INIT from CE Software.  Verify by typing "Y" while the linker 
is hanging; if the cursor spins a bit and hangs again, this is the cause (one Y
is needed for every CODE resource).  There is an obscure feature in the Vaccine
cdev which you can check to fix this problem.  Presumably this will make 
Vaccine a tiny bit less effective, but it won't hold up your links.

Help! I need some programming tips on line drawing on a macintosh.  Currently I

writing is VERY line drawing intensive and QuickDraw isn't quick enough.  
Before I get flamed I know and understand all the reasons why one shouldn't 
deviate from using the holy rom routines and so I only plan on implementing my 
own screen routines as an option.  I've timed various games so I know some of 
those folks are in fact using their own line drawing routines (probably using 
them as quickdraw bottlenecks).  I understand that I will have to work in 
assembly. Can anybody point me in the right direction?  The application, by the
way is a molecular modeling program for education purposes, not commercial, and
when it is done I will be glad to distribute to anyone who asks.

Subject: RE:  locating Appletalk line breakage

William DenBesten inquired about a way to isolate the location of

a break in Appletalk cabling.

We recently installed InterComm from Apple (cost is about $90.).  It consists 
of a master program that can be installed on any Mac, and a repeater that can 
be installed in the SYSTEM folder of all Mac's on that net.

When a problem is suspected, the master unit can bounce test packets between 
itself and any other Mac or printer on the net (provided that the other mac has
the listener installed).  It causes no disruption of user activity on the 
remote machine, but gives a good indication of broken lines or noisy lines 
where packets are lost or timed-out.

As a bonus, it will also tell you the edition of SYSTEM, FINDER, and 
LASERWRITER installed on each computer in the network.  This is very very nice 
in public user clusters where students are known to bring in from home obsolete
systems which can foul up network integrity.

I highly recommend this program to anyone who is operating a nontrivial- 
complexity Appletalk/localtalk/phonenet/... network.  It's already bailed us 
out of a few problems.

Subject: Preventing files from being copied off server...

    At the University of Massachusetts we're setting up a new public Mac- 
intosh lab with 25 SEs, two Laserwriters, and two mVax2000s as file/print 
servers.  Users will have read only access to the file servers where we are 
providing a number of applications, such as Word processing, Graphics, 
Spreadsheets, etc.  Anyway, here's the problem... we don't like the idea that 
people are going to (there's no doubt that they are going to) copy these 
applications off of the server onto their own disks for their own use on their 
own computers.  We've always had a strong stance against piracy, against the 
mainstream of the University Community, where piracy appears to be raging 
rampant.

    So what do we do?  Since Finder v5.0 the old "BOZO bit" is no longer 
supported... (that would have been the ideal solution).  There is a "protected"
bit indicated under "Get Info" from ResEdit, but I can't seem to change its 
status.  Does anyone know what this is for?  Does any- one have any ideas on 
preventing software from being copied in the finder? I recently saw a CDEV 
called "Guard Dog" which, when turned on, prevented ANY changes to the desktop,
including moving (and thus copying) of icons. Can anyone tell me the technique 
"Guard Dog" uses to accomplish this?  I'd almost buy 25 copies of "Guard Dog", 
but since anyone can turn it off from the Control Panel that's not quite good 
enough...

    Please reply directly to me (for speedieness) and I'll summarize use- ful 
responses to the net.  All responses, ideas, and tidbits of infor- mation are 
*greatly* appreciated.

No problem.  Both Farallon and apple make connectors with DB9 and Mini DIN-8

I want to have (or add to) a Finder with an `Applications' menu through which I
can call any of the application programs on `loaded' disks.  My pet Finder 
peeve is that while I can litter my applications anywhere on a disk I can only 
call them up from a folder if it contains a document for that application.  For
new documents, I am forced to either locate the application on the disk, open 
it and tell it to save in the desired folder or open a document in the desired 
folder which I will then close before opening a new document.

Subject: laserprep and QMS

I think it's easy to get the laserprep file to a host computer. Printing while 
holding down command-k generates a postscript file including the laserprep. 
This (ASCII) file can be sent to the host computer where you separate the 
laserprep, which is the first part of the postscript file, from the rest using 
an editor. The laserprep must be sent to the laserprinter every time it 
switched on Thereafter it stays resident in the printer. Once you have the 
laserprep you print on your MAC holding down command-f. This results in much 
shorter files. The problems I encountered are: Font-names in the postscript 
file are preceeded by "|_______". This is not recognized by the QMS. I always 
edit the file before sending it to the printer. I remove all occureces of 
"|_______". The laserprep files also has fontnames preceeded by "|_______". 
Remove these "|_______", too. This procedure must work, because at home I have 
a MAC at my work is

   a PDP11 with   QMS-800PS and I print home made text and pictures on

the laserprinter.

Subject: Masks Picture?

If anyone has any information on how I may obtain a copy of the theatre 
(Comedy/Tragedy) masks in a MACDRAW, MACPAINT, SUPERPAINT, or PICTURE format I 
would appreciate it.  I would like to use this symbol on a letter head using 
the Microsoft Wordprocessor program.  If there is a public bulletin board 
available with this on it or if you have a copy which can be uploaded to your 
mainframe in BINARY format and then transferred to me in either DISK DUMP or 
PUNCH format, I would appreciate it.  Whew, that was one long sentence!

Thank you in advance for any information you can provide.

Subject: Smarts Alarm v2.9 Patch

I remember seeing a hack (patch?) for Smart Alarms so that it would ring the 
bells only at the time the reminder is set (and not every three minutes 
afterwards).  This is a very useful patch, because without it your colleague's 
nerves would go crazy whenever you are not at your desk to dismiss the alert.

Now the problem: I've lost it in a HD crash.

Anyone is so kind as to send it to me or re-post it?  Thanks!

I had a different problem with bundle bits on Microsoft Word and Excell: the

I have a Lisa with a 10 meg widget internal drive.  It has been crashing

To enter a foriegn language character, hold down the option

key and press:

        ` for grave accent        e for acute accent

        i for circumflex (^)      u for umlaut

n for tilde (~)

Then type the letter to be combined with the mark.  For further information, 
see "Option Key" under "Keyboard" in Chapter 3 of your Macintosh manual.  Only 
the following combinations work:

                  a   e   i   o   u   n   A   E   I   O   U   N

      option-`    X   X   X   X   X       X

Other various foriegn language characters are available, especially in the 
Times and Helvetica fonts, by using either the option key or the option and 
shift keys together.  To see the available charac- ters, start the Key Caps 
desk accessory, go to the Key Caps menu and select the font you want to use, 
and then press first the option key and then the option and shift keys 
together.  For further information, see "Key Caps" in Chapter 3 of your

Subject: Macintosh in the Laboratory

Thomas Fruin <fruin@hleru15.BITNET> asks about hardware to interface Macintosh 
Plus and Macintosh SE computers to laboratory equipment.

The CERN-developed MacVEE system allows the entire Macintosh family to be 
interfaced to VMEbus and CAMAC systems. MacVEE (Microcomputer Applied to the 
Control of VME Electronic Equipment) provides direct memory-mapped access from 
the Macintosh to external laboratory instrumentation. In the case of the Plus 
and SE, each computer can control up to 8 VMEbus crates, or up to 7 VMEbus 
crates and 8 CAMAC crates, in any mix.

The MacVEE interface for Macintosh II is called MICRON (MacVEE Interface Card 
Resident On NuBus). Up to 3 MICRON modules can be plugged into a Mac II, 
providing access to 384 Mbytes of external system space per computer.

MacVEE is described in a CERN Report entitled 'Macintosh in the Laboratory'.  I
can provide a limited number of copies to professional researchers on request.

Subject: Correction to timing results for TK-88K-P board

Thanks to Scott Comer (wert@rosetta.com) for pointing out an error in our "C" 
benchmark timing results for the Tektronix TK-88K-P board (Info-Mac posting V6,
#78) for the Mac II based on the Motorola 88100 chip.   He pointed out that our
cited values of 0.016 microsecond for adds and multiplies of doubles must be 
too low, since this would be faster than the 0.050 microsec 88100 clock time, 
which

   would be  impossible.   In our test program,  the "add" or "mulitiply" 
   operation

is contained in a loop that executes a million times, and then the loop time 
(which is calculated separately) is subtracted out. This worked fine on the 
Microvax II timings, but after discussion with the programmer we now think that
in the case of the 88100 some (unknown) compiler  optimization must be not 
counting the full times for these operations in our tests .  So although the 
cited MicroVax II results are valid, those for the TK88K-P are not. So I am 
going to have to retract my statements on our timings for the TK-88K-P board, 
over than to say that it's  fast. Tektronix itself quotes a 6 mflop figure, 
which is the figure I used in my cost comparisons, so these still stand. -

Subject: Equation Solving Program

This is a program that I ported to the mac.  It was a unix program by Keith 
Rule of tektronix (if the path is any indication).  Anyway, it finds numerical 
solutions to equations you type in, using an iterative, backtracking scheme.  
It probably isn't useful for solving simultaneous linear equations, but is 
useful for units conversion, mortgage calculations, physics equations, etc.  
You type in the equation, and then "compile" it to produce a dialog, which is 
used to supply values for some of the variables.  The other variables are then 
solved for. Its free.  Its sometimes useful.

Subject: PopUp Control (revised)

[ Uploaded from Delphi by Jeff Shulman ]

Name: POPUP CONTROL

Date: 19-JUL-1988 03:46 by DWB

The promised updates to PopUpCtrl.  Includes bug fixes and (gasp!) comments on 
the original code.  In addition TestControl now compiles even if you don't have
my libraries.  On the downside it's now in MPW 3.0 instead of MPW 2.0.  That'll
make you folks with LSC happy since it's closer to that probably now.  Anyway 
let me know of any comments

I've been getting lots of email requests, so I'll just post it here.  The 
following is a binhex file of a StuffIt archive containing the XPRAM INIT for 
upgraded 512KE Macs. It allows those without Mac+ logic boards (and hence, 
extended PRAM) to use System 6.0's Sound cdev for beep sounds. The INIT was 
written by Scott Armitage.

Subject: Monaco Fix

The following posting contains Monaco Fix, a set of resources that makes the 
Monaco font easier for programmers to use.  The modified Monaco font contains a
slashed "zero" character (easy to distinguish from a capital "oh"), and a 
capital "I" with top and bottom bars (easy to distinguish from a lowercase 
"ell").

Monaco Fix is designed for use with the Mac II.  It includes both the modified 
Monaco font, and a set of ROv# "resource override" resources that will cause 
the modified (disk-based) Monaco font rather than the copy of the Monaco font 
contained in the Mac II's ROM.

Instructions for installation and removal are included.

This is posting of the new 1.3 version of the Sound Manager Package from 
Riccardo Ettore.  It is a shareware.  Riccardo accepts now cash, checks, as 
well as credit cards.  Registered users receive a manual and additional 
goodies.  The package includes SoundMover (Font/DA Mover-like utility for 
moving snd resources), Ibeep2 (custom beep), Sound->snd (converter), and 
StartupSndInit (play snd's as a startup sound).  This version introduces 
several improvements over version 1.0a (the last I saw in Info-Mac archives).

This posting is approved by the author.  It is stuffed and binhexed.

BSed - A BackSpace Editor.

If you use your favorite telecommunications package to regularly talk to a 
public mail system (such as ENVOY, etc...), then you probably use the 'Text 
Capture' command to keep a log of what you have done that day.  The only 
problem with this is that ALL of the characters that you type are sent to the 
file, including the control characters(backspaces, form feeds, etc....).

This is a simple program that will read in a text file and edit out the 
extraneous characters.  It is public domain by R.H. Greenfield, and is his 
FIRST Macintosh program.  Any suggestions and opinions will be appreciated.

Included is a Stuffit 1.40A file containing the program and docs in

MS Word 3.01 and text formats.

From: Daniel Carr <NETOPRDC%NCSUVM.BITNET@Forsythe.Stanford.EDU> Subject: a vm 
macro to ease getting files from MACSERVE at PUCC

to use it, you'll have to set up a function key in a profile.  i don't know if 
you're familiar with vm or not, but when you get a file (or mail) it goes to a 
reader.  you can edit it (if it isn't too big) without receiving it to your 
disk.  the editor is called peek.  so if you set up a PROFPEEK XEDIT file with 
a function key set to the name of this macro, you can peek the file in your 
reader, then put the cursor over it, and press that pfkey. the whole directory 
(from pucc) is too big to edit it from the reader, so you have to receive it 
and then edit it.  you can set up an PROFILE XEDIT file with a pfkey defined to
the name of the macro too.

it is so easy.

well here it is.  i included my PROFPEEK file, too.

This is a program which helps organize applications on your hard disk, sort of.
 It is equivalent to the idea of symbolic links in UN*X.

The program creates a small file which, when double clicked, runs a specified

retaining access to all your commonly used applications.

It is version 0.1, but it is useful.

   - Contour Application: a contour plotting program - Contour Docs: 
   documentation in MacWrite format - XY20 Log: sample plot file - Calc Out: 
   sample input file

Features include:

   - Number, spacing, and darkness of contours are all easily changed - Accepts
   either a formula for z = f(x,y) or a set of data points - Free (though 
   donations are appreciated)!

Misfeatures include:

   - Fixed size plotting window

   - No clipboard or other export support

   - Probably won't work too well under MultiFinder - User interface, though 
   Mac-ish, needs some work - Very limited support (I'm a grad student and have
   other things to do)

No known bugs, source code in Symantec/THINK LightSpeed Pascal available

on request (only, I'd like to know who has it).

Macintosh CD - The CD player for the rest of us!

MacCD is a sound playing, sound conversion program. It will play snd resources 
such as sysbeeps or HC stack sounds, and sampleds digitized sound from programs
like SoundCap, SoundWave, SoundEdit.

It will run on all macs, but is best used in conjuction with the new sound 
manager (ie. System 6.0 or Mac ][). It will also work under Multifinder, and 
will continue playing when in background.

This is a stuffit file containing MacCD Demo, and MacCD documentation. If wish 
to get the complete program please send A$40 to the address below (icluded in

This is Tadeseiyo, Korean for a politely closed door.  It's Freeware.

I made this a few months ago, because of an unexpected security problem.  It's 
a hard-disk passworder, combined with the ability to select Multi or Plain 
Finder on startup.  Doesn't need to be in the System Folder, either.

It's got a Help button, and comes with a blank password, so will ask you to 
give one the first time, which you can always change.

It might be interesting also because of the use of an Asian way of writing, 
from which it gets it's name.  See the Help.

Sometimes you don't know exactly which files you should backup.  With P.S.B.U. 
you can override this problem by supplying filename patterns with wildcard 
characters.  P.S.B.U. works like an extension to the Finder.  When 
double-clicking a P.S.B.U. document, the backup specification will be executed 
and after a successful backup the application will return directly to the 
Finder.

You will find more of the features of P.S.B.U. in the help text

included in the application.

Subject: Printing PostScript to non-LaserWriters

The remainder of this message is a postscript header that works for printing 
Mac PostScript files on Digital ScriptPrinters.  It is a very slightly modified
version of the header that you used to be able to get by using K instead of F 
when you captured the postscript file.  It may or may not work on other 
printers.  Post a message if you confirm that it does or does not work on some 
particular other printer.

To use it: simply send prepend it to any file you send to the laser printer (as
part of the same job).  If you send the header more than once it will do 
strange things (like print mirror image pages).

This file is probably copyright by Apple Computer and can probably only be 
distributed to Macintosh owners who have a license to Apple's system software. 
Then again, what would anyone else do with it?

High Capacity Floppy Drives.

A report by Natick, Massachusetts consulting and market research firm Venture 
Development says that within two years, the standard 3.5 inch floppy drive 
capacity will have increased from 1.44 Mbytes to 4 Mbytes.  Toshiba already has
introduced a 4 Mbyte 3.5 inch drive, the PD-210, which uses disks that are 
magnetized vertically instead of horizontally.  The future of floppy drives 
could also be radically changed by "Digital Paper" (see last month's column) 
which potentially could be used to make 100 Mbyte floppy disks.  However, 
Digital Paper is not (yet) eraseable.  - PC Week 18 July

"Floptical" Drive.

Insite Peripherals is scheduled to introduce a 20.8 Mbyte, 3.5 inch floppy disk
drive that combines aspects of optical servo and magnetic recording technology 
in the first quarter of 1989.  The drive, dubbed the Model 1325 Floptical Disk 
Drive, uses otherwise standard 3.5 inch floppy disks that have been modified by
embedding optical-servo tracks in them at 20 micron intervals.  The drive will 
retail for approximately $500, and Insite plans to license major manufacturers,
including Kodak and Xidex, to make the Floptical disks for an, as yet, 
unspecified price. - InfoWorld 15 August

Ever Larger DRAM.

IBM may be planning to skip 4 Mbit RAM chips altogether (see last month's 
column) but four other manufacturers, Siemens, Toshiba, Matsushita, and Texas 
Instruments, expect to be making volume shipments of 4 megabit memory chips by 
the middle of next year.  Meanwhile, IBM researchers have successfully 
demonstrated a new integrated circuit production technology that may result in 
64 megabit (8 Mbytes) memory chips.  Although the technology still needs 
development, once volume production begins the price of the resulting chips 
will "not be ridiculous" according to Jerome Silverman, a research staff member
with IBM. - InfoWorld 25 July and 1 August

Coming From Big Blue.

In keeping with the announced policy of introducing product enhancements about 
every six months (see last April's column), IBM is expected to incorporate 
graphics based on the 8154 display adapter into the motherboard of new PS/2 
machines this Fall.  The super-VGA display offers a resolution of 1,024 by 728 
in up to 256 colors from a palette of 262,144.  Among the new models expected 
are a 80386 upgrade of the Model 60.  Entry Systems Division spokesperson Jim 
Monahan has acknowledged that an 80286-based replacement for the model 30 
(known in rumors as the "Model 35") is in the works but denies the low-end 
machine will be built around an AT-bus.  Meanwhile, financial analysts and 
dealers have been told that it could be more than a year before IBM introduces 
the "AIX family" of RISC-CPU machines which will have Micro Channel 
Architecture and be OS/2 compatibility. - InfoWorld 18 July, 1 and 22 August

New PC Software.

IBM denies rumors that the long awaited Presentation Manager, due to ship in 
October, will be late.  David Harrington, IBM's communications product manager,
did admit that meeting the promised delivery date will be "very challenging."  
Version 2 of the Ventura Publisher will be released this Fall with an improved 
user interface using pull-down and drop-down menus, increased network support, 
and document management features.  The price is expected to be about the same 
as the $895 for the present version. Microsoft expects to ship its Mail program
for MS-DOS in October.  Someone forgot to include the "auto-hyphenate" feature 
in WordPerfect 5.0 even though it is in the documentation.  A bug fix is 
expected soon. - InfoWorld 1, 15 and 22 August and PC Week 15 August

Apollo's 7-MIP Workstations.

The Apollo Series 4500 workstations which will begin shipping in the fourth 
quarter are the first to use the dual ported 68882 math coprocessor at 33 MHz 
along with the Motorola 68030 CPU.  The 7-MIP, 8 Mbyte RAM Apollo computers 
will be comparable in both price ($23,490 to $36,490) and performance to the 
Sun 4/110 RISC-based workstation. - InfoWorld 18 July and PC Week 18 July

1989 Model Macs.

Apple may be planning to introduce a whole line Macintoshes built around the 
68030 shortly after the new year.  In addition to a desktop model, look for a 
high-end laptop and, and a stand alone "tower" that can act as a network server
and support multiple workstations (multiuser, multitasking).  Apple also will 
begin producing its own memory chips beginning in 1990. - InfoWorld 25 July and
PC Week 15 August

IIgs+ Delayed.

Apple did not introduce an accelerator for the Mac SE at the recently concluded
Mac World as had been rumored, although several third party vendors have 
announced such products. Apparently, Apple management decided to take President
Sculley's commitment to major customers ("no new CPU's in 1988") very 
literally.  Sources inside Apple insist that an accelerated Apple IIgs (the 
widely rumored gs+) will not be shipped until some time after the performance 
of the entire Macintosh line is improved. - A Knowlegeable (Anonymous) Source 
(Developer)

Mac II CPU's.

Daystar Digital has announced a 33-MHz accelerator for the Macintosh II that 
plugs into the 68020's original location. The Daystar product features a 
120-nanosecond memory running at zero wait states and a RAM cache.  The 
accelerator will be shipped in the fourth quarter.  Daystar also offers 16 and 
25 MHz accelerators for the Mac SE and Mac Plus.  Intel, makers of the 80xxx 
chips, is rumored to have offered Apple a "cheap" 68020.  Will Motorola respond
by cloning the 80486?  - InfoWorld 22 August

Forthcoming MacWare.

Apple engineers demonstrated the new version of Quickdraw (Quickerdraw?) at Mac
World by showing real-time color animation running in different windows on a 
Mac II.  The function will be incorporated in an unspecified upcoming version 
of the Macintosh operating system.  "Nufinder" which will include commands for 
supporting "guests" with limited access to files and folders will be part of 
System 8.0 coming in January.  Apple also has confirmed it will release a beta 
version of a C++ translator for its MPW C language to developers in October.  
The translator will permit MPW C developers to do object-oriented programming. 
Currently only MPW Pascal is the only language from Apple that supports 
object-oriented programming for the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop and Mac App
programming library. Microsoft is said to be working furiously on a major 
update of Excel (expected to become version 2.0) for release shortly after the 
new year.  The new version will allow larger spreadsheets and address other 
limitations such as the difficulty of creating complex charts.  Product manager
Pradeep Singh says the new Mac version will leapfrog the PC version in 
functionality.  Word 4.0 with an automatic data link to Excel spreadsheets is 
expected to be released in October.  Word 4.0 also will allow users to edit in 
preview mode and improve the program's Page View function.  A new Microsoft 
Works, version 2.0, with an upgraded spell checker, some desktop publishing 
features such as linked multiple columns, and improved drawing facilities is 
scheduled for October shipment, and Quick Basic for the Macintosh should appear
in September at a retail price of $99.  Acius has decided to withhold version 
1.1 of its 4th Dimension relational database package.  Instead, version 2.0 
with approximately 100 new features will ship in December. Wingz may fly at 
last by the end of the month.  The original announcement last January 
envisioned a June release, later extended to mid-September.

- InfoWorld 8 and 15 August and PC Week 15 August

HyperCard Search/Retrieve "Engine."

KnowledgeSet is expected to release a commercial version of the HyperCard 
search and retrieve engine created for the Arthur Young accounting firm later 
this month.  The Macintosh program, called HyperKRS for "Knowledge Retrieval 
System," can be used with CD ROM as well as magnetic media and is up to 200 
times faster than HyperCard on its own. - PC Week 1 August

"Hypercard" IIgs.

Roger Wagner Publishing is planning on premiering a 'hypercard' for the IIgs at
the Sept 88 Applefest.  it will not read Mac stacks because many use external, 
binary executable functions.  More hearsay is that Apple is still working on a 
real hypercard for the GS. - Larry Virden 31 July and Open Apple August

Well, Almost 100% Compatible.

Developers of the Adobe Postscript clone printers (last December's column) now 
arriving on the market claim "100% compatibility."  However, because the 
Postscript page description language is complex and includes a number of 
undocumented features, industry sources say that it is impossible to verify 
complete compatibility.  So far, there is no standard testing program accepted 
by the entire industry.  - PC Week 25 July

One-Pass Color Laser.

Colorocs Corporation has demonstrated a single-pass four color printer that is 
more advanced and faster than multiple pass printers available today.  Colorocs
expects printers based on their technology to be offered initially at $30,000 
(a bargain compared to the only other one-pass color printer under development 
by Kodak which analysts expect to cost more than $80,000).  - PC Week 15 August

Chameleon CPU.

Designers may salivate - but shouldn't hold their breath - for the VM8600S 
microprocessor created by V.M. Technology Corp., of Tsukuba, Japan. The CPU 
portion of the chip has a native instruction set of 155 commands, but the 
company can configure three programmable logic arrays (PLAs) on the chip to 
translate another processor's instructions into the CPU's native instruction.  
A 25 MHz version of the 32-bit VM8600S already has PLAs configured to translate
Intel 80386 instructions.  PLAs to emulate the 68000 family and even the yet to
be shipped 65832 are technically feasible. Unfortunately, samples of the 
microprocessor probably won't be available in the United States for about a 
year. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

On Reflection.

A new display technology for portable computers and

television sets has been developed by Reflection

Technology.  The device called the Private Eye is a 1 by 1.2 by 1.3 inch 
monocular headset weighing less than 2 ounces that produces an image that 
appears to float in space about two feet in front of the viewer.  The 
resolution is 720 by 280 pixels and should be available in quantity in about 8 
months for around $200 retail.  - InfoWorld 1 August

Color LCD.

Casio has a new color Liquid Crystal Display screen with 200,000 pixels in a 
six inch screen.  Resolution is said to be the equal of a standard CRT.  - 
Random Access 20 August

Vision System for Mac II.

Machine vision, held back by closed proprietary platforms, could turn the 
corner now that Automatix, Inc., of Billerica, MA, has announced Autovision 90 
and, with it, an industry first - Compatability with an open, standard platform
- namely, Apple's Macintosh II. Called Automatix Standard Application Package, 
or ASAP, the software accepts any RS170 interlaced-frame camera.  A minimum 
system which includes a frame-grabber board, high-resolution color or 
monochrome monitor, ASAP software, and RAIL programming language starts at 
$18,000. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

Yet another version of Stuffit Shareware program follows, as a binhexed

either Stuffit or UnStuffit is stored unStuffited.

[excerpts from (included) Stuffit 1.5.1 Read Me]

ADDENDUM regarding bug fix version 1.5.1

About StuffIt 1.5.1 (8-29-88)

StuffIt 1.5.1 is a bug fix release.  It corrects several problems in 1.5. 
Almost all of these problems were caused by my hasty conversion from 
LightspeedC 2.15 to 3.0.  In the conversion, I expected that everything will be
identical.  (A legitimate assumption.)  Unfortunately, that assumption was 
false.  As a result, quite a few, both innocuous and serious, bugs crept into 
1.5.  All known problems as of today (and I think we caught most of them) have 
been corrected in 1.5.1.

The bugs corrected are:

1. Operation of TEXT add has been restored.

2. A disk error during compression (usu. disk full) no longer crashes machine. 
3. On larger HDs, free space may be reported as negative.  Fixed 4. Aborting a 
HMF add and keeping the partially added HMF sometimes results in

   a corrupted entry.  Fixed.

Though it isn't a major improvement, performance under MultiFinder has been 
improved to the extent that running StuffIt in the background is now tolerable 
-- not great, but tolerable.

Subject: NumTalk & LSC source

This is a program called Number Talk.  If you type in a number (e.g., 
"-234.35"), Number Talk will spell it ("Negative Two Hundred Thirty-Four Point 
Three Five") and will also speak it, provided you have a MacinTalk driver in 
your System Folder.

It gets more interesting when you type in HUGE numbers

("One Trillion ...")!

The Lightspeed C source code, stripped project file, and a short "How To" 
document are included.  The program and its source code are public domain.

Have fun!

The following BinHex StuffIt file contains a LSC demo program I wrote, as well 
as the source code, resource file, and stripped project file.

This program demonstrates how to use hierarchical menus.  It also demonstrates 
how to handle DA's, how to make your own "About..." box (with an icon), and how
to use dialog boxes.

The use of this source code is FREE, provided it is for non-profit purposes.  I
hope it can save someone some time!

Subject: Simple CDEF

Knowing that Inside Mac has been particularly sketchy about how to write 
control definition functions, I finally got around to taking up the task.  The 
following is a stuffit archive of source, lightspeed c projects and a macpaint 
document that allows a push-on/push-off button to be defined as a control.  It 
is by no means complete as far as the control definition function is concerned,
as buttons do not require dragging, tracking or region calculation, but it will
serve as a decent skeleton to start from.

Here Is the lockOUT da. It will work under finder only. I downloaded it from [a

prevent someone from hitting the switch and rebooting but it does keep prying

[This binary came to Info-Mac with no description, so I'm including the one 
found with the older 1.1 version.  I expect this newer version has bug fixes or
enhancements.  - Lance]

[SoundMaster 1.1 cdev]

SoundMaster is a shareware Control Panel device from Bruce Tomlin, and is a 
godsend to those of you who like to have various Mac sounds replaced with your 
very own digitized sounds.  The various features include

       o   Specific sounds for the following operations

*  Startup

*  Shutdown

*  Restart

*  Disk Eject

*  Disk Insert

*  Bad Disk

*  System Beep

*  Key Click

       o   Plays SoundCap, SoundWave, and SoundEdit files at ALL 4 SAMPLING

RATES!  (No more 22 kHz startup sounds...).  It does not read snd

resources.

       o   Individual volume settings for each sound.

       o   Each sound can be stored anywhere in or under the System Folder.

       o   You can play the sounds inside SoundMaster, to test for the right

sampling rate.

This has allowed me to dump CheapBeep, SoundInit, ShutdownSound, MacII, MacPuke
and MacFeedMe.  VERY handy, and I've had no problems with it.

   Standard Disclaimer   I have no connections with Bruce Tomlin, other than

having sent my $10 shareware fee in 15 minutes after downloading this baby.

DriveLock - an INIT that "locks" floppy drives

Here is a little piece of work I had to do a couple of weeks ago. It's called 
DriveLock, and maybe it is of some use to you ...

   DriveLock is a simple INIT that  "locks"  floppy  drives.  This  means

that during the normal course of operation of a Macintosh a disk  will

   no longer be ejectable from a that drive. DriveLock arose out  of  the

   need  to  prevent  students  in  a  university  Macintosh  lab   from:

   o       booting with their own Startup disks (usually with old versions  of

      the  System,  and  without  AppleShare  and  AppleTalk  ImageWriter

      drivers); this  caused  all  kinds  of unnecessary network problems

   o  taking the university-supplied Startup  disks  home  "by accident".

   DriveLock can also be useful for demonstration  machines  at  computer

   shows, or for dealers, where you want people to be  able  to  use  the

   machine  without  being  able  to  take  inserted  floppies  home   or

inserting their own floppies for copying ...

And then it can be great fun to put a copy of DriveLock in a  friend's

   (or enemy's) System Folder while  s/he  isn't looking ...  you  didn't

hear this from me!

Subject: Black and White XFCN

Here is an XFCN that returns whether or not Hypercard's card window is on a 
black and white (i.e. 2 color or 1 bit) screen.  This is most useful for being 
able to make Hypercard call the Switch-a-Roo FKEY automatically with my DoFKEY 
XCMD.  Please note that Hypercard will only do it's visual effects if the card 
window is on the main screen (i.e. the one with the menu bar) so this XFCN does
not tell you if Hypercard will do it's visual effects, but since you have to 
move the card to another window, I figure you will know that and script 
accordingly.

Subject: QVT - a shareware terminal emulator (2 parts)

This posting contains QVT, a shareware terminal emulator for the

Macintosh.  QVT has the following features:

-  VT52, VT100 and VT220 emulation.

-  Support for both old-style and ADB keyboards.

-  Support for XMODEM, YMODEM, Kermit, and XMODEM-with-MacBinary

   protocols.

-  Autodialing (and demon dialing) using Hayes-compatible modems. -  Permits 
configuration of the "delete" key (sends either BS or DEL),

   screen (cursor type, smooth or fast scrolling, auto-newline, etc.), serial 
   interface (speed, parity, etc.), and auto-dial phone number. Configurations 
   can be saved;  double-clicking on a configuration file launches the 
   emulator, loads the configuration, and brings up the autodialer dialog box 
   if a phone number has been entered.

I've tested the program for a couple of days.  It's been a solid performer 
during those limited tests;  there were no unexpected errors or bombs.  The 
Kermit and MacBinary XMODEM protocols seem to work OK; I haven't tried YMODEM, 
and the Kermit protocol support doesn't appear to include sliding-windows or 
large packets.  The program refers to the MacBinary-encoded XMODEM protocol 
simply as "MacBinary";  this is a bit of a misnomer, as MacBinary can run on 
top of XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM, Kermit, or any other file-transfer protocol.

There appear to be a few rough spots and limitations in its use of the Mac 
toolbox QVT doesn't run in the background under MultiFinder, and doesn't use 
SFPutFile during downloads (thus making it difficult to download files into a 
directory other than the one that the program is stored in).  Hayes-modem 
support appears adequate, although not exceptional; for example, it appears to 
be impossible to embed mode-change strings in the "phone number to dial" field.
 The program switches the modem from "verbose" to "numeric" result codes, and 
leaves it that way when you exit.

The program is pretty easy to use, although it's clear that there are features 
that can only be used if you have access to the documentation (for which you 
must send in the $50 shareware fee).  I haven't decided yet whether to pay the 
shareware fee for this program, or to buy a copy of VersaTerm.

Date: 31-AUG-1988 21:55 by DWOOD

CELLULAR AUTOMATONS v0.1 (8/31/88)

This application calculates and displays the evolution of an array of cellular 
automatons and was inspired by the August 1988 Computer Recreations article by 
A.K. Dewdney in Scientific American.  These automatons function like the 
automatons of the "game" of life, but instead of being dead or alive, each has 
a degree of "infection." The array of cells with various states of health is 
displayed as a color coded image. Because it uses Color Quickdraw, *this 
program will only run on a Mac II* (or the rumored color SE!).  It can run in 
the background under MultiFinder and so a postage stamp size window can sit on 
your desktop displaying the current state of the automaton world while you work
in other applications. If you choose to calculate large arrays, adjust the 
memory allocation using Get Info in the Finder.  If the about box does not look
right, open the Control Panel CDEV Monitors and reset the system color table.  
(I'm working on fixing this bug, any suggestions?)  The program was written 
with Lightspeed C v3.0, an excellent, easy to use development system as 
evidenced by the fact that I only took up C last month!  I hope you enjoy 
Automatons and hope that you give me some feedback-- it would be much 
appreciated.  Look for future versions which fix known, non-fatal bugs, and 
include new features and improvements.

Major excerpts from (included) Read Me file:

7/25/88

This is a set of patches that fixes bugs in 3.0.

The patch program, "THINK C => 3.0p2", transforms your version 3.0

into version 3.0p2.

Bugs fixed

----------

(1)  In the "MF Attrs" pop-up menu in the "Set Project Type" dialog, the bit 
assignments for "MultiFinder-aware" and "Suspend & Resume Events" were 
reversed.

(2)  If the first argument to a macro call did not appear on the same line as 
the '(' preceding it, the compiler crashed.  This happened only when debugging 
was turned on.

(3)  Using the "Clear" command or key with a struct/array window frontmost

sometimes crashed the debugger.

(4)  Generating a 68881 "FTST d(An)" instruction sometimes crashed the

compiler.

(5)  Under MultiFinder, a DA opened (using the option key) in THINK C's or 
THINK C Debugger's layer did not always receive its update events.

(6)  When compiling very large files, there was a glitch in the line

count display.  This was a cosmetic problem only.

(7)  Incorrect code was generated for a conditional expression under

certain obscure conditions.

Subject: TEX v.0.5 .sit.hqx free-text real-time indexer/browser HC

Subject: stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is the file tex.0.5.sit.hqx, which has to be 
run through BINHEX and then STUFFIT to recover.  It's the HyperCard stack 
that's the shareware extended/enhanced/improved version of my old effort Texas.
 TEX (no relation to TeX or typesetting, obviously), like Texas, can be used to
build complete inverted indices to arbitrarily-large completely unstructured 
free-text files (which I call 'dataspaces') ... and like Texas, TEX lets you 
scroll around in an index window, click on a word to call up a 
key-word-in-context view of all of the occurrences of that word and its 
neighbors, click on a line in that Context view to jump immediately into the 
actual text of your dataspace at that point, and copy/paste anything you read 
from that Text view into notes or other material you're working on.

But in addition to what Texas allowed, TEX shows you multiple windows into a 
dataspace's Index view (independently scrollable), TEX lets you browse through 
multiple dataspaces (just copy the browsing Card and paste in extra copies), 
and TEX has 'subspace' browsing (a form of proximity search that's very 
friendly and nicely intuitive).  TEX is also much better designed graphically 
(thanks to help from Andreas Vichr) and is much easier for users to customize 
or extend at the HyperTalk scripting level.

TEX contains complete documentation, and the C source code for all of its XFCNS
is available separately (I'll try to post it to you here next).  The license 
fee requested is $10 for individual/family/nonprofit/educational users, and $40
for corporate users.  I would greatly appreciate any comments, suggestions for 
improvements, bug reports, etc. from anybody who tries the stack.

   Best,   ^z

Mark Zimmermann, 9511 Gwyndale Dr., Silver Spring, MD  20910

P.S.  if you can't get the .sit.hqx files off the net, you can send me a 
self-addressed stamped envelope, a formatted Mac disk, and $15 (which includes 
the individual license fee, refundable if you don't like TEX) and I'll put TEX 
0.5, the source code, qndxr, MultIndexer, brwsr, Texas version 0.27, and 
whatever else fits on there for you ... I really hate to spend time duplicating
disks, though, so please don't write unless there is no other way.  The same 
disk should be available from BMUG and other places in a few weeks....  
Apologies for mentioning money (pls feel free to delete this postscript, 
moderator!), but I don't want to be in the disk duping business any more!!

Subject: Texas v.0.27 HC indexer/browser free public-domain stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is a BINHEX'd, STUFFIT'd file of the latest 
version of Texas, 0.27 -- please discard all previous versions, as this one 
fixes some bugs in them that may cause trouble in the Merge Indices operation 
and elsewhere.

Texas, as previously described, is a free, public-domain HyperCard stack which 
lets you build complete inverted indices to big (hundreds of megabytes) 
unstructured text files, and then browse through those indices, clicking and 
retrieving key-word-in-context and full-text displays.  This version 0.27 is (I
hope!) the last one I'm going to work on, as it's superseded by TEX (posted 
separately with its source code) ... Texas lacks the subspace browsing 
(proximity search) and the multi-dataspace abilities of TEX, but it is free.  
If anybody wants to use Texas (or TEX) to build improved systems which have 
additional capabilities, I would be most pleased (provided you sell or 
otherwise distribute it at a rational price, rather than $30,000/copy -- sorry 
for editorializing, but the current price structure for inverted index systems 
is rather out of line, in my humble opinion!).  I took Texas and built TEX from
it; you may want to do the same.  Contact me for source code, or check around 
on the networks/boards....

Subject: Mac archives submission: MacSnoop 1.4.4

MacSnoop(TM) 1.4.4 Demo, 5 Aug 88, by Art A. Schumer, Shareware $25.

[upload from Boston Computer Society's Mac BBS & abstract by Jon Spear]

From the program's "Shareware Notice" text:

   "MacSnoop is a file/volume editor that was developed to help fill the gap 
   left by FEDIT since its departure from the shareware market. MacSnoop is 
   both HFS and MFS compatible and tries to adhere to the Macintosh interface 
   as closely as possible.

   "Some of the advanced features include support for any hard disk up to 512M 
   in size, the use of multiple windows for file/volume editing as well as 
   directory windows to allow you to perform common file tasks such as 
   renaming, deleting, locking, unlocking, attribute setting and informational 
   display."

MacSnoop (like the commercial programs MacZap Tools, Symantec Tools, FEDIT, and
Copy II's MacTools) lets you view/edit any block of a file or disk volume in 
hex or ASCII. These programs differ in user interface and features.

The included MacWrite-format user manual (dated 17 July 1988) includes a two 
page listing of bug fixes and incremental improvements through v1.3.1.

Version "1.4.4 Demo" doesn't explain what's changed or what improvements might 
be found in a non-demo version, but this is fully functional, NOT crippleware.

MacSnoop should work with Mac 512KE, Plus, SE, and II, but may have problems 
with pre-512KE machines with 64K ROMs. Multifinder compatible.

Subject: InvisiHDMainBo3b

Writing to you from SUNY Albany.  We believe that InvisiHDMainBo3b is where a 
virus is lodging and causing all kinds of problems.  We have it here at the 
University and are having a very difficult timing eradicating it.  It acts like
the SCORES virus, but not as quickly.  Eventually it eroded our systems 
resources making it very difficult to even erase the hard disk. The reason we 
think the virus is lodging in InvisiHDMainBo3b is Apple's Vaccine program 
identifies it as a questionable INIT file, but tells us to relax.  In the 
meantime, the system, finder, printing resources, etc. are being modified every
time we turn on the machine, plus other times in no kind of pattern.

We though we had eradicated the virus in August to find that while bringing 
back files one at a time from our back-ups and checking each one, it was 
reintroduced again.  When you are a true Mac User (not programmer) everything 
you find about viruses is in programmese; even the instructions on how to get 
rid of the virus.  Any tips (in English) would be appreciated.  We contacted 
the local Mac User group with no real solutions.  There are several macs on 
campus infected, and the university doesn't support mac so there is no help 
there.

Thanks again.  Laurie Webster-Saft, The University at Albany,

[Moderator's Note:

InvisiHDMainBo3b is an invisible data file from HDBackup!  This is the worst 
part about viruses, they spread fear and paranoia!  You have no virus, you are 
merely backing up your hard disks. --Jon]

Some of the Mac archives that I've logged on to have things divided into 
several different directories rather than all being in the same directory. 
Instead of naming everything "INIT..." and "GAME..." and "HC..." and ... 
couldn't you create directories called "INIT", "GAME", "HC", etc.?  It would 
make it much easier to find stuff, as well as to get lists of what is there 
without burning up as much time on my end or on yours.  Please let me know if 
you plan to do this or why you can't if you don't.

Subject: Backup of A/UX systems

We have recently purchased a MacII with A/UX (internal). The MacII runs off an 
ethernet populated with Suns. I have backed up the whole A/UX to a tape using 
one of the sun tapestations (using NFS).

The problem/question is: What do I do if I get a disastrous diskcrash on A/UX 
(everything wiped out) - how do I get the system up again? Assume that I have 
SASH on a floppy, and (if it helps) also have the A/UX system on a bunch of 
floppies besides the tape.

I cannot find anything in the manuals - they assume that any restore operation 
already has A/UX running. And I would like to avoid buying a backup disk, it 
would be such a waste of money in our environment of file- and tapeservers.

Cheers.

Subject: Macintosh use on Campus

I would like to find out how other colleges and universities are using 
Macintosh computers on their campuses, for example, the english dept. uses them
to teach writing, or the fine arts dept. uses them to teach computer graphics, 
etc.  I'd be interested to know of any software which is especially popular on 
campus, especially which word processor for the Mac people prefer and why.  I'd
also like to know if and how the macs are networked together, and if and how 
they are linked to the campus mainframes. You can reply to me individually, and
I will summarize to the net if people are interested.  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Document Numbering on a Mac

   Our lab recently made the transition from a Wang VS-100 system to a system 
with Mac SE's and Mac II's tied together with LocalTalk and Kinetics boxes to 
our Ethernet backbone. Part of our staff does research and part is the 
administrative support for that research.

   One of the problems we have had in the transition lies in the area of 
keeping track of documents. In our old system the Wang assigned a document 
number to each new document. Since all the terminals were connected to the 
VS-100, we had no problems sharing documents.

   Now with a more decentralized system, and with 30 staff people generating 
documents on their individual machines, we want to find a way to assign a 
document number to each document generated on each of the Macs, so that the 
document number can be placed at the bottom of each printed copy of the 
document.

   Does anyone know of an easy way to generated document numbers? We have 
written a HyperCard shell to do it, but it is cumbersome and does not follow 
the standard Mac "look and feel" guidelines. I cannot believe that there is not
an easier way.

Has anyone had any experience with the Imagewriter LQ? I have heard tah there 
have bee problems with the driver and incompatibilites with software. Also, are
are there many fonts available (since it requires that there be a font 3 times 
larger than the printed size to scale from for higher resolution).

Also, is it compatible with SuperSpool v5.0?

#72, posted by Dave Platt, dplatt@coherent.com.  Using System 5.0, I copied & 
pasted these resources into a copy of my System file, then renamed it and

screen, and then I had to reboot.  Has anyone tried to use this with success?  
I am a novice at using ResEdit and may not be doing things the correct way.

Subject: Ram Disks and MPW

We are dying a slow death running MPW. We know that Microsoft C on the PC can 
be run effectively with ram disks to increase performance and we have heard 
that the same can be done with MPW. So far we haven't had any luck. We have 
tried two programs, which we think are shareware or freeware: RamStart 1.32 and
RamDisk+ 1.4.  RamStart was on our Jasmine drive so it might be shareware, but 
RamDisk+ was on a BMUG disk so I assume it's freeware.

In any case, we haven't had any success using these programs with MPW. A while 
ago one guy tried RamDisk+ 1.4 and claimed that there was no performance 
improvement. Recently someone else here tried RamStart with System 6.01 (with 
and without multifinder) on a 5mb Mac II. However, when we double-clikc 
RamStart it crashes with "CanUt Mount the Ramdisk --- error -108."

So here's my questions:

Have you used a ram disk to increase MPW performance successfully? Which Ram 
Disk do you recommend? And how do you use it? If it's not one I have, where do 
you get it? Is it shareware, commercial ware, etc.? And what system is it 
working on?

Has anyone gotten RamStart to work with system 6.0 or 6.01? Is there any

documentation -- we don't seem to have any?

Any other suggestions?

thanks,

mark

Subject: BIG disks

I'm trying to find a source for a large (> 500 MB) SCSI disk with drivers for a
Mac.  Our project will be collecting large amounts of data, and also will be 
researching "electronic book" issues.  If we ever decide to cut a CD-ROM, I 
understand that we can send such a large disk to 3M and they will master it 
onto a CD for us.

Any information on suppliers, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I have info on
CMS Enhancements disks, but their drives are broken up into 300 MB physical 
drives, and I want a single volume (I am not willing to rewrite a SCSI driver 
to act that way, either).  I am also familiar with the WORM drive that Corel 
sells, but would be interested in any comparable optical drive.

PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE WITH IP ADDRESSING, SUBNETTING MACS to SUN WORKSTATIONS:

We are completing installation and configuration of a campus-wide Ethernet LAN.
 We have 250+ macintoshes distributed around campus, which are connected via 
Kinetics Fastpath 4 gateways, and which can make use of AlisaShare and Alisa 
Print System software on a VAX 8810 (vms 4.7). We also have a network of 9 Sun 
workstations, 8 of which use the ninth as a file server.  We are extending 
their ThinWire Ethernet cable to a DEMPR (ThinWire Repeater) and then to a 
DEBET (Thick wire Bridge), with the net (pun?) result of including their 
ethernet into the main campus LAN. We would like to use a Mac TCP/IP (NCSA 
Telnet or MacIP) so that the Macs can be used to log in to the Sun workstations
(or any other TCP host on our LAN).  Unfortunately, we must have the Macs and 
the Suns on different logical IP Subnets.

HERE'S THE QUESTION:  Does anyone have any experience with NCSA Telnet (or some
other Mac IP/telnet program in a similar situation?  We are currently

Subject: Wanted, dead or alive: Experience with Lang. Sys. Fortran

Is there anyone using Language Systems (MPW) Fortran?  For scientific number 
crunching, I've tried and nearly given up on Absoft's MacFortran/ 020. LSF 
[that's Language Systems, not LightSpeed :-(] is surely superior to Absoft, but
how good is it really?  I would like to know anyone's experience (good and bad)
with it.  Questions of interest include: 1. Speed (compile and execution time).
 The first version was reportedly slow, but they now advertise version 1.1.  
Has speed improved? 2. What else has changed? 3. Does it really support most 
VAX extensions?  How easy would it be to download a working VAX fortran file 
and run it? 4. How does it support namelist, for example? 5. What kind of 
support for 68020 and 68881 code does it have? 6. What does it do about the 
famous 32k segment limit?  They advertise support for large arrays, but what 
does that really mean? 7. What about code segmentation?  Does the user have to 
segment his program into < 32k segments in the normal Mac way?  At least Absoft
got around that by using > 16 bit offsets, but what about the MPW environment? 
Does the MPW linker require < 32k segments? 8. How easy is it to use really?  I
assume that since it is MPW, it is "Mac-like" in the redefined sense of MPW.  
But how does one choose among various compile time options, for example? 9. 
What kind of debugging support is there?  Are they waiting on SADE with MPW 
3.0? 10. For extra money, one is suppose to get a year's worth of upgrades. 
Does anyone know what is supposed to be added in the coming year(s). 11. How 
easy is it to call C routines? 12. How about Mac toolbox access? 13. And, most 
importantly, DOES IT GENERATE CORRECT CODE? 14. anything else of interest

I have also seen the Absoft ads offering an improved/faster Fortran for the MPW
environment sometime soon.  Does anyone have any knowledge at all about that?  
Could it be any better than the "normal" MacFortran?

Why does it seem that there are faster (i.e., better optimized, I guess) 
Fortrans for other 68020 machines (Suns, for example) than for the Mac II? 
Since the CPU hardware (68020 + 68881) is the same, is there some other 
fundamental hardware difference (bus or memory speed, perhaps) that makes the 
difference?  Or is the Mac OS slwoing things down somehow?  Or is it just that 
there has never been a lot of demand for good Fortran on the Mac so no one has 
ever produced or ported a good compiler.  Except Absoft, of course, and that 
hasn't worked out too well.

Thanks.  I will summarize to the net if I get individual replies.

Subject:  Re: overhead projectors

This note is a response to discussion in May issues of Info-Mac.  Those issues 
were not distributed over Bitnet until this week, hence the apparent delay. 
Down to the point.  I have recently checked the market for devices allowing to 
project Macintosh screen using overhead projectors.  I came up with a list of 
several companies selling such attachments.  Here they are

   product name      company                 phone

   QA-50             Sharp Electronics       800/be-sharp

   MacViewFrame      nView                   604/873-1354

   DataShow HR       Eastman Kodak           716/724-3169

   Mac-Screen Overhead  Ask LCD              404/399-5208

   FlatTop           Network Specialties     212/995-2224

   PC Viewer         In Focus Systems        503/692-4968

   Macnifier         Comtrex Limited         714/855-6600

They are not listed in any particular order.  I believe that Macnifier is 
marketed the longest of them all.  A few of them (like DataShow) will work with
Mac SE only.  Others require a different board to purchased depending on the 
Macintosh model.  All of them have list prices of the order of $1600 plus/minus
a 100 or so.  Some include video board, others require you to purchase them 
separately (ca. $200).  They also differ on optional stuff. I have seen only 
DataShow in real time.  It appeared to work just fine, although a good (bright)
overhead projector is required for large magnification.  It also seemed to 
follow changes on the screen quite well. The latter was the major complaint in 
the review published a few months ago in MacWorld (or MacUser) covering 2 or 3 
of those LCD devices.  I would like to learn about performance of any of these 
devices.

Reply-to: "Charles E. Bouldin" <bouldin@sed.ceee.nbs.gov>

I just got Draw II. It has several notable flaws, or at least some features 
that I need and can't seem to find. First, you cannot draw a circle, or a 
rectangle with dashed lines or a variable pen pattern for the line. This worked
in the old Draw 1.9.5 and is essential.

Also, the zoom in/out tools are very nice, but there is no command key

equivalent for these things.

Am I missing something here? For what it's worth, NO I am not running the 
newest, buggiest system 6.0 (or whatever the number is now) that was just 
released. Does this matter?

[Moderator's Note:

Use the option key on a pattern to get the pen to use it.

Does that qualify as standard?

For other minor thrills, I dare you to get text to Flip Horizontal. They added 
a lot of good stuff, but they forgot some of the basics. The fellow I spoke to 
at MacWorld said that they were addressing these and the PICT2 issue too. --

Subject: MacDraw II question & comments

We just received our copy of MacDraw II the other day and

I'd like to pass on some comments and questions.

This is a good package.  It should take care of most of the design needs that I
have.  It's very much like old MacDraw in operation, so it doesn't take long to
learn.  Some of the features that make this package good are the zooming, the 
layering, and the ability to rotate objects at arbitrary angles.  Also very 
useful are the ability to save various rulers, line styles, and views.  There 
are many other features that make this a great improvement over MacDraw.

There are, however, a few things that could be improved. Color support is only 
the old 8 color, fixed palette, with mixing in patterns used to provide other 
colors.  MacDraw II should support full color.

The ability to draw objects from a center rather than a corner is good, 
especially for circles.  When drawing an arc from the center, the center is 
apparently the centroid of the shape, rather than the center of the circle of 
which the arc is a part.  When I draw an arc from the center, I want to pin 
down the position of the center of the circle.

Dashed lines only work for lines.  You can't make a dashed

circle or polygon.

Pattern fill works as it did on old MacDraw.  A paint-bucket type of fill would
be useful for shading areas bounded by arcs, etc.  Maybe a polygon maker could 
do this:  click in a white area and the program would look for the edges of the
innermost enclosed area, and create a polygon from those edges.  Also, it would
be nice to take two open polygons and connect them into one.  Splitting a 
polygon is easy, just duplicate it and delete the undesired vertices.

More arbitrary alignment features would be good.  For instance, align selected 
points on objects (ie vertices on a polygon)

MacDraw II has plotter support with the MacPlot driver.  I haven't been able to
try it.  Even though we have some plotters, none of them are available to hook 
up, and the driver seems unable to write to a file.  Maybe someone's written a 
cdev or whatever that will reroute the output to a serial port to a file.  
There are problems with switching back and forth between the Laserwriter driver
and the plotter driver.  Quitting the program generally clears them up.

One major problem that I see is the inability to save in a published format 
that retains all of the information in the document.  Saving to the clipboard 
illustrates this problem. Make a color drawing, cut it, paste it into another 
program, copy it out and paste it back into MacDraw II, and the color is lost. 
Even Pict format has 8 color built in.  The rest of the information should at 
least be implemented into PICT comments.

I realize that some of my wants would be provided by a CAD

program, and this program is only $300.

All-in-all, MacDraw II is a good program, and it seems so

far to be bug-free, although I haven't tested it

thouroughly.  Any help with writing plotter info to a file so I can carry it to
a plotter we have would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Mapping software desired...

My home town has recently formed an environmental commission.  One of our key 
missions is to map the environmentally sensitive areas -- that is, areas easily
subject to damage, of unusual quality, or particular historical, recreational 
or scenic beauty.  The information will be used to help protect these areas 
before they become lost forever.

At present, we have many maps with features hand drawn, but the manipulation 
and comparison of the maps becomes very cumbersome.  I know that commercial 
mapping systems exist, but the one's I've seen are very very expensive -- well 
out of the budget for most rural communities.

I'd like to locate some Mac software to facilitate our work.

Most of the maps are on standard topographic scale (7.5' quadrangle) and I have
easy access to scanners that can load the maps into the MAC.

I'd like software that can start with a background figure (basic map) and then 
overlay various features (e.g. geology, land use, wetlands...). Most 
importantly, it would support the capacity to zoom in or out in order to 
examine the details in a map region.  Since a 7.5 min topographic map or town 
is about 3 ft. square, the ability to zoom out is essential to avoid tunnel 
vision.

Does anyone have suggestions or leads for good software packages for the Mac 
(without getting into the multi kilo-$$ systems)?  We'd sure appreciate tools 
to "fight back" from some of the strange ideas proposed by developers.

thanks in advance.

Subject: software for theatre work?

Does anyone out there know of theatre software which runs on IBM-PC's, Apple 
][e's, Atari ST's, Mac's, or Amiga's?  (Sorry for the broad cross- posting, but
it seems there's no net news group specifically set up for things theatrical.)

A friend of mine does set design, and remarked that no program seems to have 
been written with a set designer in mind.  We got to talking about it, and 
decided that choreography could be also made easier with a computer (instead of
having the whole cast out on stage running up and down doing variations of a 
number).  It strikes me that both could be helped a little by a good drawing 
package which allowed the use of different perspectives and of animation, but I
imagine someone who does more theatre work would find a need for facilities I 
haven't thought of.

So, to sum up, does anyone out there know what's available for theatre work, 
particularly set design and choreography, but also lighting, or anything else 
you can think of.

Please send replies directly to me, as I don't subscribe to all of these

digests.

Subject: MPW's Print command

Recently, I had to write a printer driver to "Appletalk" data to a

print server we put together on our Vax.

Anyways, I seem to be having a bit of a problem with printing from MPW 
occasionally.  I'm not sure, but by the looks of things, MPW's Print command 
doesn't seem to be setting up the first and last page fields of the print job 
subrecord.  Instead, those fields seem to be randomly filled-in (presumably not
filled in).

What I assume it wants is for my driver to just print everything that it sends 
it, which is fair enough.  What I'm doing is "properly" trapping out invalid 
page numbers (page numbers out of range, first page greater than last page, 
etc.) and in those cases defaulting to print all the pages that are sent.  
However, if MPW "sends" me some page combination like 85-113, I have no way of 
knowing that these numbers are wrong, so I print those pages, which usually 
means printing nothing at all, since most documents are a lot shorter than 85 
pages to begin with!

I guess the basic question is, what am I doing wrong, if anything? Is there 
some way to tell that an application is just asking for you to print 
everything?  I haven't found any documentation to that effect, which of course 
doesn't say much.

Any help would definitely be appreciated.  Please send responses to myself 
directly, as I'm not part of the list distribution.  I will summarize any 
findings to the list afterwards.

(While I'm posting anyways, does anyone have any comments on the public domain 
Modula-2 compiler "packaged" as MOD1.HQX-MOD13.HQX?)

Thanks in advance.

Subject: In-use light for 800K drives

Ever since I got my MacII, I've wanted to attach an in-use LED to each of my 
800K floppies.  There are times when certain programs use more than one floppy 
(ignoring the hard disk), and I'd really like to know what is going on.  This 
is particularly important for me since I frequently use II in a Mac, the Apple 
II emulator, which will let one or both floppies operate like Apple II 
Unidisks.

For some reason, Apple does not like including in-use lights on their floppy 
disk drives for the Macintosh. The purpose of these indicators on other 
machines is to let you know the disk is being used and shouldn't be removed 
until the light goes out.  But it's still pretty important to know when it's in
use on the Mac.

Apple DOES include an in-use LED on their 800K "Apple 3.5 drive", but that's 
only because the drive is used on both Apple IIGS and Macintosh. And 
unfortunately, you can't connect an external floppy to the MacII. I managed to 
get a "peek" inside the Apple 3.5 external drive at a local dealer. In addition
to the standard Sony drive/controller combination used on all Apple 800K 
mechanisms, the external drive has a "piggy back" board which attaches between 
the drive controller and the external cable. This board (which has a SONY part 
#) provides a connection for a drive LED, a connection for an intelligent 
manual eject button, and a "pass-through" port for chaining additional drives 
(on the Apple II).  Looking up this part in Apple service literature puts its 
price at ~ $65.00!

I've done a little probing with my DVM, but am unwilling to connect an LED 
without prior knowledge.  A friend of mine tried attaching an LED to one of the
leads on the IR head sensor pair, and ended up blowing his drive (and spending 
over $300 to fix his damage).

So my question is, has anybody successfully attached an in-use light to their 
800K drive?  I know there were a set of drawings for doing this on the 400K 
drives, but the boards for the 800K drives are different.  I have the LED's 
(small rectangular Telefunken brand), but am not willing to play around finding
a connection.  What I'd like is a set of detaild instructions (including 
current-matching or other warnings) of where to connect the LED, what other 
devices (resistor values, caps, transistors?) to attach between the board and 
the indicator.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: MacII audio port

When Apple introduced the Macintosh II, I was under the distinct impression 
from Apple's own engineers that the sound capabilities of the MacII were 
significantly better than the MacPlus and SE.  For one, the MacII allows 
sampling rates of up to 44KHz, as opposed to 22KHz on the Plus/SE. This allows 
for accurate reproduction of sampled frequencies as high as 22KHz. But this 
would be expected for a higher-speed processor such as the 68020. 
(Unfortunately, the standard serial ports aren't capable of transferring the 
data from sounds sampled at greater than 22KHz).

The MacII also includes a specialized sound chip, and a line-level audio port. 
I had heard that Apple includes a set of Sony pre-amps on the motherboard, and 
that the audio port is a mini-stereo jack of the type used in stereo walkmans.

However, the Apple Interface Guide for service engineers shows the pinouts for 
the MacII. This guide lists the MacII audio port as a MONORAL mini phone jack 
of the type used on the SE, Plus, and earlier Macs.

So I have two questions:

1) Is the MacII audio port a mini-stereo or standard monoral phone jack?

   If it is monoral, how do you have to buy a special card to get stereo sound?

2) With the advent of System 6.0 (forget about the sound bugs), and the Inside

   Mac Vol.5 Sound Manager implemented in RAM on the Plus and SE, what 
   advantage does the Apple custom digital sound chip in the II offer?  I 
   haven't seen any MacII-specific music software, or am I missing something?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Mac II ROM Query

I have a Mac+ with a Novy Systems 68020 accelerator board. One option in the 
support software is "copy ROM into high-speed 32 bit RAM". I use that option 
routinely and it makes a very large performance difference. Which leads to the 
questions about the Mac II ROM: 1. Is it 32 bits wide? 2. Is it accessed at 
full processor speed?

I would *guess* that the answer to those questions is yes, but Apple has cut so
many corners in the past that I am not sure. Anyone know ? If the answer to 
either question is NO, then copying the ROM into RAM may speed up the Mac II.

Subject: MacApp versus LSP 2.0 Comments

I spoke with the developers of LightSpeed Pascal 2.0 at MacWorld and then took 
Dave Wilson's MacApp class wherein we spoke a bit about LSP versus MacApp. 
Here's the situation as I understand it.

LSP cannot handle either the conditional compilation directives or the 
segmentation directives of MPW Pascal (TML Pascal II can).  The LSP people said
that they were hacking/getting a version of MacApp that would be specially 
treated for LSP.  Dave Wilson said he thought that might fly but that Kurt 
Schmucker apparently lambasted the LSP people saying that no one wanted to buy 
another version of MacApp, which is quite true.  I've paid enough for all the 
various versions of MacApp that I haven't used. :-)

Apparently the segmentation problem is the more massive one as LSP places an 
entire unit into a segment while MPW Pascal and MacApp can and do place any 
routine into any segment.  For example, all the methods of an object are 
defined in the same unit, but the debugging routines all go into the debugging 
segment, printing routines into the printing segment, etc.

Only time will tell...

Subject: PowerEdit DA LaserWriter Problem

I have been using the  PowerEdit DA, a simple but powerful text editor, to edit
long files.  (PowerEdit can handle files >32K).  The text appears on the screen
as Monaco (I think). When I try to print it on our LaserWriters, it comes out 
as Chicago, whether I leave "font substitution" checked or unchecked; except 
once it printed out as Geneva (Helevetica if font sub on.)

I am puzzled as to what's happening; I would like it to  print in a monospaced 
font like Monaco or Courier so that numbers in tables line up properly.  Can 
anyone suggest why it isn't attempting to use the screen font to print?  Is 
there any simple modification I can make to the program/system to make it print
in one of the monospaced fonts?  (I tried installing Monaco into the DA but 
that made no difference.)

I am using System 4.2 and LaserWriter/Laser Prep 5.1.

Thanks very much in advance,

High Capacity Floppy Drives.

A report by Natick, Massachusetts consulting and market research firm Venture 
Development says that within two years, the standard 3.5 inch floppy drive 
capacity will have increased from 1.44 Mbytes to 4 Mbytes.  Toshiba already has
introduced a 4 Mbyte 3.5 inch drive, the PD-210, which uses disks that are 
magnetized vertically instead of horizontally.  The future of floppy drives 
could also be radically changed by "Digital Paper" (see last month's column) 
which potentially could be used to make 100 Mbyte floppy disks.  However, 
Digital Paper is not (yet) eraseable.  - PC Week 18 July

"Floptical" Drive.

Insite Peripherals is scheduled to introduce a 20.8 Mbyte, 3.5 inch floppy disk
drive that combines aspects of optical servo and magnetic recording technology 
in the first quarter of 1989.  The drive, dubbed the Model 1325 Floptical Disk 
Drive, uses otherwise standard 3.5 inch floppy disks that have been modified by
embedding optical-servo tracks in them at 20 micron intervals.  The drive will 
retail for approximately $500, and Insite plans to license major manufacturers,
including Kodak and Xidex, to make the Floptical disks for an, as yet, 
unspecified price. - InfoWorld 15 August

Ever Larger DRAM.

IBM may be planning to skip 4 Mbit RAM chips altogether (see last month's 
column) but four other manufacturers, Siemens, Toshiba, Matsushita, and Texas 
Instruments, expect to be making volume shipments of 4 megabit memory chips by 
the middle of next year.  Meanwhile, IBM researchers have successfully 
demonstrated a new integrated circuit production technology that may result in 
64 megabit (8 Mbytes) memory chips.  Although the technology still needs 
development, once volume production begins the price of the resulting chips 
will "not be ridiculous" according to Jerome Silverman, a research staff member
with IBM. - InfoWorld 25 July and 1 August

Coming From Big Blue.

In keeping with the announced policy of introducing product enhancements about 
every six months (see last April's column), IBM is expected to incorporate 
graphics based on the 8154 display adapter into the motherboard of new PS/2 
machines this Fall.  The super-VGA display offers a resolution of 1,024 by 728 
in up to 256 colors from a palette of 262,144.  Among the new models expected 
are a 80386 upgrade of the Model 60.  Entry Systems Division spokesperson Jim 
Monahan has acknowledged that an 80286-based replacement for the model 30 
(known in rumors as the "Model 35") is in the works but denies the low-end 
machine will be built around an AT-bus.  Meanwhile, financial analysts and 
dealers have been told that it could be more than a year before IBM introduces 
the "AIX family" of RISC-CPU machines which will have Micro Channel 
Architecture and be OS/2 compatibility. - InfoWorld 18 July, 1 and 22 August

New PC Software.

IBM denies rumors that the long awaited Presentation Manager, due to ship in 
October, will be late.  David Harrington, IBM's communications product manager,
did admit that meeting the promised delivery date will be "very challenging."  
Version 2 of the Ventura Publisher will be released this Fall with an improved 
user interface using pull-down and drop-down menus, increased network support, 
and document management features.  The price is expected to be about the same 
as the $895 for the present version. Microsoft expects to ship its Mail program
for MS-DOS in October.  Someone forgot to include the "auto-hyphenate" feature 
in WordPerfect 5.0 even though it is in the documentation.  A bug fix is 
expected soon. - InfoWorld 1, 15 and 22 August and PC Week 15 August

Apollo's 7-MIP Workstations.

The Apollo Series 4500 workstations which will begin shipping in the fourth 
quarter are the first to use the dual ported 68882 math coprocessor at 33 MHz 
along with the Motorola 68030 CPU.  The 7-MIP, 8 Mbyte RAM Apollo computers 
will be comparable in both price ($23,490 to $36,490) and performance to the 
Sun 4/110 RISC-based workstation. - InfoWorld 18 July and PC Week 18 July

1989 Model Macs.

Apple may be planning to introduce a whole line Macintoshes built around the 
68030 shortly after the new year.  In addition to a desktop model, look for a 
high-end laptop and, and a stand alone "tower" that can act as a network server
and support multiple workstations (multiuser, multitasking).  Apple also will 
begin producing its own memory chips beginning in 1990. - InfoWorld 25 July and
PC Week 15 August

IIgs+ Delayed.

Apple did not introduce an accelerator for the Mac SE at the recently concluded
Mac World as had been rumored, although several third party vendors have 
announced such products. Apparently, Apple management decided to take President
Sculley's commitment to major customers ("no new CPU's in 1988") very 
literally.  Sources inside Apple insist that an accelerated Apple IIgs (the 
widely rumored gs+) will not be shipped until some time after the performance 
of the entire Macintosh line is improved. - A Knowlegeable (Anonymous) Source 
(Developer)

Mac II CPU's.

Daystar Digital has announced a 33-MHz accelerator for the Macintosh II that 
plugs into the 68020's original location. The Daystar product features a 
120-nanosecond memory running at zero wait states and a RAM cache.  The 
accelerator will be shipped in the fourth quarter.  Daystar also offers 16 and 
25 MHz accelerators for the Mac SE and Mac Plus.  Intel, makers of the 80xxx 
chips, is rumored to have offered Apple a "cheap" 68020.  Will Motorola respond
by cloning the 80486?  - InfoWorld 22 August

Forthcoming MacWare.

Apple engineers demonstrated the new version of Quickdraw (Quickerdraw?) at Mac
World by showing real-time color animation running in different windows on a 
Mac II.  The function will be incorporated in an unspecified upcoming version 
of the Macintosh operating system.  "Nufinder" which will include commands for 
supporting "guests" with limited access to files and folders will be part of 
System 8.0 coming in January.  Apple also has confirmed it will release a beta 
version of a C++ translator for its MPW C language to developers in October.  
The translator will permit MPW C developers to do object-oriented programming. 
Currently only MPW Pascal is the only language from Apple that supports 
object-oriented programming for the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop and Mac App
programming library. Microsoft is said to be working furiously on a major 
update of Excel (expected to become version 2.0) for release shortly after the 
new year.  The new version will allow larger spreadsheets and address other 
limitations such as the difficulty of creating complex charts.  Product manager
Pradeep Singh says the new Mac version will leapfrog the PC version in 
functionality.  Word 4.0 with an automatic data link to Excel spreadsheets is 
expected to be released in October.  Word 4.0 also will allow users to edit in 
preview mode and improve the program's Page View function.  A new Microsoft 
Works, version 2.0, with an upgraded spell checker, some desktop publishing 
features such as linked multiple columns, and improved drawing facilities is 
scheduled for October shipment, and Quick Basic for the Macintosh should appear
in September at a retail price of $99.  Acius has decided to withhold version 
1.1 of its 4th Dimension relational database package.  Instead, version 2.0 
with approximately 100 new features will ship in December. Wingz may fly at 
last by the end of the month.  The original announcement last January 
envisioned a June release, later extended to mid-September.

HyperCard Search/Retrieve "Engine."

KnowledgeSet is expected to release a commercial version of the HyperCard 
search and retrieve engine created for the Arthur Young accounting firm later 
this month.  The Macintosh program, called HyperKRS for "Knowledge Retrieval 
System," can be used with CD ROM as well as magnetic media and is up to 200 
times faster than HyperCard on its own. - PC Week 1 August

"Hypercard" IIgs.

Roger Wagner Publishing is planning on premiering a 'hypercard' for the IIgs at
the Sept 88 Applefest.  it will not read Mac stacks because many use external, 
binary executable functions.  More hearsay is that Apple is still working on a 
real hypercard for the GS. - Larry Virden 31 July and Open Apple August

Well, Almost 100% Compatible.

Developers of the Adobe Postscript clone printers (last December's column) now 
arriving on the market claim "100% compatibility."  However, because the 
Postscript page description language is complex and includes a number of 
undocumented features, industry sources say that it is impossible to verify 
complete compatibility.  So far, there is no standard testing program accepted 
by the entire industry.  - PC Week 25 July

One-Pass Color Laser.

Colorocs Corporation has demonstrated a single-pass four color printer that is 
more advanced and faster than multiple pass printers available today.  Colorocs
expects printers based on their technology to be offered initially at $30,000 
(a bargain compared to the only other one-pass color printer under development 
by Kodak which analysts expect to cost more than $80,000).  - PC Week 15 August

portion of the chip has a native instruction set of 155 commands, but the 
company can configure three programmable logic arrays (PLAs) on the chip to 
translate another processor's instructions into the CPU's native instruction.  
A 25 MHz version of the 32-bit VM8600S already has PLAs configured to translate
Intel 80386 instructions.  PLAs to emulate the 68000 family and even the yet to
be shipped 65832 are technically feasible. Unfortunately, samples of the 
microprocessor probably won't be available in the United States for about a 
year. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

On Reflection.

A new display technology for portable computers and

television sets has been developed by Reflection

Technology.  The device called the Private Eye is a 1 by 1.2 by 1.3 inch 
monocular headset weighing less than 2 ounces that produces an image that 
appears to float in space about two feet in front of the viewer.  The 
resolution is 720 by 280 pixels and should be available in quantity in about 8 
months for around $200 retail.  - InfoWorld 1 August

Color LCD.

Casio has a new color Liquid Crystal Display screen with 200,000 pixels in a 
six inch screen.  Resolution is said to be the equal of a standard CRT.  - 
Random Access 20 August

Vision System for Mac II.

Machine vision, held back by closed proprietary platforms, could turn the 
corner now that Automatix, Inc., of Billerica, MA, has announced Autovision 90 
and, with it, an industry first - Compatability with an open, standard platform
- namely, Apple's Macintosh II. Called Automatix Standard Application Package, 
or ASAP, the software accepts any RS170 interlaced-frame camera.  A minimum 
system which includes a frame-grabber board, high-resolution color or 
monochrome monitor, ASAP software, and RAIL programming language starts at 
$18,000. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

Subject: Stuffit 1.5.1 (Mac archives submission)

Yet another version of Stuffit Shareware program follows, as a binhexed 
Stuffited (v1.4) file.  To reduce bootstrapping problems, please ensure that 
either Stuffit or UnStuffit is stored unStuffited.

Jon Spear

[excerpts from (included) Stuffit 1.5.1 Read Me]

ADDENDUM regarding bug fix version 1.5.1

About StuffIt 1.5.1 (8-29-88)

StuffIt 1.5.1 is a bug fix release.  It corrects several problems in 1.5. 
Almost all of these problems were caused by my hasty conversion from 
LightspeedC 2.15 to 3.0.  In the conversion, I expected that everything will be
identical.  (A legitimate assumption.)  Unfortunately, that assumption was 
false.  As a result, quite a few, both innocuous and serious, bugs crept into 
1.5.  All known problems as of today (and I think we caught most of them) have 
been corrected in 1.5.1.

The bugs corrected are:

1. Operation of TEXT add has been restored.

2. A disk error during compression (usu. disk full) no longer crashes machine. 
3. On larger HDs, free space may be reported as negative.  Fixed 4. Aborting a 
HMF add and keeping the partially added HMF sometimes results in

   a corrupted entry.  Fixed.

Though it isn't a major improvement, performance under MultiFinder has been 
improved to the extent that running StuffIt in the background is now tolerable 
-- not great, but tolerable.

Subject: NumTalk & LSC source

This is a program called Number Talk.  If you type in a number (e.g., 
"-234.35"), Number Talk will spell it ("Negative Two Hundred Thirty-Four Point 
Three Five") and will also speak it, provided you have a MacinTalk driver in 
your System Folder.

It gets more interesting when you type in HUGE numbers

("One Trillion ...")!

The Lightspeed C source code, stripped project file, and a short "How To" 
document are included.  The program and its source code are public domain.

Have fun!

Subject: [hierarchical menus demo]

The following BinHex StuffIt file contains a LSC demo program I wrote, as well 
as the source code, resource file, and stripped project file.

This program demonstrates how to use hierarchical menus.  It also demonstrates 
how to handle DA's, how to make your own "About..." box (with an icon), and how
to use dialog boxes.

The use of this source code is FREE, provided it is for non-profit purposes.  I
hope it can save someone some time!

However the name "T Bear Software" and the T Bear icon are both Copyright (C) 
1988 by Ted C. Johnson, and may NOT be used without my express written 
permission.

Here's version 0.9967 if HierDA - it replaces 1.0 (yes, that's right)

I did remember one thing that may make it less desirable, someone told me that 
it does not work with fullwrite......Jorg knows this and was going to see if he
could figure out why.

[Moderator's Note:  hierDA is a INIT/CDEV that will make the DA menu (in

   systems 4.1 and above, hierarchical.  For things like the control panel, 
   you'll be able to select which control panel item will be brought up first 
   by selecting it from a pop-up hierarchical menu connected to the DA menu's

Knowing that Inside Mac has been particularly sketchy about how to write 
control definition functions, I finally got around to taking up the task.  The 
following is a stuffit archive of source, lightspeed c projects and a macpaint 
document that allows a push-on/push-off button to be defined as a control.  It 
is by no means complete as far as the control definition function is concerned,
as buttons do not require dragging, tracking or region calculation, but it will
serve as a decent skeleton to start from.

[SoundMaster 1.1 cdev]

SoundMaster is a shareware Control Panel device from Bruce Tomlin, and is a 
godsend to those of you who like to have various Mac sounds replaced with your 
very own digitized sounds.  The various features include

       o   Specific sounds for the following operations

*  Startup

*  Shutdown

*  Restart

*  Disk Eject

*  Disk Insert

*  Bad Disk

*  System Beep

*  Key Click

       o   Plays SoundCap, SoundWave, and SoundEdit files at ALL 4 SAMPLING

RATES!  (No more 22 kHz startup sounds...).  It does not read snd

resources.

       o   Individual volume settings for each sound.

       o   Each sound can be stored anywhere in or under the System Folder.

       o   You can play the sounds inside SoundMaster, to test for the right

sampling rate.

This has allowed me to dump CheapBeep, SoundInit, ShutdownSound, MacII, MacPuke
and MacFeedMe.  VERY handy, and I've had no problems with it.

   Standard Disclaimer   I have no connections with Bruce Tomlin, other than

having sent my $10 shareware fee in 15 minutes after downloading this baby.

DriveLock - an INIT that "locks" floppy drives

Here is a little piece of work I had to do a couple of weeks ago. It's called 
DriveLock, and maybe it is of some use to you ...

   DriveLock is a simple INIT that  "locks"  floppy  drives.  This  means

that during the normal course of operation of a Macintosh a disk  will

   no longer be ejectable from a that drive. DriveLock arose out  of  the

   need  to  prevent  students  in  a  university  Macintosh  lab   from:

   o       booting with their own Startup disks (usually with old versions  of

      the  System,  and  without  AppleShare  and  AppleTalk  ImageWriter

      drivers); this  caused  all  kinds  of unnecessary network problems

   o  taking the university-supplied Startup  disks  home  "by accident".

   DriveLock can also be useful for demonstration  machines  at  computer

   shows, or for dealers, where you want people to be  able  to  use  the

   machine  without  being  able  to  take  inserted  floppies  home   or

inserting their own floppies for copying ...

And then it can be great fun to put a copy of DriveLock in a  friend's

   (or enemy's) System Folder while  s/he  isn't looking ...  you  didn't

hear this from me!

Subject: Black and White XFCN

Here is an XFCN that returns whether or not Hypercard's card window is on a 
black and white (i.e. 2 color or 1 bit) screen.  This is most useful for being 
able to make Hypercard call the Switch-a-Roo FKEY automatically with my DoFKEY 
XCMD.  Please note that Hypercard will only do it's visual effects if the card 
window is on the main screen (i.e. the one with the menu bar) so this XFCN does
not tell you if Hypercard will do it's visual effects, but since you have to 
move the card to another window, I figure you will know that and script 
accordingly.

Subject: QVT - a shareware terminal emulator (2 parts)

This posting contains QVT, a shareware terminal emulator for the

Macintosh.  QVT has the following features:

-  VT52, VT100 and VT220 emulation.

-  Support for both old-style and ADB keyboards.

-  Support for XMODEM, YMODEM, Kermit, and XMODEM-with-MacBinary

   protocols.

-  Autodialing (and demon dialing) using Hayes-compatible modems. -  Permits 
configuration of the "delete" key (sends either BS or DEL),

   screen (cursor type, smooth or fast scrolling, auto-newline, etc.), serial 
   interface (speed, parity, etc.), and auto-dial phone number. Configurations 
   can be saved;  double-clicking on a configuration file launches the 
   emulator, loads the configuration, and brings up the autodialer dialog box 
   if a phone number has been entered.

I've tested the program for a couple of days.  It's been a solid performer 
during those limited tests;  there were no unexpected errors or bombs.  The 
Kermit and MacBinary XMODEM protocols seem to work OK; I haven't tried YMODEM, 
and the Kermit protocol support doesn't appear to include sliding-windows or 
large packets.  The program refers to the MacBinary-encoded XMODEM protocol 
simply as "MacBinary";  this is a bit of a misnomer, as MacBinary can run on 
top of XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM, Kermit, or any other file-transfer protocol.

There appear to be a few rough spots and limitations in its use of the Mac 
toolbox QVT doesn't run in the background under MultiFinder, and doesn't use 
SFPutFile during downloads (thus making it difficult to download files into a 
directory other than the one that the program is stored in).  Hayes-modem 
support appears adequate, although not exceptional; for example, it appears to 
be impossible to embed mode-change strings in the "phone number to dial" field.
 The program switches the modem from "verbose" to "numeric" result codes, and 
leaves it that way when you exit.

The program is pretty easy to use, although it's clear that there are features 
that can only be used if you have access to the documentation (for which you 
must send in the $50 shareware fee).  I haven't decided yet whether to pay the 
shareware fee for this program, or to buy a copy of VersaTerm.

Date: 31-AUG-1988 21:55 by DWOOD

CELLULAR AUTOMATONS v0.1 (8/31/88)

This application calculates and displays the evolution of an array of cellular 
automatons and was inspired by the August 1988 Computer Recreations article by 
A.K. Dewdney in Scientific American.  These automatons function like the 
automatons of the "game" of life, but instead of being dead or alive, each has 
a degree of "infection." The array of cells with various states of health is 
displayed as a color coded image. Because it uses Color Quickdraw, *this 
program will only run on a Mac II* (or the rumored color SE!).  It can run in 
the background under MultiFinder and so a postage stamp size window can sit on 
your desktop displaying the current state of the automaton world while you work
in other applications. If you choose to calculate large arrays, adjust the 
memory allocation using Get Info in the Finder.  If the about box does not look
right, open the Control Panel CDEV Monitors and reset the system color table.  
(I'm working on fixing this bug, any suggestions?)  The program was written 
with Lightspeed C v3.0, an excellent, easy to use development system as 
evidenced by the fact that I only took up C last month!  I hope you enjoy 
Automatons and hope that you give me some feedback-- it would be much 
appreciated.  Look for future versions which fix known, non-fatal bugs, and 
include new features and improvements.

Major excerpts from (included) Read Me file:

This is a set of patches that fixes bugs in 3.0.

The patch program, "THINK C => 3.0p2", transforms your version 3.0

into version 3.0p2.

Bugs fixed

----------

(1)  In the "MF Attrs" pop-up menu in the "Set Project Type" dialog, the bit 
assignments for "MultiFinder-aware" and "Suspend & Resume Events" were 
reversed.

(2)  If the first argument to a macro call did not appear on the same line as 
the '(' preceding it, the compiler crashed.  This happened only when debugging 
was turned on.

(3)  Using the "Clear" command or key with a struct/array window frontmost

sometimes crashed the debugger.

(4)  Generating a 68881 "FTST d(An)" instruction sometimes crashed the

compiler.

(5)  Under MultiFinder, a DA opened (using the option key) in THINK C's or 
THINK C Debugger's layer did not always receive its update events.

(6)  When compiling very large files, there was a glitch in the line

count display.  This was a cosmetic problem only.

(7)  Incorrect code was generated for a conditional expression under

certain obscure conditions.

Subject: TEX v.0.5 .sit.hqx free-text real-time indexer/browser HC

Subject: stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is the file tex.0.5.sit.hqx, which has to be 
run through BINHEX and then STUFFIT to recover.  It's the HyperCard stack 
that's the shareware extended/enhanced/improved version of my old effort Texas.
 TEX (no relation to TeX or typesetting, obviously), like Texas, can be used to
build complete inverted indices to arbitrarily-large completely unstructured 
free-text files (which I call 'dataspaces') ... and like Texas, TEX lets you 
scroll around in an index window, click on a word to call up a 
key-word-in-context view of all of the occurrences of that word and its 
neighbors, click on a line in that Context view to jump immediately into the 
actual text of your dataspace at that point, and copy/paste anything you read 
from that Text view into notes or other material you're working on.

But in addition to what Texas allowed, TEX shows you multiple windows into a 
dataspace's Index view (independently scrollable), TEX lets you browse through 
multiple dataspaces (just copy the browsing Card and paste in extra copies), 
and TEX has 'subspace' browsing (a form of proximity search that's very 
friendly and nicely intuitive).  TEX is also much better designed graphically 
(thanks to help from Andreas Vichr) and is much easier for users to customize 
or extend at the HyperTalk scripting level.

TEX contains complete documentation, and the C source code for all of its XFCNS
is available separately (I'll try to post it to you here next).  The license 
fee requested is $10 for individual/family/nonprofit/educational users, and $40
for corporate users.  I would greatly appreciate any comments, suggestions for 
improvements, bug reports, etc. from anybody who tries the stack.

P.S.  if you can't get the .sit.hqx files off the net, you can send me a 
self-addressed stamped envelope, a formatted Mac disk, and $15 (which includes 
the individual license fee, refundable if you don't like TEX) and I'll put TEX 
0.5, the source code, qndxr, MultIndexer, brwsr, Texas version 0.27, and 
whatever else fits on there for you ... I really hate to spend time duplicating
disks, though, so please don't write unless there is no other way.  The same 
disk should be available from BMUG and other places in a few weeks....  
Apologies for mentioning money (pls feel free to delete this postscript, 
moderator!), but I don't want to be in the disk duping business any more!!

Subject: Texas v.0.27 HC indexer/browser free public-domain stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is a BINHEX'd, STUFFIT'd file of the latest 
version of Texas, 0.27 -- please discard all previous versions, as this one 
fixes some bugs in them that may cause trouble in the Merge Indices operation 
and elsewhere.

Texas, as previously described, is a free, public-domain HyperCard stack which 
lets you build complete inverted indices to big (hundreds of megabytes) 
unstructured text files, and then browse through those indices, clicking and 
retrieving key-word-in-context and full-text displays.  This version 0.27 is (I
hope!) the last one I'm going to work on, as it's superseded by TEX (posted 
separately with its source code) ... Texas lacks the subspace browsing 
(proximity search) and the multi-dataspace abilities of TEX, but it is free.  
If anybody wants to use Texas (or TEX) to build improved systems which have 
additional capabilities, I would be most pleased (provided you sell or 
otherwise distribute it at a rational price, rather than $30,000/copy -- sorry 
for editorializing, but the current price structure for inverted index systems 
is rather out of line, in my humble opinion!).  I took Texas and built TEX from
it; you may want to do the same.  Contact me for source code, or check around 
on the networks/boards....

MacSnoop(TM) 1.4.4 Demo, 5 Aug 88, by Art A. Schumer, Shareware $25.

[upload from Boston Computer Society's Mac BBS & abstract by Jon Spear]

From the program's "Shareware Notice" text:

   "MacSnoop is a file/volume editor that was developed to help fill the gap 
   left by FEDIT since its departure from the shareware market. MacSnoop is 
   both HFS and MFS compatible and tries to adhere to the Macintosh interface 
   as closely as possible.

   "Some of the advanced features include support for any hard disk up to 512M 
   in size, the use of multiple windows for file/volume editing as well as 
   directory windows to allow you to perform common file tasks such as 
   renaming, deleting, locking, unlocking, attribute setting and informational 
   display."

MacSnoop (like the commercial programs MacZap Tools, Symantec Tools, FEDIT, and
Copy II's MacTools) lets you view/edit any block of a file or disk volume in 
hex or ASCII. These programs differ in user interface and features.

The included MacWrite-format user manual (dated 17 July 1988) includes a two 
page listing of bug fixes and incremental improvements through v1.3.1.

Version "1.4.4 Demo" doesn't explain what's changed or what improvements might 
be found in a non-demo version, but this is fully functional, NOT crippleware.

MacSnoop should work with Mac 512KE, Plus, SE, and II, but may have problems 
with pre-512KE machines with 64K ROMs. Multifinder compatible.

Subject: InvisiHDMainBo3b

Writing to you from SUNY Albany.  We believe that InvisiHDMainBo3b is where a 
virus is lodging and causing all kinds of problems.  We have it here at the 
University and are having a very difficult timing eradicating it.  It acts like
the SCORES virus, but not as quickly.  Eventually it eroded our systems 
resources making it very difficult to even erase the hard disk. The reason we 
think the virus is lodging in InvisiHDMainBo3b is Apple's Vaccine program 
identifies it as a questionable INIT file, but tells us to relax.  In the 
meantime, the system, finder, printing resources, etc. are being modified every
time we turn on the machine, plus other times in no kind of pattern.

We though we had eradicated the virus in August to find that while bringing 
back files one at a time from our back-ups and checking each one, it was 
reintroduced again.  When you are a true Mac User (not programmer) everything 
you find about viruses is in programmese; even the instructions on how to get 
rid of the virus.  Any tips (in English) would be appreciated.  We contacted 
the local Mac User group with no real solutions.  There are several macs on 
campus infected, and the university doesn't support mac so there is no help 
there.

Thanks again.  Laurie Webster-Saft, The University at Albany,

                           LW901 at ALBNYVM1

[Moderator's Note:

InvisiHDMainBo3b is an invisible data file from HDBackup!  This is the worst 
part about viruses, they spread fear and paranoia!  You have no virus, you are 
merely backing up your hard disks. --Jon]

Some of the Mac archives that I've logged on to have things divided into 
several different directories rather than all being in the same directory. 
Instead of naming everything "INIT..." and "GAME..." and "HC..." and ... 
couldn't you create directories called "INIT", "GAME", "HC", etc.?  It would 
make it much easier to find stuff, as well as to get lists of what is there 
without burning up as much time on my end or on yours.  Please let me know if 
you plan to do this or why you can't if you don't.

Subject: Backup of A/UX systems

We have recently purchased a MacII with A/UX (internal). The MacII runs off an 
ethernet populated with Suns. I have backed up the whole A/UX to a tape using 
one of the sun tapestations (using NFS).

The problem/question is: What do I do if I get a disastrous diskcrash on A/UX 
(everything wiped out) - how do I get the system up again? Assume that I have 
SASH on a floppy, and (if it helps) also have the A/UX system on a bunch of 
floppies besides the tape.

I cannot find anything in the manuals - they assume that any restore operation 
already has A/UX running. And I would like to avoid buying a backup disk, it 
would be such a waste of money in our environment of file- and tapeservers.

Cheers.

Subject: Macintosh use on Campus

I would like to find out how other colleges and universities are using 
Macintosh computers on their campuses, for example, the english dept. uses them
to teach writing, or the fine arts dept. uses them to teach computer graphics, 
etc.  I'd be interested to know of any software which is especially popular on 
campus, especially which word processor for the Mac people prefer and why.  I'd
also like to know if and how the macs are networked together, and if and how 
they are linked to the campus mainframes. You can reply to me individually, and
I will summarize to the net if people are interested.  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Document Numbering on a Mac

   Our lab recently made the transition from a Wang VS-100 system to a system 
with Mac SE's and Mac II's tied together with LocalTalk and Kinetics boxes to 
our Ethernet backbone. Part of our staff does research and part is the 
administrative support for that research.

   One of the problems we have had in the transition lies in the area of 
keeping track of documents. In our old system the Wang assigned a document 
number to each new document. Since all the terminals were connected to the 
VS-100, we had no problems sharing documents.

   Now with a more decentralized system, and with 30 staff people generating 
documents on their individual machines, we want to find a way to assign a 
document number to each document generated on each of the Macs, so that the 
document number can be placed at the bottom of each printed copy of the 
document.

   Does anyone know of an easy way to generated document numbers? We have 
written a HyperCard shell to do it, but it is cumbersome and does not follow 
the standard Mac "look and feel" guidelines. I cannot believe that there is not
an easier way.

Subject: Ram Disks and MPW

We are dying a slow death running MPW. We know that Microsoft C on the PC can 
be run effectively with ram disks to increase performance and we have heard 
that the same can be done with MPW. So far we haven't had any luck. We have 
tried two programs, which we think are shareware or freeware: RamStart 1.32 and
RamDisk+ 1.4.  RamStart was on our Jasmine drive so it might be shareware, but 
RamDisk+ was on a BMUG disk so I assume it's freeware.

In any case, we haven't had any success using these programs with MPW. A while 
ago one guy tried RamDisk+ 1.4 and claimed that there was no performance 
improvement. Recently someone else here tried RamStart with System 6.01 (with 
and without multifinder) on a 5mb Mac II. However, when we double-clikc 
RamStart it crashes with "CanUt Mount the Ramdisk --- error -108."

So here's my questions:

Have you used a ram disk to increase MPW performance successfully? Which Ram 
Disk do you recommend? And how do you use it? If it's not one I have, where do 
you get it? Is it shareware, commercial ware, etc.? And what system is it 
working on?

Has anyone gotten RamStart to work with system 6.0 or 6.01? Is there any

documentation -- we don't seem to have any?

Any other suggestions?

thanks,

I'm trying to find a source for a large (> 500 MB) SCSI disk with drivers for a
Mac.  Our project will be collecting large amounts of data, and also will be 
researching "electronic book" issues.  If we ever decide to cut a CD-ROM, I 
understand that we can send such a large disk to 3M and they will master it 
onto a CD for us.

Any information on suppliers, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I have info on
CMS Enhancements disks, but their drives are broken up into 300 MB physical 
drives, and I want a single volume (I am not willing to rewrite a SCSI driver 
to act that way, either).  I am also familiar with the WORM drive that Corel 
sells, but would be interested in any comparable optical drive.

PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE WITH IP ADDRESSING, SUBNETTING MACS to SUN WORKSTATIONS:

We are completing installation and configuration of a campus-wide Ethernet LAN.
 We have 250+ macintoshes distributed around campus, which are connected via 
Kinetics Fastpath 4 gateways, and which can make use of AlisaShare and Alisa 
Print System software on a VAX 8810 (vms 4.7). We also have a network of 9 Sun

their ThinWire Ethernet cable to a DEMPR (ThinWire Repeater) and then to a 
DEBET (Thick wire Bridge), with the net (pun?) result of including their 
ethernet into the main campus LAN. We would like to use a Mac TCP/IP (NCSA 
Telnet or MacIP) so that the Macs can be used to log in to the Sun workstations
(or any other TCP host on our LAN).  Unfortunately, we must have the Macs and 
the Suns on different logical IP Subnets.

Subject: Wanted, dead or alive: Experience with Lang. Sys. Fortran

Is there anyone using Language Systems (MPW) Fortran?  For scientific number 
crunching, I've tried and nearly given up on Absoft's MacFortran/ 020. LSF 
[that's Language Systems, not LightSpeed :-(] is surely superior to Absoft, but
how good is it really?  I would like to know anyone's experience (good and bad)
with it.  Questions of interest include: 1. Speed (compile and execution time).
 The first version was reportedly slow, but they now advertise version 1.1.  
Has speed improved? 2. What else has changed? 3. Does it really support most 
VAX extensions?  How easy would it be to download a working VAX fortran file 
and run it? 4. How does it support namelist, for example? 5. What kind of 
support for 68020 and 68881 code does it have? 6. What does it do about the 
famous 32k segment limit?  They advertise support for large arrays, but what 
does that really mean? 7. What about code segmentation?  Does the user have to 
segment his program into < 32k segments in the normal Mac way?  At least Absoft
got around that by using > 16 bit offsets, but what about the MPW environment? 
Does the MPW linker require < 32k segments? 8. How easy is it to use really?  I
assume that since it is MPW, it is "Mac-like" in the redefined sense of MPW.  
But how does one choose among various compile time options, for example? 9. 
What kind of debugging support is there?  Are they waiting on SADE with MPW 
3.0? 10. For extra money, one is suppose to get a year's worth of upgrades. 
Does anyone know what is supposed to be added in the coming year(s). 11. How 
easy is it to call C routines? 12. How about Mac toolbox access? 13. And, most 
importantly, DOES IT GENERATE CORRECT CODE? 14. anything else of interest

I have also seen the Absoft ads offering an improved/faster Fortran for the MPW
environment sometime soon.  Does anyone have any knowledge at all about that?  
Could it be any better than the "normal" MacFortran?

Why does it seem that there are faster (i.e., better optimized, I guess) 
Fortrans for other 68020 machines (Suns, for example) than for the Mac II? 
Since the CPU hardware (68020 + 68881) is the same, is there some other 
fundamental hardware difference (bus or memory speed, perhaps) that makes the 
difference?  Or is the Mac OS slwoing things down somehow?  Or is it just that 
there has never been a lot of demand for good Fortran on the Mac so no one has 
ever produced or ported a good compiler.  Except Absoft, of course, and that 
hasn't worked out too well.

Thanks.  I will summarize to the net if I get individual replies.

Subject:  Re: overhead projectors

This note is a response to discussion in May issues of Info-Mac.  Those issues 
were not distributed over Bitnet until this week, hence the apparent delay. 
Down to the point.  I have recently checked the market for devices allowing to 
project Macintosh screen using overhead projectors.  I came up with a list of 
several companies selling such attachments.  Here they are

   product name      company                 phone

   QA-50             Sharp Electronics       800/be-sharp

   DataShow HR       Eastman Kodak           716/724-3169

   Mac-Screen Overhead  Ask LCD              404/399-5208

   FlatTop           Network Specialties     212/995-2224

   PC Viewer         In Focus Systems        503/692-4968

   Macnifier         Comtrex Limited         714/855-6600

They are not listed in any particular order.  I believe that Macnifier is 
marketed the longest of them all.  A few of them (like DataShow) will work with
Mac SE only.  Others require a different board to purchased depending on the 
Macintosh model.  All of them have list prices of the order of $1600 plus/minus
a 100 or so.  Some include video board, others require you to purchase them 
separately (ca. $200).  They also differ on optional stuff. I have seen only 
DataShow in real time.  It appeared to work just fine, although a good (bright)
overhead projector is required for large magnification.  It also seemed to 
follow changes on the screen quite well. The latter was the major complaint in 
the review published a few months ago in MacWorld (or MacUser) covering 2 or 3 
of those LCD devices.  I would like to learn about performance of any of these 
devices.

Reply-to: "Charles E. Bouldin" <bouldin@sed.ceee.nbs.gov>

I just got Draw II. It has several notable flaws, or at least some features 
that I need and can't seem to find. First, you cannot draw a circle, or a 
rectangle with dashed lines or a variable pen pattern for the line. This worked
in the old Draw 1.9.5 and is essential.

Also, the zoom in/out tools are very nice, but there is no command key

equivalent for these things.

Am I missing something here? For what it's worth, NO I am not running the 
newest, buggiest system 6.0 (or whatever the number is now) that was just 
released. Does this matter?

[Moderator's Note:

Use the option key on a pattern to get the pen to use it.

Does that qualify as standard?

For other minor thrills, I dare you to get text to Flip Horizontal. They added 
a lot of good stuff, but they forgot some of the basics. The fellow I spoke to 
at MacWorld said that they were addressing these and the PICT2 issue too. --

Subject: MacDraw II question & comments

We just received our copy of MacDraw II the other day and

I'd like to pass on some comments and questions.

This is a good package.  It should take care of most of the design needs that I
have.  It's very much like old MacDraw in operation, so it doesn't take long to
learn.  Some of the features that make this package good are the zooming, the 
layering, and the ability to rotate objects at arbitrary angles.  Also very 
useful are the ability to save various rulers, line styles, and views.  There 
are many other features that make this a great improvement over MacDraw.

There are, however, a few things that could be improved. Color support is only 
the old 8 color, fixed palette, with mixing in patterns used to provide other 
colors.  MacDraw II should support full color.

The ability to draw objects from a center rather than a corner is good, 
especially for circles.  When drawing an arc from the center, the center is 
apparently the centroid of the shape, rather than the center of the circle of 
which the arc is a part.  When I draw an arc from the center, I want to pin 
down the position of the center of the circle.

Dashed lines only work for lines.  You can't make a dashed

circle or polygon.

Pattern fill works as it did on old MacDraw.  A paint-bucket type of fill would
be useful for shading areas bounded by arcs, etc.  Maybe a polygon maker could 
do this:  click in a white area and the program would look for the edges of the
innermost enclosed area, and create a polygon from those edges.  Also, it would
be nice to take two open polygons and connect them into one.  Splitting a 
polygon is easy, just duplicate it and delete the undesired vertices.

More arbitrary alignment features would be good.  For instance, align selected 
points on objects (ie vertices on a polygon)

MacDraw II has plotter support with the MacPlot driver.  I haven't been able to
try it.  Even though we have some plotters, none of them are available to hook 
up, and the driver seems unable to write to a file.  Maybe someone's written a 
cdev or whatever that will reroute the output to a serial port to a file.  
There are problems with switching back and forth between the Laserwriter driver
and the plotter driver.  Quitting the program generally clears them up.

One major problem that I see is the inability to save in a published format 
that retains all of the information in the document.  Saving to the clipboard 
illustrates this problem. Make a color drawing, cut it, paste it into another 
program, copy it out and paste it back into MacDraw II, and the color is lost. 
Even Pict format has 8 color built in.  The rest of the information should at 
least be implemented into PICT comments.

I realize that some of my wants would be provided by a CAD

program, and this program is only $300.

All-in-all, MacDraw II is a good program, and it seems so

far to be bug-free, although I haven't tested it

thouroughly.  Any help with writing plotter info to a file so I can carry it to
a plotter we have would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Mapping software desired...

My home town has recently formed an environmental commission.  One of our key 
missions is to map the environmentally sensitive areas -- that is, areas easily
subject to damage, of unusual quality, or particular historical, recreational 
or scenic beauty.  The information will be used to help protect these areas 
before they become lost forever.

At present, we have many maps with features hand drawn, but the manipulation 
and comparison of the maps becomes very cumbersome.  I know that commercial 
mapping systems exist, but the one's I've seen are very very expensive -- well 
out of the budget for most rural communities.

I'd like to locate some Mac software to facilitate our work.

Most of the maps are on standard topographic scale (7.5' quadrangle) and I have
easy access to scanners that can load the maps into the MAC.

I'd like software that can start with a background figure (basic map) and then 
overlay various features (e.g. geology, land use, wetlands...). Most 
importantly, it would support the capacity to zoom in or out in order to 
examine the details in a map region.  Since a 7.5 min topographic map or town 
is about 3 ft. square, the ability to zoom out is essential to avoid tunnel 
vision.

Does anyone have suggestions or leads for good software packages for the Mac 
(without getting into the multi kilo-$$ systems)?  We'd sure appreciate tools 
to "fight back" from some of the strange ideas proposed by developers.

thanks in advance.

Subject: software for theatre work?

Does anyone out there know of theatre software which runs on IBM-PC's, Apple 
][e's, Atari ST's, Mac's, or Amiga's?  (Sorry for the broad cross- posting, but
it seems there's no net news group specifically set up for things theatrical.)

A friend of mine does set design, and remarked that no program seems to have 
been written with a set designer in mind.  We got to talking about it, and 
decided that choreography could be also made easier with a computer (instead of
having the whole cast out on stage running up and down doing variations of a 
number).  It strikes me that both could be helped a little by a good drawing 
package which allowed the use of different perspectives and of animation, but I
imagine someone who does more theatre work would find a need for facilities I 
haven't thought of.

So, to sum up, does anyone out there know what's available for theatre work, 
particularly set design and choreography, but also lighting, or anything else 
you can think of.

Please send replies directly to me, as I don't subscribe to all of these

digests.

Subject: MPW's Print command

Recently, I had to write a printer driver to "Appletalk" data to a

print server we put together on our Vax.

Anyways, I seem to be having a bit of a problem with printing from MPW 
occasionally.  I'm not sure, but by the looks of things, MPW's Print command 
doesn't seem to be setting up the first and last page fields of the print job 
subrecord.  Instead, those fields seem to be randomly filled-in (presumably not
filled in).

What I assume it wants is for my driver to just print everything that it sends 
it, which is fair enough.  What I'm doing is "properly" trapping out invalid 
page numbers (page numbers out of range, first page greater than last page, 
etc.) and in those cases defaulting to print all the pages that are sent.  
However, if MPW "sends" me some page combination like 85-113, I have no way of 
knowing that these numbers are wrong, so I print those pages, which usually 
means printing nothing at all, since most documents are a lot shorter than 85 
pages to begin with!

I guess the basic question is, what am I doing wrong, if anything? Is there 
some way to tell that an application is just asking for you to print 
everything?  I haven't found any documentation to that effect, which of course 
doesn't say much.

Any help would definitely be appreciated.  Please send responses to myself 
directly, as I'm not part of the list distribution.  I will summarize any 
findings to the list afterwards.

(While I'm posting anyways, does anyone have any comments on the public domain 
Modula-2 compiler "packaged" as MOD1.HQX-MOD13.HQX?)

Thanks in advance.

Subject: In-use light for 800K drives

Ever since I got my MacII, I've wanted to attach an in-use LED to each of my 
800K floppies.  There are times when certain programs use more than one floppy 
(ignoring the hard disk), and I'd really like to know what is going on.  This 
is particularly important for me since I frequently use II in a Mac, the Apple 
II emulator, which will let one or both floppies operate like Apple II 
Unidisks.

For some reason, Apple does not like including in-use lights on their floppy 
disk drives for the Macintosh. The purpose of these indicators on other 
machines is to let you know the disk is being used and shouldn't be removed 
until the light goes out.  But it's still pretty important to know when it's in
use on the Mac.

Apple DOES include an in-use LED on their 800K "Apple 3.5 drive", but that's 
only because the drive is used on both Apple IIGS and Macintosh. And 
unfortunately, you can't connect an external floppy to the MacII. I managed to 
get a "peek" inside the Apple 3.5 external drive at a local dealer. In addition
to the standard Sony drive/controller combination used on all Apple 800K 
mechanisms, the external drive has a "piggy back" board which attaches between 
the drive controller and the external cable. This board (which has a SONY part 
#) provides a connection for a drive LED, a connection for an intelligent 
manual eject button, and a "pass-through" port for chaining additional drives 
(on the Apple II).  Looking up this part in Apple service literature puts its 
price at ~ $65.00!

I've done a little probing with my DVM, but am unwilling to connect an LED 
without prior knowledge.  A friend of mine tried attaching an LED to one of the
leads on the IR head sensor pair, and ended up blowing his drive (and spending 
over $300 to fix his damage).

So my question is, has anybody successfully attached an in-use light to their 
800K drive?  I know there were a set of drawings for doing this on the 400K 
drives, but the boards for the 800K drives are different.  I have the LED's 
(small rectangular Telefunken brand), but am not willing to play around finding
a connection.  What I'd like is a set of detaild instructions (including 
current-matching or other warnings) of where to connect the LED, what other 
devices (resistor values, caps, transistors?) to attach between the board and 
the indicator.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: MacII audio port

When Apple introduced the Macintosh II, I was under the distinct impression 
from Apple's own engineers that the sound capabilities of the MacII were 
significantly better than the MacPlus and SE.  For one, the MacII allows 
sampling rates of up to 44KHz, as opposed to 22KHz on the Plus/SE. This allows 
for accurate reproduction of sampled frequencies as high as 22KHz. But this 
would be expected for a higher-speed processor such as the 68020. 
(Unfortunately, the standard serial ports aren't capable of transferring the 
data from sounds sampled at greater than 22KHz).

The MacII also includes a specialized sound chip, and a line-level audio port. 
I had heard that Apple includes a set of Sony pre-amps on the motherboard, and 
that the audio port is a mini-stereo jack of the type used in stereo walkmans.

However, the Apple Interface Guide for service engineers shows the pinouts for 
the MacII. This guide lists the MacII audio port as a MONORAL mini phone jack 
of the type used on the SE, Plus, and earlier Macs.

So I have two questions:

1) Is the MacII audio port a mini-stereo or standard monoral phone jack?

   If it is monoral, how do you have to buy a special card to get stereo sound?

2) With the advent of System 6.0 (forget about the sound bugs), and the Inside

   Mac Vol.5 Sound Manager implemented in RAM on the Plus and SE, what 
   advantage does the Apple custom digital sound chip in the II offer?  I 
   haven't seen any MacII-specific music software, or am I missing something?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Mac II ROM Query

I have a Mac+ with a Novy Systems 68020 accelerator board. One option in the 
support software is "copy ROM into high-speed 32 bit RAM". I use that option 
routinely and it makes a very large performance difference. Which leads to the 
questions about the Mac II ROM: 1. Is it 32 bits wide? 2. Is it accessed at 
full processor speed?

I would *guess* that the answer to those questions is yes, but Apple has cut so
many corners in the past that I am not sure. Anyone know ? If the answer to 
either question is NO, then copying the ROM into RAM may speed up the Mac II.

Subject: MacApp versus LSP 2.0 Comments

I spoke with the developers of LightSpeed Pascal 2.0 at MacWorld and then took 
Dave Wilson's MacApp class wherein we spoke a bit about LSP versus MacApp. 
Here's the situation as I understand it.

LSP cannot handle either the conditional compilation directives or the 
segmentation directives of MPW Pascal (TML Pascal II can).  The LSP people said
that they were hacking/getting a version of MacApp that would be specially 
treated for LSP.  Dave Wilson said he thought that might fly but that Kurt 
Schmucker apparently lambasted the LSP people saying that no one wanted to buy 
another version of MacApp, which is quite true.  I've paid enough for all the 
various versions of MacApp that I haven't used. :-)

Apparently the segmentation problem is the more massive one as LSP places an 
entire unit into a segment while MPW Pascal and MacApp can and do place any 
routine into any segment.  For example, all the methods of an object are 
defined in the same unit, but the debugging routines all go into the debugging 
segment, printing routines into the printing segment, etc.

Only time will tell...

Subject: PowerEdit DA LaserWriter Problem

I have been using the  PowerEdit DA, a simple but powerful text editor, to edit
long files.  (PowerEdit can handle files >32K).  The text appears on the screen
as Monaco (I think). When I try to print it on our LaserWriters, it comes out 
as Chicago, whether I leave "font substitution" checked or unchecked; except 
once it printed out as Geneva (Helevetica if font sub on.)

I am puzzled as to what's happening; I would like it to  print in a monospaced 
font like Monaco or Courier so that numbers in tables line up properly.  Can 
anyone suggest why it isn't attempting to use the screen font to print?  Is 
there any simple modification I can make to the program/system to make it print
in one of the monospaced fonts?  (I tried installing Monaco into the DA but 
that made no difference.)

I am using System 4.2 and LaserWriter/Laser Prep 5.1.

Thanks very much in advance,
