P035/C06 has been installed in NEWMON.  Please use NEWMON the next time

deposit nonzero in 30 and save the crash dump instead of resetting the base.
The changes to P035/C06 are to attack the "slot out of ports" problem.

The next time the system goes down with a UIL stopcode, please mention in
the crash mail which tape drives had tapes mounted on them.  To help us
track down this bug, we also need to know which tape programs (TITO,MAGCON)
were running at the time of the crash.

NEWMON.SAV has been patched to F26-P035/D-1 to fix the PCBFL1 stopcodes.
That stopcode was caused when any program that peeks at the monitor (such
as ICP, TAKEIT, and CTYLOG) tried to run on a system with 4 meg and 2
real strings of 3652 disks.  The bug is at least 8 years old but hasn't
shown up until now.  		/Joe Smith

   IT IS POSSIBLE TO REBUILD THE SYSTEM IF NECESSARY, PROBABLY,
   HOWEVER, WITH SO MANY DATA WRITE ERRORS DUE TO TAPE DRIVES,
   I WOULDN'T COUNT ON THIS BEING A GOOD DUMP.  REASON FOR
   SYSTEM ANSWERING LATE WAS DUE TO TAPES AND DRIVES.  THE
   SET OF TAPES USED WERE NEW (3/26) BUT EVEN WHEN I CYCLED IN NEW
   TAPES TO REPLACE THOSE, WE CONTINUED TO GET DATA WRITE ERRORS
   ON THE TAPEDRIVE.  WE ONLY HAD THE ONE TAPE DRIVE SO WERE FORCED
   TO USE IT, EVEN WITH DATA WRITE ERRORS

Subject: "To find out the reason of File""... 

To find out the reason of "Disk File" related crashes on systems
running with 3650/3652 disks in BLOCKS, F26 is running with a
diagnostic patch which makes "any correctable disk error" to a HDEV
error.

When a HDEV error accours on a file, it is marked HRE by the monitor.
The file is really "not bad" and copying the file to itself will clear
the HRE bit and the file is OK.

Don't be alarmed by the hard errors which the system picks up
any time it gets a read error.  If the system crashes just do
the normal things to bring the system up.

The diagnostic patch will be removed as soon as we have determined the
best way to handle read errors on 3650/3652 blocks systems.

Please note: The problem with handling read errors on 3650/3652 disks does
not occur if the disks are formated in pages.  It may be worth considering
the idea of converting the blocks systems to pages.  F74 has not been
having problems.
