Please investigate what happenned to the directory (UPL) on system D31.

It seems that all files from this directory were deleted sometime in the
recent past.  Please check the latest couple of ALL-FILEs sets to find
the latest date that all of the files seem to be intact.

Please contact Julian Min at the Fremont Data Center once this information
has been located.  Julian will co-ordinate what files should be restored.
However, I expect that the entire directory needs to be restored.


This is the reason that (UPL)FTX22 has been broken on this system.  Just
copying FTX22#.SHR from another system was insuffiecient to run FTX22
because all of the support programs where missing.
