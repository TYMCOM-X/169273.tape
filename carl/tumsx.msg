I took the liberty of editing your MAIL.FWD on 930.  I added the
"!" in front of the name so you don't have to worry about forwarding
loops between 930 and 35.  For example, !JMS@C35 is the same as
JMS@C35 except that with the "!" it will suppress any further forwarding.
This ony works if the destination is a Tymcom-X.  -Bill

Bill,
  Do you know why I get "Access bared" when I try to build a circuit
from BUBBNET back into TYMNET?  It makes it a little difficult to do
anything on system 39.

  If I masque as WRS or something, it works fine...  if you could fix
the problem for me, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks /Carl

PS.  We've played muciscal hosts in preparation for the move.  X930 is
still the same host, but right now it keeps crashing.  It would be best
to try sending mail to X14 or X17 if 930 is down, or maybe best to D35
during the move.   I will update my local MAIL.FWD to go to 35.

Osman restored the 19-AUG 2020 all files to X32 with MODE OLD TAPE.
I restored the 19-AUG F3 all files to X32 with MODE OLD NEWEST.
I restored the 2 tapes from X14 (RP06-2020) with MODE OLD NEWEST to get NEW11.
I restored the 2 tapes from X930 with MODE OLD TAPE for CARL, XEXEC, SUBMIT.
The remainder of the 2nd tape (X930's incomplete incremental) was restored
with MODE OLD NEWEST.  At this point X32 should have the union of all files
from X930, X62, X95, and X118 - no files missing.

Subject: Host 14 is still on 940NET. 

When I tried to log into JMS:14, the Supervisor told me the host was down
before I had entered my password.  Using JMS:17 requires a password go get
the host down message.  It appears that transparent login to 940NET is still
in effect.

The following hosts are transparent: 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,20.
The following hosts are normal: 3,7,10,15,17,18,19,21.

Someone needs to tell the Supervisors that hosts 14 and 16 are normal hosts,
not transparent.   /Joe

Subject: How to patch the CPU serial number into a monitor SAV file. 

There are three consecutive locations, starting at .CPLOG which describe
the CPU ID.  To look at them, use .CPLOG$6T/=<lf>=<lf>.
  .CPLOG has 2 or 3 letter hardware designation in LH, node number in RH.
  .CPCPU has 'KI', 'KL', etc in LH, APRID number (in decimal) in RH.
  .CPSNO has system number (such as 'F22') in sixbit.
The sixbit quantities can be left or right justified.  I changed 33035C.SAV to
22035C.SAV by using:
  .CPLOG/ $"/XXX/,,3374
  .CPCPU/ $"/KL/,,1421.
  .CPSNO/ $"/F22/
When the new KL is installed, the right half of .CPCPU must be changed.  /Joe

Guys,

  I thought we would have X32 for a longer time than it looks like we're
getting.  All day today I've seen a message from Operations telling me that
"Host D32 is no longer timesharing.  Please see your representative.  ..."
Does this mean that any files I had on X32 are now gone, and can only be
recovered by a restore from tape?

Thx!

OOps... we must have overlooked you.. I thought you had heard yesterday
from Joe or Osman...

System 32 went away on Monday at 6pm so that they could swap the KL we
had for X32 in place of the KKI on system 22.  Rather than give us the
KI immediately, since they are moving the KL from BUBB-C to Fremont, we
will get the KL from BUBB-C sometime late Wednesday (if all goes well).

So.. for a KL instead of a KI, no one made any noise... more at the meeting
or from Osman.

I left at 8:40pm after cabling up nodes 6760, 6657, 2346, part of 10115 and
554A.  I tried to load 6760 but it didn't look like it worked... probably
need to check the DR11-C cables to make sure they are connected properly.

I ran KMCLOD so that I could reload the system and got PLEASE LOG IN and
no response on the CTY.  I pushed BOOT and oops... no boot on this pack, so
we are down waiting to be booted from tape.

When I come in, we can check the connections and try it all again.. if anyone
hears from Tracy... let me know what happens or what has happenned.

Thanks... G'night

We received a call to look at a crash on cpu#1300 and called the FE and
the FE's beeper and received no response.  I logged into OSTC.DEC1 but
it is homed to KL#1195 at the moment and both 5243&5244 report host down.

I called the computer center, @Roe West's # 314-232-7151 and no one was
working on the machine... so, if they need our help... we just have to
wat for them to call us back.

Subject: NAD %1.07 

I've looked at the code for NAD and it appears that listings are currently
available to anyone running (SOURCE)NAD or anyone having TYMSHARE license.

Actually if the FPN of NAD matches the PPN of the input file, (or TP license)
then a listing can be generated.  What this means is that the current scheme
will allow anyone running NAD to get listings of any file in SOURCE since the
only version of NAD that is really NAD will be in SOURCE.  Files in BETATEST
are not listable unless you have TP license.

I know where to make the changes... as soon as Dennis Ernst confirms which
source file is the correct file then I will make the changes we discussed.

I feel the following "other" changes should be made...
  1)  Listings can only be generated if you have TP license (or)
      if the input file is in your own directory (or)
      if the input file is in your own GAN [since these are unreadable if
                                            the file is protected, so all ok]
  2)  As per (1) don't care what FPN NAD is run from -- remove check.

...otherwise having everyone run (SOURCE)NAD will allow everyone to get
listings whether or not they have TP license.

To Dennis:  Any reason why your current changes cannot released to the
            entire world?  Or should I change (NAD)NAD01.R05 as well as
            your version [NAD01.R06 or NAD01.R07?]

To Wayne:  Please pass this on to Doug so he knows about the listing 'twist'.

Dennis you have:
   NAD01.BAK  & NAD02.BAK   which appear to be previous versions of
   NAD01.R06  & NAD01.R07   respectively... the difference between each
                            set (*.BAK and .R06/.R07) is the same.

   NAD01.R06 has a newer creation date than .R07 and the major difference is
the treatment of underline "_" between .R06 and .R07.  Which version should
I change?

Subject: NAD 

Dennis,
  I've made the changes that I mentioned to you the other day to a copy of
your file (DERNST)NAD01.R06 which resides in (CARL)NAD01.R06.

The changes are as follows:

 1)  Listing control is dependent soley on TP in .GTPRV for the user.
 2)  Input files in (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) may be read by anyone that
     can run NAD.  Listings or symbols in NIB files still require TP.
 3)  Command files may be read from directory (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) by
     anyone that can run NAD.

When the program is released to (SOURCE) it should have RF license and
be protected ALL RUN RUN.  It is NOT to be put on (SYS).

Bill Soley will replace the NAD on sys with a program which verifies who
the user is by GAN and/or USERNAME and run (SOURCE)NAD for that user who
is allowed to run NAD.   (If he hasn't done it already).

I didn't know whether to rename the file to NAD01.R07 or to change the
name in the source from .R06 or not.  I need someone to test the changes
more thoroughly.  (CARL)NAD###.DIF shows the differences between your
file .R06 and my file .R06 on system 39.

Thanks.

/Carl

                            -------------------

	Any system running with the P035/C monitor if enabled will
report the AR/ARX parity error.  This would give FSCO personnel more
precise information where in the hardware the error happened.

	AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled by KLDCP.  While
in KLDCP type "PE 36<cr>" to enable it and "PE 16<cr>" to disable it.
Once the AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled on the KL10 you must
bring the system up with P035/C monitor or later.

Subject: (MAIL)930.Q 

At least temporarily... you need to have the router forward mail for
system 930 to system 35.  most of the messages in this file on 39 were
probably sent from mailing lists..?..  anyway,   XXX@X930 won't get
delivered until 1) 930 comes back up, and 2) we get a tymnet line to
our micronet so that we can get to 930 from Tymnet.

can you do anything about it... (other than edit the .Q file changing all
the X930's to F35 and renaming it 35.Q ???)

Is this an existing capability of ROUTER.DAT?

Can you tell me the name of the bimbo on F70 that was running a perp job
every 4 seconds and never reading his mail?

Have you implemented the "do not retrun this message" feature when users
do not read their mail?  ...or was it "discard after 30 days" ..or "n days"?
(the second is excellent for messages which are "timely").

I made the changes to NAD, but I don't know what Dennis Ernst needs to do
to release his version (prior to my changes) as far as testing.  My new
version is on (CARL:39)NAD.SAV and is in need of testing.  It currently
has RF license for reading files in SOURCE and BETATEST and is protected
ALL RUN RUN.

If I change ROUTER.DAT, the mail will be sent to 35, but 35 needs to have
something to do with it.  It'll spend alot of ime sitting there trying to
deliver it to the real 930 or worse yet, to itself.  I'll work on it.  For
now I'll just send it to 35.  -Bill

I'm sorry, I have no idea how frequently he was running the PERP job.
I've since forgotten the name.  The discard feature is probably not in
the immediate future.  *SIGH*  -Bill

I just got about 2500 pages (disk) of mail from system 70 that was

systems 29, 55 and 70 didn't have a mail.fwd in (perpoper) so I created
an empty one.  This will send all the mail to the bit bucket rather
than me.  I noticed on the other systems, you had it going to a file,
but I wasn't sure that was a good idea given the huge volume of stuff
that seems to be happening.  Anyway, change it if you want, just PLEASE
make sure it goes somewhere other than to me.  Wasn't sure you knew
about the empty mail.fwd feature.  -Bill

As of 9/15, MUX hosts 2096 and 1274 have moved from Engines in Orchard Parkway
to Microengines in South Bay Center.  If you have nodes 2366 or 2367 in your
SWITCH.INI, they should be changed to 3170 and 3345 respectively.  I noticed
the change because host 2096 was having problems.  It was "2*OV" and "****"
meaning the link to its only neighbor was overloaded both directions and
had a high line error rate.  1274 was better.   /Joe

The first UFD data page for (SYS:26) was on BPA3 page 10010.  That was one
of the pages that PAKCOP could not read, and had pointers to LOGINN and RPG.
DSKCLN aborted with "Error in RIB - wrong hash code" and "Critical file
damaged".  Page 0 was indeed garbage, and the 2nd page for that hash code
was 10.  After zeroing the offending paged and putting 10 in the link at 777,
the UFD was readable.  Having REFLAG, I restored all of SYS until TITO asked
to overwrite a file.  Typing control-C at that point caused TITO to report
that 102 files were processed, exactly one page worth.  F26 is running a
full DSKCLN at this moment.  /Joe

Subject: 98% dialup connection 

I sent mail on X14 describing the events, but you won't see them until you
get to the office.  I returned to the office around 7:30 and generated new
code at Nicholson, reloaded 2346, went to SBC to install the new boards,
went back to Nicholson to get a 2nd DUV11 for 2770, back to SBC to install
it, back to Nicholson to load 2770, back to SBC to check the DZV11 and the
node itself, re-pinned 4 male connectors as cross-overs at the DZV11 panel
and connected the modem with a straight male connector.

The modem line works... however, the code is generated with the DZV11 lines
as Hard-Wired and I need to change the configuration to Dial-Up and reload
2770.  I will try to do that on my way to the office tomorrow (today).  I
will check to see who is on before I yank out the plug on 2770, besides I
will need someone to push the HALT/ENABLE and INIT buttons to put it into
it's bootstrap to load.  (I don't remember how to do it remotely).

I am logged in on the modem, and even though I hung up, the modem will not
because the line isn't a dial-up... this should be fixed when I reload it.
Possibly if I logged out first, the modem would drop the circuit... but that
isn't the case.  I just hung up.

Guys,

    The connection to Tymnet on floor 3 of this building is O.K.!  I've talked
with Dick Kovachs about connecting to Tymnet through his engine.  No problem
-- except that Dick reminded me that we will have to run cable from his
printer room to his phone closet, and from our phone closet to our lab.  He
was concerned about the appearance of the cables.  We might be able to run
them up the (inside of the) walls and through the ceiling, since both ends of
the cable are in rooms with real walls, and I've looked at the ceiling:  it's
typical suspended ceiling.  We could pull cable just like Carl and I did at
Nicholson Way.

    We could be in Tymnet just as soon as the cable is pulled and connected,
and the code is cut!

Overview:

Security is a major concern in all areas of the Network.  From
restricting access to the Network to restricting the range of
capabilities a user has once a successful connection is made to a
host, security is a concern.  This proposal seeks to address one part
of the security picture.

Today, all users on the PDP Code Genning Systems have the capability to
| access the NAD program in the (SYS) directory.  This program has read
| file license (RF) assigned to it.  With RF license, any user has the
| capability of accessing any file on the PDP through the NAD program.

| What this proposal seeks to control is really two fold.  First, it will
| restrict which users are allowed to use the NAD program.  This will
| restrict users without RF license from accessing files on the PDP they
| should not access.  Secondly, users who are allowed to access the NAD
| program and gen code but should not create code listing will be
| restricted from performing the listing function.

[Thirdly, those who do have access to NAD will only be able to assemble
files from (SOURCE), (BETATEST) or directories that they normally have
access to without license.]

Goals and Compromises:

The ultimate goal for the implementation of restricted access was to
disallow access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories from all
users except those that require access.  Those requiring access include
all field and Headquarters support people; Project Implementation; the
Field Service Organization; Customers who, by contract, are allowed
access; the Headquarters Quality Assurance group; and the development
organization.  Groups that required access only to a limited set of
files in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories would then be
restricted on a file by file basis.  For example, Customer A has in
their contract a license to gen X.25, Node Code and ISIS.  They would be
allowed access to only the source for this code and be barred access to
the remaining source code files.

Unfortunately, barring access down to a per file per user basis is not
possible under current TYMCOM-X limitations.  This capability would
require modifications to the Operating System.  What is possible is to
restrict access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories as a whole
and restrict access to some of the capabilities of the NAD program. 
Thus, restricting access on a more limited basis is possible.

After the restructuring of the PDP systems, as will be documented,
restriction to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories will be on
a per user basis.  Certain users will be barred from being able to
create listings of the source code and will be able to only write files
into their own directories.  They will not be able to over-write files
| of any other users and will be restricted from accessing files that are
| protected and not in the (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) directories.



Restructuring with Restrictions:

There are [two] copies of the code genning program, NAD, on all PDP Code
Genning Systems.  One NAD is the aforementioned copy in the (SYS) directory.
| The second NAD is the copy in the (SOURCE) directory.  Both of these
| copies are identical.  They are both assigned Read File license.

There is also an important feature of NAD that is part of this
restructuring.  If a user lacks TYM license, NAD will not allow that
user to create listings of the source code.  Currently, most users that
gen code have TYM license.  They are able to both gen code and create
listings of the source code.

The changes proposed to create tighter controls on the capabilities of
users on the PDP Code Genning Systems are:

| 1.  Make modifications to the NAD program so the NAD program in the
|     (SYS) directory will only be a verification program for access
|     control.  The NAD program in (SYS) will verify the user attempting
|     to call the NAD program is validated on a GOODGUY list.  If valid,
|     the user will be routed to the real NAD program in the (SOURCE)
|     directory.  The (SYS)NAD program will be given ALL [RUN RUN]
|     restrictions.  (NOTE:  This is a common practice for programs on the
|     PDP's today.)
| 
| 2.  Place protections on NAD in the (SOURCE) directory so it can not be
|     called directly unless the user can override the restrictions with
|     their own license.  This [] will prevent users (such as customers)
|     without proper license from accessing the (SOURCE) NAD program
|     directly.
| 
| 3.  Modify the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory to set Read File
|     license selectively.  When running NAD, the NAD program will set
|     Read File license if it is attempting to read a file in the
|     (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) directories.  If it is instructed to read a
|     file in any other directory, it will not set Read File license.
|     This will require any file [not in SOURCE or BETATEST] that needs
|     to be read by NAD to have the
|     proper protection to allow it to be read by all users.  This
|     includes files such as patches in other directories or special
|     source files in other directories.  The purpose of this is to not
|     allow users to use the Read File license of NAD to access files they
|     should not have access to.
| 
| 4.  Each customer will be placed in their own GAN.  This will restrict
|     them from being able to look at files in any directory but ones in
|     their own GAN.

| 5.  Remove TYM license from users who should not be able to create
|     listings of the source code.
| 
| 6.  The (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories should have directory access
|     protection of  SHARABLE and LISTABLE only.  They currently have
|     SHARABLE, LISTABLE and NEW FILES. 



| When these changes are complete, users not on the NAD GOODGUY list and
| without proper license will not have access to the NAD program.  Without
| the TYM license, they would be unable to create listings of the source
code.  Without the additional licenses on the NAD program they would be
unable to over-write files not in their own directory.  With directory 
access set, users will be prevented from writing into the (SOURCE) and
(BETATEST) directories.

With the current protections placed on all (SOURCE) and (BETATEST)
source code, users without the proper license will not have access to
the files in these directories.  They would be restricted from even
viewing the source files.

| Without proper license, users will not be able to view other users files
| in directories under different GANs.


Concerns and Questions:

PEAK and VUE, the text editors on the PDP's, require modification if they
are to be used by users that do not have TYM license.

Who will be tracking the change of GANs for the customers?

Who will identify the customers requiring these changes?

| An access list will have to be maintained for the (SYS)NAD program.

Did you both decide on a meeting time?
  I've not done anything more since our last meeting with SETOP.  I have
however, completed NAD and PEAK.  PEAK is on (SYS) on all PDP_10 systems.
NAD has been "tested" and still resides in (CARL:39)NAD.SAV for more
intensive testing (if anyone feels it necessary, or if some QA procedure
exists for NAD before it is released... however, I doubt it).

  I've not heard back from Dennis Ernst about transmitting it.  I guess
I cando it, but I'd prefer someone in NTD since there are "procedures".

Let me know ... CARL@D35.Tymnet ... if we need to have a review meeting
at this point (soetime this week).

I checked out 33 and whatever it was is gone now.  You must have fixed it.
Its not clearwhat it was.  Some program was appearently running, opening
a file, and dieing without closing it (this is detected and the mail is
reprocessed by MAILER thus causing the REQ).  The idea being that when a
program dies without cleaning up, you can't tell if it has delivered the
mail it was working on, so to be safe, you deliver it again.  -Bill

Doug, I've moved my version of NAD to (WRS:33)SYSNAD.* but it should
be installed with the name NAD as follows.

The file (WRS)SYSNAD.SAV goes in (SYS)NAD.SAV with RF license and ALL RUN RUN.
The file (WRS)SYSNAD.LIS goes in (SOURCE)NAD.LIS with no special protection.

NAD.LIS is a demo.  It has comments in it (which you may want to remove
to prevent someone from being tempted to edit it).  Let me know if there
are any questions.  -Bill

I called Fremont to see if the test KL was down for a particular reason.
They said the CTY on F33 started smoking, so they borrowed the LA36 from X32.
I suppose they don't have any other current-loop LA36's available.  /Joe

Subject: F26 survived a base reload! 

F26's base was having problems (many jobs running LOGINN in TI state) and
it was reloaded.  Host 26 was not available thru net because the EBUS base
was waiting for the PDP10 to tell it what host number to use.  From KLDCP
I was able to deposit a host-to-base message in the ORING specifying the
host number and 127 ports.  When ORPPDP was poked, host 26 became visible.
OPER could log in, but others couldn't because the base thought the PDP10
was SHUT but F26 thought it had answered.  Setting SCHED 400000 and SCHED 0
cleared up that misconception.  I will add the code to send the right
messages to SCNSER; it may be worth adding a DDT patch to all P035/C when
it's ready.  /Joe

Joe,
  I called Osman on Saturday and he was still trying to juggle his schedule
to be available on Monday.  His daughter is not expected to be released from
the hospital until Tuesday sometime (if all goes well).

  I told him that we discussed doig the HARDWARE portion of the class without
him and if he couldn't make it, we would do it.  He was relieved, because it
would have been very difficult for him to make it to Fremont before Wednesday.
On Wednesday, he'll try to be there and cover anything we didn't cover in as
much detail as the class is interested.

  I will stop by the office today to pick up the KL handbook set and the three
volume KL handouts from Rhett's class, just so we will have them available.  I
will also bring the processor reference manual (unless you happen to already
have a copy at home, then you can bring it.  Let me know, so I can leave it at

 SUBJECT:  BETATEST File Protections
 
=========================================================================
 
Doug,
 
As I know that you are already immersed in the protection measures
for source code, I will adress this memo to you. 
 
The attempts to protect the source code on the BETATEST and SOURCE
directories have caused me problems out here in the field before.
Our private net customers have been allocated accounts on PDP-10s,
and are responsible for the generation and loading of their own
network codes.
 
The current plan was to protect the source code files, and only
give NAD the read file license to access these.  I would assume
that the release parameter files would remain accessible, as these
are necessary to the generation and maintenance of the code.
 
This created a problem with PASCAL files, as these files are
initially merged using COPY, not NAD, so someone with RF license
must be involved in the generation of these files.  This is a
hassle that I complained about before.
 
Now, it appears that there is no standard for the allocations
of protection to the BETATEST file, and some release and
parameter files can be accessed, and many cannot.  What, if
it exist, is the policy on the file protections assigned to
these files?  Is there any consideration in these security
policies for the extra time and effort required by field CC's
to transfer this information to the customers, who until now,
have been able to access it on-line?
 
Best regards,
 
 
Dan

Subject: Formatting X32's disks. 

I found 2 bugs in PAKCOP(PAKCP5).   
If the 1st string controller is off-line (BPA0-BPA7), then PAKCOP assumes
the entire 3674 controller is off-line (BPA0-17 & BPB0-17).  PAKCP5 didnot
want to look at the string of 3650 disks on BPA10-17 as a result of
the string of 3675 disk on BPA0-7 being switched off.

2nd problem: Although I tried to make PAKCOP do everything SA10NW does,
something is missing.  Those paacks have not been formatted using PAKCOP,
because PAKCOP dies on CYL 559 with "Equip Check".    They were formatted with
SA10NW with FMTM=0, wich does cylinders 0-554 only.  When I tried FMTM=1,
SA10NW aborted because cylinders 555-559 were not set up.  I am now using
FMTM=-1 to re-write HA and R0 - this takes 2 secons per cylinder, 19 minutes
per pack.  After SA10NW finished, thhen I reformat thhem in pages.
I plan do do all but BPA16 - I'll leave that one as a test case for the
next version of PAKCOP.			/Joe

Subject: Leased line troubles. 

Yesterday afternoon I went to Nicholson Way, to look at possible modem
problems.  Our Paradyne modem was powered down.  I turned the power back on
for it.  The indicator LEDs were lit for the 3 left-most indicators and the 1
right-most indicator.  The 4th from the left, which Joe tells me is carrier
detect, was not lit.

I returned to D-2.  The modem in the lab was indicating the same state.  I
tried to load 2770 from the public network, but it wouldn't take a load (it
"timed out", according to LOADII), which should indicate that it was already
loaded fine.

While at Nicholson Way, I neglected to look at the connection between the
Paradyne modem and the leased line.  If it was disconnected when the line was
being worked on Monday (which is highly possible, since they were there and
had powered the modem down) that could be a cause for the communication
failure.

Or (paranoid fantasy):  Tymnet is messing with us, because we have a
non-Tymnet line going into "their" "super site".  (Remember the fortune
cookie:  "Just because you're crazy doesn't mean they're not out to get you.")

The 9600 baud modem is in the rack by the F3's, but the leased line interface
is on the other side of the ramp, by the 2020's.  The modular plug at the
interface end was unplugged.  It was not obvious because the it was hidden
by the blue panel.  It has been moved to the back of that rack to be more
accessable - the link came up as soon as it was plugged in.

Host 17 was down to allow Osman to build another KLAD pack on the RP06,
host 14 was brought up but is not visible to the Supervisor due to 2770's
config file.  Until that's fixed, the only way to get to the 2020 that is
host 14 is by dialing (408)432-1735.  It is up now, on the 1-pack RM03.

Subject: "Listing the SUBMIT queue on F33"... 

Listing the SUBMIT queue on F33 takes too long.
Try "LIST (VWARKER) *" to SUBMIT and notice the long pause after the third
line.  Also notice 14039 in there twice with two different statuses.
Then ask SUBMIT for a full LIST and time it with a stopwatch.
It looks like XEXEC needs to do garbage collection on JQUEUE.SYS.
Also, try "FIND 14039 FAILURE (SUBMIT)87102#.JQL"  Verry strang.

Subject: Where the files went 

Before move:  All TXS files were spread out on 3 systems: X930, X62, X95.

Liberty St:  All of X930 and X62 files were combined onto one system.
  This system was called X118 and consisted of 3 RP06 packs.  It had
  everything that X930+X62 had, except for the directories Carl saved
  on the "ripoff" tape and directories (such as KS2020) which were
  kept on the 2 RM03 X95 system instead.

During move:  Everything was moved to X32 in Solar Way.  X32 used 4 3675
  packs, and had X118's RP06 save restored to it.  To make sure nothing got
  lost, the saves for X930, X62, and X95 were also restored.  Some of the
  ripped off directories came back as a result of this.

After move:  A one-pack RP06 system was build on X17 from the 1-tape save
  and Carl's 4-tape save and the microNET sources from B39.  A one-pack
  RM03 system was built on X14 from the 1-tape save only.

23-Oct-87:  A third RM03 was added to X95's 2-pack set and mounted on X14.
  All the files that Carl had on the 1-pack RP06 system are being restored
  to it.  X14 will have KS2020 and microNET related files.
  The 3-pack RP06 set has been formatted and is being restored to the way
  it was when it was in Liberty St.

Future:  Directories which exist on X17 and X14 need to be sorted out.
  Between the two of them, they have enough space to handle everything
  that is currently on X32.  A 1600bpi save of X32 can then be restored
  to the two 2020s.

Rick,
 
Here is my feelings on the TYMCOM-10 training class:
 
A) I feel that the information was well grouped. The instructors did not teach
   as if the students were all programmers, like in most cases.
   The presentation for the most part was well structured, the only obvious
   problem I felt was the fact that the people who were training did not get
   to prepare for the class, due to the personal problems of Osman & Joe.
   For example: The first day Osman was to teach and he had to attend to
   personal business which left Carl & Joe fairly unprepared to teach that day.
 
B) I feel that as far as time constraints that the training should have been
   on a more rigid schedule. Breaks on the hour for 10 minutes, lunches 1 hour,
   class starting and ending as scheduled.
   One week was fine for the duration.
 
C) I refreshed on a lot of items that I had forgotten, unfortunately I missed
   more than I wanted to, but I will be attending the next session.
 
D) All in all I feel that it was a valuable training session.

      a. How do you feel the seminar was presented?
COMMENT: Due to circumstances the order of the classes had to be changed,
         this did have an effect on the big picture goal of the class since
         it meant others had to be called upon before they were ready. The
         class was also prepared for those who had some experience, yet the
         participants were mainly made of inexperienced persons. These two
         things lessened the effect of the class, however, I thaught the
         classes were very informative.
 
      b. Do you feel the seminar should have been longer?
COMMENT: The seminar really couldn't have been any longer because of
         scheduling problems. I do think that we need to go into detail
         in some areas, in another seminar. A sequel of sorts.
 
      c. What did you get out of the seminar?
COMMENT: I picked up bits and pieces of information from all areas covered.
         I now feel more comfortable with the file structure, and monitor
         concepts inparticular.
 
      d. Include as other comments you feel are pertinent.
COMMENT: Next time we should match the information and class objective with
         the expected participants of the class. I was very satisfied with
         what Lynn and myself took from the class, but the new people will
         probably need to reattend the class once they've worked with the
         PDP10's for a while. Rick I commend you on your part in making
         these classes happen.

   Subj: DECsystem10 P035/C monitor with E-BUS uprev.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     As of today  10-30-1987 all of the Dallas  DECsystem10's are running
   with the  P035/C monitor and the  uprev E-BUS Tymnet board.  With this
   combination we have  seen a drop in NOBASE type  stopcode crashes that
   took the DEC system and the engine  down. With this added value to our
   system, we should see a much needed improvment of CPU reliability.
 
     The CTTY will report the following messages:
 
      %%EVENT stopcode NOBASE at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      No response from base. Please reload it. PDP-10 is still up.
 
     After the  base is reloaded  or reinit the  DEC system and  the base
   will resync and you will receive the following message twice:
 
      %% EVENT stopcode BASEOK at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      Code in base is version 2.00 - debug flag is OFF
 
     I wish we had this 5+ years ago.  In any case, this is much like how
   the TYMCOM-370 base/operating system works. If the DEC user has LOGOUT
   on DISCONN, no problem, the user is  logged off the system, but if the
   user has DETACH  on DISCONN this will  put him in a  detach state.  If
   and only IF  the user is smart  they will reattach to  the detach job.
   If the user does not, we will start getting a bunch of control C jobs.
   We can do several things to correct these massive control C's,
 
      1) Change all users to DETACH ON DISCCON with a 15 MINUTE TIMEOUT
      2) Re-educate the user on how and why to reattach.
      3) Keep everything the same and run the FREE program.
 
     I have talked with OSMAN and as of Monday we are going to submit the
   FREE to run  all the time in detach  and kill all the  control C jobs.
   This is just for short term until whom  ever can come up with a better
   solution.
 
     As we all know, this should not be  coded as a crash nor recorded in
   the MUR  database, but FSC  should be  notified for the  simple reason
   that  the base  may have  a  problem and  may  need to  correct it  on
   schedule time.
 
    Any futher questions or comments, please either call me or send me an
   ONTYME.
 
                                 Thank you,

There is a new version of NONAME which has a variety of things changed

Again... to aid in implementing Roy Roskilly request the monitor commands

anyone to set a limit between 1 and the system default limit.  However, to
set the limit to 0 or to a value greater than the system default, you MUST
be an account supervisor or (have OP, WC or JL license, since anyone with
these licenses can change their limits by mucking around).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Robert C. Grandey

SUBJ:  Delayed arrival Monday.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guys:

	There have been a few problems around here, that I must stay home
Monday morning to try to get fixed.  I will not be arriving until I have
gotten the minimum fixed, or at least started.  Item on my list:

	1.)  Repair the U-joint on my car which broke Saturday, so it can move
under its own power and thereby get me to work.  (Car is currently in my
driveway.  I am unable to find a replacement U-joint.  The car must be out of
the driveway Monday morning, to make room for the 40 cubic yard "dumpster"
which will be placed to receive the old roofing shake and other construction
material/debris which is scattered throughout the house and yard.)

	2.)  Hire someone to dig up my front lawn, to find and fix the place
in the main sewer line from the house which is broken and since Saturday will
not allow anything to flow.  (I miss clean clothes, a shower and a toilet.)

	3.)  Be here to meet the roofers Monday morning.

	4.)  Finish wiring the kitchen and installing the range hood vent
through the ceiling and roof, so the kitchen ceiling drywall can be finished
and the new roof can be installed with the vent included.

	Items 1, 2 & 3 will be taken care of Monday morning.  Item 4 is a
project for tonight.

As per our telephone conversation, we have no further need for node

Fremont (Liberty street site).  The node was disconnected from TYMNET
on August 28th, 1987.

I don't know if you need our cost code number.  If so,  the code for
Field Service Company - Product Support is 90842.  The old Tymshare
cost code for our group is 4011 (whichever one is on your books).

Thank you for your help.

Subject: Everything went OK on the first install of NAD 1.6 onto system 54 

SUBJ: Everything went OK on the first install of NAD 1.6 onto system 54

Bill,

Everything went OK on the first install of NAD 1.6 onto system 54
yesterday.  Of course the .LIS file contains only a * so no restrictions.
Wayne's group will handle that after we get the names.

But, there are 2 requests.  1.  Change the name of the NAD.LIS file
to something cryptic (Wayne to create name).  2. Allow NAD to set read file
for the (QSATS) directory.  This directory contains patches and just 
yesterday has become the OFFICIAL patch directory (new procedures).  So,
we would like NAD to read from Source, Betatest and QSATS directories.

Let me know if problems, we are not in a great hurry but the sooner...

Thanks Bill,
Doug

I thought that I sent you a phone reply, but maybe not...  Let me know
when you'd like to get together... I'm available for a late lunch on
Thursday, or anytime Tuesday.  Wednesday and Friday I'll be on vacation.

I'm scheduled for vacation Thursday & Friday for the next three weeks
(this week, I've swapped Wednesday for Thursday due to our monitor
meeting being moved to Thursday 10-12. So sometime after that, 12:30 or
1:00pm would be fine)

What kind of schedule do you have this week?

Subject: NAD %1.7 

Bill & Wayne,
  As per Doug's request, I have added directory (QSATS) to the list of valid
directories.  My previous version %1.6 is now (CARL:39)NAD1x6.SAV and the
new version %1.7 is now in (CARL:39)NAD.SAV.

  This version %1.7 does NOT include the changes made by Dennis Ernst to NAD
in his directory (dated 24-Jul-87) which changes the treatment of the "_"
character.  If Dennis wants his change incorporated into my version, I will
add it, but not without his confirmation.  Dennis?

  If my address for Doug is incorrect, please forward this message to him.

  The new version is ready for release/testing.  The only change between the
version now running as 1.6 and this version is the addition of QSATS to the
list of valid directories.

Dan,

If you send me a list of the systems and code involved I will declare
them readable by all users of the PDP.  I have found the programs that
reset the license of the SOURCE and BETATEST code and can modify them
to insure the code is always readable.

It seems to me the failing here is in the writing of the contract for
Private Networks to gen their own code.  It is obvious the authors of
the contracts are not in tune with established code management procedures
which you have been requesting to modify.  

The changes will be made after I request and receive approval from
Security to make the changes you request.

Doug.

must be readable without license.
 
Note also, that many release documentation (.X, .Y, .Z) and parameter

from the directories on an as needed basis, but with some inconvenience.

You will have to have QA track the sporatic changes on the .X and other

What systems are you concerned with?  I will only make the changes 
on the systems you are working on since this is a security issue.

Doug,

Systems 22 & 37.

Can you inform the first level of management responsible for
QA, STS, NTD and PDP operations?  As an external entity, MDIS
is paying MDNSC for support, and I do not have the time to
attempt to allocate responsibility for NSC products from across
the world.

This does not imply in anyway that I am unappreciative of your
efforts on my behalf, but I plan to make a lot of noise until
the quality of the support for these products shows improvement.

Best regards,

Dan

Dan,

I'd guess Warren Prince would be the best focal point for QA, STS
NTD, and PDP operations.  

You are running into unchartered waters with your requests for procedural
changes.  I hope you relize that by making the changes you request,
ANY user on the PDP's can delete, modify or copy the source
code we declare readable.  I view it not as a support issue but a security 
issue.  

I'll do what I can on the specific files you mentioned.  You will have
to change Company policy to make the changes stick.  You might consider
submitting a PIR for making any changes you feel necessary.  I will follow
it up for you at the product release meetings.

Let me know if you need anything else (small requests only please).

Thanks,
Doug.

 SUBJECT:  SOURCE/BETATEST Access and Security
 
=========================================================================
 
Although I have discussed this issue with STS many months ago, it is still
an ongoing problem, and I hope that you can be of some assistance in its
resolution.
 
For security reasons, all actual source code files (.I and .R) have been 
declared to have ALL RD NO protections.  NAD has been set up with 
Read File (RF) license so that private net customers can still generate
code, but cannot read, or copy, the files directly.
 
This is fine in most cases, except for PASCAL codes, which require to
merge the files using COPY, prior to calling the PASCAL compiler programs.
Because these files are also protected, our private network customers are 
unable to access them.
 
This means that the local Communications Consultant must actually undertake
the preparation and genning of these files, no matter how trivial the change.
 
Private Network customers have been trained to generate, modify and maintain 
their networks' code on a day to day basis.  Although MDIS is glad to assist 
the customer with any software problem, day to day code generation is not
covered under our provision of software support.  If we did provide this 
service, the consultants time would be chargeable to the customer.
 
As this extra time and effort is not at customer request, but due to problems 
introduced by NSC, and which, so far, NSC has been disinterested in 
correcting,  MDIS will be recording the time spent in supporting these codes, 
and billing NSC for same.
 
For solving the problem itself, I have some recommendations:
 
        Drop protections on PASCAL source code files.
 
        Modify CPPRO to accept as input a multiple file string, and
        give CPPRO Read File license (similar to what we are doing 
        with NAD).
 
I would appreciate your timely response to the above problem.

Doug,

The setting of the files to public READ status should not allow
anyone to modify, or delete, these files.  All it will allow as
a security issue is that these files can be read, displayed or
listed.

If this is still a security issue, it should be corrected, but not
at the expense of field personnel and customers.  Either the systems
need to be modified, or the access programs (ND, PAscal compilers,
etc.) need to enforce only the necessary level of security.  With the
PASCAL preprocessor, the output is in fully readable form anyway.

Thanks for getting these files modified.

Best,

Dan

The message "Bits 18,19,20 disabled cannot swap" should be interpreted as
"disk full or quota exceeded".  User UKMKTG on F26 has a quota of 5000 pages
and is currently using 5030 pages.  The easy way of checking this is to
GFD to that directory and "R QUOLST".
UKMKTG will not be able to created any new files until either
a) some old files are deleted, or
b) the logged in quota is increased and the user logs out and back in again.

Subject: XEXEC Monitor solution! 

Joe,
  I've come up with a solution to the problem XEXEC has with the universal
identifier JBTUID which currently restarts at 1 each time the system is
reloaded.  If instead of using a monotonically increasing number, we set
the UID to the universal-date-time, we will be guaranteed of unique UIDs
that will never be reused.  Thus, if a job number and UID match at any time
we know we have the right job.

  Of course, we know the UDT is accurate to 1/3 second, so what do we do
about jobs that would have the same UDT?  Simple... since we keep the last
UID, we now keep the last UDT used for a UID and if the current UDT matches,
we increment it by 1  (1/3 second isn't going to hurt anything).  It's a
small possibility that the UID could get ahead of the UDT but it wouldn't
stay ahead for very long.

  And last, but not least, we can redirect .GTJLT (130) to point to JBTUID
and be able to obtain the login time for a job.

  The change should be in FRMSER in FRMASN where the UDT is incremented and
set for each frame

*** I would like this change to be made in /C09 ***

Subject: Suprise! Suprise!!! 

Hmmmm.... It makes sense, since just assigning a frame number doesn't
guarantee that the job will get logged in... but, there are 2 places in
the monitor that set the UID.

  1) in FRMSER in .FOCFM code after most everything is setup
  2) in SCHED1 {page 40} where it sets up/resets the context pages

For two instructions <AOS T1,SYSUID & MOVEM T1,JBTUID(J)> it's not worth
having this done by a routine, but it should be for what I propose.  I'm
actually waiting for system 32 to come back up so I can make the changes.
Please let me know when you brng it up.

Dennis,
  In preperation that you might want to re-use DENCOFF and so that we do not

we will have SRA change username DENCOFF to TXSINFO.  This should not change
the password, and you can continue to use the new name until Ron has your
new username or DENCOFF validated again.

  SRA has recently received a memo from Irvine requesting the cancellation
of a list of usernames, among which was found DENCOFF... apparently someone
doesn't know what your username was used for, because I can't believe that
they have their act together to cancel your username so fast.

rdmail uses the sail parser, tums uses one I wrote in FLIB.  I will put
it on the list of things to do to convert rdmail to use flib, until then
anyone having a dot in their username should just use tums to read their

I think getting rid of the dot is the best solution since nobody is about

The problem is in the CVFIL filespec decoder in the SAIL runtimes.  I showed
the problem to Mike and Adele ages ago after Scott went to NTD and it was
tabled by them because of declining language support.  CVFIL uses the same
routine to read usernames as it does file identifiers, only allowing twelve
characters instead of 6.  Changing the code to use a different routine that
accepts "." as well as the other special characters allowed in usernames is
trivial.  Then rebuilding the SAIL runtimes and re-distributing them is the
major "glitch"... Scott or Lois were the last to do this  and I'm not sure
what kind of documentation exists.

Bill, If you'd like us to make the change, we can...  let us know...

Doug,
  After the new monitor is released, we can determine if the job is a
batch job and putting this into NAD will be useful to users ...   it will
require checking all of the error messages printed by NAD and deciding
which should continue and which should abort, but this item should be
brought up by your group to determine whether to do it.  We will NOT do
any work on NAD unless TYMNET asks for it...

Let me know what happens.. I thought you should know that some of the people
that use NAD are experiencing problems that they don't know  what to do about.

every message after that printed the statistics followed by 
"?EOT expected at end of message <crlf> ?EOT found in message"

This "shouldn'" happen... right?

(Also, is ther a way to set all the messages as READ without actually

  The code is kind of "so so" and there isn't much that I do.  I count
characters and change tabs into the proper number of spaces and I issue
an extra form feed at the end.  If you do not use the index capability
or the cross-reference capabilities, there isn't much else... maybe some
code to "wrap" long lines and count them as 2 lines instead of one.

  A half hour on the phone, or less telling you what the major algorithm
used for your purposes whould probably be more productive since you ARE
re-writing it in C for UNIX, right?

What version of TUMS?  Make sure you have a new one, I've fixed alot of that

still no way to mark everything read except the rename kludge.  The

  As per our discussion a few weeks ago, I'm sending you mail requesting

Subject: GAN-5 and other usernames 

Jan,
  There are a reasonable number of usernames that currently exist on the
PDP-10s that no one ever logs into.  Is there really any reason for those
usernames to exist in TYMNET?  Is there any reason why a set of usernames
or directories cannot exist only on the PDP-10s?

  The only stipulation being that those usernames cannot be assigned to
users that want to use the PDP-10s.  A user could have the name (DEC) and
be valid to talk to the DECNET gateways 411 and 412, but not be valid on
the PDP-10s.  On the PDP-10s we could have username (DEC) with a designated
PPN that isn't billed against (since it would be an IPC internal name).

  Maybe we should get together to talk about this... since if you and Ed
and Nancy and I can agree on what I'm proposing, it would solve the problem
with duplicate UUNs and reduce the cost incurred by IPC and by us in TYMNET.
(Why should we have billable username sin TYMNET if no one ever logs in?)

I accept your "wait to 88", but have my reservations re the PIR process
for security measures - they are a corporate issue, not a marketing issue.
I have security PIR's in as long as 2 years and no action because no MKTG
priority....As to PASCAL, the idea was (is?) to do the similar thing that we
did with NAD.  As to NAD AND (maybe) PASCAL, non-NTD developers are 
involved, and they have no concern with the PIR process (eg, Carl b. and
IPC - Julian Mein...)anyway...........

I'm interested in knowing if TUMS handles these addresses correctly...

Bill,  the current sources to PEAK are in (MYPEAK:32).  The module you need
to look at is REDISP.SAI.

If you want, just send me a copy of the escape sequences and I'll make the
changes, since I am more familiar with what it expects to do with them.  If
you have them XEROX-able, I can stop by your office and get a copy, or you
can mail it to me inter-office to mailstop D21, cube D2-325.

Thanks - I'll take a look at the source and see if its too cryptic and maybe
defer to you.  Otherwise I'll just put it on 39 to start with.  The only non-
trivial thing is the way insert works.  It takes a count of the number of
spaces to insert and then you write over the spaces.  This is much more
efficient than the way Hp does it.  I'll probably be spending the holidays
playing with my son and my Sun.  That's not a great loss, though, since we
don't celebrate Christmas or New Year they are just convenient long weekends.
I presume you do, though, so I hope you enjoy whatever you have planned.

Subject: re: PEAK, REDISP 

The REDISP module does the entire redisplay algorithm.  There are a few
tables (setup by macros) which define terminal types.  The rest is pretty
much done with case statements with each type of terminal's escape seq's
banded together.  The functions that it relies on are pretty basic, so
you may not even need to worry much over character insert/delete unless
either function doesn't exist.  There should be a flag (or some thing) to
declare whether or not to use insert-delet-line and one for insert-delete-char.

The algorithm used to do one character at a time... I changed one versin to
delete as many as known at a time, but I don't remember whether it was PEAK
or VUE that I made the changes to.

Please send me a copy of the escape sequences... so I can add them to my tables
to be put into my next version of VUE if there ever is a next version.

                                           For Immediate Release
 
 
 
       DIRECT VAN SERVICE BETWEEN JAPAN AND U.S. BEGINS
 
 
    SAN JOSE, California, December 21, 1987 --  Tymnet, McDonnell
 
Douglas Network Systems Company, announced here today that its
 
Japanese affiliate, Network Information Service, Ltd. (NIS), a
 
provider of packet-switched network services, has linked its
                                                                Page  2

 
network with the TYMNET(R) data communications network in the
 
first direct connection between a Japanese VAN and one in the
 
U.S.
 
    The linking comes about as a direct result of an agreement
 
between NIS and the Japanese Ministry of Post and
 
Telecommunications that allows communication between the two
 
companies without having to go through International Record
 
Carriers (IRCs).  It is part of a recent deregulation of the
 
Japanese telecommunications market.
 
    Tymnet, along with Marubeni Corporation, a leading Japanese
 
general trading company, owns a controlling interest in NIS, and
 
will now be able to offer its U.S.- based customers the full
 
range of Tymnet data communications products and services for
 
locations in Japan.  Until the agreement, many services were
 
unavailable in Japan.  Conversely, Japanese NIS customers will
 
also now be able to take advantage of the full range of Tymnet
 
protocol conversion, error-protection, low-cost local access and
 
other value-added features when communicating with offices in the
 
U.S.  Additionally, the agreement will significantly reduce the
 
costs of communications between the two countries.
 
 
    In an inaugural ceremony in Tokyo on Friday, Japan's Minister
 
of Post and Telecommunications, Mr. Nakayama, was present to
 
signal his government's approval of the agreement.  In addition,
 
congratulatory letters from high ranking officials in the
 
Department of Commerce and the State Department were displayed
 
via Tymnet's OnTyme(R) Electronic Mail System.  The letters
 
hailed the agreement as an important step in the development of
 
liberalized regulations governing international tele- and data
 
                                                                Page  3

communications.
 
 
    The NIS network was one of Japan's first, with service
 
commencing in 1985 after deregulation of Japan's domestic
 
telecommunications market.  Since then, several other
 
packet-switched networks have emerged.  Until the end of last
 
month, these networks were strictly internal to Japan, with
 
international traffic having to go through gateways supplied by
 
the IRCs.
 
    The agreement is significant for a number of reasons.  Not
 
only does the full Tymnet product line become available for use
 
between the two countries, but billing and initiation of service
 
are improved.  With the agreement in place, companies can now
 
sign up for network services from either Japan or the U.S.  They
 
can also be billed in whichever location they choose.
 
    "We are very excited about this agreement," said Ron Bamberg,
 
Vice President of Business Development and Planning for Tymnet.
 
"It not only solidifies our position as the leader in
 
international data communications, but paves the way for future
 
agreements with other countries in Europe, Asia, and South
 
America."
 
     Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company, owns and
 
operates TYMNET(R), the world's most ubiquitous public data
 
communications network.  In addition, they are a leading supplier
 
of private data networks.  Tymnet is a part of the McDonnell
 
Douglas Information Systems Group, with 1986 revenues in excess
 
of $1.1 billion.

Subject: Hotline Call 

Bonnie called me at 10 minutes to 8, and I responded late (at 9:20pm when
I returned home) that the Japanese customers were complaining about SPOOL
and BIONIK and a fortran program TOKTYP that were causing them problems.

This same problem occurred last week, DEC 22, when the SA-10 problem caused
them to put 74 on the spare KL. I presume they swapped the SA-10 and brought
things up on 74's base... 'cause the japanese customers reported the problems
fixed shortly after that.

I checked out BIONIK and BIONIC, Bonnie and I checked out TELECOPY and all
block-io programs appeared to be having problems.  BIONIC received every 4th
byte transmitted (? really ?) and TELECOPY failed miserably.

I found out they were using node 2100 for the base (?the bad one?) and had
Bonnie call FSC to have the base swapped out for Node 6722's hardware.  It
took until 2:00 for them to get the base loaded after the swap out.

The system answered by 2:40 and I logged in and tested BIONIC.  Cindy from
operations checked out TELECOPY and it worked ok.  I asked her to put a note
on the base 2100, that BLOCK-IO doesn't work on this base.  (I thought the
bad base was retired?)

System 74 is up on the spare KL (that is why it was using node 2100) because
the SA-10 is still down... need to check with FSC to find out when X32 will

Subject   : F74 another problem    
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Rick,
     
Now, we have another problem on F74 (or the Base for F74).  
     
Our customers have sent files on to F74's KANA files by BIONIK, I will mentione 
about the BIONIK below, and the sent files had a problem.   
     
Some portion of the files, 8chars or 12 chars string, was replaced  as
unexpected same length string.
     
1. The characters which were replaced seemed to be by some Word unit. 
   (In KANA file,a word is 4 chars.)    
     
2. BIONIK is modified version for KANA file creation of BIONIC, and was    
   generated by ex-Tymshare person for NIS, ex-KTL. The program is located 
   on (UPLKT:74).   
     
3. About the timing of the problem, following 4 cases are reported.   
     
        In JST 
     
        '87  Dec  21st  morning    
                  21st  evening    
                  24th  morning    
        '88  Jan  06th  evening    
     
4. In those cases, the customers had made an access to F74 through 2 or 3  
   kind of HSA slot in Japan. 
     
5. We also know some unstable condition about I/O to F74 from the end of the    
   last year to the begin of this year. 
     
6. We have changed nothing in past one month, about BIONIK, HSA slot, etc. 
     
     
Regarding above matters, even though we have no explicit evidence, sorry,  
I suppose there might be some problems about I/O for F74 (or Base ?). 
And about the problem, the customers are very frustrated on our F74 system.
     
So please check and advise me on it, or please pass this letter to appropriate  
person. (Who is responsible about F74's system program now ?)    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: FFIle recovery? 

Dan,
  I called your office and got no answer... since it seemed urgent
I thought that if the problem was that something was deleted, or lost
then you should know that the best thing to do is to contact the system
operator and have them restore the file or files in question from the
previous day's backup tapes.  (this presumes that the lost information
is at least a day old, when it was lost....)

  Let me know if this helps.... send me mail to CARL@D35

  You can call the operator, or you can send a batch request to restore
the file(s).  SPecify the date-time you know the data was good and when
you know it was lost and they should be able to find a copy on tape.

Subject: Re: Meeting... next week 

Wayne,
  Next week would be a time for us to get together.  I've been working on
the mapping package I'll be using for SETOP and haven't done anything new
on the actual program.

  I just started working on the program the past couple of days and have
fitted the new routines into the main program.  I expect to have a scaled
down version of what we originally talked about so we can talk about it
by next week.

  The main additions over the previous SETOP version will be the audit trail
and the tracking of license holders by their ISG numbers.  There will be the
capability to grant license to people that do not report to you, but the
capabilities based on this will be more limited.

  Tracking ISG numbers will be the biggest problem still!!!  How will we
verify the id numbers given.  Do people like me give 212344 (the number on
my badge), 008324 (the number on my payroll checks) or 808324 (the number
I'm listed under in the benefits/human resources computer)?  People who have
joined CSC or FSC and paid out of Irvine after the badges were issued have
numbers such as 008324 in payroll and on their badges.

  I suggest that we ask for a company name, eg. FSC and we insert a code
for each ISG company/payroll and allow all the varieties as long as we can
code them accordingly.  I think I can squeeze in a payroll code somewhere
in the current record description...

Subject: Block I/O problem 

Joe,
  In memory of my previous patch to track down a similar problem with
block i/o, I think it would be a wise idea to install a similar check
in the monitor to verify that the base did indeed write a full/partial
block-i/o buffer and if the base skips a word somehow, do one or more
of the following:
	Issue a black-ball received on port (data lost)
	Issue a new messge type to the base to retransmit the block-i/o buffer
	Error return to the user, cause is data lossage?

I think that there should be some handshake to tell the base that we did NOT
receive the buffer when it sends a message in the ring saying it is done
writing a block-i/o buffer.

Joe,
  When you copied things from 930/62 ==> 32 and then 32 ==> 33, 34, ...
did you copy (SYS), (SAILIB), (FTSYS), ...?

  I just remembered.... that I patched the SAIL runtimes on system 62 to
do something different than on all the other systems.  I guess I can re-think
what I did to patch it, but if the patched version is around... I'd like to
get it in a place where I can use it.

  What I patched was the remote-interrupt stuff to use frame-interrupt calls
instead.  The only program that uses intrmt (or rmtint?) is CHKPNT on device
ACT: anyway.  I doubt we'll ever rewrite it into SAIL...

ThThe beeper went off quite a few times while Ed Hall was trying to put in
the digits... I guess the 4th or 5th time in rapid succession he got through.

Date: 16-Jan-88 8:40ish, Contact Ed Hall, 206 697 6402.
      Actual contact, Danny King @home 713 721 4101, for system 370.
      Yes, this is Fayez sarofim...

Problem: Support in diagnosing the hardware problems, cause of system crashes
      over the past month.  FE would like some assistance.

History: Looked at the crashes on disk, CRA004-CRA008, CRA011-CRA014, CRA015.
      All but CRA015 were of the same type; in FILIO, DTASAT+4 had received
      an i/o interrupt for the disk, the PGYIO table says no i/o in progress
      so crash!

      CRA004-CRA007 were on RMA0, CRA008,CRA011,CRA012 were on RMA1, and
      CRA012-CRA014 were on RMA0.  (Danny says they had Fayez swap drives
      for a time).  CRA015 looks like a shutdown... SYSCRS/ NOCRS.

      I looked a little deeper, and tracked the CONO/DATAI info to see if
      there were any common patterns and relayed the info to Danny.  Spent
      a little over 2 hours.

Follow up:  We can look on Monday to see if there is anything else we can
      give to Danny, otherwise, hope the info already given was enough for
      him to track down the problem.

To who if may concern... if you receive this and you are not responsible
for (NETALERT)ALERT, please pass it on to whomever is now responsible...

Why are there 5 jobs running ALERT?  I thought that the proposed idea was
to keep a single ALERT program running on multiple systems so that ONE of
them would always be running even when systems are taken down or crash...

If this is still true, and there is more than copy of ALERT running on each
system, then somethng is wrong with the logic in the program.  Someone needs
to look at it.

I've only brought this up, and sent this message because I recall a comment
in a meeting with Gary Walker, that (NETALERT) was one of the largest CPU
users on system 70 just before it went away...  If multiple copies of ALERT
are running on the same system, we are wasting TYMNET's computing resources.

Thank you for your attention.

Subject   : F74 PROBLEM

Carl and Dennis,

At first, I'm sorry I'm not sure that you are the right person to be contacted
on such problem. However, in my old memory, you have been the responsible
persons for PDP-X system software.

The problem on F74 reported during the middle of the last Dec and today, by
many users.

And the problem is becoming very critical.

So please check and advise me, or please pass this letter to appropriate person
and let me know the name of the responsible person.

The problem is

        When users sent files onto F74 by BIONIC or BIONIK, the modified BIONIC
        for KANA file input written by ex-Tymshare, they found that some
        characters (8-12 char string) was replaced as other string.

        For your checking, I located one of the troubled files onto (OGURA:74)
        CHKDAT.NIS. (The original file in user area is (HAL:74)RHAMK2.020.)
        In that file, you can find a string "WW@@ZZ Z" at 15th column of the
        307th record. But the original string for the 8 chars is ";  YVWYS",
        and also we can find the "WW@@ZZ Z" at the 302nd rec in the file.
        So I guess the 8 char string of 307th rec is overwritten by the 8 char
        string of 302nd rec.

        Anyway, our users found that the sent files on F74 were different from
        the original files on their terminals.

        The users tried to send the files through HSA in Japan. And regarding
        the HSA, no Tymcom-370 user, who access to the host through the HSA
        slot, report such kind of problem.

Thanks and regards,
Makoto

P.S. I also find some strange matter on creation date in dir information
     of (OGURA:74)M28250.OTM. Year 1999 was indicated for the creation!!
     I feel there is something wrong in the current F74.

Subject: Patched monitor for F74 

To all concerned with F74's recent problems.  I have created a patch and
applied it to a copy of F74's monitor.  The next time system 74 is reloaded
for any reason, including an emergency scheduled reload (if possible),
please bring system F74 up on (SYS)PATMON.SAV.

The patch implements an INFO STOPCD named BIOBAS which will report on the
CTY when/if the current problem is caused by the base skipping any data
words when writing into the PDP-10s block-io buffers.

Please call the hotline, or contact one of: Carl, Osman or Joe before the
reload occurs.  If any problems with PATMON, please fall back to (SYS)NEWMON
after checking with Rick Daniels or one of us.

Subject: HSA question... 


Osman,
  I expect to be in by noon.  If you get a chance, could you contact Linda
Maurer at x6261 and ask her who is responsible for HSA at the moment, in
NTD and (if she knows) TYMNET.

  Also, does she know if the HSA converts the EBCDIC data records which
come in as <data-record><irg> etc, into...
           <data-record><cr>  etc  or
           <data-record><cr><lf> etc.

I ask, so that we can determine if the 132 characters records from Japan
are being converted by HSA-BBXS into 133 ascii characters or 134 characters.
That will tell us how they are packed in the block-io buffers.

You may also hint that, we may need some of their assistance in tracking
down this problem (assuming that it is not a hardware problem).

Subject: Skiing 

I've been pretty busy trying to keep track of some things lately, and we
have a friend of Cherie's visiting till Thursday... so you can guess why
I haven't gotten back to you sooner.

As for the skiing, I don't really know what the crouds and conditions
are like on Friday & Saturday...  The two times we went last year, we
went on Wednesday & Thursday, then again on Monday-thru-Thursday.  If
it were up to me, I'd try to make it during the week, since we know
what to expect, but if it has to fit into your schedule, Friday and
Saturday should be alright.  I haven't had time to discuss your last
message with Cherie to see what she thinks.

We still hadn't made any final plans other than that week.  (although
we want to finalize it so we can make reservations).  We also don't
know how well either of us is going to hold up, with the skating and
both of us getting over an injury (Cherie, her knee, and me, my foot,
so we expect to be taking it pretty easy).

We could ski, Tuesday-Friday to take advantage of their mid-week ski
package with the super price discount, and you could ski Friday thru
Sunday to give us a day of overlap (and depending on how we're
doing we can decide if we want to continue on Saturday)...  That way
you'll get to be alone (without us?).

I don't know how our budget is holding up or whether we can afford to
stay through the weekend.

Give me a call in the afternoon and we can chat briefly... I'll hope
to have talked with Cherie by then, or we can try a 3-way call.  I also
thought that maybe we could have you stop by on your way home, and I'd
arrange to be home so we can talk about it together (since we're only a
little out of your way to go home), possibly Wednesday.

HI CARL,
I THINK I MAY HAVE FOUND THE PROBLEM. I FIGURED I JUST USE PEAK TO WRITE

WROTE THE MESSAGE THEN GAVE ME AN "AUTO LOGOUT". AT LEAST THIS TIME
I DIDN'T LOSE MY WORK! I THINK THAT MAYBE THE AUTO LOGOUT FEATURE
DOESN'T RECOGNISE THAT WHEN YOUR IN PEAK YOUR REALLY WORKING.
MY CRISIS SEEMS TO BE GETTING BETTER, BUT WHO DO WE TALK TO
ABOUT FIXING THIS AUTO LOGOUT FEATURE, OR SHOULD
I JUST LIVE WITH IT? OH WELL, I GUESS THERE'S WORSE THINGS.

Rick was concerned about not being able to run more than 1 tape at a time

more tapes were being used at the same time.  The culprit was in stopcode
FTACFC (which was added in /B08) left T2 pushed on the stack when it POPJed.
(M33)FTACFC.PAT changes the reference from CPOPJ to T2POPJ and is being

Subject: BLOCK-IO buffers 

At the moment, BLOCK-IO buffers are gotten right out of freecore along
with everything else that comes out of freecore.  This will make it  very
inconvenient to uncache them, since we would be uncaching whatever else
is interlaced in freecore on the same pages.

A suggestion... in addition to GET4WD, we add a routine which works from
the top of freecore backward (much like the stack and heap on many micros)
looking for space.  This way, only when freecore gets full would we ever
mix cache-able and non-cache-able data structures in freecore.  A second
routine could take a page number determined from the address and re-cache
the page whenever a buffer is released to freecore (only if all bits in
the free-core map say no one else is using that memory page).  Then, always
turn off the cache bit for any pages used for block-io at buffer creation
time.

Block-io buffers are only created when one is needed and no free ones are
available.  Block-io buffers are normally returned to the pool until 2*jobn
buffers exist, then they are returned to freecore as they are released once
more than 2*jobn buffers have been created.  No telling if this limit is
ever crossed in either direction (since not all jobs use block-io and they
would have to get backed up somehow to use more than 2 per job).

(internals: See GETBB and RELBB, page 205 [/N] or /N-fiche #10 D2 & E2).

OOPS, my mistake.. I remembered what I read wrong... it's not 2*JOBN for
the number of buffers in the pool.  It keeps up to 2*<biocnt> which is
the number of ports using block-io.  No distinction is made for input or
output.  So, yes, when no one is doing block-io the buffer pool is empty.

Subject: P035/D Monitor release .. 
----------------------------------

	This is an announcement of official release of "Monitor Version
P035/D".  Included with this mail is a brief document describing the
significant changes and improvements made to the monitor.

	(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all PDP-10 systems now have the P035/D
monitor.  This monitor is already tested.  All of Fremont D.C.
PDP-10's have been running with this monitor since December 1, as P035/C10.

	If you need a copy of the Monitor release notes, they are located 
on all of the PDP10s.  They are named as: (OSP)P035D.DOC and (OSP)STOPCD.MEM

	Any questions or comments please call (408)922-6224 and ask for
Carl Baltrunas, Osman Guven or Joe Smith.  Thank you.
(OSP)P035D.DOC - List of changes from P035/C to P035/D.            3-Feb-88
These are the "release notes" for the P035/D monitor.


New messages for the OPR:
  RIBHRE - Hard read error trying to lookup the RIB of a file.
  RIBERR - Software detected error in the RIB of a file.
  REDSAT - Hard read error trying to read a page of the SAT.
  BADSAT - Software detected error in the count of bits in the SAT.
  BADPAG - Hard read or hard write error detected, page gets marked in the BAT.

New UUOs:
  More entries in GETTAB table .GTCNF - see P035D.MEM for details.
  Set KSYS command and UUO give programs warning when the system is
    scheduled to go down.
  Notice-in-Child and inactivity timer added (for XEXEC and SUBMIT jobs).
  SYSDVF function 6 returns named buffers.  (Makes CTYLOG program faster.)
  KS2020 can have up to 8 tape drives defined.  Don't die if no LP20.
  Output event stopcode PTYSBL when a PTY gets a buffer-zap.
  Fixed the problem of "slot out of ports" by no allowing excessive input.
  Monitor edit number stored in GETTAB(70,11) where programs can look at it.
  GETTAB table 130 has date/time job logged in.

Performance enhancements:
  Files are created with contiguous pages if possible.  This speeds up
  sequential access to files (such as TITO saves) and makes BOOTS much
  faster in loading the monitor.

ONCE dialog:
  TYPE BAD will decode the BAT pages and output a list of bad disk pages.
  The date and time must be entered before refreshing the structure.
  The creation date for SAT.SYS and HOME.SYS is the date when refreshed.
  The command to dissolve the structure is spelled correctly (not DISOLVE).
  The front-end file (FEFILE.SYS) on the 2020 is created correctly now.
  TSTSUP commands have been added to allow for patching absolute pages on
    disks.  This disaster recovery procedure has already been used to
    salvage disk problems that would otherwise require a system rebuild.
  A new startup command - NOINITIA - starts DSKCLN but no other part of the
    autorestart procedure.  This was specifically added for TITO rebuilds.

Miscellaneous:
  The date and time defaults from SAT.SYS, so we should never see the
    phony date of 1-JAN-64 ever again.
  The current date/time is now more accurate on KS-2020 systems.
  Stopcode SAXINY has been removed.
  Device errors on 3650 disks are now logged in BAT pages like data errors.
  The EBUS base can be reloaded without reloading the PDP-10.
  Problems with the host/base interface are reported as INFO stopcodes instead
    of DEBUG stopcodes, so that the system will not crash when they occur.

Changes which affect general users:
  The SEND command uses SENDMAIL to send TUMS mail instead of RPG mail.
  The MAIL command now checks for both RPG mail and TUMS mail.

License and privileges:
  The ENABLE and DISABLE commands can set/clear specific licenses.
  A new license has been defined - HR allows home-files read privileges.
  New UUO to allow operators to get all license when doing TITO restore.
  SET AUTOLOGOUT modified to not allow users to disable inactivity timeout.

Subject: Found bug in DSKCLN. 

Problem: The errors that cause files to be deleted print garbage PPNs on the
	CTY.  In particular: SLF = Rib has bad self pointer, NAM = RIB's
	name does not match UFD, and MUP = RIB page is multiply used.

Diagnosis: The PPN in T3 was getting half overwritten by the error code.

Cure:  T2 has an index into BUF (from 000 to 777), so put the error code
	in the LH of T2.

File 1)	DSK:DSKCLN.107	created: 1626 21-AUG-87

To who if may concern... if you receive this and you are not responsible
for (NETALERT)ALERT, please pass it on to whomever is now responsible...

Why are there 5 jobs running ALERT?  I thought that the proposed idea was
to keep a single ALERT program running on multiple systems so that ONE of
them would always be running even when systems are taken down or crash...

If this is still true, and there is more than copy of ALERT running on each
system, then somethng is wrong with the logic in the program.  Someone needs
to look at it.

I've only brought this up, and sent this message because I recall a comment
in a meeting with Gary Walker, that (NETALERT) was one of the largest CPU
users on system 70 just before it went away...  If multiple copies of ALERT
are running on the same system, we are wasting TYMNET's computing resources.

Thank you for your attention.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Osman,
   Hi. This past Saturday when I was starting to run the weekly
ASP on system D55, I noticed that we were unable to come up in
console mode. When I got to the procedure where the operator types
a ctrl z followed by 'L' to login, I received the following message
on the CTTY 'user invalid on this computer'.
   I tried several variations in the 'reflag'.. command while in
DDT (such as 'reflag! ,1'  'reflag! 1,0'  'reflag! 1,1'  ...etc
but none of them worked (kept receiving the invalid user msg).
( the usual syntax used is 'reflag! ,0' )
   If you could send us the correct PPN to use it would be greatly
appreciated as we usually bring the system up in console mode when
running the ASP backups.
                                       Thanks a lot,
                                        Paul Miller
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

We forgot the mention in P035D.DOC that "REFLAG" is no longer works.
They don't need reflag to come up in console mode, I will send them
documents showing how could they do it without reflag.

Carl,

I have just returned from 3 weeks off sick and I am getting a long
message about problems on January 27th every time I log in.

The problem appears to be that something went wrong either on system
26 or on the "PERP master" for 26 and my regular job that goes around and
assembles our queued jobs went crazy.

Since these have been running for over 3 months, I am surprised that
such a catastrophic problem occurred.

I have re-entered and monitored the jobs for a couple of hours now
(taking care to ensure that no restart is set in case of interuptions)
and would be grateful if you could have the message removed so that
I can login without waiting for that printout to finish.

The username concerned is MWALTERS on system 26.

Many Thanks
MJW

     SUBJECT:      Changes in M&PD Staffing and Programs


     It is with both pleasure and regret that I have decided to leave
     McDonnell Douglas, effective February 11, 1988.  I have accepted the
     position of Domestic Training Manager for Seagate Technology, in Scotts
     Valley, California.  

     I am extremely pleased to announce that Kathleen Corcoran, formerly
     Senior Training Specialist in M&PD-San Jose, has been appointed to fill
     my position.  Please join me in congratulating Kathleen on her new
     assignment, which reflects her outstanding accomplishments over the
     last year in a variety of M&PD programs.

     I am also pleased to announce that Becky Spencer has taken the position
     as Department Secretary of M&PD.  Becky was previously an MDC employee
     with Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach.

     Kathleen's former Training Specialist position is currently available.
     Interested candidates should contact Kathleen at (408)922-7651.

     Questions about M&PD programs and services can be directed as follows:

         Kathleen Corcoran (408)922-7651 -- Questions on program content of
         M&PD programs.

         Becky Spencer (408)922-7653 -- Questions on enrollment in M&PD
         programs; borrowing films and tapes; ordering Ethical Decision
         Making supplies.

         LaVonne Hage (408)922-7652 -- Educational Reimbursement questions
         and forms.

     The following is a listing of M&PD-San Jose programs scheduled for the
     next two months and their status.  (The 2Q88 M&PD-San Jose schedule
     will be published in early March.)  Employees wishing to enroll in any
     of the following programs should see their senior section manager for
     an enrollment form.  If additional enrollment forms are needed, contact
     Becky Spencer.

Dispatch said caller had right number and right department and had an emergency
on system X0DDD74.  The memo is working!

The Japanese users are quite upset that they were getting A016 errors trying
to run MAGNUM ever since F74 came back up.  Bonnie said that the accounting
files from yesterday were missing, and day shift had remedied the problem.
I recommended she get a hold of the people in charge of royalty accounting;
it appears the database is not correct and is rejecting access from the
nodes the Japanese users are on.  There is nothing I can do.     /Joe

Dear Mr.Baltrunas,  
this is the first time for me to sent you a mail. First I'd like to   
introduce myself, my name is Kazuo Watanabe, Application System  
Dept. in NIS. I have some customers on host F74.  
     
By the way, the F74's problem was returned to our customers. They have
sent  files on to F74, and the sent files had a problem. About the timing  
of the problem, following 5 cases are reported.

Please investigate again, and let me know result. I will try to test, 
if necessary.  
     
Best regards.

The reason why they never had to enter ^Z L O P E R <cr> when they came
up console was that they set reflag non-zero.  That meant ignore the
normal LOGIN procedure and just log them in.  Without reflag, they needed
to enter a login name so that LOGINN would do the right things for them.

Re:  Your jobs on system 26

As you saw, your "PERP" jobs using the SUBMIT program went out of control
in your abcense.  This caused the SUBMIT program and the entire "PERP"
system on F26 to process an inordinate amount jobs which stepped on each
other and caused each other to bomb (all yours) and took about 20% of the
CPU resources.

I looked at the files being used by your jobs to analyse what they were
doing to take up so much CPU time.  In the process, it appears evident that
you are NOT using the SUBMIT/EXEC system properly.  There is no need to use
SUBMIT to run PCOM jobs.  This in fact is wasteful.  SUBMIT jobs are fully
upward compatible from PCOM jobs, as SUBMIT was designed to replace PCOM
and PERP.

I will be happy to work with you to setup a smooth job processing system
for your actual needs.  I shall be back from vacation on Monday 22-Feb-88.
Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss your needs and allow me
to demonstrate the most optimal way to fulfill those needs on TYMCOM-X.

Thank you.

Re:  Your jobs on system 26

As you saw, your "PERP" jobs using the SUBMIT program went out of control
in your abcense.  This caused the SUBMIT program and the entire "PERP"
system on F26 to process an inordinate amount jobs which stepped on each
other and caused each other to bomb (all yours) and took about 20% of the
CPU resources.

I looked at the files being used by your jobs to analyse what they were
doing to take up so much CPU time.  In the process, it appears evident that
you are NOT using the SUBMIT/EXEC system properly.  There is no need to use
SUBMIT to run PCOM jobs.  This in fact is wasteful.  SUBMIT jobs are fully
upward compatible from PCOM jobs, as SUBMIT was designed to replace PCOM
and PERP.

I will be happy to work with you to setup a smooth job processing system
for your actual needs.  I shall be back from vacation on Monday 22-Feb-88.
Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss your needs and allow me
to demonstrate the most optimal way to fulfill those needs on TYMCOM-X.

Thank you.

Investigate connecting RM05s (we have at least one DCL and 4 drives, and
we were supposed to swap Dallas a drive for a DCL) to the 2020s.  If they
are more reliable than some of the hardware we have (they are newer) they
may be another solution to the RP06 problems we continue to have.

Problem:  Their customer RAILTRACK, calles them complaining that their
          SUBMIT jobs are not running.  They've entered them a few times
          and they are not doing anything.

Research: (SUBMIT)*.JQL shows that nothing has run since 21-Feb-88.  The
          isn't any problem with (SYS)XEXEC or (SYS)EXECX.

          CTYLOG shows that the system has been up since Sunday 20:05 in
          "MANUAL" mode, no DSKCLN has been run, system was unshut after
          running ASP.   (An aside: we need to have ASP write to the CTY
          so that we can detect this condition.)

Solution: I masked as PERPOPER and started XEXEC.  I also impressed on the
          operator and shift supervisor the gravity of what "could" be a
          major file-system integrity problem due to the failure to reload
          and run DSKCLN.  I advised them to reload and do a FULL DSKCLN.

As we left it, Marconi was due in at any moment and he would authorize them
to do whatever they feel is necessary as far as scheduling down-time to try
to correct the problem.   I'll follow-up and contact Marconi later today.

    Attn:   Landa Morris
	    RPM group members

    From:   Carl A Baltrunas

    Subj:   PDP-10 developments for performance monitoring


    Landa,

      I have gone through our recent release notes for the P035/D monitor
    and identified all of the work accomplished to provide better tools and
    information for monitoring the resources available on PDP-10 systems
    running TYMCOM-X.

    1)  Access to previously unavailable internal monitor tables.
	Provide information requested by TYMNET and for RPM so that newer
	tools may access the information for any user.  (Resource Monitoring)
	A)  Frame CPU time.
	B)  Frame login date-time.
	C)  Second internal status word (6 bits defined).

    2)  Aux circuit trace info.
	Provides a table indexed by port number with the login string passed
	to the network for all aux circuits.  (Resource Monitoring)

    3)  Fixed erroneous info reported for disk drives units DSKB1 and DSKB2.

    4)  Internal system console log.
	Provides a log of all output that appears on the system console in
	a form readable by utility programs.  (Operations Support)


      In addition, the SYSTAT program was updated to report the proper data
    for 3650 and 3652 disk units specifically, and to handle units formatted
    in blocks (old style) or pages (some selected systems).


      The above changes will allow our group to provide a new version of the
    ICP program (possibly a new program) to aid RPM with the monitoring of
    the PDP-10s run by MD-IPC.  However, we have not actually agreed on which
    features should be provided by the new ICP version.  That is the purpose
    of today's meeting.

      I have a display program which utilizes much of the above information
    just as ICP does and presents an ongoing snapshot of the system on the
    screen (similar to SRACRT).  This is my test program for all of the new
    resource monitoring info.  I will be happy to give a brief demonstration
    during or after the meeting.  Any display that you can run PEAK on will
    work for my program.

      As I mentioned to you on the phone, it may be in the best interest of
    both IPC and FSC to provide a new version of ICP which includes the new
    features we decide on today and ONLY that information utilized by RPM.
    Again, we should decide on this in today's meeting.

  We expect the appointment to be over soon enough fr me to drive home

Please let everyone know, if I am later than I expect.

Carl:

The problem with your reply involves the way interontyme is set up between
machines.  Only some accounts can communicate with each other across
systems.  Obviously (although I did not look this up), TXS can and the
other account cannot.

Now I have a question for you.  I read the mail fine using "mail" on
35, but when I went back to reread it I could not find it.  I tried
"r tums" which first told me I had 8 messages, but when I tried to read
or list them it said I had none.  I have a tums.tix which has the
message headers in it, updated with your latest message.  What goes?
I was afraid to use tums to send a message to you when it had
"lost" my messages.  Is there another program I should be using?

You will probably need to log into ontyme (poor Carl) to send your
reply unless you can instruct tums as to which system (account) to
send your reply from.

     CARL, HERE IS AN OUT-LINE OF THE PDP-10 TOOLS RPM FINDS NECESSARY TO
IMPROVE OUR PERFORMANCE MONITORING.  FOR NOW, IF POSSIBLE, WE CAN RECEIVE
THIS DATA TRHOUGH THE ICP REPORTS BUT LATER ON WE WANT THE DATA DISPLAYED
ON THE CRT'S AND HISTORY OUTPUT TO A FILE.

     NEW SPECS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

          *  CPU BUSY THRESHOLDS

          *  CPU CAPACITY  (when the system is out of room/saturated)

          *  MEMORY - when capacity is exceeded/what's normal/what's not

          *  DISK QUEUES  -  number of blocks per sec. (disk i/o)


     REGARDING THE CURRENT ICP REPORTS, WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ICP
MEASUREMENT THRESHOLDS:  WHAT THEY DO AND HOW THEY RELATE, WHAT KIND OF
TOOLS THEY ARE.  THE DEFINITIONS NEED TO BE CLARIFIED.

     AGAIN, THE CURRENT ICP FILE IS SUFFICIENT FOR NOW, BUT LATER THE DATA 
OUTPUT TO A SCREEN.  THE FORMAT IS NOT IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME.  THESE NEW
TOOLS ARE NEEDED NO LATER THAN END OF APRIL.

and needed to be cleared.  When you see slot 0 running ok and can't 
log in try pushing the "INI" button or the "bubble switch" on the

Well Ops, it did it again today.  B39's base 2674 slot 1 went bad.  I
don't know what is causing this problem because there have been no changes
to the base code.  Have there been changes to the system monitor?
Since I was logged into the dispatcher of the base I was able to "HALT", 
"INIT" and "EXECUTE" the 'bad guy' from here.  If this problem
continues I will look into it further.

  VT100 in KL Lab - good video board, logic board stuck with white background.
  VT100 in Nicholson - video board dead, logic board good, no AVO.

After 4-Mar-88:
  VT101 in VAX Lab - has bad video board and bad logic board.
  VT100 in KL Lab - has good video board and good logic board.
  VT100 in Nicholson - has good video board and so-so logic board.

(The video board can be easily repaired.  One diode runs hot enough to scortch
the board and evaporate the electrolyte from the adjacent capacitor.  When
the capacitor dries out, it blows the fusable link.  Replace link and capacitor,
and board works again.  The previous info came from a DECUS session.)  /Joe

12-Mar-88 05:02/Joe  (Pager said 817-637-7435, did not go thru Central Dispatch)
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size".  It did not say whether there were too
          many or too few units in the new structure.
Solution: Told them to verify that the new DSKB had exactly the same number of
          units as when the ASP was done.  The highest unit can be found at the
          end of the hardcopy from when ASP was run.

11-Mar-88 00:23/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, David Jorgenson, (415)498-2588, System 32.
Problem:  When bringing up the system READONLY to run ASP as part of operator
          training, it died with a NONAME stopcode in SCHED1.
Diagnosis: LOGINN was trying to update the LUD to turn off the 6 letter bits
          to indicated that OPER had seen the "system is going down" message.
          During READONLY, updating ENTERs are allowed.  However, when the
          program issues an OUT uuo or VALPAG chanio, the system crashes.
Solution: Told them to come up MANUAL this time to do the ASP.  Later analysis
          showed that they could have come up MANUAL, run TAKEIT to HANG the
          system, and then come up READONLY.
Note:     Looking at the monitor source code implies that this bug existed
          prior to P034/N.  One way around it is to come up using "NOINITIA"
          and "FULL", then login as OPER (which clears the bits in the LUD)
          to run TAKEIT and "HANG" the system.  That leaves the files is the
          proper state to bring up "CONSOLE" and "READONLY" so the OPER can
          login and run ASP.  This will be fixed in next release of the monitor.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System 30.
Problem:  One user had 30 jobs logged in, all detached, all running MAGNUM
          programs.  The jobs would not go away immediately - LOGOUT and TAKEIT
          only evicted them.  System was heavily loaded and very slow.
Solution: None.  By the time I logged in, all these jobs had logged out.
          MAGNUM enables notice-to-quit (NTQ) so that it can clean up after
          itself and leave the database in a consistent state.  Until the clean
          up is done, the job can be evicted but not killed.

To get TXS added to interontyme for the account you want to communicate with
you should execute the file *** otforms.interot/req (on any system).  You
will have to log in, preferably as TXS.SUP (sorry).  If it were for any 
system other than the French host, I would add you myself, but this better
go through channels.  Catherine Derby is the actual human who will do the
modifications necessary.  (The command is :EXEC *** OTFORMS.INTEROT/REQ).

It looks like TYMNET had to turn off their circuit-breaker panel.
All the engines were down around noon today, but the 2020's kept running.
Nodes 5416 and 5561 were down so we couldn't get to 17 or 14 via TYMNET,
and we couldn't get thru via the micronet because node NICK and its modem
were plugged into TYMNET power.  I located a 30-amp extension cord, now
node NICK, node FOON, the sync modem, and both async modems are now
plugged into our conditioned power.  We need another 10-foot 30-amp
extension cord so that all the terminal by the Foonlys can be plugged into
our conditioned power.  		/Joe

We also received, in late May, four 4-digit host numbers for our use.
(I don't have these handy, but will save them away for later).

With these 8 numbers, and the ones we already have, we should be able
to configure our micronet with printer devices accessible from the real

Subject: Host 14 is still on 940NET.

When I tried to log into JMS:14, the Supervisor told me the host was down
before I had entered my password.  Using JMS:17 requires a password go get
the host down message.  It appears that transparent login to 940NET is still
in effect.

The following hosts are transparent: 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,20.
The following hosts are normal: 3,7,10,15,17,18,19,21.

Someone needs to tell the Supervisors that hosts 14 and 16 are normal hosts,
not transparent.   /Joe

Is this behavior in the group/class list, or is it a kludge in the Supervisor?
If the latter, how long will it take to get new code genned and loaded in
all the SUPs?    ?joe

Subject:  DEC-10



It is the intent of MDNSC to get off of DEC-10 systems and convert our
existing applications, as necessary, to appropriate alternate
environment within the next 12 months.  This decision is based on the
recommendations made by an internal task force on hardware planning.
This migration will eliminate excessive IPC charges and also get us off
an archaic and inflexible computing environment that we have been using
for nearly 15 years.  While purchase of departmental processors might be
appropriate for applications specific to your groups only, common
hardware/software strategy may be required for applications such as code
management, validations, documentation, accounting, etc.

Please collect the information on your current DEC-10 based applications
in the format suggested by April 1 and return it to your representative
of the Hardware Planning Task Force.  The members of the task force are:

Raja Rajaraman - Operations 
Ken Holcomb - NTD 
Gary Walker - Marketing and Sales 
Sateesh Lele/Fred Canning - Finance (HR, Legal, Business Planning, if 
necessary)

Your cooperation in this matter is extremely critical in order to put
together an intelligent and consistent hardware/software strategy.

Thank you for your compliance.

Subject: AR/ARX failures show up as "IME" on current monitor. 

The "IME" stopcodes on system 33 were a result of an AR/ARX parity error
being detected.  I suspect a bad cache board.

.CPUP1+0 = saved contents of UPT+500 = page fail word
.CPUP1+1 = saved contents of UPT+501 = PC at time of page fault
.CP7+0   = saved contents of AC 0 of block 7 (contents of AR)
.CP7+1   = saved contents of AC 1 of block 7 (contents of ARX)
Page fail type 36 is AR parity error (data word from cache or E bus)
Page fail type 37 is ARX parity error (instruction PC points to from cache)

Crash  Date   Time  Type  UPT+500 UPT+501    Good data      Bad data    Where
CRA002 24-MAR 02:49 36=AR  177163  170473 574212,,000000 554210,,000000 .CP7+0

CRA006 was a parity error detected at the S-bus, the sector lights should have
been on for this particular crash.

On all the other crashes, the bad data came from cache and the good data was
read after doing a cache sweep.  The difference in each case is 020000,,000000.

Patch #3 (IMEPAR.PAT) has been applied to NEWMON on all systems in the
data center.  It causes all AR/ARX detected faults to output the standard
"PARITY ERROR" message and then stop with an APRFAT stopcode.

I will look into the possibility of continuing after an AR/ARX error.  /JMS

Subject: Patch #4 for P035/D stops on AR/ARX errors. 

Patch #4 has been applied to NEWMON in the Fremont Data Center.
This patch causes the system to stop with CPU stopcode AR.ARX whenever
an AR or ARX parity error occurs.  The previous patch invoked the old
parity error scanning routines when AR/ARX problems were detected, but
that caused misleading information to be typed out.  It produced a
"USER PARITY ERROR" messaged, scanned memory, couldn't find any errors
in memory, output "SPURIOUS PARITY ERROR", and then marked all pages of
the user's core image as being bad.  This in turn triggered many BADPAG
messages.

With patch #4, AR/ARX problems will cause an immediate stopcode.
The way to recoginize an AR/ARX problem is by looking at the "UPT+500"
word printed as part of the "CPU STATUS".  If the first 2 digits are "36",
it is an AR error, AC 7:0 has the bad data.  If the first 2 digits are "37",
is is an ARX error, AC 7:1 has the bad data.

Hi...
  The access message you saw was a response to Warren Prince's memo to all
of MDNSC that they should identify their PDP-10 applications so that they
can meet their goal to be off the PDP-10s by the end of 1989.  I will be a
little suprised if they make it.  We shall see.

  The expunge message is normally what you see when you delete a mail message
and then issue the EXPUNGE or EXIT commands.  (EXIT does an implied EXPUNGE of
any deleted messages).  The "% phase error; EOT found in message" text is a
warning message that TUMS is confused by (what it thinks is an extra ^D inside
the text of the message) so it complains.  You may ignore it.  It is a bug in
TUMS.  Send mail to WRS if it annoys you... he knows about it, but I don't know
if it will ever get fixed.

  Thanks about the infor for otforms.interot/req ... I haven't done anything
yet, but plan to one of these days.

*** I'm too busy... and until I get another message saying I cannot send mail
*** it seems I can ignore it.   (Maybe the need will go away?)

Subject: What went wrong on F22, F33, F58. 

Patch #3 from the original IMEPAR.PAT had a bug.  It picked up the page-fail
code from UPT+501 instead of UPT+500.  This means that when a page fault
occured, if the PC flags had CARRY0 + CARRY1 + FLOAT_OVERFLOW + FIRST_PART_DONE 
+ USER all set, then the patch would say it was an ARX error, and jump to
the parity error routine.  APRER1 saw the USER flag set and tried to locate
the word with the bad parity error by scanning all of the user's core.  Since
it couldn't find any parity error in memory (the problem was in the cache,
not in core), the routine had no alternative but to wipe out all of that
user's core.  It marked all his pages as having read errors.  The routine
that frees up user core saw the read error bit set, so it added all of
those pages to the BAT page.

The final fix did not get installed into P035/D-4 until about 6pm, Tuesday
March 29.  The AR.ARX dumps on F22 and F58 prior to that time are bogus.

All Fremont systems are now up to date.  The way to check the crash dumps,
NEWMON, and/or the running system is to look at location PATCH+26 and
verify that the RH is UP%500, not UP%500+1.   /Joe

Subject: MAILER and ONTMTP 

Bill,
   Someone in FSCO just received an itemized bill for a few months ago and
found 1500 logins/month on each of our FSC.x/xxxxx ONTYME names.  He said it
amounts to about $5K just for logging in, since the volume of messages for
our names was negligible.

   I checked the queue and found MAILER running every 20 minutes on system 29.
TThe log showed ONTMTP running about 2 times an hour... this adds up to about
1500 logins per user per month.  I realize that polling is the only way we
can have ONTMTP check for mail, but the frequency shown is a little much if
you don't get much mail via ONTYME.

   I changed the schedule for MAILER to run every 2 hours.  We can change it
whatever is needed, but for now, I thought 2 hours would be OK.  What I am
really interested in at this point is what are the alternatives?

   o  Can we add a field to ONTYME.DAT to indicate the frequency to check for
      ONTYME mail on a name by name basis?  This way it would only login to
      an account when asked...  I easily see wanting TXS.* to check every 2-4
      hours, and FSC.* (for me anyway) every 24 hours or even once a week.

    If there wasn't so much goings on about paying for this stuff it would be
fine the way it is.  We are even getting charged for cpu and disk storage for
the MAIL username (not to mention TYMNET traffic, for all the inter-host mail).


    Let me know what you think about the ONTYME.DAT frequency parameter, and
if we can live with MAILER running every 2 (or longer) hours.  I understand
that MAILER also kicks the other servers for MCAUTO into action (that's why
I set it at 2 hours instead of 4).

I got your note and agree that you people should be responsible for INIting
B39.  But how long should operations leave B39 down waiting for someone to
look at 2674 via DDT?  I mentioned using INI only if it is necessary to
get B39 back up quickly.

Is it possible to do an up-line dump of node 2674 to ELF or 33 via
gateway?  Right now, I don't think anyone has logged in to 2674 to determine
if slot 1 was stopped due to an ISIS error or a Dispatcher error.

By the way: Although we did generate new code for NW2674, it has never been
loaded.  We had scheduled using the new code, but due to a communications
mixup it was not loaded.  As far as I know, 2674 is running the same code
it always has.

Subject: Subtle solution 

After talking with Bill Soley today... we hit upon a solution that lets
MAILER run every 20 minutes (on system 29) and doesn't kick-start polling
our ONTYME mail each time.

  Remove our names from (MAIL:29)ONTYME.DAT
  ...actually modify them to allow sending, but not to poll.

This removes the 1500 logins per month.  To still receive mail, I've
setup a batch job to run once a day at 14:00 to pull our ontyme mail
to FSC.* and TXS.* on system 35.  To do this we run ONTMTP on system
35 once a day, and MAILER knows nothing of this.  ROUTER.DAT is unchanged.

The first pickup will be at 14:00 on Thursday.  The last pickup was at
16:20 on Wednesday.  If once a day is too infrequent, please let me know.
Osman and I agreed that once a day is enough for us.

/Carl

PS.  TXS.C/FLETCHER will still forward to FSC.C/FLETCHER (once a day)
     and FSC.C/FLETCHER will still NOT be polled at all, so whatever
     arrangements you (Craig) have with Karen will continue.

Subject: Nosey me 

Hello Bruce,
  I was working on a new display systat program and noticed that you were
running SAIL, so I took a quick nosey look (since I was surprised to see you
using SAIL) to see what you were doing.

  Did you know that there is a program on (SYS) called LOGON that reads 99%
of the things that you're doing with your init program from a parameter file
and does a few other things?

  (Not at the moment, but later) If you're interested, I can send you some
documentation and a how-to parameter file.  It's much nicer than what your
INIT file is doing.  [I've seen that INIT file before... Bill Soley wrote it
initially, 8 (or more) years ago].

Subject: X14's power supply went bad. 

Both 2020's, both bases, and both ADM3s lost power sometime this afternoon.
X17 was up but its base hadn't been reloaded.  X14 was down.  Attempting to
power it up produced a big blue spark as the circuit breaker tripped.  Then
I saw Chuck's note in the log saying that a new power supply for X14 is
expected tomorrow.  X17 keeps dying with PAR ERR - its power supply may
need adjusting too.  It stayed up long enough to load 6657 but not 6760.

Subject: SENDMAIL 

Since SENDMAIL replaced the RPG SEND command, I've been getting alot of
mail appearently due to people saying "SEND MAIL" in stead of "SENDMAIL".
I just released a new version of SENDMAIL which (0.2) checks for the first
name being MAIL and prints a little message explaining the correct syntax.
The new version also fixes a bug in the @filename feature and includes a
simple help message in response to "SEND HELP" and "SEND ?".  I have just
copied it to (MAIL:29) and RDIST should take it from there.  It is pretty
well tested.  It also checks for message length and refuses > 100000 like
most of the other TUMS programs.  -Bill

Hi Carl -

Sure do remember.  Happy to see that there are a few other die hards around.
I am aware of your program, and it does seem better.  I have used it in the
past.  I assume you are refering to the one that uses "SWITCH.INI".  I keep
meaning to use SAIL more.  Would if I where more involed with the PDP-10s
these days.  I hae been writing proposals, running cables uder floors, 
playing sailsman, supporting ANZ bank here in Australia, and writing
accounting software in C (among other things).  I don't mind the snooping
but most of what I do is probably pretty boring.  By the way, I have a nice
editor for the PC.  It is a distant relative of EMACS/JOVE, but has quite a few
enhanced features.  If you are interested I will get a copy to you.  Hope
that you are doing well.  Anyway, I have to get back to work...

o  X14 is back up with the same P/S.  Spare P/S would not work at all.
   So, Chuck put back the old one and made it work some how.  Base

Subject: suggestion for a PDP-10 utility. 

Carl,

  HI!  I'm writing this using 'vi' on one of the Suns.  I'm learning vi.

  My idea is this:  a little program which does what CLS does under MS-DOS.
This program would read the terminal type info (as do PEAK and SY), and then
send the appropriate escape sequence to clear the screen.  The Suns have just
such a utility, and I like it.  I don't recommend using the Sun name for it
('clear'), however, since (SYS)CLEAR is the program used by operators to 
"clear" their sys mail and OPER jobs.  I like 'CLS' for a name.

  I like and use the SUN's 'clear' utility a lot.  I have created the alias
'cls' to run it.  I have (and probably got from you or Joe) a little program 
for the 10's which sends the escape sequence to clear the Rainbow's screen.  
I have it in my directories as CLS.  I use it a lot, when I'm on the Rainbow.  
On the 444's I use the 'function' keys to clear the screen and display memory.
I believe a 3-char 'command' would be easier to remember and to type than:
(1.) left-up arrow; (2.) shifted roll/down-arrow.  (I'm a touch typist.)

D.

Paul Krumviede (who has a cubicle next to mine in building F) was talking
about upgrading F38's base to the latest version of ISIS and node code.
Something about the old node code being a bottleneck - the maximum amount
of data going thru the base was limited by inefficiencies in node code, not
by the number of sync (or SIO) lines.

The only differences were to add a 1000(8) word buffer and code which
calls 2 new tiny routines to put things into this buffer.  I find it hard to
believe that 1 page+ a little overflowed the monitor size.  Did I have

  I looked at the .PAT files and it appears that DMON.PAT has -1-2-3 and

than (M33:32/33)DMON.PAT, so I suspect that IMEPAR.PAT may also suffer

  Please apply the patches from the correct DMON.PAT and IMEPAR.PAT and
change TTYZNE to S$DEBUG and send us mail.

  (M33:39)NEWMON.SAV is a copy of (M33:39)39N35D.SAV, ready to be patched.

To isolate and/or fix the problem B39 is having, these are
suggestive steps to take.

o  Most of the system crashes in last 2 weeks always started
   with TTYZNE event stopcode, follewed by some number of BASE
   event stopcodes and than crashed with some kind of STOP 
   stopcode.  To find out more information about the crashes, 
   made the TTYZNE a STOP stopcode and monitor should goto
   BOOTS when it detects it.  A crash dump should be taken to 
   be  analized.

o  B39's Base code should be tested running with the same
   base code as the rest of the systems, which is:
   Node code version 5.10
   ISIS code version 7.01
   to see if B39 will run as well as the other PDP10s.

o  Put diagnostic patch in monitor to save I/O ring messages 
   between the Base and the PDP10 to find out the message sequences 
   just prior to crash.

o  Run one of the Fremont D. C. hosts with the same base code
   version as B39:
   Node code version: 5.22
   ISIS code version: 7.03
   to see if it will experience the same problem as B39 is having.

we see FILAMO or FILAUU ...  (FILAUU says ATB: Private pages for frame 985)
I forsee this as significant information but I don't know what Joe is trying

Subject: Strange zaps on MUX thru gateway. 

Around 11:20am today, my circuit to B39 got zapped.  I had logged in from
the MUX on host 2096 to username BUBB to JMS:39.  When I trie to login again,
the gateway said that host 39 was down.  However, when I tried 5 minutes later,
I got thru and the system had been up for 20 hours.  There were not a bunch
of detached jobs; the base had not crashed and the host had not crashed.
Osman had the same experience - for a short period of time he could not log
into 39 from the gateway, but people in Bubbnet had no problems.

Around 5:30pm, I was again zapped from the mux and could not get back for a
while.  When I did get thru, my previous job was still logged in and had a
port (it was not detached).  
SYSTAT said "4067(n1B3)" for both jobs, which is public net host 5981.
It looks like the portion of my circuit between the mux and the gateway got
zapped, but the portion between the gateway and system 39 was not.

Has anyone else reported similar problems?  Who should be notified?

Subject: (SYS:39)CRA015 is a TTYZNE crash. 

Login request (message type 6) received on port 172.
LDBLOG is 200000,,0 which means not logged in, zap in progress.
L2LOWT is set meaning SCNSER is waiting for orange ball to come back before
releasing the zapper.  L2LOWS is set meaning that L2LOWT has been on for 10
seconds (zapper will be unleashed if no orange ball within another 10 seconds).

This one might be SCNSER's fault.  I find it strange that the rest of LDBLOG is
all zero.  If the base thinks that particular port is not in use, it probably
will ignore the yellow ball instead of reflecting an orange ball.  Since the
base thinks the port is not in use, it is quite reasonable to send a login
request on that line.  The 68000 gets upset when we zap its login request.
I haven't checked to see what SCNSER does with the rest of the login request
(4 bytes of node id, 12 chars user name).  If it sends zaps for every one
of those bytes, I wouldn't blame the base for getting upset.  The 20 second
delay between yellow ball and zapper send by SCNSER is consistent with the
CTYLOG on CRA003.
  16:19:29 Something makes SCNSER think it should send a zapper on port 71.
           It sends a yellow ball first, starts the 20 second timer.
  16:19:32 Base wants to use port 71 for an aux circuit.  TTYZNE stopcode.
  16:19:49 Orange ball timer expires, SCNSER sends zapper.
  16:19:49 INFO stopcode BASE, Key=354.
  16:19:57 Stopcode IME (probably due to loop in TTYBMT output).

We should modify SCNSER to allow incoming logins to quietly cancel pending
zappers.  As long as the sign bit in LDBLOG is off, it make more sense to
take the base's word for it that the port is available to be re-used.  /Joe

Any FRMOP that accesses another job has to map the other job's context pages
into %UPX.  This access increments the use count stored in the other job's
dummy ATB (since context pages and private pages use the same ATB).
Therefore, the FRMOP that reads UPTLOG (as opposed to GETTABing LDBLOG) causes
the shared count of the target's job to be temporarily incremented.  If there
is a bug that doesn't decrement the count when the UUO finishes, then you
should be able to crash the system consistantly by simply doing that one
FRMOP to 2 or more different jobs until the field overflows.

Subject: Loop found in ISIS to 68K initialization. 

Paul Krumviede found a bug in ISIS where it sends the wrong command to the IPI
(68000 board) whenever slot 1 crashes.
1) Something goes wrong, ISIS crashes slot 1.  IPI sends KEY=354 to host.
2) Because CRASTOP is not set, ISIS does not stop on the crash, and instead
   tries to restart the slot.
3) Slot 1 executes SVC SYS,CONIP to connect to the IPI.
4) The kernel checks to see if the requesting slot was started as a result of
   a startup command or a crash restart condition.
5) Seeing that it is not an 'E' command from DDT, the kernel tells the IPI
   to reload itself.
6) The IPI sees the message to reload, doesn't recognize it, sends 354 to the
   PDP-10 and sends "I give up" to the Kernel, which crashes slot 1 again.
7) Go back to step 2, repeat every 4 seconds.

The original problem that caused step 1 is still unknown.  Any data about it
has been wiped out.  Dave Smith agrees this is a bug in the ISIS kernel.
Paul is trying a hack to the IPI code so it responds to message to reload
itself.

Subject: B39-P035/D-6 in NEWMON. 

Patch #6 (TTYZAP.PAT) has been tested on X32 and applied to (M33:39)39N35D.
It is in NEWMON as B39-P035/D-6 and is ready to be loaded.
Patch #6 tests if TTYZAP has been asked to send a zapper to a not-logged-in 
port.  If so, it outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 with the job # and program
name, then goes ahead and sends the zapper without a yellow ball.  This way
we can determine if a program running on B39 is causing the problem.

To refresh your memory: B39-P035/D-6 and X32-P035/D-6 both include the SCNSER
log of IRING/ORING traffic and treat TTYZNE as a DEBUG stopcode (which goes
to BOOTS on B39).

Paul will build new node code for BB2674 that will halt the Engine when the
slot crashes so that a dump of the Dispatcher rings can be made on hardcopy.
Operations should force 39 to take a dump when the Engine halts so that
SCNSER's rings and slot 1's rings can be compared.

Subject: Annoyance: Zappers send when INITIA detaches. 

TTYZAP.PAT outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 whenever SCNSER tries to send a
zapper to a port that is not logged in.  The idea is to catch programs
doing that.  Well, the patch has already caught one program, but not the
right one.

Whenever a program issues the ATTACH uuo with an argument of -1, the frame
is detached from its line.  If it is already detached, not thing happens.
If there is an LDB, SCNSER sends a zapper to that port.  The lines that
run INITIA at startup are a bit strange.  These TTYs have LDBs but to not
have TYMNET ports.  At system startup, 6 TTYZP1 stopcodes are output when
INITIA detaches from TTY0 thru TTY5.

We may have to live with this unwanted typeout until the real guilty
program makes its presence known.  It is my feeling that some program
which runs on B39 only is causing SCNSER to send bad data to the base and
the Dispatcher crashes the slot when it gets the bad data.  The bad data
is probably a legitimate message that is not allowed under certain conditions
(such as while the port is in the middle of logging in).

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, (415)498-2588, System 30
Problem:  System 30 is moving to the drives system 32 has been running on.
          X32's monitor sees BPA0-7, BPA10-17, BPB0-7 as being present,
          BPB10-17 as unit error, BPC off-line.  That matches the hardware.
          F30's monitor sees BPA0-17 then hangs.  B39's monitor does the same.
Fix:      12:54/Joe Created KONEND.PAT and applied it to (SYS:30)NEWMON.SAV.


The patch was lifted straight out of CPXKON.MAC and is now part of BPXKON.MAC

Subject: What happened to SCNSER? 

On System 33, there is no SCNSER.MAC....

I presume this means "all is lost" and we cannot build a monitor...

Actually, I presume this means it will simply not work in it's present state
and that Joe (?) is in the middle of doing something to it.  However, this is
not good... there should at least be a .MAC which was the last "good" .MAC
file for all of the source modules.

Please decide what would be the best .MAC file so that things which search the
monitor sources will not beak when something is missing (broken).  Thanks!

SCNSER.MAC exists on X32 and was in the process of being TELECOpied to F33
when X32 was taken down (for F30 swap).  Renaming SCNSER.D05 to SCNSER.MAC
would have worked, however the correct version has been copied over now.

Joe,
  Ron and I were a bit curious about the simultaneous crashes of the PDP-10s
in Dallas, and noticed that the base on all the machines that were crashed
by the EBUS had been up a bit over 41 days, which is about the resolution of
31 bits of FASTC.  It looks like the half-second logic in the EBUS saw that
FASTC wrapped, and we then got bit by the nature of signed arithmetic on a
68010.  The EBUS decided that a half-second had passed, looked for a key,
etc.  I guess I should change the branch to something other than BLT...
  I hope this resolves the problem.  Ron commented that this was real
familiar.  So we can get about 41 days 10 hours 12 minutes 20 seconds on
a base.

I had wondered about FASTC overflowing, but did not pursue it.
Friday must have been 41 days after the last power failure.

The following is a list of FSC Internal Ids valid on F-40, which is   
scheduled to shutdown on June 30, 1988. 
     
Many of the ids are only valid on F-40. If they are needed on an 
IBM host, please let me know by May 20th, so that I can validate 
their id's on D-43. On June 3rd, I will then move files for them.
If there are id's that are not needed, please let me know by May 
20th, too. I will remove them from F-40 on that date, or as I    
receive them.  
     
Ids that are valid on other IBM hosts, are responsible for moving
their files to the alternate host by the closing of June 30th.   
If more storage is required to accomodate F-40 files, please call me  
for more resources. 
     
Our IBM hosts (D43) already running successfully on CP Version 4.2    
and (D47) expected to run on CP Version 4.2 beginning on May 7th,
is different from F40, which is running on CP Version 3.2. If you
want to test your application against 4.2, please let me know right   
away. I will setup your id for the test on D43 (if you are not already
there).

How do you change the budget?  (SYS)NONAME and (FTSYS)NONAME show a budget

read and written and block-i/o usage.

Please DO NOT log this job out.  It should be running whenever the system is
up for normal timesharing in order to monitor system performance.  At present
a snapshot is taken every 15 minutes and recorded.  (If the sample rate needs
to be adjusted, please let me know and I will change the program.)

MCAUTO.Q has been taken care of.  I created a TECO-macro called SPLIT.TEC.
Using "MUNG SPLIT,MCAUTO.Q" produced MAILQ.100 thru MAILQ.348 - where each
message was stored in a seperate file.  I then used FINDIT to get a list
of the file names with their checksums.  Using the list sorted by checksums
I deleted all names from the list that had a duplicate checksum.  (For the
most part, only the messages from Office-8 showed up.)  The resultant CMD
file was given to "COPY @MAILQ.CMD" to append all the good messages together.
(Did you know the limit to "COPY 1+2+3+...+63,SUM" has a limit of 64 files?)
The end result was a new MCAUTO.Q that was 109 pages long, which was
processed with no further problems.  MAILQ.### and the old 1511 page MCAUTO.Q
have been deleted.

We have had similar problems twice before.  SMTP needs a command that will
refuse all mail from a particular host, giving it an error code that the
SMTP interface is temporarily out of service.

Joe - sorry the Tumsgate seems stressed.  My view is that I am not getting 
useable feedback from something.  Either Augment, or Tumsgate. I certainly 
never get any feedback from Profs.  The messages are representative of the 
reports we are distributing electronically and it is valuable to see if they 
make it completely in a useable form.

Is this the new Sun based Tumsgate?  If so, does that mean you are checking 
things out also?  We would treat it more delicately if we thought you were also
testing new stuff.  Too many variables at one time.

Thanks for your response to us.      Dave Carter
------------------------------------------------------------------

The TUMS gateway is system F29, a PDP-10 approximately 100 feet south of
Office-1 in Solar way.  Since Bill Soley has gone to the Turbo-Engine project,
the TUMS mail system is under the TYMCOM-X Support Group.  The TUMS gateway
has not changed for over 2 years.

I got involved when I notice that username MAIL was chewing up an inordinate
amount of CPU time.  There appeared to be two problems.
  1) The message was truncated, in that TUMS did not get the End-Of-Message
     indicator.  The log shows "time out waiting for command".  This is
     most likely a bug in the SMTP program on Office-8 because logged in
     another circuit and resent the entire message immediately.
  2) The message had no blank lines, and the body got smushed up into
     the header.
Problem #1 created a message queue that was 1511 disk pages long.  It
contained about 100 copies of 3 slightly different messages.  The only
difference was the subject: "Testing TUMS format with quick body" or something
to that effect.  When I sent the "please use smaller messages for testing"
message, I was under the assumption that TDC and/or YOUNG was repeatedly
sending messages manualy.  If Office-8 hadn't timed out or did not try to
resend the messages, there wouldn't have been a problem.

As a side note: I did see two copies of the message that did go out OK.
I believe it was 9 pages long and had lots of blank lines.  Sorry, I did not
take notice of the sender or recipient.

Subject: crufty string garbage-collect fix 

Bill,

  As per the ill-mem-ref we see from time to time in SAIL string garbage-
collect... I found that in my new SETOP it dies after calling the routine
%ARRSRT inside the GC cycle.  This is where it is supposed to be tracing
down STRING-ARRAYs to see what is in use etc. (I guess?)

anyway, the code assumes that register F is setup and at %ARRSRT the setup
code is commented out in the sources and later on it loops back to get the
next item using  "HLRZ 6,1(12)" at label %ARRS1 which happens to also be
%ARRSRT due to the commented out instruction.

I tried a DDT patch to setup F (F=12) then fall into the right code, but
the error still occurs.

I finally put "POPJ P," in %ARRSRT and the symptom of dying with an ill-mem-
ref went away.  To this end, I have a little subroutine called FIXSGC on
my directory which does:

              PUSH P, .+2
	      POP  P, %ARRSRT
              POPJ P,

It doesn't really fix the GC problem but I thought that you might like to
try this in your code which dies in the string GC to see if it will stop
the >explosions<.

Subject: UPDUFD.PAT created to try to solve UFDER1 crashes on F29. 

It looks like the MAIL programs were trying to set the "dumped" bit on a
file that was marked for deletion.  The code in FILUUO:CLOSIN at CLOSRN
says to jump to CLSIN2 only if no one else is reading the file and the
file is NOT marked for deletion.  The crash shows that the ATB got marked
for deletion between the time it took to get from UPDUFD+0 to UPDUFD+14.
Since that section takes two page faults, there was time for this to occur.

Scenario:
1) Job 1 runs ONTYME or SMTPX or other MAIL program that creates *.FEM file.
2) Job 1 does a CLOSE trying to set the dumped bit (so that TITO won't store
   the FEM file to tape).  At the time, no other job is looking at the file.
3) While doing the CLOSE, job 1 gets a page fault while reading the RIB of
   the UFD and gets a page fault while reading the UFD data page.
4) While job 1 is waiting for disk I/O, jobs 2 deletes the file.
5) Job 2 lucks out, finds the UFD data before job 1 gets a chance to run, and
   the monitor removes the FEM file from the UFD data page.
6) Job 2 finally gets a chance to read the UFD data page, can't find the
   file (because it was deleted).   Crash with UFDER1.

Fix: Before calling DIRSRC to search the directory, make sure ATPDEL hasn't
     gotten set.

X32 is rebuild from ALL-FILES and BACKUP tapes.  All the files are up
to date and nothing is lost.  It is build on 4 pack, 3652 in pages.
After the rebuild and ASP dump was taken and all went OK.  Changed DSKTYP
to 3652 in CONF32.MAC and rebuild a X32-P035/D05 monitor.  System is up
and running with it.  I think we can consider this to be alfa testing for
F26's rebuild in pages on 5/28/88.

From South Bay Center, there is one 56Kb line to Nicholson Lane.
When we login to the Fremont hosts, the circuit goes to Nicholson then to
Fremont.  Execpt when that one 56Kb line is down.  Today, logins are going
from South Bay Center to Dallas, from Dallas to Nicholson Lane, from
Nicholson Lane to Fremont.   Wonderful, yes?

Subject: What's in OSP. 

Directory OSP has the production monitor only.  (No patch files, no patched
monitors.)  On each system, OSP has P035D.MEM, P035D.DOC, STOPCD.MEM, and the
appropriate ##035D.SAV file.  A backup copy of ##035D.SAV is also on (OSP:33)
and 33's duplicate is on (OSP:34).

DMON.PAT is in M33 on all systems and has all patches up thru #7 for UFDER1.

The ##035D.SAV file in M33 on all systems was created from (OSP)##035D.SAV
using DMON.PAT.  They have the "###-P035/D-7" monitor.

Example of use:

System 37 added a second string of 3652 disks in March.  
1) Edit (M33:33)CONF37.MAC to add 2nd string, then "CPY CONF37.MAC/HOST:32".
2) GFD to OSP and run MONED1 there to create a new 37035D.SAV
3) TELECOPY from (OSP:33)37035D.SAV to (OSP:37)37035D.SAV
4) Login to 37 and apply DMON patches:
   GET (OSP)37035D
   DDT
   ^Y (M33)DMON.PAT
   SAVE (M33)37035D

To repeat: OSP has the virgin, unpatched monitor.  M33 has patches.

------------------------------------------------------------------------   
     
     
     
In two weeks, I will be moving your accounts from F40 to D43. The move
will begin at 5pm pdt on June 3rd. 
     
A previous memo was sent to you on May 4th, listing all users found   
on F40. Several ids were found valid on a Dallas IBM host. These users
are responsible for moving their own files to Dallas. A memo regarding
information to transfer files to Dallas was sent on May 10th.    
     
Again, here is the list of userids that I will be moving to D-47:
     
MAINTFSC  
ABELE
AGTDMS    
CSS1 
CSS10
CSS11
CSS5 
CSS6 
CSS7

JWILLOTT  
MIKEMO    
MSTRBRD   
NORTHRIP  
RBROWN    
SOLOMON   
SULRICH   
JCM  
     
And again, this is the list of userids that are responsible for moving
their files to Dallas by the closing of June 30th.
     
1213MGR   
OSMAN
TXSDOC    
ANVERM    
MOORING   
PKRUMV    
SALTYRON  
BUDGET    
     
And finally, this list contains users only valid on F-40 with one file:    
MAIL ADDRESS. These users will be removed from the move and will be   
removed from F40 on May 31, 1988:  
     
ARELLA    
FACILITY  
FSCLI
LAUVER    
WAGNERD   
WWPC 
WWPM 
BILLROD   
BROWNR    
CHINJEFF  
DBLISS    
GOLOBIC   
GUINASSO  
JGIUSTI   
KENNEDY   
KOLICZEW  
PATELN    
     
To ensure a smooth center-to-center customer move, the users that I am
moving must be FREE of bad files. If BAD FILES  are found on the day of    
the move, I will delete them from their directory.
     
Any users who have BATCH jobs, must be canceled on June 3rd and re-   
submitted on D-47.  
     
The users involved in this move, must be logged off at the time of the
move. This includes disconnect users. Any users found logged on when  
the move begins, will be messaged to log off within two minutes. After
a two minute lapse, the users will be forced off. 
     
If you have any questions, I can be reached at (415)498-2556.    
     
Thank you,
Jan

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Plans are being formulated to convert System 33 from a BLOCK
monitor to a PAGE monitor starting on 2 July.  This conversion needs
to be done by ALL-FILES and will take approximately FIVE (05) DAYS
to complete once started.  Converting to a PAGE monitor will increase
the file storage by eleven percent (11%) and will handle the READ ERRORS
more effectively.

The system will be unavailable from 0000, 2 July (PDT) until approximately
2400, 6 July (PDT).

If this timeframe is unacceptable, please give us an alternate
timeframe.

Please contact McDonnel Douglas, Fremont Operations at (415) 498-2595
or Ontyme IPC.R/DANIELS with your proposals by 10 June.

Wayne,
  Documenting has been slow...  I have a very preliminary, but summarily
complete document that provides user and internal information about SETOP.
I also have (atthe moment, un-integrated) a separate text that gives a few
examples of most of the commands.

  I'd like to give the document to you or to Barbara Victorino today (June 1,
1988) so that it can be reviewed.  I'll also provide an alpha-test version
of SETOP for the validations group to use to become familiar with the new
command format and to report any problems.

  Based on their comments, a beta-test version (of both the document and
the program will be made available, one week after I receive a full report
of their comments).

  Please send me TUMS mail indicating a time I can drop the document by your
office.  (We don't need a meeting, until you've had time to review it all).
I expect to be in the office after noon.

Where did req #13604 go?  It wasn't put back in the queue - I will have to
re-insert it instead of doing just a RERUN on it.		/Joe

During the past 18 months, the TYMCOM-10 Software Support Group, has
been a tremendous help in solving some long overdue problems on
these systems.

They have put in long hours to provide updated software for the
conversion of these systems from MEMOREX disk drives 3675's to 3650's
and 3652's; from BLOCK monitor to PAGE monitor; updated disk recovery
software; and numerous other software changes to improve the 
availability of these system for our customers.

The Fremont Data Center wishes to express our appreciation to:

     Craig FLETCHER

     Carl BALTRUNAS

     Osman GUVEN

                                                                Page  2

     Joe SMITH

for their untiring dedication, long hours and support for a smooth
transition during this period.

Subject: F30 problems & recovery 

Due to the apparent hardware problems with drive A1, it was not possible to
bring the system up for timesharing. The system was able to be brought up in
manual mode for disk inspection, however, none of the system files in (SYS)
were available.

I logged in "REFRESH MODE" and was able to run the disk reading programs and
disk repair programs (ASH and TSTSUP) from tape to determine the extent of the
damage to (SYS).  The retrieval block for [1,4].UFD contained garbage in
locations 131-777 which appeared to be UFD data.  Location 131 is the correct
word address for a UFD entry to start, so this confirms that somehow UFD data
was inadvertantly written into the RIB of the UFD instead of one of the UFD
data pages.  I cleared out the garbage data and fixed the pointers.

We also had read errors for the first BAT page and the third BOOT page.  I
copied the bad data for the BAT page to memory and corrected it.  After
rebooting the system, we ran ASP from tape to make an image copy of the bad
pack.  Then we restored the tape copy to a newly formatted pack.  All was
successful and the system came up with a FULL DSKCLN showing only 3 bad files.
Two of these were open when the system crashed and the third was caused by
a RIB error shortly before the first crash.

The message "BPB6 SECOND BAT BLOCK CONSISTANCY ERROR" was caused by the second
BAT page havinfg correct data which did not match the bad data from the first
BAT page.  This morning, I zeroed out the BAT page data to reflect running on
a newly formatted pack and this message should not occur anymore.

It is not completely certain that this was the only damage to the original
pack.  However, it was the only apparent damage to the file structure.  the
actions taken by the operations staff in taking the system down and calling
both hardware and software support was a significant aid in making the
successful recovery possible.

It's been pretty quiet around here since DPN week (as the "in" crowd here
refers to it. Hee hee.).  As for the change in gateways, Wisconson got tired of
supporting the BITNET-ARPANET gateway, and the dubious honor has fallen to N.Y.

As for your architectural/carpentry skills, I imagine they're pretty good.
Especially consindering you have the benefit of using (or consiously ignoring)
the knowledge on which your degree is based.  Anyway, I can imagine the place
from your description.  Sounds rather nice.

Me on the other hand...  I putter around.  A few years ago I found huge old
phone spool (about 4' diam. x 3.5' high).  I got it into my head to turn it
into a table, so I sanded it stained it with a mahogany stain, put some casters
on it, cut a door in the side, and replaced the bolts holding it together.
I thought it was going to be a cheap piece of furniture.  Boy, was I wrong!
(I had to buy the tools as well as the parts.)  But once I had made the inital
investment on one, I found 3 other spools.  They are considerably smaller, and
less expensive since I have the tools.  They've come out pretty good so far.  I
finished two, and the other two wait for a rainy year.  I'd like to take a
woodworking class somewhere in the future.

Work for me consists mostly of avoiding work.  I'm very good at it.  I've been
doing some small tutorials here and there.  I'm practically evangelical when it
comes to E-mail.  "Throw out your TDD's" cries the voice in the wilderness, "E-
mail is goodness, truth and light!"

As for BIGCAL, I don't know how much messing you do with the VAX, but I'm
thinking of converting it to C and incorporating some of Screen Management
routines provided by the VAX.  Provided (A) I have time, (B) I have the
motivation and (C) I can get my hands on the source...  Computer Center has all
that stuff under lock and key (as well as the stuff I and others have left
behind).  I still dislike the VAX.  Not as much as I dislike IBM, but enough to
make mw wish for the DEC-10.

Lastly, California...  I talk a lot, but I'm trying to save every penny for
school.  So, I don't know how soon I'd actually make the trip.  At some point
I will definitely want to get away from it all and head west.  I now know
several people I can freeload off of.  And they're welcome here in Brain-
Washingtron, D.C. provided that neatness is NOT a criteria of theirs.  The
invite extends to you as well.  (Considering that you once had a car in your
living room, I figure you can wade through the papers here, without complaining
too much.  Hee hee.)

Anyway, t'was good hearing from you, and thanx for the permission.

P.S.  Seen or read any good science fiction lately?  I just finished the Julian
      May saga (4 books). Liked it.  Saw "Willow" -- so-so.  Now I'm hunting
      for a good read again.

The following messages were found in "JZ(!.FEM" dated 28-Apr and "CA(!.FEM"
dated 13-Jun.  If TUMS dies for any reason (such as Illegal Memory Reference
or SAIL String Garbage Collect Error), it often leaves behind a *.FEM temp
file.  The way to recover is to recover is:
        DIR *.FEM
        RENAME *.FEM,MAIL.
        TUMS
        EXIT
If there are more than 2 *.FEM files, repeat the above procedure until they
are all taken care of.

Carl and Soley tell me the problem is in the way SAIL does its garbage
collection, which is part of the SAIL runtime routines.  It doesn't look like
this bug will ever be given the priority needed to fix it.

Paul noticed that the TYM files on F33 for nodes 6720 and 6415 were over a
year out-of-date.  In fact, the BND file for 6415 was also wrong.

When I added the changes to the TYM files, I assumed that TYMNET was keeping
the backup directory of (TYM5:33) up to date with the primary directory on
(TYM5:54).  (EBUS)NW6720.BND and (EBUS)NW6415.BND have been updated on
all three systems.

RIck, Bill... 
  1400 Wednesday is fine.  We should try to keep it short.

I'll call you if I'm going to be late or anything like that.  I'll be at
Nicholson lane in the morning for awhile, so if you need to get ahold of me,
then feel freee to beep me... (I'm on call: 408-977-7960)

Rick,
  Yes... I know... Craig's last two memos said to call DISPATCH or the
secretary.  One of the previous ones published the group pager number and
since that time, the method of contacting software support has depended
on who contacted us.

  As per our conversation, we have no problem with contacting us via the
group pager number, however that puts the burden on you (operations) to
call us back if there is no answer.  If you call DISPATCH, then they are
supposed to worry about getting us to respond.

  Next week, when OSMAN returns we will go through the motions to get all
the systems straight in the dispatch database.  We may even re-enter them
using the CPU serial numbers.  I'll keep you posted about when that is
complete.  ...and we can bring it up in the change control meetings as soon
as everything is in place.

Need an answer on the following as soon as possible.

When Operators are using TAKEIT to take a system down for ASP dumps,
they are using deposit 1 in 30 in most cases when they get the message
"?can't halt frame with JACCT: job 2, user OPER <CHKPNT> RN".
Usually, they art at a -7 or -10 before entering the 1 in 30.

Need clarification about HDEV, HDAT, SATFAILS, RIBS,
and THUNGS reported when running PSP on 3330's and 3350's.

ON 3330'S
---------

Are all of a serious nature that a FULL  disk clean should be
run before and after an ASP Dump?

At other times, if it can wait, should the system be scheduled
down for a FULL disk clean?

ON 3350'S
---------

Do we need to be concerned about HDEV errors and THUNGS?

If SATFAILS, HDAT, and RIBS show on the PSP, should a FULL
disk clean be run before and after ASP dump?

There seems to be a misunderstanding here on the above and I
want to get the correct information out about it.

Subject: Hello! 

Hi!
  You will have gotten this by the time I come to the office
and have time to call you.  I just thought that I'd give you
some advance warning so you can prepare any info you need.

I talked to the people in St. Louis and they are interested in putting
the CUA accounting system on their KL.  I am told they have TOPS-10 7.01A
(not 7.01 as I said earlier: they left the name as 7.01 so their users
wouldn't know there were any differences).  If this is mis-information I
will have determined what I'll need by the time you have to send me any
tapes or what-not.

I need the correct price (assuming $2500 was an estimate), and I guess
whatever materials you send to prospective customers about the package and
what changes need to be made to the system (so I can estimate installation
time).  Chances are, I and/or Joe Smith will do the installation.

I will be writing a time proposal based on the info you give me.  The people
in St. Louis will evaluate my proposal with their plans to provide KL-10
service past the end of the year.  If all is accepted, I will let you know
and we will purchase the accounting system as expected.

Information I can give you about the system and software versions are:

    GATEWAY DEC1/7.01 system 1300  (system is in St. Louis)
    BATCON %102(2067)-4		DAEMON %20(757)-4
    LOGIN  %61(751)-4		LOGOUT %102(2027)-4
    LPTSPL %102(2263)-4		OMOUNT %27(205)-4
    OPSER  %5D(116)-4		QUEUE  %2A(100072)-1
    SPROUT %2(2116)-2		UMOUNT %26A(103)-4


If there is anything else you need... try sending me mail (or reply to this
message).  I will be giving you a call around 3:00 PM EDT when our weekly
staff meeting is over.



Sincerely,

An anecdote might make it clearer why write-only registers are a real problem,
if they share addresses with any other function.

This happened with an old DEC serial interface (DZ-11 I think),
and the PDP11/04.  The DZ-11 had a read-only input FIFO and a write-only output
register at the same address.  With most machines, this would cause no problems.
It required very careful coding to be sure that only READ accesses were used
to get data from the input register, and WRITE accesses to send to the output.

Unfortunately, in order to save some complexity in the 11/04 CPU, DEC had
made the MOV instruction ALWAYS READ ITS MEMORY DESTINATION.  This meant that
	MOV	Rn, OUTPUT_REGISTER
would first read (and discard!) the top of the input FIFO.

There was absolutely nothing that could be done to make this combination of
CPU and peripheral work.  We wound up junking 5 11/04s, which at the time cost
us some $50K in all, not to mention the time spent debugging mysterious lost
input characters.

As I seem to like to dredge up ancient history in this forum, these
thoughts sent me to my dusty closet of 'olde stuff' to fetch volume
1 (I also have V2) of a collection of papers produced by DEC called
"PDP-10 Applications in Science".
I think that I got this sometime in 1970, though most of the papers
seem to be from around 1967-1968.
The third paper in the book is

"Selecting and Evaluating a Medium Scale Computer System"
"A Study Undertaken for Louisiana State University at New Orleans"
by Jon A. Stewart, Director, LSUNO Computer Research Center

The paper is a summary of an in-depth comparison of three major
systems of the time; the SDS Sigma-5, the IBM 360/44, and the
DEC PDP-10. The paper is very fine at bringing back the memories
of the good old days, but of most interest to this discussion is
an appendix containing compiler-generated code for a simple
fortran benchmark.

The upshot was that the PDP-10 generated much shorter code,
that also ran faster. (I can publish a sample if there is
enough interest.)

While this paper drew no architectural conclusions (such as
are discussed in this forum) the main reason (if I
remember my DEC Propaganda of the day) was the very orthogonal
instruction set as opposed to a smaller number of instructions.

This clean and complete instruction set allowed the compiler
to use a large percentage of the instruction set. While I believe
that the clean instruction set came first, and the compiler
that used the large percentage of that instruction set came later,
rather than the current risc idea of profiling code to determine what
will be in the instruction set, it was a haunting hint of where
we would be today.

I recall seeing published statements about how many of the KA-10's
366 instructions were actually used by the FORTRAN compiler.
Does anyone still have these numbers??

I also have some DEC Propaganda from about 1973 bragging about
the optimization done by DEC FORTRAN. This includes examples
of generated code. Again, if anyone is interested...

somehow mangling the byte pointer which initially points into page 777 and
in adjusting it to point to the right offset (using a subtract) the byte ptr
becomes ['10677,,-1].  The illmem ref appears when LDB 11,PTR is executed
and PTR contains the value in brackets above.

Don't ask me... but I think an illmem ref for 310000 or 50533 is out-to-lunch.
Someone has gotten the wrong info from somewhare.

Joe: any ideas?  Osman:  Isn't this strange behavior for hte hardware?
Any: Am I missing something rather obvious?

Need an answer on the following as soon as possible.

When Operators are using TAKEIT to take a system down for ASP dumps,
they are using deposit 1 in 30 in most cases when they get the message
"?can't halt frame with JACCT: job 2, user OPER <CHKPNT> RN".
Usually, they art at a -7 or -10 before entering the 1 in 30.

What I want to know is:

Is it a good practice to deposit 1 in 30?

How long should thy wait for this job to be HUNG?

Why doesn't it HANG JACCT within a reasonable amount of time?

Thanks Rick

Need clarification about HDEV, HDAT, SATFAILS, RIBS,
and THUNGS reported when running PSP on 3330's and 3350's.

ON 3330'S
---------

Are all of a serious nature that a FULL  disk clean should be
run before and after an ASP Dump?

At other times, if it can wait, should the system be scheduled
down for a FULL disk clean?

ON 3350'S
---------

Do we need to be concerned about HDEV errors and THUNGS?

If SATFAILS, HDAT, and RIBS show on the PSP, should a FULL
disk clean be run before and after ASP dump?

There seems to be a misunderstanding here on the above and I
want to get the correct information out about it.

Untill we come up with a fix in TAKEIT it is OK to deposit 1 in 30.
Should waite 5 mins before doing deposit 1 in 30.

SUBJECT>   Checking NODE CODE Loads


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On the TYMCOM-10's there is a utility  that identifies date and time,
slot, user and directory that a specified  file(s) was accessed on the
TYMCOM-10 currently logged into.

For example, I want to know when anyone loaded node or slot code for 
node 2430.  The output of this request and the full session is listed below.
The program is FIND.SAV.  To execute it, you must log into the system
you suspect the code was loaded from.  The code and documentation is located
in the SPL directory.

The following is the node 2430 session example:

R (SPL)FIND

Target 1:  2430.      For all occurrances of "2430." in my specified file.
                      Be sure to put a 'period' after the number.

Target 2: <cr>        At this point, more search strings could be entered
                      but this is all I'm interested in.  Also, rather than
                      2430 as a string, I entered 2430. to capture all
                      occurrances of ##2430.* and also avoid capturing
                      other loads that happened to be done where the time
                                                                Page  2

                      stamp had the string 2430 in it.

search in: .R         This is where all commands are entered.  ".R" to
                      file all lines containing "2430." in them.

Recording file: RICK.TMP      This is my file name.

search in: (SYS)LOADII.ACC     Search for "2430." in file (SYS)LOADII.ACC.

(SYS)LOADII.ACC: 1 (14)       Target 1 found 14 times.

search in: .Q         At this point, more command could be entered like ".T"
                      to enter new targets, etc.  ".Q" entered to close
                      file RICK.TMP and end the session.

The following is the file RICK.TMP and the format is the following:

File name that was searched:

DATE ! START TIME ! STOP-TIME ! ? ! SLOT ! LOADII-CMD ! SUCCESS !
USERNAME ! FILE-NAME ! NEIGHBOR ! LINE-# ! NETWORD ! ? ! ? !TARGET #) !
"STRING" ! # OF MATCHES

***********************************************************************

(SYS)LOADII.ACC

(PAGE 1)...
110485 155656 16 1 1        LD OK OPER  (TYMNET)ND2430.`BND 2355 1

************************************************************************

To obtain the above file, enter TYP RICK.TMP on terminal.

This could be useful for resolving erroneous code load problems, etc,
and can be tailored by inputing the appropriate search string.

This only lets you know if the code was loaded from the right directory
with the correct filename.  It does not tell you what version was loaded.

The output on the CTTY when the code is loaded should report the current
version loaded.

Subject: Re: NETID on CREAUX. 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 24 Jun 88 21:36:41 PDT

Joe,
  I think we should define a new message so that maybe things will work with
mismatched code.
  The node-code uses a 16 bit field for NETID, but I'm not sure how many new
nets will want to have this done... We currently don't even require 8 bits for
NETID.
  You suggested sending aux crq requests to the originating node-code for the
port if the AUXNETID is zero.  Is the port send from the monitor to the EBUS
as part of the aux circuit request the ISIS port number for the command port?
Is it possible that one could get a zero AUXNETID and a zero port number?  We
may have to define a default NETID (I guess whatever is in slot 0?) to cover
this case...

The bug in the SYSDATa program has been fixed!!! So, the CTYLOG output is
again being collected on all systems [except 32 which has been down].

Joe: By re-arranging the order of a couple of operations, everything now
     works as intended.  The problem was caused whenever data was added~
     to the log and the previous data ended exactly on a page boundary.

The new version is %2(17) and is installed on (SRA) on all systems except
the test system :32.  WHen 32 comes up, I will copy it over.

Yes, it is a very good idea as to not to refer to X32 as "SPARE"
system.  SPARE has the connotation of being dispensable which
I don't like our system being refered to.

By the way, Joe tested the 41 day crash on the base successfully.

o  Please go ahead and load Dallas's Bases whenever the systems come
   down next time.  Base codes are located on systems 25, 54 and 33.
   User name is (EBUS), file name NWxxxx.BND.

   Fremont D.C. has been running with the "NEW BASE CODE" successfully and
   without any problems.  Again, one of the important fixes in the new base
   code is: Prevention of host/base crashes when system has been up more
   than 41 days.

   If you have any problems with the new base code, please send mail indicating
   on what system it was not successful.


o  I am planning to be in Dallas Aug 2-4 to teach a seminar to "Operations"
   and "MDFSCO" and whoever else is interested in attending.

   The basic thrust of the seminar will be to go over the new and updated
   monitor functionality and some system utilities.

See you all soon.

	The "NEW EBUS BASE CODE" which has had a couple of fixes, has been
running in Fremont D. C. successfully.  Dallas D. C. will start running it
this week.  They are loading the bases from user name (EBUS) on systems
25, 54 and 33.  The base codes are named NWxxxx.BND.

	Process of releasing the Base Code officially is in progress with
the NTD people.

Subject: AI slides 

Craig,
  This is the first of 2 messages.  The next message contains each of
the individual pages that we discussed for the AI-Slides.  I put a extra
form feed at the beginning and end so that the entire file could be
loaded from ONTYME to Karin's PC so that she could make any changes
or simply print them, or insert them into the text of the slides she
has already prepared from your text.

I will try to be in between 9 and 10.  This message is primarily to
give you 99% of the foils prior to my arrival so that Karin can gather
them together for sending to Bill.

The remaining foils will be the copy of the actual flowchart and the
changes made to it... (in pencil?) and copied.

I also suggested to Bill K. that if we were going to Fed-Ex the hardcopy
to Irvine anyway... that maybe it would be a good idea to send all the
prepared foils (on an IBM floppy disk) so that they could modify them in
Irvine.  He thought it was a good idea.  He also said they could print
them on the laser printer and make nicer foils...

See you in the morning.

/Carl

PS.  There are more slides than we really need.  I punched them all in
     with various examples so that we wouldn't be typing them in if we
     decided later to use any of them.

Subject: F30's problem was an off-by-one bug in ONCE. 

EVASIZ has the highest unused address.  When EVACLR rounded it up to a page
boundary, it did so using a method that failed if EVASIZ just happened to
be on a page boundary.  In particular, the monitor asked for memory up to
and including address 744777, which made EVASIZ be 745000 (the first unused
location).  The old code using IORI T4,777 and ADDI T4,1 would round that
up to address 746000, instead of leaving it at 745000.  (A kludge to get
around the problem was to bump PATSIZ up by a couple of pages - incrementing
it by any number that was not a multiple of 145 did the trick.)  The file
EVACLR.PAT has been created, and added to DMON.PAT as patch #8.   /Joe

I just got around to sending mail.  Looks like mail form operations and
Joe finding the solution to F30 are all that is necessary.  Bravo!

PS. F30 is up with PATSIZ set to PAT+3000.  I didn't check to see if Joe
    changed it back when he fiddled with NEWMON on F30...?

Subject: Re: D31 downtime - UFD rebuild 


The problem on D31 today was that the RIB pointer for the (SYS) directory
was wiped out by a data page for some directory file.  The cause of this
catastrophe is unknown.

What transpired today was an educated re-creation of the initial RIB data
which contained pointers to all the "special" system files, in place of the
destroyed RIB page for the (SYS) directory.

After this step the system was reloaded several times in an effort to verify
that each step was complete and to restore as many critical files as would
fit on D31 with the limited disk space available.  An hour and a half was
lost getting DSKCLN to run to recover lost pages (after we ran out of disk
space).

After DSKCLN completed, I finished restoring the remainder of the missing
files for (SYS) from the most recent all-files tape.  Operations finished
the job by restoring the files from the 12 daily backup tapes and the
system was up for timesharing with everything restored.

I do not have the precise times for any of these events.  The system was
answered immediately after DSKCLN finished, then Operations shut the system
to begin restoring files from the backups and all-files.  When the all-files
and the 12th day backup was completed, the system was un-shut.  Operations
proceeded to restore day 11 through day 1 in reverse order as per my 
instructions.

Subject: re: D31 UFD rebuild 

Note:  I failed to mention this, but... the time spent re-constructing the
       (SYS) directory RIB and restoring the missing (SYS) files saved D31
       from having to do a full rebuild and prevented the loss of any work
       done between the time of the last daily backup and the time of the
       RIB failure.

Someone deleted username GAMES from all systems today.  I think X32 has

restored to X32 from the other systems's all files.   /Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To give system 39 more disk space, Fremont Data Center is planning
on converting it to a PAGE monitor the weekend of 6 - 7 August 1988.
Converting to a PAGE monitor from a BLOCK monitor picks up about 11%
of free pages on each unit.

While doing this conversion, system 39 will be unavailable for
approximately 48 hours.

Please discuss this with your Group/Users and let Fremont Data Center
know if this timeframe is acceptable.  It is is not, let the Center
know when it can be done.

Thanks

Subject: Dispatch wants us to close incidents. 

A typical call to Central Dispatch goes like this:
  o  The Data Center has a problem that may be software, they call Dispatch.
  o  Dispatch opens an incident number, pages us.
  o  We call Dispatch, get system number, this marks incident as answered.
  o  We look at problem, fix it, or tell them it's a hardware problem.
  o  Third Party Maintenance fixes the hardware, opens a new incident number,
     gives Dispatch a code number for what was replaced, closes the incident.
  o  Third Party happens to notice an open incidence number pertaining to
     the system they just fixed, and closes it for us.

We have been unaware of that last step.  If it is not done, a timer
automatically escalates it.  If the original incident was logged on Friday
evening, it may escalate to the Regional Manager by Monday morning.

To avoid this in the future, we need to be sure to get the incident number
when answering the page from Dispatch, and to call Dispatch back when we
are done working on the call.  The incident number needs to included in the
mail sent to MONITOR and included in (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG.

Reason for transmittal of code:
-------------------------------

This release (19-Jul-88) consists of patches to the 68K object code
only.  All changes are stored in EBUS02.O00 ('oh', 'zero', 'zero').

Fix problem with restarting after a Dispatcher crash.
The symptom was that the IPI would immediately crash when the
slot was restarted, causing the slot to crash again.  After
several repetitions, the 68010's stack would overflow and the
entire Engine would have to be reset.

Fix problem with the base zeroing out the PDP-10's ring pointers
when the base was restarted.

Fix problem with the base crashing the PDP-10 host for no
apparent reason 41 days and 10 hours after the node was loaded.

Jerry,

  Here is the AI project report that you asked me to send:



Project Title:  TYMCOM-X Stopcode Diagnosis (and Action)

Objective:      The main objective of this project is to determine the cause
                of the TYMCOM-X operating system shutdown from the stopcode
                messages printed on the system console.  A secondary objective
                is to prescribe the appropriate action to take to bring the
                system back to full optimum performance.

Categories:     Diagnosis, Planning, Repair

The July 11, 1988 issue of Federal Computer Week has an editorial
written by Fred Reed ("Ada: A View From the Field", page 19) which
supposedly presents both the pros and cons of Ada. The following
quotes are representative:

"What follows is one man's opinion, but it is an informed opinion --
he programs in Ada as well as C and other -- so I thought it was worth
passing along. We'll call him Bob because, Ada being a fairly sacred
cow, he didn't want to be named."

"... Ada has been called everybody's favorite 17 programming
languages." 

"Fewer programming errors. Among other features, Bob explained, Ada
has what are called strong typing and range checking. Strong typing
means that the programmer is forced to tell the computer the nature of
each piece of information he uses. This allows the machine to be sure
incompatible kinds of information are not mixed."

"Ada, said Bob, is well suited to being understood and maintained by
many programmers who will work on a large program over its lifetime.
This is why it saves money, he said."

"However, he noted, these strength also result in weaknesses. For
example, the programmer has to write extra code to do the strong
typing and range checking, and this, among other things, makes Ada
code slow to write."

"Further, because the program constantly has to check ranges and data
types as it runs, Ada produces much slower programs than some other
languages.

"An Ada program typically runs a tenth as fast as the same program in
C," said Bob. "I think we are seeing the bureaucratic attitude at its
ultimate. Ada is a prudent approa

ch to software. It is defintely
suboptimal in performance -- slow, bulky, verbose and slow to write.
But it is reliable and easy to work with after it is written. It is
safe. These are qualities prized by bureaucrats. DoD chose reliability
over performance."

     Osman, please note the attached Ontyme message from NIS (Japan).
 
     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Rick,
     
This morning on Japan, we have a problem about MAGNUM access on F74, maybe 
you know. I checked F-center on it and was respounded that it would be
followed at noon.   
Then, this afternoon, i tried and found some MAGNUM access was OK, however 
some MAGNUM access still have the problem. We, NIS,may be requested by
the Japanese users some conpensation about the problem, because adding
the current problem they have the big problem at the begin of this month.  
     
        1. NIS must explain about the problem to the customers.  
                What was happened on F74.    
                What was the cause.
           Please let me know it in detail.  
     
        2. Some user still has the problem. Some user can not use MAGNUM yet.   
           So please advise us how we can repaire it or what you can do for it. 
     
           Major usernames which is indicated messages from the system saying   
           the file was damaged.

           Especially, about MVX, it seems that the files on MAGNUM which  
           was not mentioned in the message was garbled. Simple command on 
           MAGNUM is NOT available. Please advise ASAP.
     
           I attached sample log of MVX access for your reference.    
     
NIS, and the customers want to repaire it by the next Monday morning. 
So please reply ASAP.

Tracking down MM interlock problems on an SMP system is very nasty.
I looked at it, and found nothing obvious.  My guess is that it will take
over a week of solid looking to find the problem, which will undoubtedly
require a change to the software to fix.  As I understand it, this would
exceed the amount of software support we have promised (if any) to this
customer.  I'll leave it at that.     /Joe

     Osman, please note the attached Ontyme message from NIS (Japan).
 
     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Subject   : F74 (MAGNUM) Problem   
            URGENT !!!

Rick,
     
This morning on Japan, we have a problem about MAGNUM access on F74, maybe 
you know. I checked F-center on it and was respounded that it would be
followed at noon.   
Then, this afternoon, i tried and found some MAGNUM access was OK, however 
some MAGNUM access still have the problem. We, NIS,may be requested by
the Japanese users some conpensation about the problem, because adding
the current problem they have the big problem at the begin of this month.  
     
        1. NIS must explain about the problem to the customers.  
                What was happened on F74.    
                What was the cause.
           Please let me know it in detail.  
     
        2. Some user still has the problem. Some user can not use MAGNUM yet.   
           So please advise us how we can repaire it or what you can do for it. 
     
           Major usernames which is indicated messages from the system saying   
           the file was damaged.   
     
                MMETAL   
                MVX 
                MPPC
                NETBILL  
     
           Especially, about MVX, it seems that the files on MAGNUM which  
           was not mentioned in the message was garbled. Simple command on 
           MAGNUM is NOT available. Please advise ASAP.
     
           I attached sample log of MVX access for your reference.    
     
NIS, and the customers want to repaire it by the next Monday morning. 
So please reply ASAP.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

24-Jul-88 13:00/Joe                     (Sunday)
Contact:  Fremont Operations, L T Smith, (415)498-2588, System 32
Dispatch: Called me at home, said they paged me twice with no response,
          however L T's page came thru (I was outdoors in Fremont at the time).
Problem:  X32 had  3 crashes after Lenny replaced some boards, an IME, a UIL,
          and PAGP3R.  System ran DSKCLN with no problems, died only while
          running diags (such as MEMEXR or XCORE).  Lenny wanted to know
          if this IME is the same as the previous ones.
Diagnosis:  IME caused when PC was set to the middle of CTYLOG.  There were
          no tracks as to how it got there.  The IME is not related to the
          SKIPLE J,.CPJOB problem this CPU was having earlier.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Debbie Hightower, (415)498-2588, System 32
Problem:  Lenny was running diagnostics, trying to reproduce the problem on
          CPU 1336 (B39).  The two-pack test system would fail, but diags
          wouldn't.  Between the time I was paged and when I answered,
          DDQCB failed on bit 27.  All he needed at this point is verification
          that it was the same bit that was set in the IME dumps.

     on a stand-alone system.  However, for the schema.discount, it is

     I hope these results help with your meeting in St. Louis.  At least
     you now have a clear procedure to follow to test PREMIUM when you
     return to France.

XEXEC isn't doing anything on D23.  It and EXECX are just sleeping - no
jobs have run since 18-Jul.  I tried attaching to XEXEC and restarting
it, but that didn't help.  Roy Roskilly's NETDB jobs aren't running.

        File access this Memo: (BETATEST)MEMO.962 
     
        Product Name:    E-BUS BASE FOR PDP-10    
        Code Version:   02.00        DATE:07/20/88
        Release Document:     (BASELINE)EBUS02.X00
        Release Description:  (BASELINE) NONE
        Modified Files:       (SOURCE)  
                                        EBUS02.O00   JOXRUW 
                                        EBUS02.W00   WEBSIR 
     
        Test Site Location(s): X32, all PDP-10 systems in Fremont Data Center   
     
        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
     
        Engine code now drives front panel.  
        Engine code now contains Operation Monitor.    
        68K code has been completely rewritten!   
        There now exists an ERS and an IMS for this product.
.    
        This release (19-Jul-88) consists of patches to the 68K object code
        only.  All changes are stored in EBUS02.O00 ('oh', 'zero', 'zero').
        The new checksum for EBUS02.O00 is JOXRUW.
.    
        Fix problem with restarting after a Dispatcher crash.    
        The symptom was that the IPI would immediately crash when the 
        slot was restarted, causing the slot to crash again.  After   
        several repetitions, the 68010's stack would overflow and the 
        entire Engine would have to be reset.
.    
        Fix problem with the base zeroing out the PDP-10's ring pointers   
        when the base was restarted.    
.    
        Fix problem with the base crashing the PDP-10 host for no
        apparent reason 41 days and 10 hours after the node was loaded.    
.    
        ================================================================   
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        This  code is now  available on  NTD's  system 39.   For Tymnet    
        release  date and system information,  contact  Tymnet  Quality    
        Assurance.  
     
        Testing  should  be coordinated with JOE SMITH

As of 27-Jul-88, the new (SOURCE)EBUS02.O00 is on D25, D54, and F33.
This means that if PI (Project Implementation) makes a new BND file for
any base, they will automatically get Krumviede's patches.

     Ogura-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding F74 file problems.
     Rick Daniels is not in office today, so I cannot obtain additional
     information at this time.
 
     I am unclear as to the reliability of F74 Disk drives this week.
     Hopefully Rick and/or Mike Bellopatrick can supply you with present
     status, if this problem has continued during recent days.
 
     For your information, I've not seen message A25087 from Mike.
 
     As I'm sure you realize, we do not have personnel here to analyze and
     solve Magnum problems.  If the issues relate to hardware, IPC Ops.
     can respond accordingly; if they involve Tymcom X software other
     than Magnum, the Tymcom X Support group can analyze and solve.
 
     Accordingly, I'm requesting that Rick supply you with an update on
     the present status of F74 hardware problems, as they may be responsi-
     ble for the problems you're experiencing.
 
     Regards. Ken

Ken san,
 
Thank you for your support on our service on F74.
 
Right now, NIS found some file problems on F74.
Please pass this OnTyme to appropriate person.
 
Flat file problem:
 
        From Jul's 25th evening to 26th evening in JST, files  (MPPC:74)
        SHOHI.A29 and/or SHOHI.X29 were garbled. They are the element of ISAM
        and I don't know which one (or both) is garbled. 
        Yesterday, the user who is the owner of the username MPPC pointed out
        that illegal figures appeared in their reports. So, NIS checked, found
        the problem, and could recovered.
        Now, NIS is requested to explain the cause of the problem by the user,
        because he know troubles on Jul, (04th, 06th, and 21st), and is afraid
        of reliability of our host.
        
        Please check and let me know what was happened.
 
MAGNUM problem:
 
        Kazuo Watanabe got the all files of MVX:74 at 18th JUl from the backup
        files of the Fremont center, and we found the MAGNUM error at the 
        execution of programs on the (restored) MAGNUM. From 18th to 20th Jul,
        we could execute the programs without problem every day.
        I attached the execution log with this OnTyme, so please check it.
        You can find the fatal MAGNUM error at the middle of the log.
 
        So the MAGNUM is seeemed to still have a problem. Please check and 
        advise me.
 
        Also, Mike Bellopatrick mentioned in his OnTyme #A25087 about the
        missing MAGNUM file on MVX:74, so please let me know what kind of file
        is missed, and it's id if possioble.  ######.M??    .... ?
 
Again MAGNUM problem:
 
        Today, we found a magnum text file P.REP01(exec level id is MG5WI9.ME2)
        of TYMPAS (the name of the schema) on NETBILL:74 was garbled without
        explicit file modification in past 2 weeks. About the file, no warning
        is indicated. Regarding the file, it is recoverble, however we are
        afraid that there are this kind of silent garbled files which are not
        found by our check, yet.
 
All those problems have no explicit relation with the trouble on 21st Jul,
we can only supporse they were caused by it, however it is the fact that
after the trouble, we find this kind of file (especially MAGNUM file)
problems frequently. We feel something was wrong on F74. So please check it 
again and let me know the status.
 
At this moment, we find the problem on MAGNUM in MVX:74 and NETBILL:74.
And I hope no more MAGNUM id which has the problem appeared.
 
Best regards,
Makoto

Makoto;

Read through your Ontyme  M79463 today.  I do not know that much about
MAGNUM, only enough to clear up errors that we may have on our own, which
I learned from the MAGNUM Group that use to be here.

What I did this morning is the following:

As menioned before, there may still be some files garbled on System 74,
but we have no way of knowing which ones until the USERS lets  us know.

The files can be restored if the Users know which ones they are from the
lastest all-files and backups.  Even after doing this, the User may have to
recreate some files.

Fremont Data Center needs to schedule this system down for the next three
Fridays in order to check-out/replace some HDA's  It is imperative that
system 74 be scheduled down this coming Friday to start this work.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: SAT.SYS HRE Fixed 

Rick,
   WHat I did today was as follows:

   Prior to the pakcpy:
	Rebuilt (SYS)SAT.SYS so that DSKCLN would accept the structure
        and so the monitor would not get messed up if the system was
        reloaded before a PAKCPY could be done.  Page 22000 on BPA5:DSKB4
        is indeed bad and the pack should be copied out.

    <system crash> BADSAT or REDSAT BPA5:DSKB4 page 10
                   SAT2ND BPA5:DSKB4 page 10

    <pakcop done>  System came up ok, DSKCLN ok
                   FNDBAD reports (SYS)SAT.SYS still has HRE

    After PAKCPY:
	Fixed [1,4]UFD information for SAT.SYS and cleared HRE for pages
	previously marked as bad.

Subject: F74 SAT.SYS rebuild 

This afternoon, I had to rebuild the RIB to SYS:SAT.SYS while the system
was still up.  They had a SATRED error for a sat-page on logical unit 4.
The page was legitimately bad, could not read/write it.  I suggested they
PAKCPY it out as soon as possible, since DSKCLN would get upset trying to
re-write the SATs the next DSKCLN.

While checking, I looked at the rib, and gee-golly-oh-my it was garbage!
I was going to clear HRE on SAT.SYS initially, but hmmm...  So, I told
Rick what was going on and began the repair.  I rebuilt it using the RIB
from system F33 (also 365x's formatted in pages) as the template.
  Details:  Used PEAK to create FOO.DDT showing all page pointers then
            ^Y (read command file in DDT) in TSTSUP to do most of the
            typing in... 18 units x 13 page pointers ...

Anyway, all said and done, the system crashed for SAT2ND on a different
page on the same logical unit 4, before I could clear HRE from the status
bits in [1,4]UFD entry for SAT.SYS.  DSKCLN found my reconstructed RIB
to specification and the system came up.  I then fixed the UFD entry.

Again, if this tool we talked about last week existed, the reconstruction
would not have been necessary, a simple page copy would have been enough!

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

     Ogura-san, received your latest memo regarding F74 Magnum problems.
 
     Although we all appreciate and sympathize with the problems you are
     experiencing with Magnum internal file corruption, we can do little
     or nothing to solve the problems associated with Magnum code or
     files.
 
     As I have mentioned in past Ontymes, we have no remaining expertise
     with Magnum here at our facility, or anywhere in the U.S. for that
     matter.
 
     It is my feeling that NIS has the Magnum knowledge necessary to ana-
     lyze and correct the problems better than anyone else (i.e. re. MFUDO
     relation which reflects 2 instances for one key value: I assume it
     will be necessary to dump the relation to a 'flat' file and make nec-
     essary adjustments).
 
     However, we also realize the problems you are reporting are due to
     hardware disk failures on host F74.  Operations and the maintenance
     staff are doing everything possible to remedy these problems.
 
     I strongly suggest you keep close records of all problems, for future
     credit request requirements, and keep me posted on these problems if
     you wish.

     I'm not trying to discourage your communication to us on such issues,
     but wish to emphasize that we can do very little to assist you in
     resolving Magnum file corruption problems.
 
     We're all hopeful the hardware problems will be resolved soon.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Ken san,  
     
Thank you for your OnTyme.    
     
Today we could get more information about the current MAGNUM atatus.  
     
MAGNUM commands as  
     
        COPY TEXT .... TO FILE ....       and
        BACKUP ......  TO ......   
     
are not available on some schemas with error message "User Directory Access
Error", and available on other schemas. It depends on the directory which the   
schema is located. And if the destinaton file is not-existing (i.e. new) file,  
the problem is not appeared.  
The  problem is reproducable on the specific schema as 
     
                ONTYME.DB on DISTRICT239:74, 
                MMCAIS    on MMETAL:74, and etc.  
     
We guess the matter points is a part of MAGNUM copy mechanism which copies 
a MAGNUM file to a exec file as new file. And also, we found , on the same 
schema, a mechanism reading record from MAGNUM file and writing it onto exec    
(new) file works without problem, because    
     
        LIST FROM ..... TO ..... and    
        MAGNUM report writing 
     
has no problem.
     
I tried the COPY and BACKUP commands after the schema recompiling, however 
the problem still be appeared.
     
     
As you understand, this problem is very serious for NIS and reliability of 
MDC's RCS service in Japan.   
     
     
After host moving to F74 last autumn, we experienced heavy host problems every  
half a year, the cash memory trouble for over two months at the begin of this   
year and this disk un-reliability problem from Jun.    
Then our customers are going to feel something critical to operate their   
system, especially the financial system, on our service.    
     
I wonder that someone in IPC mentioned his MAGNUM on F74 had no problem, and    
hope he has no hidden problem as we are having.   
     
We know, you have no team for MAGNUM at this moment, however Mr. Matsumori,
the president of NIS, may not agree to pay the MAGNUM fee for such unstable
MAGNUM service and support, but may indicate some compensation from MDC for NIS.
     
At this moment, we can't evaluate the current MAGNUM on F74 run normally or not,
and only thing we need it to offer stable MAGNUM service to the customers. 
The simple example of the stable service is that the MAGNUM command, which 
I mentioned above,should work normally in anytime in any schema. 
     
Can we continue the MAGNUM service on F74 or should we change the service host  
to another host(X) ?
     
Please advise us.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: Re: D31 downtime - UFD rebuild 


The problem on D31 today was that the RIB pointer for the (SYS) directory
was wiped out by a data page for some directory file.  The cause of this
catastrophe is unknown.

What transpired today was an educated re-creation of the initial RIB data
which contained pointers to all the "special" system files, in place of the
destroyed RIB page for the (SYS) directory.

After this step the system was reloaded several times in an effort to verify
that each step was complete and to restore as many critical files as would
fit on D31 with the limited disk space available.  An hour and a half was
lost getting DSKCLN to run to recover lost pages (after we ran out of disk
space).

After DSKCLN completed, I finished restoring the remainder of the missing
files for (SYS) from the most recent all-files tape.  Operations finished
the job by restoring the files from the 12 daily backup tapes and the
system was up for timesharing with everything restored.

I do not have the precise times for any of these events.  The system was
answered immediately after DSKCLN finished, then Operations shut the system
to begin restoring files from the backups and all-files.  When the all-files
and the 12th day backup was completed, the system was un-shut.  Operations
proceeded to restore day 11 through day 1 in reverse order as per my 
instructions.

Note:  I failed to mention this, but... the time spent re-constructing the
       (SYS) directory RIB and restoring the missing (SYS) files saved D31
       from having to do a full rebuild and prevented the loss of any work
       done between the time of the last daily backup and the time of the
       RIB failure.

Ken san,  
     
Over Saturday and Sunday, we checked major relations and procedures of
customers on F74 by recompiling the procedures and accessing all instances 
for the relations. And we found several problem, however they were recovered.   
     
MFUDO's Problem
     
  However, about MFUDO's schema, by this moment, NIS can't complete to recover  
  it's destroyed data even though Tadashi Takahashi tried to do for last three  
  days.   
     
Problem   
     
  Right now, we still have the system reliability problem of MAGNUM.  
     
        1. Kazuo Watanabe recreated (NOT only recompile schema) the schema on   
           MVX:74, and found some program on the schema run normally sometime,  
           and run abnormally sometime without explicit changing for the program
           and execution environment.   
     
        2. And, I'm not sure this is related with the current problem, one of   
           person reported that temp files which was created by MAGNUM are still
           remained when he logged off all usernames related the directory (at  
           Saturday ecening) then logged in again (at Monday morning).
     
  I'm sorry I can not indicate the evidence for both case, but I feel something 
  unstable about F74 and MAGNUM.   
     
The Current Status  
     
  Again at this moment we can't evaluate what is incorrect. 
     
        - The current MAGNUM processer ?
        - Individual files on the MAGNUM schema ? 
        - Something others ?  
     
  Please set up the MAGNUM processer in normal status, or please point out 
  what is wrong if the cause is being outside of the MAGNUM.
     
     
Counter Plan   
     
  To avoid future problem, I'd like to discuss following matters.
     
        1. Moving host from F74 to other host.    
           Because almost of the current problems are believed to come from
           the disk problem. If we can get another host, the MAGNUM on that
           host works without problem. (Of cource, the support for MAGNUM has   
           still problem.)    
     
        2. Special BACKUPs for NIS's customer
           We supporse the backup operation at the center is taken when our
           our customers are operating their files by the time difference  
           between Japan and USA. So the restore operation from the backups
           is very complicated. Please arrange Following special backup for
           NIS.
     
                - NIS indicates file-list file containing username and file
                  ids.   
                - NIS indicates username-list file containing usernames.   
                - Center execute backup for all files indicated in the file-    
                  list file at 06:00 JST (Start 06:00 JST, and end the
                  operation within two hours, if possible.) every day through   
                  Monday to Friday/Saturday in JST.    
                - Center execute backup for all files under the usernames  
                  indicating in the username-list file at 06:00 of Sunday JST.  
                - All data should be remained for one month. (i.e. it's need    
                  31 Mag Tapes for this operation.)    
                - Backup information (backup starting time, backup ending time, 
                  file-ids, file creation date & time, size, etc.) for every    
                  operation is informed to NIS as on-line file just after the   
                  operation.  
           By above mechanism, we can easly follow the problem speedy.
           If this is feasible, we will discuss on details and charges.    
     
  How do you think about the matters ?  
     
Charges   
     
  Regarding the problem, we user a huge amount of TRUs by checking and
  recovering as compiling, programing, test run, and etc. And NIS will intend   
  to negotiate about the charges and costs after everything is over.  
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Contact:  "Fountana" Data Center, Mike Silva, System 26, no incident number.
Problem:  PAKCOP hung after copying cylinder 504 on BPA2.
          Select light off, no action in memory lights, no response to the
          attention button.  They wanted to know if it was OK to do an ASP
          save on the 3652.  BPC2 copied out OK.
Fix:      I suggested they try the OLDC command.  It got an unrcoverable
          error on cylinder 473.  Told them to do the ASP one-disk save.
          This worked, but BPC2 had a "missing or inconsistent pack set id",
          which was to be expected.  After putting a JFCL at STRFIX, the
          system came up running a full DSKCLN.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As part of the project to bring OnTyme to MDISC, training is
being delivered across the country to key offices.  If you
are in a smaller office, you probably did not see a flyer
announcing the class.  (Or perhaps you're so busy you haven't
read the bulletin board!)  Either way, below you'll find our
first training schedule.

If you are interested in participating, please register by 
phoning the appropriate contact as soon as possible - as class
size is limited.  Each session lasts 3 1/2 hours, scheduled either
in the morning or afternoon.  Most are morning sessions from 8:30 to
12:00.  When you call to register, you will be informed of the
class time.

I look forward to meeting those who plan on attending.




Best,
Les

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As everyone is aware of, or has heard, ASP can be used to copy
out a unit, or units, on the TYMCOM-10's.

ASP is only used if PACKCOPY cannot be used, or if it fails to
copy out a unit - it is not a general procedure to use instead
of PACKCOPY.

If not done correctly, a system can be wiped out.

It is requested that Shift Supervisors get together and let
me know the best time and day of the week I can instruct Operators
of these procedures.  Please submit a joint schedule to me by
19 August.

All other interested personnel are invited.

Thanks Rick Daniels

     Ogura-san, received your latest two memo's on subject (August 5th and
     8th); I was out of office on the 8th, returning to office today.
 
     I cannot give you advice on "The Current Status" issues at this time.
 
     Regarding your section "Counter Plan":
 
      1.  I can check into alternative hosts, with Jan Krivanec (or Ed
          Roop), if we find that it's absolutely necessary.  However,
          PDP10 hosts are being removed from the network (at a slow pace)
          and I'm not sure the required resources are available on another
          host.
 
      2.  Backup of customer files:
 
           a.  Presently, an ALLFILES dump to Mag Tape is performed twice
               a month, during Saturday mornings (late Saturday afternoon
               JST).
 
           b.  Tape BACKUP's (for new and modified files) are run daily
               between the hours of 0001 and 0200 PDT (1600-1800 JST).
               I'd suggest we request Operations to run the BACKUP's
               between 0300-0500 PDT (1900-2100 JST).
 
               I see this as giving two benefits: A) Customers on-line and
               running at time of BACKUP may not have files placed on
               backup tape; you would have less clients accessing system
               after 1900 JST.  B) As your prime time ends at 1900 JST,

 
F74 Problems                                                        Page 2
 
 
               most all of the files updated or created during that busi-
               ness day will be stored on the BACKUP tape, whereas now the
               files created between 1600 and 1900 may not be back'ed up
               til following day.
 
           c.  Special backups for clients, as you suggest in your memo:
               You would be required to submit Batch Requests in the stan-
               dard fashion, by user name, (or group of names) and request
               that Ops send you the TID for each of the groups.  I
               believe you'd be required to submit Batch Requests daily to
               store the specified users files, appending to the existing
               TID previously set up.  Then, when a tape is full, a new
               TID would be assigned.
 
               This would involve a large administrative effort for NIS
               and am not sure a good alternative exists (not to mention
               the transfer cost involved).
 
     I'm afraid I must finish this correspondence for now, due to a previ-
     ous appointment.  Please supply your comments to the above and we'll
     continue the dialogue.  Best regards. Ken

SUBJECT>   TYMCOM host F74 Problem


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Dear Ken,
As you know, I am responsible for sales of TYMCOM service since April '88.
Recent heavy and frequent host down causes serious problems for our business.
History of F74 host down is shown on an attached form. Even if the term 
of host down is short,it causes problem for batch type operation as re-run.
We understand PDP-X host is so old and being removed. Based on this
circumstances,we installed VAX host in our node center and transfer
TYMCOM-Xuser's application from PDP to VAX. But it will take one more year
to complete that migration.
I am very afraid that if these accidental and troublesome situation will
continue, most of our costomer will start to plan removing from our RCS
service because of lack of reliability.
Mr. Ogura's proposal (Ontyme M80513) is most important for NIS to protect
customer's trustness. I hope you will find alternative host of F74 and
arrange to take special back-up.
The host down on July 22nd was the worst during past 7 years of our 
RCS service. Customers files were damaged and back-up tape could not cover
proper back-up function because of improper timing and continuous host 
down. It has been taken 5 days to complete recovery by "MANUAL".

We shall appreciate it if you will consider the above circumstances
and reply at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Ivan Kyoda
General Manager , Sales Dept 4.

Subject: Average and max chars per second thru the base? 

A question came up while talking with Krumviede: what is the limiting factor
in getting characters into and out of the PDP-10s?  Is it:
 a) the number of characters SCNSER can handle,
 b) the speed in which the 68000 shuffles data from PDP-10 to Engine memory,
 c) the Dispatcher moving data to/from slot 1 and node code,
 d) the thruput of node code talking to the switchers.

The IRING size of 128 words and ORING of 256 means a maximum of 500 in
and 1000 out per tick, or 30K cps in and 60K cps out.  This does not
count block-I/O, but I'm sure that UUOCON can't provide that much
thruput on non-block-I/O lines.  Node code on D25's and D54's bases
reported an average of 700 in/out (at the time we were watching) and a
high-water mark of around 6800 characters per second in and out.

Carl: Did you determine that JBTCNI/JBTCNO was valid or bogus?  I looked at
a couple of systems (including F33-P035/D-7) and noticed that JBTCIN+0 and
JBTCOT+0 were between 1.0 and 2.0 times UPTIME.  That is, an average of 1
character per tick = 60 per second over a 131 hour period.

The question that started this discussion was "would enabling the trace buffers
in the 68000 code slow down thruput?"

The question itself is not as important as the fact that the metrics are not
available.

Subject: Average/max chars per sec base<==>PDP-10 

At 30 chars/msg = 8 words/msg gives 16 msgs in and 32 msgs out for a more
precise character count of 480 in and 960 out per tick (60th second).  If
the base keeps up with 1/60th second response, the total would be 28,800 in
and 57,600 out cps.  However, I do not know how fast the base polls the ring.
(This is important, since it checks the key each 1/2 second...)

On the KL, we can easily change the size of the ring on a heavily loaded
system to determine if SCNSER is the bottleneck.  The rings can be any size
we want as long as it's a power of 2.  (I'd like to see 1-page or 1K RINGS
for such a test.)  I had done this once, at the time we found the bug in
the KMC code for the 2020.

JBTCNI and JBTCNO are valid and presumed accurate not counting block-io which
is found in JBTBIO  (see (CARL:33)SYSDAT.SAI for actual table if JBTBIO is not
correct).  We do have sampling of the data you request every fifteen minutes
for all systems that ran SYSDAT since the beginnig of June-88.

I think you are right... the real bottleneck may be UUOCON and not SCNSER for
normal I/O.  If you'd like, I can finish whipping up my SHOVEL program to do
just that... shovel data through the interface, using regular I/O, TTCALLS, and
BLOCK-IO or even all three to determine the maximum rate.  (TTCALLS would use
things like OUTSTR/OUTPTR or .AXPTR/.AXSTR).

What did you guys decide?

Well, we used to be able to set the size to anything we wanted as I mentioned.
Will this mess up anything that you've done with saving a copy of the rings at
crash time? or in allocating space to hold the copy of the rings?

If not, then just changing the right pointers, it's done!

     Ivan, I've just received copy of Ontyme you sent today on subject
     of Tymcom host F74.  I did not receive the original ontyme from you,
     but Rick Daniels forwarded a copy when I learned a message had been
     sent.
 
     I certainly realize you've had a very rough July due to F74 reliabil-
     ity; your statistics point out that July had more than 43 hours down-
     time, with the understanding it was not all Prime Time outages.
 
      1.  Rick Daniels has changed the hour when backup is run for F74.
          Effective 88-08-11, backup will be run at 0300 PST, rather
          than shortly after midnight.  This item was referenced in my
          previous ontyme (I14434, item 2b).
 
      2.  Jan Krivancec (Resource Allocation) has informed me that host
          F29 could be considered as an alternative host to F74.  However,
          I don't think it a good idea to transfer all customers to anoth-
          er PDP10 immediately unless F74 hardware problems continue.
          Rick has informed me they've not had additional disk (DASD)
          errors in recent days.
 
          Please notify me if you wish for "resources" to evaluate the
          possibility of F29 replacing F74 as the primary NIS host.
 
      3.  It is quite complicated and time consuming to attempt and
          arrange a "special" backup arrangement for NIS customers.  Is
          Ogura-san suggesting this be an on-going process for a long

          period of time?  In addition to the complexity of such an
          arrangement is the cost involved for all tapes etc.
 
     Consider this an interim response to your memo of today (10th) and
     let me know your thoughts on the above.  Best regards. Ken

     A proposed schedule has been derived to facilitate the plans to  
     convert the Tymnet code machines to a page monitor format.  
     The systems have been scheduled in order of need as this upgrade 
     will considerably increase the storage availability.   
     
     Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects
     and workloads to be planned accordingly. All of the conversions  
     are scheduled during weekends, and coordination with other data  
     center will take place to insure availability of its designated  
     back-up host. A system message will be posted prior to its  
     conversion date.    
     
     If any of the systems scheduled poses a problem, please call me  
     at (415)498-2514 as soon as possible and we can make arrangements
     to reschedule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following proposal is submitted of the intended dates when the
remainder of the TYMCOM-10's are scheduled for conversion at the
Fremont Data Center.

     F58 - Weekend of 9 through 11 September

     F29 - Weekend of 11 through 13 November

     F38 - Weekend of 25 through 27 November

At the completion of this schedule all Fremont TYMCOM-10's
will be running on a PAGE vice BLOCK monitor  This will prevent
some confusion as to what type of monitor the systems are up on.
It will also cut down of remembering what PACKCOPY version to
use.  Instead of remembering FOUR version;s; only have to
remember TWO.

Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects and
workloads to be planned accordingly.

If any of the systems poses a problem, please call me at (415)498-2595
as soon as possible and we can make arrangements to reschedule.

Subject: TECH-SYS 

Will the TECH-SYS expert-system/phone-assist system be able to accept
calls from a computer system?  For example, we could have a remote
monitoring program (SYSDAT) running on the PDP-10 that builds a circuit
to an out-dial host (or directly to TECHSYS if it has ports directly on
TYMNET) to connect as a client and open a service call (or incident in
CHAD) and have us paged via dispatch when it decided that a particular
PDP-10 host is having problems.  We could then investigate and provide
operations with the "level of care" we desire before operations has had
time to make the determination themselves to call us...

re: well-system care!  we need some way for a PDP-10 to call us!

Joe,
  got called about 22nd UFDER1 crash on B39... 2 DSKCLN runs today
found many files with rib pointers which it marked with POR and SLF.
I don't see any history of disk problems in CTYLOG, but I only did TAIL
to see the most recent day...

Let me know if you find out anything.  I'll look further later and
let you know if I find anything else out... looks like B39 is having
some kind of garbling problems......

Osman;
    I just wanted to say Thank you for coming by here last week
and sharing your information and time with us. I know that what
you had passed on to us is greatly appreciated by the Operators
and by us Supervisors. It has opened new doors of thinking for
us all. Thanks again. It was really nice to finally get to meet
you in person after all these years of telephone contact. I have
to tell you that you didn't look anything like I imagined you, I'm
sure the same goes for you! Ha ha ...
 
Take care for now Osman, and Thanks again...

            Key: 75660

CRA003 and CRA004 are IME crashes in CORE1 where it's looking for pages
to remove from job's working set, and that job's context pages are swapped
out.  I'm guessing that PAGWK2 is also related to swapped context pages.
If that is true, one way around this problem would be to add more memory
to D56.  It currently has only 2 meg and is running a lot of 1022F4 and
MAGNUM jobs.    /Joe

At one time Carl and I were toying with the idea of eliminating BACKUP.SAV
so as not confuse things with BACKUP.SHR - but nothing has come of that.
I copied SYSTEM.SAV to BACKUP.SAV on X32's 3675 packs - I think it is already
there on the 3652 packs.

What is the status of the disks connected to X32?  Are the 3675s there for
long term or short term?

Bill,
  Do you have the phone number(s) of the BUBBNET consat(s) in the local
area (MDC Center, etc.)?  Also, the current 800 number for TYMNET?  (I cn
probably get that from TYMNET information)

  Last night, Nicholson lane was down and gee-whiz, so is the entire south
bay community at large, Fremont being the closest consat that was up.  Redwood
City the next closest...

When X32 is running on the 3652's an ASP Dump will be done.
It will be up to the Operator to determine what X32 is up on.


ALL-FILES will be taken whether it is up on 3652's or 3675's.

Subject: How to load the Turbo Engine file system. 

~jms/loadsfs.doc			17-Aug-88

To set up a Turbo Engine from scratch:
  I.   Set up the GP cards and disk hardware (done in Manufacturing).
  II.  Run MAKESFS to set up the sfs root directory.
  III. Run SFS and create top-level directories.
  IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to do it when BITS is working:

Part I will not be necessary if manufacturer sets up the hardware correctly.

Part II.  Load makesfs via BITS and run it.
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p u makesfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Go to the TTYA port on GP.133 and enter 51849.

Part III.  Load sfs via BITS and create top-level directories
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p f sfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Enter "fo mkdir /isis".
  3.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.133".
  4.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.135".

Part IV.  Load the six mandatory files using BITS.
  1.  "fs -p f sfs.e        /GP.133/load".
  2.  "fs -p i kernel.e     /GP.135/load".
  3.  "fs -t s isom.e       /isis/debugger".
  4.  "fs -t s dispatcher.e /isis/dispatcher".
  5.  "fs -t c syscon.e     /isis/syscon".
  6.  "fs -t s nodecode.e   /isis/slot00".

Part V.  Bring up Turbo Engine.
  1.  Enter "bs GP.133" and "bs GP.135" to BITS.
  2.  Copy any other files as needed after Turbo is up in the network.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to do it without BITS:

All board addresses and Unix directory names are what where used in the
demonstration given the week of August 15.  The actual names and addresses
will be different on your system.

You must be at the keyboard of a Sun workstation to do this.
  1.  Make sure GP board in slot 0 is strapped for VME arbitration master.
  2.  Verify File Server is addressed as GP.133 and ISIS is GP.135.
  3.  Both boards must have Probug ROMs, not Rodney ROMs.
  4.  Login to the workstation and start suntools.
  5.  Open 2 shell windows, and enter "skytool tb6" in one of them.
  6.  Use the other window to locate the following files:
      Sun programs: skytool, skyload, tw, skycheck, skyclock
      Probug bootables: dl.x, makesfs.x, sfs.x, filebug.x, rodney.x
      X.409 binaries: dispatcher.d, isom.d, nodecode.d, kernel.d, sfs.d
      Node specific: syscon.d, nodecode.d

Part I.  Set up the GP cards and disk hardware.
  1.  Connect a line from TTYA on the workstation to TTYA on GP.133.
  2.  (here we do somthing to run skyclock and skycheck on each GP card).
  3.  Enter "skyload -b dl.x tb6" to the shell.
  4.  Enter "j800a000" to skytool which starts dl.
  5.  Enter "in" to initialize the disk.
  6.  Enter "bl" to change block length.
  7.  Enter 3 blanks and then "1024"
  8.  Enter "y" to "make permanent" and return to "abort".
  9.  Enter "ex" to get back to Probug.

Part II.  Run makesfs to set up the sfs root directory.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/makesfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "j" to skytool.
  3.  Makesfs will type recommended disk size.  Enter this number to skytool.
  4.  It will take about 45 minutes for this to complete.

Part III. Run sfs and create top-level directories.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  4.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  5.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start sfs.
  6.  Enter "m /isis" to the "cmd:" prompt (to make /isis direcory).
  7.  Enter "m /GP.133" and "m /GP.135".
  8.  Enter "f /" to list files.  The 3 directories should be there.
  9.  Enter "c /isis/syscon" to create an empty file (due to bug in "tw").
 10.  Enter "c /isis/debugger", "c /isis/dispatcher", "c /isis/slot00".
 11.  Enter "c /GP.133/load" and "c /GP.135/load".

Part IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  1.  Disconnect cable from GP.133 and plug into TTYA on GP.135.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/filebug.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  4.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  5.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  6.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start filebug.
  7.  Enter "tw /isis/syscon <syscon.d" to shell.  Note: tw is very slow.
  8.  Enter "tw /isis/slot00 <nodecode.d". 
  9.  Enter "tw /isis/dispatcher <isis68k/dispatcher/1.0/bin/dispatcher.d".
 10.  Enter "tw /isis/debugger <isis68k/isom/1.0/bin/isom.d".
 11.  Enter "tw /GP.135/load <isis68k/kernel/1.01/bin/kernel.d".
 12.  Enter "tw /GP.133/load <rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.d".

Part V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.
  1.  Power card cage off, wait 30 seconds, then back on again.
  2.  Once the node has come up in the network, BITS can be used for all
      further transfers.

Subject: Re: "I DON'T GET WHY A JOB WOULD RUN"... 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 19 Aug 88 9:03:41 PDT

Lets say you have JOB1 scheduled to run at startup, and it schedules JOB2 to
run every day at 6am.  The system comes up, JOB1 completes, and JOB2 is in
the queue.  If the system crashes, JOB1 will run again when the system
comes back up and puts in another request for JOB2.  Now if this crash
occurs before the first JOB2 has run, it means that there are two JOB2
jobs in the queue.  If the system crashes 5 times in one day, then there
will be at least 5 JOB2s in the SUBMIT queue; all set to go off at the
same time.

One way to prevent this is to have JOB1 do a "CANCEL (NETDB)JOB2 *" before
it does an "INSERT JOB2".  This will remove any pending JOB2 requests and
replace them all with a single JOB2 request.

Subject: AUXMOX overloading of F33 to end in a couple of days. 

I talked to Phillipe Michel in Project Implementation about the many jobs
running AUXMOX.  The "522 Deployment Project" is modifying the TYM and
CMD files of all nodes in the Public Net to use Node Code version 5.22.
The BND files are being telecopied from D25/D54 to F33 as they are
created, because many nodes are reloaded the same night as when their
code is generated.  The people in PI did not know that you could enter
more than one file specification at a time when running (SPL)COPY.
Therefore each node was transfered as a seperate TELECO job.

Phillipe said they should be done in a few days.     /Joe

Subject: TYM files for all EBUS bases updated. 

The TYM files have been updated to include features that will help the
REBUILD option.  The new base code is now in (TYMNET:25)ND####.BND and
(TYM5:54)ND####.BND.  Please use them instead of the NW####.BND files the
next time the base is reloaded.

In each TYM file, the symbol REBTST is defined so that OPTION(REBLD) works
right and S0CORE has been bumped up from 240 to 350 to make more room for
the rebuild buffers.

The old BND files have been renamed to BK####.BND on (TYMNET:25) and on
(TYM5:54).

Those scheduled will be on the SPECIAL EVENTS form.  Please check
it to be sure of what HOST to load the code from.  The code is not
on all the systems that are usually used.

26-Aug-88 19:20/Joe             (Dispatch beeped at 19:22)
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, System 33, (415)498-2588
Problem:  System when down with RIBBRP on (EBUS)[3,317016].UFD and Mike wanted
          to know how serious it was.  System 54 was scheduled to be down
          for the conversion to pages at 20:00 and System 33 was supposed to
          be up all weekend.  He was worried about bad RIB in UFD.
Action:   Had them bring the system up MANUAL so I could check the UFD.
          No RIB errors were found.  Considerring that I had 5 jobs GFD'd
          to EBUS when it went down, it might have been a bad RIB pointer
          in a DDB, meaning everything on disk was good.  Told them to force
          a FAST DSKCLN so that it would finish before D54 was scheduled down.

F26 is running on XXX KL#1307 base 2100 instead of FFF KL#1324 base 10350.
The two 9600 baud lines on node 2100 are the bottleneck for loading private

I NOW HAVE A NEW ONTYME NAME:  TMC.S/DUNHAM.  I WILL READ  MESSAGES FROM
,MY OLD NAME AND CLEAR THINGS OUT OF IT.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd prefer to hang onto my password and not give it out to anyone, at least
for the time being.

I have asked you before not to call me by those nicknames anymore,
and I realy woish you wouldn't.  It makes me feel uncomfortable.

Sorry the prospect didn't turn out as well as hoped with the condo.  
Maybe the next one will be the right one.  I really hope you aren't
spending a lot of money on me for Christmas, cuz if you are, I'm
not going to be able to accept your gifts.  I don't want to be in
a situation where that happens.

I hope work is going better. Sounds like you have a lot of ideas to
offer them.

Gotta run and get some orders into the system before lunch.

Talk to ya later.

No, I can't do anything to your id because I'm not the account supervisor
for your id.  Ii thought that your id did that because of something
that you did in your init file.

It doesn't look like I'll be abl to do lunch with you today.
go to lunch tomorrow with Ken.

Talk to ya later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IT IS BETTER IF YOU CA REPEAT THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T REPLY TO.  SOMETIMES
YOU EXPECT REPLIES TO THINGS I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT YOU DID. (EXPECT REPLIES
TO, THAT IS).

NEED TO SEND AN ONTYME TO THE WAREHOUSE.  SEE YA LATER.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


JUST GRABBED THE LAST MESSAGE I SENT TO YOU.  I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT LINE
GOT EATEN LIKE THAT...THE ONLY THING YOU MISSED WAS THE PART THAT SAID
THAT I WAS GOING TO LUNCH WITH KEN TOMORROW.  NOTHING BIG.

RE:  GOLDFINGER

I WENT TO BED BEFORE THE END OF IT.  I WAS TOO TIRED AND IT WASN' INTEREST-
ING ENOUGH TO KEEP ME GLUED TO THE SET.  I STILL LIKE ROGER MOORE BETTER,
HE HAS MORE CLASS.  
MORE TO FOLLOW LATER.

/SHE

P.S.  THANKS FOR A *GREAT* TIME LAST NIGHT.  I HAD A BLAST.  I CAN'T TELL
      YOU HOW MUCH FUN I HAD.  WE SHOULD DEFINITELY PLAN ON VISITING
      SEBASTIANS AGAIN ON THE 29TH AT LEAST FOR DRINKS AND DANCING!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ii just got back from looking at another house that was for rent.  It was
in better condition, but I think we're going to try for the first one
(the one that I told you about tonight).  It has two separate living rooms
as well as the bedrooms.  The bedrooms and bathrooms are smaller in
the first house, but the way the house was designed space-wise, Ii think
it is going to be better for three people living there.  There are more
areas to go to get away from each other.  The house tonight had
a large kitchen and family room but that was it except for the bedrooms.
So, you could either go in your bedroom or join everyone else in the
living room.  Meep said she'd call the first guy back tomorrow and tell him
we are definitely interested.  I hate moving; especially at this time of the
year!  Oh well, it'll be good to start the new year in a new house, though!

How was San Diego?  Sounds like it went really well.  I'm glad.
I tried to log in to do some more work tonight and I can't get the #!*%&@!
modem to work.  I don't know what buttons to push in on it and Mmeep
went to the movies.  Crap!  I wanted to get in some more o.t. over this
weekend.  Oh well, I can always do it tomorrow night.

Well, guess I'll go to bed so I can get to work at some reasonable hour
tomorrow.  Maybe I'll go in early and work an extra hour.  That'll be a good
way to get in o.t.  (over time, if you haven't deciphered that by now...)

Talk to ya tomorrow.  Lunch will probably be fine.  I don't think
the evening will work out too well, though.  I've still got a lot of stuff
I want to accomplish before the new year and Thursday night is already
booked, so that only leaves me with tomorrow and possibly friday.

G'Night!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*yawn*!  (notice the time of this message...)  i have been here since 7:15
and am only planning on a half hour lunch.

We got the house in campbell and spent from 8:00 A.M. until 9:00 last night
PAINTING.  We are about half done and have to get it finished asap so they
can clean the carpets before we move in Saturday and Sunday!  I'm so tired
of painting I could cry.  Where I'll find the energy/desire to go back there
after I get off work this afternoon is beyond me.  That's why  I'm coming in
early and taking little or no lunch, so I can leave early and paint some more
before it gets too dark and cold.

Every muscle in my body aches, especialy my hands...and I'm sure you really
don't need to or want to hear all about my aches and pains, so I'll cool it for
a while.  

How was your new years?  We (Mmeep and Gil and me) went to zapps that
evening.  It was okay, nothing earth shattering or extremely thrilling.

Wwell, gotta get to work since that's what I came in early for.  I'm not
going to be able to go to lunch or anywhere after work until some time next
week.  Thanks for asking though.

Sheila

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


YES, I AM INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT THE INTERESTING THINGS YOU HAVE
FOUND OUT ABOUT ROSS.

GIL IS GOING TO TALK TO HIS DAD TODAY TO SEE WHEN WE CAN BORROW HIS TRUCK
TO MOVE.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW ASAP, AND WILL MOST LIKELY CALL.
WE'LL PROBABLY DO THE ACTUAL MOVING ON SUNDAY.  I DON'T  KNOW
WHEN WE'LL PACK, I GUESS SOME TIME AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN WE RETURN FROM
PAINTING THE HOUSE!  (I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE WORK WE'RE DOING, I'M
JUST IN SHOCK AT HOW LONG IT TAKES AND HOW HARD OF WORK IT IS, AND THAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY DOING THIS INSANE ACT!)  I GOT OFF WORK YESTERDAY AT 3:30, STOPPED
BY ALPHA BETA TO GET WOOD FOR THE FIREPLACE SO WE DON'T FREEZE AT NIGHT
(THAT IS ONE *COLD* HOUSE!), WENT HOME AND CHANGED AND GOT TO THE HOSE
BY 4:30 (THAT SHOULD BE 'HOUSE', NOT 'HOSE').  PAINTED LIKE MAD UNTIL
10:45 (SIX HOURS!!!!!), WENT HOME, JUMPED IN THE SHOWER AND CRASHED 
UNTIL 5:45 THIS MORNING.  *YAWN*, AM I ACTUALLY HERE AT THIS INSANE
HOUR OF THE MORNING...??

SO, IF ANY ONE ASKS ME WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING LATELY, I CAN SUM IT UP PRETTY
EASILY:  GO TO WORK, PAINT, SLEEP.....GO TO WORK, PAINT, SLEEP...
ETC, ETC!

WE STILL HAVE THE DOORS LEFT AND A LOT OF TRIM AROUND THE WINDOWS AT TOPS OF
                                   ___
THE WALLS.  IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST TWO MORE NIGHTS BEFORE IT'S ALL DONE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN KEEP THIS UP.  I'M SLEEPING AT MY DESK
DURING THE DAYS AS IT IS.  I MAY HAVE TO ASK FRANCIS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON
OFF SO WE CAN GET THE ODDS AND ENDS CLEANED UP AROUND THERE SO WE CAN MOVE
STUFF IN.  I COULD ALSO PACK THAT DAY.

I'LL BE GLAD WHEN THIS WEEK IS OVER AND WE'RE ALL SETTLED IN!  WHAT A RELIEF
THAT WILL BE!

WELL, TOMORROW'S PAY DAY AND THAT'LL BE NICE.  I'VE BEEN WRITING CHECKS
LIKE CRAZY FOR THE PAINT, ETC, AND HAVE TO WAIT TILL WE PAY RENT TO
OUR NEW LANDLORD AND DEDUCT IT FROM THAT.  

GUESS I SHOULD GET AT MY WORK HERE.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS
WEEKEND PROBABLY THIS EVENING OR TOMORROW MORNING.

TALK TO YA LATER!

SHE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HI.  I WAS GOING TO ENTER SOME ORDERS TO SHIP BUT DECIDED TO WRITE
YOU FIRST.  I'M SURE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY FOR BEING SO SNAPPY...I OWE
A FEW OTHER PEOPLE AN APOLOGY OR TWO, TOO.  WHAT CAN I SAY...I CAN'T
HELP FEELING THAT WAY SOMETIMES.  AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN
MAKE ME SNAP OUT OF IT.  I TOLD YOU I WAS EITHER GOING TO END UP PRETTY
BITTER THIS YEAR OR THAT FOR A CHANGE THINGS WOULD FALL INTO PLACE AND
GO WELL.  UNFORTUNATELY, IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRST IS GOING TO WIN OVER.

TO ANSWER YOUR LAST ONTYME:


THAT IS INTERESTING AT ROSS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE LEAVING.  MAYBE THEY
JUST DIDN'T "FIT" WITH THE CO. AND IF THEY AREN'T/WEREN'T HAPPY,
IT IS BETTER THAT THEY RE GONE SO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE THERE, CAN BE THERE.

NO MY SCANSET ISN'T LOCKED INTO CAPS; IT'S JUST FASTER AND EASIER IF I DON'T
HAVE TO BOTHER WITH CAPS.  THEY KEYS ARE TINY ENOUGH THE WAY IT IS
WITHOUT HAVING TO HIT THEM MORE OFTEN.

HOW DO YOU LIKE IT THERE NOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A MONTH?
       ---

I WILL KEEP THE CONDO IN MIND.  HOPE ALL GOES WELL.  I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
WERE REALLY AIMING AT MAKING A MARK AT ROSS BEFORE YOU MOVED.  I THOUGHT
IT WAS MORE OF A PLACE TO BE IN THE INTERIM.  TWO YEARS COULD BE REALLY
TIGHT.  HOPE IT GOES OKAY.  I DON'T THINK EVEN I CAN HANG AROUND THIS
VALLEY THAT LONG.  MAYBE I'LL GET A GOOD OFFER TO MOVE TO ANOTHER COMPANY
FROM THIS POSITION AND CAN MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION.  OR PERHAPS
GOING TO SCHOOL AT BIOLA WILL BE A GOOD CHANGE.  WHO KNOWS...

GLAD THE PEN HOLDER AND KEY CHAIN ARE DOING THEIR JOBS.  ABOUT THE RING:
I DECIDED I DO NEED TO GET IT SIZED.  PROBABLY 1/2 SIZE LARGER WOULD DO.
I CAN GET IT OFF BUT IT'S TIGHT A LOT OF TIMES.  AFTER JUST HAVING TO HAVE
ONE RING CUT OFF THAT FINGER, I'M NOT REAL ANXIOUS TO THINK OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF BEING IN THAT POSITION AGAIN.  MAYBE WE COULD MEET FOR LUNCH ONE DAY AND
TAKE IT TO ZALES AT VALCO  (DO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ORIG. STORE?) AND
THEY CAN PROPERLY MEASURE MY FINGER AND SIZE IT.  SOUND OKAY?

I NEED TO ENTER THE ORDERS NOW, I GUESS.  TALK TO YA AGAIN LATER.

SHE

P.S.  IT LOOKS LIKE GIL WILL BE ABLE TO BE AT THE HOUSE TOMORROW AFTERNOON
FOR THE CARPET  CLEANERS SO I WILL BE HERE ALL DAY.  IF YOU WANT, WE CULD
GO TO ZALES TOMORROW...OR ANOTHER DAY IS FINE, TOO.

I'LL TRY TO CHECK ONTYME AGAIN BEFORE I LEAVE TONIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW
MORN FOR A RESPONSE.

Subject: ASH 

In noticing that you're doing something to ASH, I did a differ... and
I'd like to make the following comment:

    I think that NOT reading the entire structure sequentially is a
    good feature.  [That is what I surmised you are adding]

    I propose that BOTH mechanisms be allowed to co-exist, and that
    the determination of whether to "randomly" read versus sequentially
    read be based on a SWITCH, eg. VERBOSE/BRIEF, called RANDOM and
    that this switch be toggled with the RANDOM command, or set to the
    appropriate value by the RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL commands.

    Correct me if I'm wrong, but I presume you want to read a buffer
    at a time, not a page at a time, and therfore, if you modify the
    code which increments the buffer pointer to the next buffer to
    select the next "random" buffer address (either at random, or if you
    keep a table [a la SATS] of buffers read, so as to only read the
    entire structure once, but not sequentially, then select it from
    this table and mark it read).  A SAT table for the entire structure
    may not fit, if you set the buffer size to 1 page, but it was a
    suggestion.

Subject: re: Lines on the screen.. 

Both PEAK and VUE have an internal buffer that has a maximum of 24ish lines
by 132 chars.  Anything less than that can be configured with terminal types
that set the parameters.  (Some terminals in VUE set less than that, I don't
think PEAK can do it.)

If I changed the buffer in REDISP.SAI to handle larger sizes for redisplay
and then modified PEAK to also allow larger screens, then you could get what
you want.

I'll think about it... might want to hack up a special PEAK for you, since
extra memory lets ytou edit bigger files and someone may get kicked over
the limit by such an increase.

Subject: re: .chCFP and VCREAT 

I was thinking....

  If we had a new bit in RIB pointers (near RBREAL et al) that said that
this page is a virgin page that HAS NOT been zeroed on disk.  Then, .chCFP
could be speeded up by simply assigning pages to a file.  When a page is
mapped in (by whatever means) with this bit set in the RIB, the data on
DSK is ignored and the user is given a free memory page assigned to the
disk page.  Only after the new page has been written to disk is the entry
in the RIB modified to reflect that the data is good!

  Likewise, for super-map/virgin we simply assign a clean memory page to
the appropriate disk page and set the page-dirty bit so it will be written
out reasonably soon.  ASP would then be speeded up by not using such a large
page cache for writing (not having to wait for it to come in)...

  For .chCFP, all pages created with .chCFP could use this bit and the user
would NOT pay the penalty of having to wait twice (once while it is zeroed
and written, and again to have it mapped).  This also would remove the NEED
for create-zero-map page, since allocation and mapping would be as though
a VCREATE was done, (allocation - finding free pages in the SAT, mapping -
assigning a free memory page).

  If you also add your super-map "retrieval-pointer"-page then if this new
"virgin" bit is set in the retrieval pointer, the page is allocated from
clean (zeroed) memory and assigned to whatever page the ret-pointer was
pointed at.   This could helf DSKCLN and otehrs a lot.

Think about it and comment...

Subject: re: .chCFP and TITO 

Hmmmm...

  What if when I open the file on output, I do .CHCFP for one more page
than I actually need... this will produce a file of contiguous pages with
the pattern n+1,n+2,....,n+m,n.   Then, I truncate the file to the proper
word length, thus deleting page n, and leaving a one-page orphan that won't
be contiguous in any file (most likely).

  I can check the .chCFP result for errors and if I get "no room" then I
simply release the channel freeing up the pages and print the appropriate
message on the console, can't enter file.. No use writing the file up to a
point before finding out it won't fit.

Just a note... it will have to be done the right way, that is, writing
to (SYS)SPAGES.SYS as a file doesn't work as long as we have the no-delete
bit set in the RIB, ... so, to write into SPAGES, I have to figure out the
geometry of the disks, and verify in the RIB of SPAGES that they match
on each unit, then use super-mapping to write into SPAGES.  Sigh..
 a little more work than just writing into a file in update mode....

Subject: re: SPAGES.SYS writing 

Joe,
  There is "sort of" a way to get the page information for SPAGES.SYS
without without too much trouble...

  VDSKPT AC,    ; where ac/ memory page

  First, we lookup SPAGES.SYS to get the size.
  Then we do a DSKCHR on the STR to get the # pages in STR and each UNIT.
  The number of units is deduceable from the DSKCHR info.
  The size of SPAGES div #-UNITS = 2 times pages per cylinder and gives
      the offset into SPAGES per unit.
  This offset div 2 = Max pages we want to write per unit, thereby only
      using 1 cylinder of the 2 on each unit that SPAGES uses.
  Then we do CHANIO .chMFP each of the pages we wish to scribble in
      for safety's sake (and we do want to compare info later).
  Now that it's mapped, we use VDSKPT to get the retrieval pointer on disk
      for each page "before" we overwrite it.
  To overwrite it, we take the retrieval pointer, calculate the appropriate
      structure page that matches the <UNIT>B16+<PAGE> and super-map that
      page read/write and then scribble in it and unmap both pages.

**This is still much less work than deciphering rib data structures in a
  user program, and depending on things that ONLY the monitor and DSKCLN
  ought to know in the first place!

Craig,
  What this means is that writing SPAGES is simple and straight-forward and
the extra steps taken here will provide greater reliability that QIKSAV will
NOT damage anything on the disk.  If SPAGES doesn't exist, it will report it
as such and maybe write a disk file, but won't just go scribbling on various
unknown cylinders, corrupting the file system in an effor to save it.

High Capacity Floppy Drives.

A report by Natick, Massachusetts consulting and market research firm Venture 
Development says that within two years, the standard 3.5 inch floppy drive 
capacity will have increased from 1.44 Mbytes to 4 Mbytes.  Toshiba already has
introduced a 4 Mbyte 3.5 inch drive, the PD-210, which uses disks that are 
magnetized vertically instead of horizontally.  The future of floppy drives 
could also be radically changed by "Digital Paper" (see last month's column) 
which potentially could be used to make 100 Mbyte floppy disks.  However, 
Digital Paper is not (yet) eraseable.  - PC Week 18 July

"Floptical" Drive.

Insite Peripherals is scheduled to introduce a 20.8 Mbyte, 3.5 inch floppy disk
drive that combines aspects of optical servo and magnetic recording technology 
in the first quarter of 1989.  The drive, dubbed the Model 1325 Floptical Disk 
Drive, uses otherwise standard 3.5 inch floppy disks that have been modified by
embedding optical-servo tracks in them at 20 micron intervals.  The drive will 
retail for approximately $500, and Insite plans to license major manufacturers,
including Kodak and Xidex, to make the Floptical disks for an, as yet, 
unspecified price. - InfoWorld 15 August

Ever Larger DRAM.

IBM may be planning to skip 4 Mbit RAM chips altogether (see last month's 
column) but four other manufacturers, Siemens, Toshiba, Matsushita, and Texas 
Instruments, expect to be making volume shipments of 4 megabit memory chips by 
the middle of next year.  Meanwhile, IBM researchers have successfully 
demonstrated a new integrated circuit production technology that may result in 
64 megabit (8 Mbytes) memory chips.  Although the technology still needs 
development, once volume production begins the price of the resulting chips 
will "not be ridiculous" according to Jerome Silverman, a research staff member
with IBM. - InfoWorld 25 July and 1 August

Coming From Big Blue.

In keeping with the announced policy of introducing product enhancements about 
every six months (see last April's column), IBM is expected to incorporate 
graphics based on the 8154 display adapter into the motherboard of new PS/2 
machines this Fall.  The super-VGA display offers a resolution of 1,024 by 728 
in up to 256 colors from a palette of 262,144.  Among the new models expected 
are a 80386 upgrade of the Model 60.  Entry Systems Division spokesperson Jim 
Monahan has acknowledged that an 80286-based replacement for the model 30 
(known in rumors as the "Model 35") is in the works but denies the low-end 
machine will be built around an AT-bus.  Meanwhile, financial analysts and 
dealers have been told that it could be more than a year before IBM introduces 
the "AIX family" of RISC-CPU machines which will have Micro Channel 
Architecture and be OS/2 compatibility. - InfoWorld 18 July, 1 and 22 August

New PC Software.

IBM denies rumors that the long awaited Presentation Manager, due to ship in 
October, will be late.  David Harrington, IBM's communications product manager,
did admit that meeting the promised delivery date will be "very challenging."  
Version 2 of the Ventura Publisher will be released this Fall with an improved 
user interface using pull-down and drop-down menus, increased network support, 
and document management features.  The price is expected to be about the same 
as the $895 for the present version. Microsoft expects to ship its Mail program
for MS-DOS in October.  Someone forgot to include the "auto-hyphenate" feature 
in WordPerfect 5.0 even though it is in the documentation.  A bug fix is 
expected soon. - InfoWorld 1, 15 and 22 August and PC Week 15 August

Apollo's 7-MIP Workstations.

The Apollo Series 4500 workstations which will begin shipping in the fourth 
quarter are the first to use the dual ported 68882 math coprocessor at 33 MHz 
along with the Motorola 68030 CPU.  The 7-MIP, 8 Mbyte RAM Apollo computers 
will be comparable in both price ($23,490 to $36,490) and performance to the 
Sun 4/110 RISC-based workstation. - InfoWorld 18 July and PC Week 18 July

1989 Model Macs.

Apple may be planning to introduce a whole line Macintoshes built around the 
68030 shortly after the new year.  In addition to a desktop model, look for a 
high-end laptop and, and a stand alone "tower" that can act as a network server
and support multiple workstations (multiuser, multitasking).  Apple also will 
begin producing its own memory chips beginning in 1990. - InfoWorld 25 July and
PC Week 15 August

IIgs+ Delayed.

Apple did not introduce an accelerator for the Mac SE at the recently concluded
Mac World as had been rumored, although several third party vendors have 
announced such products. Apparently, Apple management decided to take President
Sculley's commitment to major customers ("no new CPU's in 1988") very 
literally.  Sources inside Apple insist that an accelerated Apple IIgs (the 
widely rumored gs+) will not be shipped until some time after the performance 
of the entire Macintosh line is improved. - A Knowlegeable (Anonymous) Source 
(Developer)

Mac II CPU's.

Daystar Digital has announced a 33-MHz accelerator for the Macintosh II that 
plugs into the 68020's original location. The Daystar product features a 
120-nanosecond memory running at zero wait states and a RAM cache.  The 
accelerator will be shipped in the fourth quarter.  Daystar also offers 16 and 
25 MHz accelerators for the Mac SE and Mac Plus.  Intel, makers of the 80xxx 
chips, is rumored to have offered Apple a "cheap" 68020.  Will Motorola respond
by cloning the 80486?  - InfoWorld 22 August

Forthcoming MacWare.

Apple engineers demonstrated the new version of Quickdraw (Quickerdraw?) at Mac
World by showing real-time color animation running in different windows on a 
Mac II.  The function will be incorporated in an unspecified upcoming version 
of the Macintosh operating system.  "Nufinder" which will include commands for 
supporting "guests" with limited access to files and folders will be part of 
System 8.0 coming in January.  Apple also has confirmed it will release a beta 
version of a C++ translator for its MPW C language to developers in October.  
The translator will permit MPW C developers to do object-oriented programming. 
Currently only MPW Pascal is the only language from Apple that supports 
object-oriented programming for the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop and Mac App
programming library. Microsoft is said to be working furiously on a major 
update of Excel (expected to become version 2.0) for release shortly after the 
new year.  The new version will allow larger spreadsheets and address other 
limitations such as the difficulty of creating complex charts.  Product manager
Pradeep Singh says the new Mac version will leapfrog the PC version in 
functionality.  Word 4.0 with an automatic data link to Excel spreadsheets is 
expected to be released in October.  Word 4.0 also will allow users to edit in 
preview mode and improve the program's Page View function.  A new Microsoft 
Works, version 2.0, with an upgraded spell checker, some desktop publishing 
features such as linked multiple columns, and improved drawing facilities is 
scheduled for October shipment, and Quick Basic for the Macintosh should appear
in September at a retail price of $99.  Acius has decided to withhold version 
1.1 of its 4th Dimension relational database package.  Instead, version 2.0 
with approximately 100 new features will ship in December. Wingz may fly at 
last by the end of the month.  The original announcement last January 
envisioned a June release, later extended to mid-September.

- InfoWorld 8 and 15 August and PC Week 15 August

HyperCard Search/Retrieve "Engine."

KnowledgeSet is expected to release a commercial version of the HyperCard 
search and retrieve engine created for the Arthur Young accounting firm later 
this month.  The Macintosh program, called HyperKRS for "Knowledge Retrieval 
System," can be used with CD ROM as well as magnetic media and is up to 200 
times faster than HyperCard on its own. - PC Week 1 August

"Hypercard" IIgs.

Roger Wagner Publishing is planning on premiering a 'hypercard' for the IIgs at
the Sept 88 Applefest.  it will not read Mac stacks because many use external, 
binary executable functions.  More hearsay is that Apple is still working on a 
real hypercard for the GS. - Larry Virden 31 July and Open Apple August

Well, Almost 100% Compatible.

Developers of the Adobe Postscript clone printers (last December's column) now 
arriving on the market claim "100% compatibility."  However, because the 
Postscript page description language is complex and includes a number of 
undocumented features, industry sources say that it is impossible to verify 
complete compatibility.  So far, there is no standard testing program accepted 
by the entire industry.  - PC Week 25 July

One-Pass Color Laser.

Colorocs Corporation has demonstrated a single-pass four color printer that is 
more advanced and faster than multiple pass printers available today.  Colorocs
expects printers based on their technology to be offered initially at $30,000 
(a bargain compared to the only other one-pass color printer under development 
by Kodak which analysts expect to cost more than $80,000).  - PC Week 15 August

Chameleon CPU.

Designers may salivate - but shouldn't hold their breath - for the VM8600S 
microprocessor created by V.M. Technology Corp., of Tsukuba, Japan. The CPU 
portion of the chip has a native instruction set of 155 commands, but the 
company can configure three programmable logic arrays (PLAs) on the chip to 
translate another processor's instructions into the CPU's native instruction.  
A 25 MHz version of the 32-bit VM8600S already has PLAs configured to translate
Intel 80386 instructions.  PLAs to emulate the 68000 family and even the yet to
be shipped 65832 are technically feasible. Unfortunately, samples of the 
microprocessor probably won't be available in the United States for about a 
year. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

On Reflection.

A new display technology for portable computers and

television sets has been developed by Reflection

Technology.  The device called the Private Eye is a 1 by 1.2 by 1.3 inch 
monocular headset weighing less than 2 ounces that produces an image that 
appears to float in space about two feet in front of the viewer.  The 
resolution is 720 by 280 pixels and should be available in quantity in about 8 
months for around $200 retail.  - InfoWorld 1 August

Color LCD.

Casio has a new color Liquid Crystal Display screen with 200,000 pixels in a 
six inch screen.  Resolution is said to be the equal of a standard CRT.  - 
Random Access 20 August

Vision System for Mac II.

Machine vision, held back by closed proprietary platforms, could turn the 
corner now that Automatix, Inc., of Billerica, MA, has announced Autovision 90 
and, with it, an industry first - Compatability with an open, standard platform
- namely, Apple's Macintosh II. Called Automatix Standard Application Package, 
or ASAP, the software accepts any RS170 interlaced-frame camera.  A minimum 
system which includes a frame-grabber board, high-resolution color or 
monochrome monitor, ASAP software, and RAIL programming language starts at 
$18,000. - Electronic Design, June 9, 1988 (forwarded by Tom Metro)

Subject: TITO statistics 

Note: TXS confidential

I have the map from disk and write to tape portion of TITO working, tested
and benchmarked against the standard (SYS)TITO.  I had directories made using
(SYS)TITO of all tapes written with both versions of TITO.

On system 33, with a minimal load (not a controlled single user environment)
Saving (SYS)*.* took 20 minutes with TITO
                took  8 minutes with TITO-P

On system 32, with the static sys-jobs (again not completely controlled)
Saving ALL (for 1 tape) took 52 minutes with TITO
                        took 18 minutes with TITO-P
                        took 17 minutes with TITO-P (minor change to loop)

All times are approximate... within one-minute.

TITO-P is approximately 3 times faster than TITO.

Subject: re: SPAGES.SYS writing 

Joe,
  There is "sort of" a way to get the page information for SPAGES.SYS
without without too much trouble...

  VDSKPT AC,    ; where ac/ memory page

  First, we lookup SPAGES.SYS to get the size.
  Then we do a DSKCHR on the STR to get the # pages in STR and each UNIT.
  The number of units is deduceable from the DSKCHR info.
  The size of SPAGES div #-UNITS = 2 times pages per cylinder and gives
      the offset into SPAGES per unit.
  This offset div 2 = Max pages we want to write per unit, thereby only
      using 1 cylinder of the 2 on each unit that SPAGES uses.
  Then we do CHANIO .chMFP each of the pages we wish to scribble in
      for safety's sake (and we do want to compare info later).
  Now that it's mapped, we use VDSKPT to get the retrieval pointer on disk
      for each page "before" we overwrite it.
  To overwrite it, we take the retrieval pointer, calculate the appropriate
      structure page that matches the <UNIT>B16+<PAGE> and super-map that
      page read/write and then scribble in it and unmap both pages.

**This is still much less work than deciphering rib data structures in a
  user program, and depending on things that ONLY the monitor and DSKCLN
  ought to know in the first place!

Craig,
  What this means is that writing SPAGES is simple and straight-forward and
the extra steps taken here will provide greater reliability that QIKSAV will
NOT damage anything on the disk.  If SPAGES doesn't exist, it will report it
as such and maybe write a disk file, but won't just go scribbling on various
unknown cylinders, corrupting the file system in an effor to save it.

******************************************************************************
 
Within the next 30 days, several OnTyme accounts in NSC and Diversified will be
restructured.  This is being done to reduce the number of accounts and to
provide account names that are more intuitive.
 
Please pay close attention to any memos sent out to you regarding these changes.
You will receive more specific information, including a diagram of the affected
accounts, by the end of next week.
 
Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: SYSDAT, SYSSHO 

A newer version of SYSDAT and SYSSHO have been propagated to (CARL) on
all KL-10s in TYMNET.  Didn't do B39 or the 2020's except :17.

SYSDAT corrects a bug which overwrote the high-order 5 bits of the 12-bit
apr serial number with ones in the data.

SYSSHO now displays a new field after the memory usage "m%%" which is the
percentage of user memory required to meet the need of memory usage.  It
contains a slight hack, assuming the size of the running monitor is the size
to deduct from the amount of physical memory available for each sample, to
determine user available memory.



Note:  This change is in response to monitoring D56 when they get to adding
more memory.  For Sept.. the approx. highest usage was 350%, with the normal
usage above 150%, only a few periods that fell below 100%.

Subject: Rainbow Kermit qustion 

When running KERMIT on the rainbow, it appears that it changes the non-shift
of the ~ key to ESC.  That's very nice and kind of it.  I have my MUX setup
to use accent-grave as the escape character.  How do I type it in MSKERMIT?

Is there some key combination that will do it?  Or am I S.O.L. ?

The command to do the translation is in the MSKERMIT.INI file.
I'm not sure which other key it uses to create ~, but you can disable the
translation by editing the INI file.  It might be mentioned in the Rainbow
specific chapter of the manual, something like MSXRB1.DOC.

Subject: Another Rainbow-kermit question 

Joe,
  2 things...

  I found out what was necessary from a hardware point of view to deinstall
  and re-install the hard drive.  In fact, it is now in the rainbow I have
  at home (at least temporarily).  Do you know when the last time you were
  able to do anything with the CP/M partition on the disk?  Was it before or
  after the rainbow was shipped to Tom Ellis?  Any ideas what might have
  happened to the CP/M boot?

  Does KERMIT, or MSKERMIT (since there seems to be 2 versions available) do
  anything to disable the "switch-to-printer" escape sequence coming from the
  host?  I cannot get ~TYPE to function properly when running KERMIT.  If I
  use print-screen then I get the extra stuff or worse miss part of the
  beginning...  At present, it seems ridiculous to have to get out of KERMIT
  and go into terminal emulation mode just to print a file with compressed
  print... {sigh}


(Yes, I found out about the .INI stuff, and where to find ~ and ` ).  Thanks!

Actually "LOG PRN" and "CONN" ... but that has the same effect as ^-print-screen
and the same problems...

Is there a transparency mode or something that needs to be set?

I checked the CP/M partition after it cam back from Tom Ellis.
It was working then, but I have no idea as to where the CPM boot floppy went
to.  (I was very disturbed to find it missing!) 

I just check the doc file for version 2.31 (which came out this summer).
It says that $[5i and friends do work with latest version - I think you
are running 2.29c or so.  I will try to obtain the new version at the next
Silicon Valley Rainbow Users Group meeting this week.

Thanks for the info, and for trying to get the latest version.

A CP/M question about formatting... what would you say if the problem if
every disk I try to format comes back looking like:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
??___?_?_??_???????_?___??___?_???________?__?__?_?_?_________???_???_????_???__

I've already swapped in a new set of floppy disks since I lost my A drive over
the weekend, and in all cases, I seem to get lots of errors.  I tried running
FNDBAD60 on a few of the disks and they found 3 or 4 bad sectors, but said the
rest were OK.  It created [UNUSED].BAD or whatever.  I then tried using PIP to
copy files onto the disk with the [UNUSED] file and it reported writing errors
in the same first sector and aborted.  {sigh}

I also tried the B drive, and some disks that formatted fine a month ago... but
now say they're bad.  (Should I give up?)

The people at DECTECH (who do maintenance on Rainbows) usually junk RX50's
that have problems.  (Easier and cheaper to swap than to fix.)  Try disassembling
the drive and checking for dust.  Otherwise swap with one of the unused
Rainbows.

I did swap them... I got the errors on all three drives I tried.  However
all of them (except the trashed A drive) can read floppies fine.  Formatting

The version running everywhere was dated Aug-79.  It used <JRST .-1> to
keep polling for incoming characters.  There was a version in SSPAMSYM
dated Aug-82, but it had 3 problems.
1. It was loaded with a version of PAM.MAC that had the debugswitch set.
   This made it incompatible with the existing PAM.LOW, and caused I/O
   to unassigned channel due to mismatch.
2. The ACs weren't defined consistently.
3. The routine to do waiting did not have 2 <SOS (P)> instructions to
   retry the AUXCAL that read in characters.

The new version is running everywhere - it hibernates while waiting for input.

ADDENDUM regarding bug fix version 1.5.1

About StuffIt 1.5.1 (8-29-88)

StuffIt 1.5.1 is a bug fix release.  It corrects several problems in 1.5. 
Almost all of these problems were caused by my hasty conversion from 
LightspeedC 2.15 to 3.0.  In the conversion, I expected that everything will be
identical.  (A legitimate assumption.)  Unfortunately, that assumption was 
false.  As a result, quite a few, both innocuous and serious, bugs crept into 
1.5.  All known problems as of today (and I think we caught most of them) have 
been corrected in 1.5.1.

The bugs corrected are:

1. Operation of TEXT add has been restored.

2. A disk error during compression (usu. disk full) no longer crashes machine. 
3. On larger HDs, free space may be reported as negative.  Fixed 4. Aborting a 
HMF add and keeping the partially added HMF sometimes results in

   a corrupted entry.  Fixed.

Though it isn't a major improvement, performance under MultiFinder has been 
improved to the extent that running StuffIt in the background is now tolerable 
-- not great, but tolerable.

Knowing that Inside Mac has been particularly sketchy about how to write 
control definition functions, I finally got around to taking up the task.  The 
following is a stuffit archive of source, lightspeed c projects and a macpaint 
document that allows a push-on/push-off button to be defined as a control.  It 
is by no means complete as far as the control definition function is concerned,
as buttons do not require dragging, tracking or region calculation, but it will
serve as a decent skeleton to start from.

[SoundMaster 1.1 cdev]

SoundMaster is a shareware Control Panel device from Bruce Tomlin, and is a 
godsend to those of you who like to have various Mac sounds replaced with your 
very own digitized sounds.  The various features include

       o   Specific sounds for the following operations

*  Startup

*  Shutdown

*  Restart

*  Disk Eject

*  Disk Insert

*  Bad Disk

*  System Beep

*  Key Click

       o   Plays SoundCap, SoundWave, and SoundEdit files at ALL 4 SAMPLING

RATES!  (No more 22 kHz startup sounds...).  It does not read snd

resources.

       o   Individual volume settings for each sound.

       o   Each sound can be stored anywhere in or under the System Folder.

       o   You can play the sounds inside SoundMaster, to test for the right

sampling rate.

This has allowed me to dump CheapBeep, SoundInit, ShutdownSound, MacII, MacPuke
and MacFeedMe.  VERY handy, and I've had no problems with it.

   Standard Disclaimer   I have no connections with Bruce Tomlin, other than

DriveLock - an INIT that "locks" floppy drives

Here is a little piece of work I had to do a couple of weeks ago. It's called 
DriveLock, and maybe it is of some use to you ...

   DriveLock is a simple INIT that  "locks"  floppy  drives.  This  means

that during the normal course of operation of a Macintosh a disk  will

   no longer be ejectable from a that drive. DriveLock arose out  of  the

   need  to  prevent  students  in  a  university  Macintosh  lab   from:

   o       booting with their own Startup disks (usually with old versions  of

      the  System,  and  without  AppleShare  and  AppleTalk  ImageWriter

      drivers); this  caused  all  kinds  of unnecessary network problems

   o  taking the university-supplied Startup  disks  home  "by accident".

   DriveLock can also be useful for demonstration  machines  at  computer

   shows, or for dealers, where you want people to be  able  to  use  the

   machine  without  being  able  to  take  inserted  floppies  home   or

inserting their own floppies for copying ...

And then it can be great fun to put a copy of DriveLock in a  friend's

   (or enemy's) System Folder while  s/he  isn't looking ...  you  didn't

hear this from me!

The assembly language source is included.

Subject: Black and White XFCN

Here is an XFCN that returns whether or not Hypercard's card window is on a 
black and white (i.e. 2 color or 1 bit) screen.  This is most useful for being 
able to make Hypercard call the Switch-a-Roo FKEY automatically with my DoFKEY 
XCMD.  Please note that Hypercard will only do it's visual effects if the card 
window is on the main screen (i.e. the one with the menu bar) so this XFCN does
not tell you if Hypercard will do it's visual effects, but since you have to 
move the card to another window, I figure you will know that and script 
accordingly.

Subject: QVT - a shareware terminal emulator (2 parts)

This posting contains QVT, a shareware terminal emulator for the

Macintosh.  QVT has the following features:

-  VT52, VT100 and VT220 emulation.

-  Support for both old-style and ADB keyboards.

-  Support for XMODEM, YMODEM, Kermit, and XMODEM-with-MacBinary

   protocols.

-  Autodialing (and demon dialing) using Hayes-compatible modems. -  Permits 
configuration of the "delete" key (sends either BS or DEL),

   screen (cursor type, smooth or fast scrolling, auto-newline, etc.), serial 
   interface (speed, parity, etc.), and auto-dial phone number. Configurations 
   can be saved;  double-clicking on a configuration file launches the 
   emulator, loads the configuration, and brings up the autodialer dialog box 
   if a phone number has been entered.

I've tested the program for a couple of days.  It's been a solid performer 
during those limited tests;  there were no unexpected errors or bombs.  The 
Kermit and MacBinary XMODEM protocols seem to work OK; I haven't tried YMODEM, 
and the Kermit protocol support doesn't appear to include sliding-windows or 
large packets.  The program refers to the MacBinary-encoded XMODEM protocol 
simply as "MacBinary";  this is a bit of a misnomer, as MacBinary can run on 
top of XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM, Kermit, or any other file-transfer protocol.

There appear to be a few rough spots and limitations in its use of the Mac 
toolbox QVT doesn't run in the background under MultiFinder, and doesn't use 
SFPutFile during downloads (thus making it difficult to download files into a 
directory other than the one that the program is stored in).  Hayes-modem 
support appears adequate, although not exceptional; for example, it appears to 
be impossible to embed mode-change strings in the "phone number to dial" field.
 The program switches the modem from "verbose" to "numeric" result codes, and 
leaves it that way when you exit.

The program is pretty easy to use, although it's clear that there are features 
that can only be used if you have access to the documentation (for which you 
must send in the $50 shareware fee).  I haven't decided yet whether to pay the 
shareware fee for this program, or to buy a copy of VersaTerm.

Date: 31-AUG-1988 21:55 by DWOOD

CELLULAR AUTOMATONS v0.1 (8/31/88)

This application calculates and displays the evolution of an array of cellular 
automatons and was inspired by the August 1988 Computer Recreations article by 
A.K. Dewdney in Scientific American.  These automatons function like the 
automatons of the "game" of life, but instead of being dead or alive, each has 
a degree of "infection." The array of cells with various states of health is 
displayed as a color coded image. Because it uses Color Quickdraw, *this 
program will only run on a Mac II* (or the rumored color SE!).  It can run in 
the background under MultiFinder and so a postage stamp size window can sit on

Subject: Retouch Version 1.2

Retouch, an image-processing/retouching/special-effects program for the Mac

512KE, Plus, SE, and II.  With Retouch you can:

* Manipulate both black-and-white (bitonal) and 8-bit gray-scale images. * Open
and save images in TIFF, compressed TIFF, and MacPaint formats. * Convert 
images from one format to another, and convert PICTs to images. * Print images 
on an ImageWriter or LaserWriter printer. * Transfer images to or from other 
programs using the clipboard or TIFF files. * Cut, copy, and paste selected 
areas. * Blend multiple images with a large selection of special effects. * Cut
out selected areas, trim away unneeded background, or crop images to a

   given size.

* Enlarge or reduce images by percentage or to a given size.

* Rotate images to any angle.

* Flip images left-to-right or top-to-bottom.

* Fill selected areas with any of 63 shades of gray, as well as black and

   white.

* Change brightness and contrast of selected areas. * Apply sophisticated 
image-processing techniques to enhance low-quality

   images.

* Smooth or sharpen selected areas.

* Trace edges.

* Magnify or shrink an image by any percentage.

* Choose from two levels of quality (fast or best).

* Choose from three halftoning methods.

* Change image resolution (dots per inch) to any value. * Convert images from 
bitonal to gray-scale, or vice-versa.

[This posting contains the Retouch application, documentation in MacWrite 
format, and a sample image.  Retouch is Shareware.]

Requires StuffIt for decompression.

This posting is version 1.2.  It includes a workaround for a bug in MacScan 
TIFF files and a fix for a LaserWriter printing problem, but otherwise is 
identical to version 1.0.

[THINK C 3.0 => 3.0p2 patcher, Binhexed Stuffit 1.4 file, 105 lines]

Major excerpts from (included) Read Me file:

7/25/88

This is a set of patches that fixes bugs in 3.0.

The patch program, "THINK C => 3.0p2", transforms your version 3.0

into version 3.0p2.

Bugs fixed

----------

(1)  In the "MF Attrs" pop-up menu in the "Set Project Type" dialog, the bit 
assignments for "MultiFinder-aware" and "Suspend & Resume Events" were 
reversed.

(2)  If the first argument to a macro call did not appear on the same line as 
the '(' preceding it, the compiler crashed.  This happened only when debugging 
was turned on.

(3)  Using the "Clear" command or key with a struct/array window frontmost

sometimes crashed the debugger.

(4)  Generating a 68881 "FTST d(An)" instruction sometimes crashed the

compiler.

(5)  Under MultiFinder, a DA opened (using the option key) in THINK C's or 
THINK C Debugger's layer did not always receive its update events.

(6)  When compiling very large files, there was a glitch in the line

count display.  This was a cosmetic problem only.

(7)  Incorrect code was generated for a conditional expression under

certain obscure conditions.

Subject: TEX v.0.5 .sit.hqx free-text real-time indexer/browser HC

Subject: stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is the file tex.0.5.sit.hqx, which has to be 
run through BINHEX and then STUFFIT to recover.  It's the HyperCard stack 
that's the shareware extended/enhanced/improved version of my old effort Texas.
 TEX (no relation to TeX or typesetting, obviously), like Texas, can be used to
build complete inverted indices to arbitrarily-large completely unstructured 
free-text files (which I call 'dataspaces') ... and like Texas, TEX lets you 
scroll around in an index window, click on a word to call up a 
key-word-in-context view of all of the occurrences of that word and its 
neighbors, click on a line in that Context view to jump immediately into the 
actual text of your dataspace at that point, and copy/paste anything you read 
from that Text view into notes or other material you're working on.

But in addition to what Texas allowed, TEX shows you multiple windows into a 
dataspace's Index view (independently scrollable), TEX lets you browse through 
multiple dataspaces (just copy the browsing Card and paste in extra copies), 
and TEX has 'subspace' browsing (a form of proximity search that's very 
friendly and nicely intuitive).  TEX is also much better designed graphically 
(thanks to help from Andreas Vichr) and is much easier for users to customize 
or extend at the HyperTalk scripting level.

TEX contains complete documentation, and the C source code for all of its XFCNS
is available separately (I'll try to post it to you here next).  The license 
fee requested is $10 for individual/family/nonprofit/educational users, and $40
for corporate users.  I would greatly appreciate any comments, suggestions for 
improvements, bug reports, etc. from anybody who tries the stack.

   Best,   ^z

Mark Zimmermann, 9511 Gwyndale Dr., Silver Spring, MD  20910

P.S.  if you can't get the .sit.hqx files off the net, you can send me a 
self-addressed stamped envelope, a formatted Mac disk, and $15 (which includes 
the individual license fee, refundable if you don't like TEX) and I'll put TEX 
0.5, the source code, qndxr, MultIndexer, brwsr, Texas version 0.27, and 
whatever else fits on there for you ... I really hate to spend time duplicating
disks, though, so please don't write unless there is no other way.  The same 
disk should be available from BMUG and other places in a few weeks....  
Apologies for mentioning money (pls feel free to delete this postscript, 
moderator!), but I don't want to be in the disk duping business any more!!

Subject: Texas v.0.27 HC indexer/browser free public-domain stack

Appended below, if all goes well, is a BINHEX'd, STUFFIT'd file of the latest 
version of Texas, 0.27 -- please discard all previous versions, as this one 
fixes some bugs in them that may cause trouble in the Merge Indices operation 
and elsewhere.

Texas, as previously described, is a free, public-domain HyperCard stack which 
lets you build complete inverted indices to big (hundreds of megabytes) 
unstructured text files, and then browse through those indices, clicking and 
retrieving key-word-in-context and full-text displays.  This version 0.27 is (I
hope!) the last one I'm going to work on, as it's superseded by TEX (posted 
separately with its source code) ... Texas lacks the subspace browsing 
(proximity search) and the multi-dataspace abilities of TEX, but it is free.  
If anybody wants to use Texas (or TEX) to build improved systems which have 
additional capabilities, I would be most pleased (provided you sell or 
otherwise distribute it at a rational price, rather than $30,000/copy -- sorry 
for editorializing, but the current price structure for inverted index systems 
is rather out of line, in my humble opinion!).  I took Texas and built TEX from
it; you may want to do the same.  Contact me for source code, or check around 
on the networks/boards....

Best,  ^z

Appended below, if all goes well, is a file containing all of the TEX (version

There are 4 external functions, two of which are pretty major (to build indices
and to browse through the index files and format data for HyperCard 
Index/Context/Text view fields).  Have fun with them!  ^z Mark Zimmermann, 9511

MacSnoop(TM) 1.4.4 Demo, 5 Aug 88, by Art A. Schumer, Shareware $25.

[upload from Boston Computer Society's Mac BBS & abstract by Jon Spear]

From the program's "Shareware Notice" text:

   "MacSnoop is a file/volume editor that was developed to help fill the gap 
   left by FEDIT since its departure from the shareware market. MacSnoop is 
   both HFS and MFS compatible and tries to adhere to the Macintosh interface 
   as closely as possible.

   "Some of the advanced features include support for any hard disk up to 512M 
   in size, the use of multiple windows for file/volume editing as well as 
   directory windows to allow you to perform common file tasks such as 
   renaming, deleting, locking, unlocking, attribute setting and informational 
   display."

MacSnoop (like the commercial programs MacZap Tools, Symantec Tools, FEDIT, and
Copy II's MacTools) lets you view/edit any block of a file or disk volume in 
hex or ASCII. These programs differ in user interface and features.

The included MacWrite-format user manual (dated 17 July 1988) includes a two 
page listing of bug fixes and incremental improvements through v1.3.1.

Version "1.4.4 Demo" doesn't explain what's changed or what improvements might 
be found in a non-demo version, but this is fully functional, NOT crippleware.

MacSnoop should work with Mac 512KE, Plus, SE, and II, but may have problems 
with pre-512KE machines with 64K ROMs. Multifinder compatible.

I have version 2.31 of KERMIT for the DEC Rainbow available for
downloading from The Pot of Gold Fido (1:109/483) at 1-703-359-6549.
The BBS supports 300-2400 baud, and you can download with XMODEM,
MODEM7 or KERMIT.  The versions for the IBM and GRiD are also available
at the same BBS.

	MSKERM.ARC	Documentation for Version 2.31
	KERRB.ARC	DEC RAINBOW version

FidoNet (or FidoNet compatable) nodes can file request either or both of
these files during non-ZMH hours.

                     HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THE NEW IDS?
                     ********************************


              To figure out a new ID, merely change the OLD 
                   account name to the NEW account name




         For example, Dick Kovach's ID is FIN.R/KOVACH.  His new ID,
         starting 9-26, will be NSC.R/KOVACH.  

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > FIN.R/KOVACH
                     NEW ONTYME ID === > NSC.R/KOVACH



         Another example is Dick Gunther's ID.  His new ID, starting 10-3
         will be NSCMS.D/GUNTHER.

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > TYM.D/GUNTHER
                    NEW ONTYME ID === > NSCMS.D/GUNTHER


Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Osman,
  After you left on Thursday, I talked to Joe and here is what we decided
to do with who was on-call.

Scheduled: 9/12- 9/18 Joe     Actual:  9/12- 9/14 Joe   M -W  3
           9/19- 9/25 Carl    Actual:  9/15- 9/21 Carl  Th-W  7
           9/26-10/02 Osman   Actual:  9/22-10/02 Joe   Th-W  7 Th-Sn 4
          10/03-10/09 Joe     Actual: 10/03-10/09 Osman M -Sn 7
          10/10-10/16 Carl    --back on schedule--      M -Sn 7

Since I am going to be off Th-Sn with visiting relatives, I shifted my week
back 4 days, with Joe taking the first 3 and last 4 days of his scheduled
week a week apart.

Then, since we're both going to be out-of-town for 3 1/2 days, Joe will swap
with your scheduled week.  This gives Joe a week and 1/2 at once, but keeps
the swap uncomplicated and gets us back on schedule.

This also allows me to be available to go to St. Louis for a couple of days
in the first week of October.

So, I am on call!

Subject: TOPS-10 Accounting system 

Walt,

  I need to talk with you about installing the new accounting system on
the TOPS-10 KL in Saint Louis.  I have already built the initial versions
of the data gathering, account summary and reporting programs.

  What still needs to be done is:

  1)  Install a filter to read the raw accounting records written by AT&T's
      accounting DAEMON.  (Later, we want to modify their DAEMON to add the
      characters read/written information... but that isn't necessary yet!
      When that phase is ready we will need whatever co-operation is necessary
      from AT&T so that we don't mess up their billing programs.)

  2)  Obtain whatever co-operation we need from AT&T to allow us to rebuild
      and release newer versions of certain system utility programs.  These
      include the accounting DAEMON, and the MONITOR.

      Note:  We are not asking for information about their billing system,
      (which I am told they are unwilling to give us), we are asking for the
      co-operation (or authority) to modify certain specific programs which
      I have identified as direct interfaces to the new accounting modules so
      that both accounting systems may co-exist thru the end of December.

  3)  I need to start the ball rolling and setup a meeting with you and your
      group (to show you the possible detailed information we can provide) and
      at least a second day to have us meet with someone in accounting to
      determine what they will accept from our system.  (I have the detail
      layouts of the TYMCOM-X RAW ACCOUNTING records, and see where we can
      insert most of the infor from the CUA system, but we need to discuss
      the level of summary/detail we want to pass to CPIPS/MPIPS).


Please give me a call.  (408) 922-6206, secretary (408) 922-6224

I will be out of the office for an off-site meeting until 1pm PST, so if
we cannot arrange for a call today (Tuesday) please contact our secretary
to let me know.   I will also be taking vacation Wednesday afternoon thru
Friday, so I do have some urgency in arranging to talk with you.

Thanks Again.

Subject: InvisiHDMainBo3b

Writing to you from SUNY Albany.  We believe that InvisiHDMainBo3b is where a 
virus is lodging and causing all kinds of problems.  We have it here at the 
University and are having a very difficult timing eradicating it.  It acts like
the SCORES virus, but not as quickly.  Eventually it eroded our systems 
resources making it very difficult to even erase the hard disk. The reason we 
think the virus is lodging in InvisiHDMainBo3b is Apple's Vaccine program 
identifies it as a questionable INIT file, but tells us to relax.  In the 
meantime, the system, finder, printing resources, etc. are being modified every
time we turn on the machine, plus other times in no kind of pattern.

We though we had eradicated the virus in August to find that while bringing 
back files one at a time from our back-ups and checking each one, it was 
reintroduced again.  When you are a true Mac User (not programmer) everything 
you find about viruses is in programmese; even the instructions on how to get 
rid of the virus.  Any tips (in English) would be appreciated.  We contacted 
the local Mac User group with no real solutions.  There are several macs on 
campus infected, and the university doesn't support mac so there is no help 
there.

Thanks again.  Laurie Webster-Saft, The University at Albany,

Some of the Mac archives that I've logged on to have things divided into 
several different directories rather than all being in the same directory. 
Instead of naming everything "INIT..." and "GAME..." and "HC..." and ... 
couldn't you create directories called "INIT", "GAME", "HC", etc.?  It would 
make it much easier to find stuff, as well as to get lists of what is there 
without burning up as much time on my end or on yours.  Please let me know if 
you plan to do this or why you can't if you don't.

Subject: Backup of A/UX systems

We have recently purchased a MacII with A/UX (internal). The MacII runs off an 
ethernet populated with Suns. I have backed up the whole A/UX to a tape using 
one of the sun tapestations (using NFS).

The problem/question is: What do I do if I get a disastrous diskcrash on A/UX 
(everything wiped out) - how do I get the system up again? Assume that I have 
SASH on a floppy, and (if it helps) also have the A/UX system on a bunch of 
floppies besides the tape.

I cannot find anything in the manuals - they assume that any restore operation 
already has A/UX running. And I would like to avoid buying a backup disk, it 
would be such a waste of money in our environment of file- and tapeservers.

Cheers.

Subject: Document Numbering on a Mac

   Our lab recently made the transition from a Wang VS-100 system to a system 
with Mac SE's and Mac II's tied together with LocalTalk and Kinetics boxes to 
our Ethernet backbone. Part of our staff does research and part is the 
administrative support for that research.

   One of the problems we have had in the transition lies in the area of 
keeping track of documents. In our old system the Wang assigned a document 
number to each new document. Since all the terminals were connected to the 
VS-100, we had no problems sharing documents.

   Now with a more decentralized system, and with 30 staff people generating 
documents on their individual machines, we want to find a way to assign a 
document number to each document generated on each of the Macs, so that the 
document number can be placed at the bottom of each printed copy of the 
document.

   Does anyone know of an easy way to generated document numbers? We have 
written a HyperCard shell to do it, but it is cumbersome and does not follow 
the standard Mac "look and feel" guidelines. I cannot believe that there is not
an easier way.

Subject: Ram Disks and MPW

We are dying a slow death running MPW. We know that Microsoft C on the PC can 
be run effectively with ram disks to increase performance and we have heard 
that the same can be done with MPW. So far we haven't had any luck. We have 
tried two programs, which we think are shareware or freeware: RamStart 1.32 and
RamDisk+ 1.4.  RamStart was on our Jasmine drive so it might be shareware, but 
RamDisk+ was on a BMUG disk so I assume it's freeware.

In any case, we haven't had any success using these programs with MPW. A while 
ago one guy tried RamDisk+ 1.4 and claimed that there was no performance 
improvement. Recently someone else here tried RamStart with System 6.01 (with 
and without multifinder) on a 5mb Mac II. However, when we double-clikc 
RamStart it crashes with "CanUt Mount the Ramdisk --- error -108."

So here's my questions:

Have you used a ram disk to increase MPW performance successfully? Which Ram 
Disk do you recommend? And how do you use it? If it's not one I have, where do 
you get it? Is it shareware, commercial ware, etc.? And what system is it 
working on?

Has anyone gotten RamStart to work with system 6.0 or 6.01? Is there any

documentation -- we don't seem to have any?

Any other suggestions?

thanks,

I'm trying to find a source for a large (> 500 MB) SCSI disk with drivers for a

researching "electronic book" issues.  If we ever decide to cut a CD-ROM, I 
understand that we can send such a large disk to 3M and they will master it 
onto a CD for us.

Any information on suppliers, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I have info on
CMS Enhancements disks, but their drives are broken up into 300 MB physical 
drives, and I want a single volume (I am not willing to rewrite a SCSI driver 
to act that way, either).  I am also familiar with the WORM drive that Corel

PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE WITH IP ADDRESSING, SUBNETTING MACS to SUN WORKSTATIONS:

We are completing installation and configuration of a campus-wide Ethernet LAN.
 We have 250+ macintoshes distributed around campus, which are connected via 
Kinetics Fastpath 4 gateways, and which can make use of AlisaShare and Alisa 
Print System software on a VAX 8810 (vms 4.7). We also have a network of 9 Sun 
workstations, 8 of which use the ninth as a file server.  We are extending 
their ThinWire Ethernet cable to a DEMPR (ThinWire Repeater) and then to a 
DEBET (Thick wire Bridge), with the net (pun?) result of including their 
ethernet into the main campus LAN. We would like to use a Mac TCP/IP (NCSA 
Telnet or MacIP) so that the Macs can be used to log in to the Sun workstations
(or any other TCP host on our LAN).  Unfortunately, we must have the Macs and 
the Suns on different logical IP Subnets.

HERE'S THE QUESTION:  Does anyone have any experience with NCSA Telnet (or some
other Mac IP/telnet program in a similar situation?  We are currently

Subject: Wanted, dead or alive: Experience with Lang. Sys. Fortran

Is there anyone using Language Systems (MPW) Fortran?  For scientific number 
crunching, I've tried and nearly given up on Absoft's MacFortran/ 020. LSF 
[that's Language Systems, not LightSpeed :-(] is surely superior to Absoft, but
how good is it really?  I would like to know anyone's experience (good and bad)
with it.  Questions of interest include: 1. Speed (compile and execution time).
 The first version was reportedly slow, but they now advertise version 1.1.  
Has speed improved? 2. What else has changed? 3. Does it really support most 
VAX extensions?  How easy would it be to download a working VAX fortran file 
and run it? 4. How does it support namelist, for example? 5. What kind of 
support for 68020 and 68881 code does it have? 6. What does it do about the 
famous 32k segment limit?  They advertise support for large arrays, but what 
does that really mean? 7. What about code segmentation?  Does the user have to 
segment his program into < 32k segments in the normal Mac way?  At least Absoft
got around that by using > 16 bit offsets, but what about the MPW environment? 
Does the MPW linker require < 32k segments? 8. How easy is it to use really?  I
assume that since it is MPW, it is "Mac-like" in the redefined sense of MPW.  
But how does one choose among various compile time options, for example? 9. 
What kind of debugging support is there?  Are they waiting on SADE with MPW 
3.0? 10. For extra money, one is suppose to get a year's worth of upgrades. 
Does anyone know what is supposed to be added in the coming year(s). 11. How 
easy is it to call C routines? 12. How about Mac toolbox access? 13. And, most 
importantly, DOES IT GENERATE CORRECT CODE? 14. anything else of interest

I have also seen the Absoft ads offering an improved/faster Fortran for the MPW
environment sometime soon.  Does anyone have any knowledge at all about that?  
Could it be any better than the "normal" MacFortran?

Why does it seem that there are faster (i.e., better optimized, I guess) 
Fortrans for other 68020 machines (Suns, for example) than for the Mac II? 
Since the CPU hardware (68020 + 68881) is the same, is there some other 
fundamental hardware difference (bus or memory speed, perhaps) that makes the 
difference?  Or is the Mac OS slwoing things down somehow?  Or is it just that 
there has never been a lot of demand for good Fortran on the Mac so no one has 
ever produced or ported a good compiler.  Except Absoft, of course, and that 
hasn't worked out too well.

Thanks.  I will summarize to the net if I get individual replies.

any good?  How about interfacing to the Mac OS?

Subject: RamStart woes

Hello,

   Sorry if this has already been asked and answered, but I've been

unable to get the digests for a long time.

        Is anyone else getting the "Sigh. Programmer error -23" when they try 
to start up RamStart (either 1.32 or 1.4) under the current system/finder (that
is, 6.0 system/6.1 finder).  I can't get it to run, and would like to.

        If that program is broken now, is there another ramdisk program that 
works under the 6.0 system/6.1 finder combination?

   thanks,

Subject:  Re: overhead projectors

This note is a response to discussion in May issues of Info-Mac.  Those issues 
were not distributed over Bitnet until this week, hence the apparent delay. 
Down to the point.  I have recently checked the market for devices allowing to 
project Macintosh screen using overhead projectors.  I came up with a list of 
several companies selling such attachments.  Here they are

   product name      company                 phone

   QA-50             Sharp Electronics       800/be-sharp

   MacViewFrame      nView                   604/873-1354

   DataShow HR       Eastman Kodak           716/724-3169

   Mac-Screen Overhead  Ask LCD              404/399-5208

   FlatTop           Network Specialties     212/995-2224

   PC Viewer         In Focus Systems        503/692-4968

   Macnifier         Comtrex Limited         714/855-6600

They are not listed in any particular order.  I believe that Macnifier is 
marketed the longest of them all.  A few of them (like DataShow) will work with
Mac SE only.  Others require a different board to purchased depending on the 
Macintosh model.  All of them have list prices of the order of $1600 plus/minus
a 100 or so.  Some include video board, others require you to purchase them 
separately (ca. $200).  They also differ on optional stuff. I have seen only 
DataShow in real time.  It appeared to work just fine, although a good (bright)
overhead projector is required for large magnification.  It also seemed to 
follow changes on the screen quite well. The latter was the major complaint in 
the review published a few months ago in MacWorld (or MacUser) covering 2 or 3 
of those LCD devices.  I would like to learn about performance of any of these 
devices.

Subject: Draw II questions

Reply-to: "Charles E. Bouldin" <bouldin@sed.ceee.nbs.gov>

I just got Draw II. It has several notable flaws, or at least some features 
that I need and can't seem to find. First, you cannot draw a circle, or a 
rectangle with dashed lines or a variable pen pattern for the line. This worked
in the old Draw 1.9.5 and is essential.

Also, the zoom in/out tools are very nice, but there is no command key

equivalent for these things.

Am I missing something here? For what it's worth, NO I am not running the 
newest, buggiest system 6.0 (or whatever the number is now) that was just 
released. Does this matter?

[Moderator's Note:

Use the option key on a pattern to get the pen to use it.

Does that qualify as standard?

For other minor thrills, I dare you to get text to Flip Horizontal. They added 
a lot of good stuff, but they forgot some of the basics. The fellow I spoke to 
at MacWorld said that they were addressing these and the PICT2 issue too. --

Subject: MacDraw II question & comments

We just received our copy of MacDraw II the other day and

I'd like to pass on some comments and questions.

This is a good package.  It should take care of most of the design needs that I
have.  It's very much like old MacDraw in operation, so it doesn't take long to
learn.  Some of the features that make this package good are the zooming, the 
layering, and the ability to rotate objects at arbitrary angles.  Also very 
useful are the ability to save various rulers, line styles, and views.  There 
are many other features that make this a great improvement over MacDraw.

There are, however, a few things that could be improved. Color support is only 
the old 8 color, fixed palette, with mixing in patterns used to provide other 
colors.  MacDraw II should support full color.

The ability to draw objects from a center rather than a corner is good, 
especially for circles.  When drawing an arc from the center, the center is 
apparently the centroid of the shape, rather than the center of the circle of 
which the arc is a part.  When I draw an arc from the center, I want to pin 
down the position of the center of the circle.

Dashed lines only work for lines.  You can't make a dashed

circle or polygon.

Pattern fill works as it did on old MacDraw.  A paint-bucket type of fill would
be useful for shading areas bounded by arcs, etc.  Maybe a polygon maker could 
do this:  click in a white area and the program would look for the edges of the
innermost enclosed area, and create a polygon from those edges.  Also, it would
be nice to take two open polygons and connect them into one.  Splitting a 
polygon is easy, just duplicate it and delete the undesired vertices.

More arbitrary alignment features would be good.  For instance, align selected 
points on objects (ie vertices on a polygon)

MacDraw II has plotter support with the MacPlot driver.  I haven't been able to
try it.  Even though we have some plotters, none of them are available to hook 
up, and the driver seems unable to write to a file.  Maybe someone's written a 
cdev or whatever that will reroute the output to a serial port to a file.  
There are problems with switching back and forth between the Laserwriter driver
and the plotter driver.  Quitting the program generally clears them up.

One major problem that I see is the inability to save in a published format 
that retains all of the information in the document.  Saving to the clipboard 
illustrates this problem. Make a color drawing, cut it, paste it into another 
program, copy it out and paste it back into MacDraw II, and the color is lost. 
Even Pict format has 8 color built in.  The rest of the information should at 
least be implemented into PICT comments.

I realize that some of my wants would be provided by a CAD

program, and this program is only $300.

All-in-all, MacDraw II is a good program, and it seems so

far to be bug-free, although I haven't tested it

thouroughly.  Any help with writing plotter info to a file so I can carry it to
a plotter we have would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Mapping software desired...

My home town has recently formed an environmental commission.  One of our key 
missions is to map the environmentally sensitive areas -- that is, areas easily
subject to damage, of unusual quality, or particular historical, recreational 
or scenic beauty.  The information will be used to help protect these areas 
before they become lost forever.

At present, we have many maps with features hand drawn, but the manipulation 
and comparison of the maps becomes very cumbersome.  I know that commercial 
mapping systems exist, but the one's I've seen are very very expensive -- well 
out of the budget for most rural communities.

I'd like to locate some Mac software to facilitate our work.

Most of the maps are on standard topographic scale (7.5' quadrangle) and I have
easy access to scanners that can load the maps into the MAC.

I'd like software that can start with a background figure (basic map) and then 
overlay various features (e.g. geology, land use, wetlands...). Most 
importantly, it would support the capacity to zoom in or out in order to 
examine the details in a map region.  Since a 7.5 min topographic map or town 
is about 3 ft. square, the ability to zoom out is essential to avoid tunnel 
vision.

Does anyone have suggestions or leads for good software packages for the Mac 
(without getting into the multi kilo-$$ systems)?  We'd sure appreciate tools 
to "fight back" from some of the strange ideas proposed by developers.

thanks in advance.

Subject: software for theatre work?

Does anyone out there know of theatre software which runs on IBM-PC's, Apple 
][e's, Atari ST's, Mac's, or Amiga's?  (Sorry for the broad cross- posting, but
it seems there's no net news group specifically set up for things theatrical.)

A friend of mine does set design, and remarked that no program seems to have 
been written with a set designer in mind.  We got to talking about it, and 
decided that choreography could be also made easier with a computer (instead of
having the whole cast out on stage running up and down doing variations of a 
number).  It strikes me that both could be helped a little by a good drawing 
package which allowed the use of different perspectives and of animation, but I
imagine someone who does more theatre work would find a need for facilities I 
haven't thought of.

So, to sum up, does anyone out there know what's available for theatre work, 
particularly set design and choreography, but also lighting, or anything else 
you can think of.

Please send replies directly to me, as I don't subscribe to all of these

digests.

Thanks in advance, David

Subject: MPW's Print command

Recently, I had to write a printer driver to "Appletalk" data to a

print server we put together on our Vax.

Anyways, I seem to be having a bit of a problem with printing from MPW 
occasionally.  I'm not sure, but by the looks of things, MPW's Print command 
doesn't seem to be setting up the first and last page fields of the print job 
subrecord.  Instead, those fields seem to be randomly filled-in (presumably not
filled in).

What I assume it wants is for my driver to just print everything that it sends 
it, which is fair enough.  What I'm doing is "properly" trapping out invalid 
page numbers (page numbers out of range, first page greater than last page, 
etc.) and in those cases defaulting to print all the pages that are sent.  
However, if MPW "sends" me some page combination like 85-113, I have no way of 
knowing that these numbers are wrong, so I print those pages, which usually 
means printing nothing at all, since most documents are a lot shorter than 85 
pages to begin with!

I guess the basic question is, what am I doing wrong, if anything? Is there 
some way to tell that an application is just asking for you to print 
everything?  I haven't found any documentation to that effect, which of course 
doesn't say much.

Any help would definitely be appreciated.  Please send responses to myself 
directly, as I'm not part of the list distribution.  I will summarize any 
findings to the list afterwards.

(While I'm posting anyways, does anyone have any comments on the public domain 
Modula-2 compiler "packaged" as MOD1.HQX-MOD13.HQX?)

Thanks in advance.

Subject: In-use light for 800K drives

Ever since I got my MacII, I've wanted to attach an in-use LED to each of my 
800K floppies.  There are times when certain programs use more than one floppy 
(ignoring the hard disk), and I'd really like to know what is going on.  This 
is particularly important for me since I frequently use II in a Mac, the Apple 
II emulator, which will let one or both floppies operate like Apple II 
Unidisks.

For some reason, Apple does not like including in-use lights on their floppy 
disk drives for the Macintosh. The purpose of these indicators on other 
machines is to let you know the disk is being used and shouldn't be removed 
until the light goes out.  But it's still pretty important to know when it's in
use on the Mac.

Apple DOES include an in-use LED on their 800K "Apple 3.5 drive", but that's 
only because the drive is used on both Apple IIGS and Macintosh. And 
unfortunately, you can't connect an external floppy to the MacII. I managed to 
get a "peek" inside the Apple 3.5 external drive at a local dealer. In addition
to the standard Sony drive/controller combination used on all Apple 800K 
mechanisms, the external drive has a "piggy back" board which attaches between 
the drive controller and the external cable. This board (which has a SONY part 
#) provides a connection for a drive LED, a connection for an intelligent 
manual eject button, and a "pass-through" port for chaining additional drives 
(on the Apple II).  Looking up this part in Apple service literature puts its 
price at ~ $65.00!

I've done a little probing with my DVM, but am unwilling to connect an LED 
without prior knowledge.  A friend of mine tried attaching an LED to one of the
leads on the IR head sensor pair, and ended up blowing his drive (and spending 
over $300 to fix his damage).

So my question is, has anybody successfully attached an in-use light to their 
800K drive?  I know there were a set of drawings for doing this on the 400K 
drives, but the boards for the 800K drives are different.  I have the LED's 
(small rectangular Telefunken brand), but am not willing to play around finding
a connection.  What I'd like is a set of detaild instructions (including 
current-matching or other warnings) of where to connect the LED, what other 
devices (resistor values, caps, transistors?) to attach between the board and 
the indicator.

Thanks in advance!

Subject: MacII audio port

When Apple introduced the Macintosh II, I was under the distinct impression 
from Apple's own engineers that the sound capabilities of the MacII were 
significantly better than the MacPlus and SE.  For one, the MacII allows 
sampling rates of up to 44KHz, as opposed to 22KHz on the Plus/SE. This allows 
for accurate reproduction of sampled frequencies as high as 22KHz. But this 
would be expected for a higher-speed processor such as the 68020. 
(Unfortunately, the standard serial ports aren't capable of transferring the 
data from sounds sampled at greater than 22KHz).

The MacII also includes a specialized sound chip, and a line-level audio port. 
I had heard that Apple includes a set of Sony pre-amps on the motherboard, and 
that the audio port is a mini-stereo jack of the type used in stereo walkmans.

However, the Apple Interface Guide for service engineers shows the pinouts for 
the MacII. This guide lists the MacII audio port as a MONORAL mini phone jack 
of the type used on the SE, Plus, and earlier Macs.

So I have two questions:

1) Is the MacII audio port a mini-stereo or standard monoral phone jack?

   If it is monoral, how do you have to buy a special card to get stereo sound?

2) With the advent of System 6.0 (forget about the sound bugs), and the Inside

   Mac Vol.5 Sound Manager implemented in RAM on the Plus and SE, what 
   advantage does the Apple custom digital sound chip in the II offer?  I 
   haven't seen any MacII-specific music software, or am I missing something?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Mac II ROM Query

I have a Mac+ with a Novy Systems 68020 accelerator board. One option in the 
support software is "copy ROM into high-speed 32 bit RAM". I use that option 
routinely and it makes a very large performance difference. Which leads to the 
questions about the Mac II ROM: 1. Is it 32 bits wide? 2. Is it accessed at 
full processor speed?

I would *guess* that the answer to those questions is yes, but Apple has cut so
many corners in the past that I am not sure. Anyone know ? If the answer to 
either question is NO, then copying the ROM into RAM may speed up the Mac II.

We need to limit access to our laserwriters either locally or on other zones.

Is there any software/hardware to do this???

Apparently there is a gateway to AppleLink accessible from the interNet.

Subject: MacApp versus LSP 2.0 Comments

I spoke with the developers of LightSpeed Pascal 2.0 at MacWorld and then took 
Dave Wilson's MacApp class wherein we spoke a bit about LSP versus MacApp. 
Here's the situation as I understand it.

LSP cannot handle either the conditional compilation directives or the 
segmentation directives of MPW Pascal (TML Pascal II can).  The LSP people said
that they were hacking/getting a version of MacApp that would be specially 
treated for LSP.  Dave Wilson said he thought that might fly but that Kurt 
Schmucker apparently lambasted the LSP people saying that no one wanted to buy 
another version of MacApp, which is quite true.  I've paid enough for all the 
various versions of MacApp that I haven't used. :-)

Apparently the segmentation problem is the more massive one as LSP places an 
entire unit into a segment while MPW Pascal and MacApp can and do place any 
routine into any segment.  For example, all the methods of an object are 
defined in the same unit, but the debugging routines all go into the debugging 
segment, printing routines into the printing segment, etc.

Only time will tell...

Subject: PowerEdit DA LaserWriter Problem

I have been using the  PowerEdit DA, a simple but powerful text editor, to edit
long files.  (PowerEdit can handle files >32K).  The text appears on the screen
as Monaco (I think). When I try to print it on our LaserWriters, it comes out 
as Chicago, whether I leave "font substitution" checked or unchecked; except 
once it printed out as Geneva (Helevetica if font sub on.)

I am puzzled as to what's happening; I would like it to  print in a monospaced 
font like Monaco or Courier so that numbers in tables line up properly.  Can 
anyone suggest why it isn't attempting to use the screen font to print?  Is 
there any simple modification I can make to the program/system to make it print
in one of the monospaced fonts?  (I tried installing Monaco into the DA but 
that made no difference.)

I am using System 4.2 and LaserWriter/Laser Prep 5.1.

Thanks very much in advance,

I have fifteen counters arranged in a triangular grid, with one of them
removed (say the top one):

            <---------
        X X          |
       X X X         I call the space left by the removed counter
      X X X X        the "initial space."
     X X X X X

A move consists of taking a counter, hopping it over one of the counters
immediately adjacent to it, placing it in the space immediately on the
other side of the counter that was hopped over (this space must have
been empty beforehand), and removing the counter hopped over from the
grid.  You cannot move outside the initial triangular grid.

For example, in the above situation, the leftmost counter in the line
third from the bottom can be hopped over the leftmost counter in the
line fourth from the bottom, leaving the following situation:

         X
          X
         X X
      X X X X
     X X X X X

The object is to make thirteen moves and thereby leave just one counter
remaining.

If the initial space is on the border (i.e., not one of the middle
three), then a solution exists.  Prove this.

Open questions:

1.  Does a solution exist if the initial space is one of the middle
    three?  (Conjecture: no)

2.  For each possible position of the initial space, determine the
    number of distinct (i.e., excluding rotations and reflections)
    solutions.

3.  Generalize to triangles of different sizes.

4.  Generalize to different grid configurations (other than triangular).

5.  Generalize to tetrahedra and higher dimensions.

A friend of mine works at a school for delinquent and disturbed kids.
Their school inherited a Radio Shack TRS-80 computer which they thought
was probably junk.  I told him that at one time, there was a lot of
software available for those machines.

He would like to know if there are any games and other programs which
might be good to have at the school available.

Also, he needs a user's manual.

     Use the MDC OnTyme User Directory to locate OnTyme IDs!
 
 
The MDC OnTyme User Directory consolidates account directories
each OnTyme Account Supervisor maintains.  To simplify look up,
you no longer have to know the user's account!
 
 
   To look up an employee's OnTyme ID, when accessing OnTyme 
   (Choose Manual Access if you are using ISGMail), merely type
 
                  :EXEC *** DIRECTORY [RETURN]
 
   Wait for the prompts and you are then asked to identify 
   the person.  Whenever you use the Directory, you have 
   three times to request OnTyme IDs.  After this, you are
   logged out of the Directory and back into OnTyme.  If 
   you are unable to locate a person's ID, let them know.
   It is possible the Supervisor* needs to add the person to
   his or her directory.
 
 
We think you will find the MDC OnTyme User Directory a valuable 
tool, especially useful during the OnTyme restructuring transition 
taking place during the next few weeks.

Subject: DIVERSIFIED RESTRUCTURE 

                       OnTyme Account Restructuring


    This is to advise you that the ISGFM account will be phased out.
    There are some new Diversified accounts available, beginning Monday,
    9-26.  They are as follows :

         RSC        Remote Services Center
                    [Includes Mr. Calvert]

         MPD        Manufacturing, Permac & Distribution

         ISE        Information Systems Engineering


The restructure only affects the account name.  For instance, Bill McKay's
OnTyme ID is currently ISGFM.B/MCKAY.  Starting Monday, his new ID will be
RSC.B/MCKAY.  In the same way, Kathy Waddell's OnTyme ID is currently
IPC.K/WADDELL.  Her new ID will be ISE.K/WADDELL.


    In addition, the entire account, MDCSS, will be renamed to the new
    account, MDCIS.  On Monday, you must send your OnTyme's using the new
    account.


    For instance, Paul Scholten's current ID is MDCSS.P/SCHOLTEN.  His new
    ID will be MDCIS.P/SCHOLTEN.


        ** WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION **

                     HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THE NEW IDS?
                     ********************************


              To figure out a new ID, merely change the OLD 
                   account name to the NEW account name




         For example, Dick Kovach's ID is FIN.R/KOVACH.  His new ID,
         starting 9-26, will be NSC.R/KOVACH.  

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > FIN.R/KOVACH
                     NEW ONTYME ID === > NSC.R/KOVACH



         Another example is Dick Gunther's ID.  His new ID, starting 10-3
         will be NSCMS.D/GUNTHER.

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > TYM.D/GUNTHER
                    NEW ONTYME ID === > NSCMS.D/GUNTHER

Subject: Hotline call at 8:15pm Saturday 

24-Sep-88 20:15/Joe
Contact:  TRW Opertaions, Tina Ngo, (714)786-3145(home?) (714)385-5522
Problem:  TRW had a head crash on DSKB0 and DSKB1 at 5:14pm Friday the 23rd.
          After aligning new heads and formatting new packs, "the FE was
          unable to IPL the system".  This call was a warning from Tina
          that she might need assistance in rebuilding the system.
          I.e. this is not yet a hotline call, but may turn into one.

---------------
My personal procedure is to put something into (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG before
working on the call, whenever possible.  This is so that if anyone is
curious as to what is going on can find the information on the first page
of (M33)HOTLIN.LOG on system F33.  After the call is closed, I take the
message verbatim, extract it into HOTLIN.TMP, and then use TUMS to send
it to MONITOR.

     Use the MDC OnTyme User Directory to locate OnTyme IDs!
 
 
The MDC OnTyme User Directory consolidates account directories
each OnTyme Account Supervisor maintains.  To simplify look up,
you no longer have to know the user's account!
 
 
   To look up an employee's OnTyme ID, when accessing OnTyme 
   (Choose Manual Access if you are using ISGMail), merely type
 
                  :EXEC *** DIRECTORY [RETURN]
 
   Wait for the prompts and you are then asked to identify 
   the person.  Whenever you use the Directory, you have 
   three times to request OnTyme IDs.  After this, you are
   logged out of the Directory and back into OnTyme.  If 
   you are unable to locate a person's ID, let them know.
   It is possible the Supervisor* needs to add the person to
   his or her directory.
 
 
We think you will find the MDC OnTyme User Directory a valuable 
tool, especially useful during the OnTyme restructuring transition 
taking place during the next few weeks.

Subject: The ARPAnet connection will be out for a while 

Bill Soley mentioned that tymix will get a real ARPAnet host name,
as in "Tymix.Tymnet.MDC.COM", in 2 to 3 months.  I found the following
in the comp.lang.ada newsgroup, which implies that there will be a
period of time where we do not have an ARPAnet mail gateway.

Subject: SYSDAT/SYSSHO outputs garbage on systems with 8192 pages. 

I had to remove the edit you added on Sept 9th (problem with overlapping
bits in the word that has memory and serial number).

It was trying to store the value 256 in an 8-bit field, which was causing
systems with 4 Meg to show up as having 0*16K of memory.  I noticed this when
D56 started reporting -657% core used.  I had to fix SYSSHO as well.

Subject: Memory utilization of the Dallas PDP-10s 

I ran Carl's SYSSHO program on all the machines in Dallas and checked the
memory utilization over the past 24 hours.  The results are:

System Memory  Low High  Comments
D23    2 meg   70% 600%  could use 4 meg, CPU is only 50% utilized
D25    2 meg   50% 100%  OK                 (Public Net code generation)
D31    2 meg   25%  40%  OK
D34    2 meg   90% 150%  OK, CPU usage is about 30%
D35    2 meg   20%  30%  OK
D37    4 meg   20%  30%  could run on 2 meg
D54    4 meg   20%  50%  could run on 3 meg (Public Net code generation)
D55    4 meg   30%  40%  could run on 2 meg
D56    4 meg   90% 170%  was 180% to 350% before upgrading from 2 to 4 meg

Please remember that these percentages were obtained by looking at the systems
for only one day.  Weekly or Monthly activities could use up more system
resources.  It may be worth considerring moving 2 meg from D37 to D23.
This move is not as urgent as adding 2 meg to D56 was, because D23 appears
to be running large but mostly inactive jobs.

D56 has been saturated at 100% CPU utilization all day today since 6:34am CDT.
It really needed the extra memory.

I set up ROUTER.DAT on TRW's KS system so that it can only talk to the
PDP-10 hosts.  This message is coming from Anaheim, "S33-P035/D-8".
This is proof that the /GATEWAY switch in (MAIL)ROUTER.NET is working.

Subject: EDITOR vs P035/D 

Robert (NOWELLR) is having problems with running EDITOR under the new monitor
.  He says that when he's in line edit mode, and types Control-Z "A" to go
to the next occurance of the letter A, it just beeps at him.  But Control-Z
"," or any other nonalphabetic works.  This problem did not occur with
P034/P.  I have never used EDITOR; could you look into this?   /Joe
