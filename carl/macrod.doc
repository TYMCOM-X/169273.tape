1.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

1.1  Problems For Which A Solution Is Known

     1.  UUOSYM.mac declares .JB41, .JBCST, .JBOPS, .JBREN and .JBVER to
         be  EXTERNAL  symbols.  This is inconsistent with C.mac in some
         circumstances.  If A-errors occur while  recompiling  a  source
         file   (HELPER,setsrc)   with  C,  the  user  has  one  of  two
         alternatives.   The first is to recompile without C  by  adding
         "SEARCH   MACTEN,uuosym"   to   the  beginning  of  the  source
         file.  The second is to delete  from  C.mac  the  line  "EXTERN
         .JB41,.JBCST,.JBOPS,.JBREN,.JBVER"  and  recompile  as  before.
         This problem will disappear  as  MACTEN  and  UUOSYM  gradually
         replace C in the users' search lists.

     2.  SOS fails to compile under MACRO 50A, as it does not know about
         the   KL  opcode  "EXTEND"  implemented  in  50A,  The  correct
         long-range fix is to change all references to  "EXTEND".   (SOS
         is  unsupported.)  To  recompile  the  source  the  user should
         manually replace the line "IFNDEF EXTEND,<EXTEND==1> in SOS.mac
         by  "EXTEND==1"  (or  "EXTEND==0"  if  desired).   It  is  also
         possible (but not recommended) to turn off the KL10 opcodes  in
         MACRO by recompiling MACRO.mac with KL10==0.

     3.  For LOGIN version 57 only:  LOGIN version 57 takes advantage of
         a  bug in MACRO fixed by edit 412, included in MACRO 50A.  As a
         result, LOGIN 57 will not load properly  after  compiling  with
         version  50A.   The correct fix to LOGIN is as follows:  Remove
         the TWOSEG pseudo-op from page 1  on  LGNUNV.   On  page  2  of
         LGNUNV, add a TWOSEG to the LGNDCL macro definition just before
         the RELOC 400000.  In LGNLOW, add a  TWOSEG  before  the  RELOC
         400000.   This  fix  is  included in LOGIN version 60, which is
         fully compatible with MACRO 50A.

     4.  For ALGOL version 6A only:  ALGCON, an ALGOL source file,  gets
         N-errors  because  MACRO  50A  flags  overflows  resulting from
         multiply and divide operations.  To get around this, insert the
         line  ".DIRECTIVE .OKOVL ;[BWR4] ALLOW * AND / OVERFLOW" at the
         beginning of ALGCON.mac.  In addition, a "KL-only  INSTRUCTION"
         error  message can result from executing ALGOL 6A compiled with
         MACRO 50A, since ALGOL 6A also did not know about the KL opcode
         "EXTEND".   To  get around this, compile using either MACRO 50A
         rebuilt with KL10 set to zero (in MACRO.mac) or  MACRO  version
         50.   (Version  50  will  also  not  trap  multiply  and divide
         overflow.) The proper edit, which  changes  all  references  to
         "EXTEND", appears in ALGOL version 7.  ALGOL version 7 is fully
         compatible with MACRO 50A.

     5.  BASICH, a component of BASIC, gets R-errors when assembled with
         MACRO  50A.   Edit  440, a two line patch to MACRO, fixes this.
         See the FILCOM below.  NUM, a component of COBOL, gets R-errors
         when  assembled with BIS set to zero (in INTERM.mac).  Edit 440
         fixes this case also.

     6.  MOVE, CMP and SPAC, components  of  LIBOL,  get  Q-errors  with
         MACRO  50A when BIS is set to one (in INTERM.mac).  LBLPRM.mac,
         which is searched  by  these  modules,  defines  some  extended
         opcodes  (also defined in MACRO 50A) improperly, leading to the
         confusion.   The  correct  long-range  fix  is  to  change  the
         extended   opcode   definitions   (in   LBLPRM)  from  halfword
         assignments to proper OPDEFS, and change  all  extended  opcode
         references  in  LIBOL  as  necessary  to  accomodate  this.   A
         short-term way-around is to change all references  to  extended
         opcodes  occurring  in  the opcode field (i.e.  [MOVSLJ,,0]) to
         proper opcodes (i.e.  [MOVSLJ]), thereby causing MACRO to  pull
         in  its  own  opcode  values, which are consistent.  It is also
         possible, but not recommended, to turn off the KL10 opcodes  in
         MACRO by recompiling MACRO.mac with KL10 set to zero.

     7.  Edit 415 caused SPROUT (a GALAXY  component)  to  compile  with
         phase errors.  Edit 441, a two line patch to MACRO, fixes this.
         See the FILCOM below.

     8.  Page offsets are counted incorrectly on  PRGEND.  Specifically,
         the offset gets stuck at [PAGE#]-1.  Edit 433 (PCO 83, a 2 line
         patch) from MCR50B.pco fixes this.  QAR #00360

     9.  When too many lines occur in in a literal, "label+offset" given
         in  the  error  message  is  wrong,  as  the  offset  count  is
         reinitialized to -1.    Edit  402,  which  made  "label+offset"
         meaningful  in  literals  with labels, failed to take this case
         into  account.  A  temporary  fix  (until  full  label  use  is
         implemented  in  literals)  is  provided by edit 434 (PCO 84, a
         several line patch) from MCR50B.pco.   QAR #00591

    10.  A spurious "MCRNES NO END STATEMENT ENCOUNTERED ON INPUT  FILE"
         message  can occur on pass 2 when I/o flags are bombed during a
         call to  the  IOSET  routine.   This  problem  was  encountered
         assembling  SIMULA,  when  an IRP ended while a line containing
         XALL, SALL or .XCREF was being polished off.  Edit 435 (PCO 85,
         a 3 line patch) from MCR50B.pco fixes this.   SPR 20472

    11.  Phase errors discovered while checking the  start  of  the  VAR
         area  on  END  are  lost unless assembly of literals happens to
         follow.   %....P appears in the symbol table with  no  matching
         mnemonic  in  the  listing.  Edit  436  (PCO 86, a several line
         patch) from MCR50B.pco fixes this.  SPR 20681

    12.  SFDS are ignored on output file specifications.  Edit 437  (PCO
         88, a 12 line patch) from MCR50B.pco allows for the use of SFDS
         on output file specifications.  SPR 20779

1.2  Problems To Be Fixed In The Near Future


The following is a list of problems for which no solution  is  currently
known,  but  for  which  a solution is expected in the near future.  The
patches will be published in the DECSYSTEM-10 Software Dispatch as  they
become known.

     1.  Code in an IF1 conditional gets an extra line at the bottom  of
         each  page  in the list or cross reference of the program.  The
         line that MACRO puts out has a carriage  return,  but  no  line
         feed.

     2.  Missing page headers on some listing pages.

     3.  RIM10 stays set across PRGEND.

     4.  MACRO OPDEF DEVSIZ is not recognized by MACRO if used first  in
         a   program   inside   an   expression  of  the  type  "<devsiz
         1,>!200000".  A known way around is  to  search  UUOSYM.   (See
         suggestions, 6.0, for related suggestion.)

     5.  MACRO fails to notice  when  it  is  including  non-RADIX50-set
         characters in its six-character TITLE.

     6.  MACRO's floating point input routines do not agree  with  those
         of other compilers, FORTRAN in particular.

1.3  Problems Which Should Be Fixed In Some Future Version

     1.  The .IF pseudo-op will  be  completely  reworked  in  the  next
         development release.

     2.  Expressions of the type  "FOO-1(10)"  cause  LINK  to  generate
         different  values  depending  on  whether  FOO  is  INTERNAL or
         EXTERNAL.  The reason is that, in the latter case, LINK  thinks
         it   is   fixing   up  something  like  JRST  FOO  -1(10),  not
         EXP<FOO  -1(10)>,  and  indeed  cannot  tell  the   difference.
         Future  versions  of MACRO will have the capability to generate
         sufficient information to LINK to generate the needed fixup, as
         well  as  maintain  upward and downward compatibility with user
         and system programs.

     3.  Universals are still searched on defining occurances of  INTERN
         and EXTERN, leading to possibly conflicting definitions for the
         symbols specified.  Several approaches to or ways  around  this
         problem have been suggested.

     4.  Several  problems  spring  from   the   fact   that   currently
         end-of-line  must be forced out early for commented macro calls
         under XALL.  The next development release of MACRO will include
         extensive  changes  to  macro processing, and may along the way
         provide a means for withholding output  of  comment/end-of-line
         until  after  the  expansion,  thereby  eliminating  a range of
         listing and line-reference bugs.

     5.  MACRO's asterisk-level command scanner has incurred a long list
         of  suggestions and complaints, even the smallest of which must
         await a design-level reworking.  No plans currently  exist  for
         this, however.

     6.  Full use of labels in literals will be implemented in the  next
         development release of MACRO.

INTERNAL CHANGES BETWEEN MACRO 50 AND MACRO 50A


2.0  INTERNAL CHANGES BETWEEN MACRO 50 AND MACRO 50A

Edits 367,376 and 415 were changes to the literal processor.  The effect
is  to  prevent  PASS 1 pooling of literals with errors in them when the
literals are deeper  than  the  first  level.   Because  the  space  for
literals  is  reserved on the first pass, when MACRO cannot ascertain if
literals with undefined (I.E.  forward) references can be combined, some
extra  space  is  reserved.   The  space used by the literal pool on the
first pass, but not on the second pass is  not  reclaimed  because  this
could  introduce  phase  errors.   Because MACRO 50A detects more PASS 1
errors in literals (such as U and O) which may go  away  in  the  second
pass,  programs  assembled by MACRO 50A may be several words longer than
the same programs compiled with MACRO 50.  There is no error introduced,
and program execution should be unaffected.



3.0  SUGGESTIONS

Users are warned that they should begin to search UUOSYM in their  MACRO
programs, as CALLIS will disappear from MACRO in some future version.

         ALGUTL  because  of  different  macro-call argument handling in

     2.  BASICH, a component of, BASIC gets  a  Q-error  when  assembled

     3.  COMMON, a component of TOPS10  (V602A)  gets  2  N-errors  when
         assembled  with  MACRO  V52.  The errors occur in the following
         lines:

         A.  AXXVER==<BYTE(18) A00CLH(12) A00MVN-<1-
                      A00SVN/A00JVN>*<A00DLN/A00DLN > (6) A00SVN+<1-

         B.  REPEAT Z1/Z2, <Z1==Z1-Z2>

             where Z2=0.

         MACRO V52  will  give  an  N-error  for  divide  checks.   Both
         N-errors  in COMMON can be ignored, since the assembled code is
         correct.

     4.  In FILUUO, a component of TOPS10 (V602A and  previous  versions
         only), the line

              AOS-1(p)

         will be assembled as 530000,,-1 since AOS will be treated as  a
         symbol  in  an  arithmetic  expression.  This is different from
         what is intended which is

              AOS        -1(P)

    correct the line so that a tab, rather  than  "-",  immediately
         follows  the  instruction  AOS.   The correct assembled code is
         530 00 0 17 777777.

     5.  When loading TOPS10 REL modules generated by  MACRO  V52,  LINK
         gives error message:

              "MULTIPLY DEFIND GLOBAL SYMBOL WAKE, IN MODULE CLOCK1".

         WAKE is a UUO.  MACRO V52 makes it  global  and  WAKE  is  also
         defined  as  a  global  label  in CLOCK1.  The solution to this
         problem is to change the label WAKE  to  WAKEJ  (MCO  6318  for
         TOPS10 6.03).  Changes are required in two modules:

              CLOCK1 (near labels CKLCH1 and WAKE)

              UUOCON (near label MSLEEP)

     6.  LNKERR, a component of LINK V3A, gets a Q error when  assembled
         with  MACRO  V52.  Q-error appears on a line which has an extra
         ">" at the end.  This ">" character was there so that the older
         versions  of MACRO will assemble the line correctly.  The extra
         ">" is no longer needed.  The Q-error can be ignored, since the
         assembled code LNKERR is correct.

     7.  Very large programs, such as the TOPS-10 monitor, may not  load
         correctly  after being assembled with MACRO 52.  This is due to
         a bug in  LINK 3A  which  is  fixed  by  edit  572.   The  file
         LNK572.cor is a correction file for FED that will automatically
         install this edit in LINK 3A.  We recommend that this  edit  be
         installed  in  LINK 3A  before attempting to load monitors that
         have been assembled with MACRO 52.   Refer  to  LNK572.mac  for
         information  on  how to verify that edit 572 has been installed
         correctly.  For more information, see LNK572.pco.

     8.  For correct assembly of ALGOL V7:

         Add .DIRECTIVE .OKOVL at the beginning of ALGSTB.
         Add .DIRECTIVE NO MACMPD at the beginning of ALGDEC.

     9.  MAKLIB'S REL file patching facility may be used with REL  files
         produced  by  MACRO V52.  However, incorrect results will occur
         if any location whose contents is the result of a polish  fixup
         is  changed  by MAKLIB.  A future release of MAKLIB will remove
         this restriction.

    10.  A one line patch (edit 531) has altered the listings  of  macro
         expansions under XALL.  This edit allows two macro calls on the
         same line to be listed.  However, it has introduced the problem
         of a /80 listing embedded macro calls.  If this is not desired,
         remove the one line:

              TLZ IO,iomac

         at MAC23:  until a better patch is published for both cases.





4.2  Problems To Be Fixed In The Near Future

The following is a list of problems for which no solution  is  currently
known,  but  for  which  a solution is expected in the near future.  The
patches will be published in the DECSYSTEM-10 Software Dispatch as  they
become known.

     1.  Code in an IF1 conditional gets an extra line at the bottom  of
         each  page  in the list or cross reference of the program.  The
         line that MACRO puts out has a carriage  return,  but  no  line
         feed.

KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES


     2.  MACRO'S floating point input routines do not agree  with  those
         of other compilers, FORTRAN in particular.





4.3  Problems Which Should Be Fixed In Some Future Version

     1.  Expressions of the type  "FOO-1(10)"  cause  LINK  to  generate
         different  values  depending  on  whether  FOO  is  INTERNAL or
         EXTERNAL.  The reason is that, in the latter case, LINK  thinks
         it  is  fixing  up  something like JRST FOO -1(10), not EXP<FOO
         -1(10)>,  and  indeed  cannot  tell  the  difference.    Future
         versions   of  MACRO  will  have  the  capability  to  generate
         sufficient information to LINK to generate the needed fixup, as
         well  as  maintain  upward and downward compatibility with user
         and system programs.

     2.  Handle polish block of greater than 17 words.

     3.  Universals are still searched on defining occurrences of INTERN
         and EXTERN, leading to possibly conflicting definitions for the
         symbols specified.  Several approaches to or ways  around  this
         problem have been suggested.





5.0  MCR53.DOC -- CHANGES FROM V52(551) TO V53(1120)

3.0  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
*    1.  MACRO can't generate any Polish block  which  will  use  more
         than 17 words.
     2.  You can't forward reference a Polish symbol,
         should do:
              FOO=EXT##+1
                   .
                   .
                   .
              MOVE  1,FOO
     3.  A  Polish  OPDEF  is  treated  internally  as  a  full   word
         assignment.  As a result, AC and address may not be used with
         it.
     4.  MACRO's floating point input routines do not agree with those
         of other compilers, FORTRAN in particular.
     5.  MACRO will not assemble a line in PIP correctly:
               DISP   ),0
         Add angle  brackets  around  the  un-paired  close  paren  in
         PIP.MAC:
               DISP   <)>,0
     6.  MACRO will not assemble a line in RUNOFF correctly:
               MSG$   ..."

         Delete the unpaired  quote  mark  at  the  end  of  the  line
         RUNOFF.MAC:
               MSG$   ...
     7.  MACRO prevents  the  TWOSEG  pseudo-op  from  working  across
         PRGEND.   LOGIN  57 took advantage of the bug.  Correct LOGIN
         sources as follows:  remove the TWOSEG pseudo-op from page  1
         of  LGNUNV.   On page 2 of LGNUNV, add a TWOSEG to the LGNDCL
         macro definition just before the RELOC  400000.   In  LGNLOW,
         add  a  TWOSEG before the RELOC 400000.  This fix is included
         in LOGIN version 60, which is fully compatible with  versions
         50A, 52, and 53 of MACRO.
     8.  MACRO currently will not  allow  pooling  of  literals  which
         contain labels.
     9.  If the right hand side  of  an  assignment  statement  is  an
         expression  containing  Polish,  angle-brackets must surround
         the expression.
     10. Expressions of the form
              <EXT  +1>B7
         generate a ?MCREPP error message.
     11. Incorrect CREF listings generated when:
              .zero loop of IRP is done.
              .references suppressed by XLIST inside macro expansion.
     12. Phase errors will be generated by MACRO when  assembling  the
         distributed MIC source.  MACRO allows macro calls to occur in
         the operand field of a source statement.  The sample  program
         below  shows  the  sequence of instructions in the MIC source
         which causes the phase errors to occur.
              SEARCH MACTEN
              JRST MACERR
              MACERR:
              END
         As  shown  above,  MIC.MAC   forward-references   MACERR,   a
         user-defined  label.   However,  MACERR  also  happens  to be
         defined in MACTEN as a macro.  Since MIC searches MACTEN, and
         since  macro  calls  are allowed in operand fields, the macro
         definition is used in assembling the statement "JRST  MACERR"
         in  pass  one.  This causes phase errors in pass two when the
         correct label definition is used.  Problem may  be  fixed  by
         changing the lable name MACERR so as not to conflict with the
         macro name.
     13. In SETSRC.MAC, MACRO encounters  a  forward  reference  of  a
         symbol  name  JSYS, and MACRO assembles in TOPS20 JSYS opcode
         instead of user label address.  By changing  the  label  name
         and  all  its  references in SETSRC, you will get the correct
         assembly.

3.0 Known Bugs and Deficiencies

*    1.  MACRO can't generate any Polish block  which  will  use  more
         than 17 words.
     2.  You cannot forward reference a Polish symbol  of  other  than
         the form:  EXT##+k or EXT##-k
         instead, you should do the following:
              FOO=EXT1##+EXT2##

         it.
     4.  MACRO's floating point input routines do not agree with those
         of other compilers, FORTRAN in particular.
     5.  MACRO will not assemble a line in TOPS-10 PIP correctly.  The
         following represents edit 346 to the product:
         At DSPTAB + 12L:
               DISP   ),0
         Add angle brackets around  the  un-paired  close  parenthesis
         such as:
               DISP   <)>,0
     6.  MACRO will not assemble 2 lines in RUNOFF correctly:
         At FRCEND + 4L and FIN2 + 13L:
               MSG$   ARG1,ARG2,,....."
         Enclose the last macro argument in angle brackets, such as:
               MSG$   ARG1,ARG2,,<.....">
         or include the statement .DIRECTIVE NO MACMPD somewhere  near
         the beginning of the program.
     7.  MACRO currently will not  allow  pooling  of  literals  which
         contain labels.
     8.  If the right hand side  of  an  assignment  statement  is  an
         expression  containing  Polish,  angle-brackets must surround
         the expression.
     9. Incorrect CREF listings generated when:
              .zero loop of IRP is done.
              .references suppressed by XLIST inside macro expansion.
     10. Phase errors will be generated by MACRO when  assembling  the
         distributed  TOPS-10 MIC source.  MACRO allows macro calls to
         occur in the operand field of a source statement.  The sample

              MACERR:

         As  shown  above,  MIC.MAC   forward-references   MACERR,   a
         user-defined  label.   However,  MACERR  also  happens  to be

         definition is used in assembling the statement "JRST  MACERR"
         in  pass  one.  This causes phase errors in pass two when the
         correct label definition is used.  Problem may  be  fixed  by
         changing the lable name MACERR so as not to conflict with the
         macro name.
     11. In TOPS-10 SETSRC.MAC, MACRO encounters a  forward  reference
         of  a  symbol  name  JSYS, and MACRO assembles in TOPS20 JSYS
         opcode instead of user label address.  The  following  change
         represents  edit  47  to  the  product,  which eliminates the
         problem.
         In macro CTAB, 6 lines down, the macro definition:
               DEFINE   CC (NAM,ADDR)<ADDR>
         should be changed to:
               DEFINE   CC (NAM,ADDR)<Z ADDR>
     12. Attempts to compile field image BACKRS.MAC to rebuild  BACKUP
         will  produce R errors.  These errors occur on erroneous BYTE
         statements that attempt to modify the high order bit of an 18
         bit  relocatable  quantity.   This  type  of  error  was  not
         detected by previous versions of MACRO.
         At FRSDTM + 0L:
                FRSDTM: BYTE (1)0 (17)FRSDAT (18)L$DATE ;LABEL CREATION
                        BYTE (1)1 (17)FRSDSD (18)L$DSTR ;DESTROY DATE
                        BYTE (1)0 (17)FRSSDT (18)S$DATE ;SAVE SET DATE
         Replace the 3 lines with:
                        FRDUM1==0B18+FRSDAT             ;[330]
                        FRDUM2==1B18+FRSDSD             ;[330]
                        FRDUM3==0B18+FRSSDT             ;[330]
                FRSDTM: BYTE (18)FRDUM1 (18)L$DATE      ;[330]LABEL CREATION
                        BYTE (18)FRDUM2 (18)L$DSTR      ;[330]DESTROY DATE
                        BYTE (18)FRDUM3 (18)S$DATE      ;[330]SAVE SET DATE
     13. The opcode field  of  an  instruction  must  evaluate  to  an
         absolute  quantity  at  compile  time.  Note that no error is
         generated if this condition is not met, to allow  for  OPDEFs
         which  contain  relocatables,  or  externals  in  the address
         portion of the instruction.
     14. Polish is not allowed an index field  (eg.   ADDR(POLISH)  ).
         Also,  externals  are  not  allowed in the index field if the
         expression evaluates to other than a zero in the  left  half.
         This  restriction  is imposed because there is no polish swap
         operator.  Note that the expression ( "OP  AC,POLISH(1B1)"  )
         falls  into  this  class  of  problems,  however,  it  is not
         currently flagged as an error.
     15. Error lines in macros under SALL do not list.  They  can  not
         be  listed  since the original source line is not around when
         the macro call line is finally listed.
     16. Long binary generating lines under XALL list only partially.
     17. Lines in an IRP will usually not be indeneted  properly  when
         LALL is in effect.
     18. Under SALL, the following example involving REPEAT  does  not
         list as expected.
                REPEAT 2,<MOVE
                        COUNT=0>
         The REPEAT is closed off before the last line is listed.
     19. A formfeed followed by another formfeed causes macro to  skip

         a page header.
     20. CREF reference line numbers can be  incorrect  for  variables
         seen  in XLISTed code.  In the following example, A is CREFed
         as being referenced on the line following LABEL.
                A=1
                DEFINE X,<XLIST
                A
                LIST>
         LABEL: X
                Z
     21. MACRO's  command  scanner  is  very  archiac,  and  does  not
         neccessarily conform to the currently accepted method of file
         specification scanning,  such  as  that  used  by  SCAN.   In
         particular, the command:
                FIL E.REL=FILE.MAC
         is accepted without error, and FILE.REL is created.  Also,  a
         single  filespec  will  cause the TOPS-20 version of MACRO to
         loop until it eventually runs out of core.
     22. The .DIRECTIVE .NOBIN does not work  properly  with  PRGENDed
         files, since the directive immediately closes the .REL file.
     23. .DIRECTIVEs MACPRF and .NOUUOS do not get  cleared  across  a
         PRGEND.
     24. MACRO is unable to PEEK ahead across the end of  macro  args,
         the  end  of  a  macro,  the  end  of an IRP, or the end of a
         REPEAT.  This means that constructs such as "==", "=:", "::",
         and others cannot be recognized across these limits.  This is
         related to not being able to continue  a  line  across  these
         boundaries.
     25. Either  "A=B##"  or  "A=EXP  B##"  should  generate  fullword
         Polish.   At  present,  the first case generates a right half
         external fixup, and the second  case  generates  bad  listing
         output and an incorrect .REL file.
     26. Polish used as  the  argument  to  a  B  shift  operator  may
         generate a bad .REL file, depending upon whether or not angle
         brackets surround the entire expression, such as:
                <<POLISH>B7*4>
     27. Characters that are not specified to be in MACRO's recognized
         character  set,  such as vertical bar, will be converted to a
         strange up-arrow character, if they are passed over  as  part
         of an unprocessed conditional.
     28. A macro which contains SALL and XLIST  will  cause  an  extra
         blank  line  to appear in the listing file, because both SALL
         and XLIST attempt to  finish  off  the  current  output  line
         before changing listing modes.
     29. An unary minus preceeding a relocatable expression such as:
                -<RELOC+2>
         generates garbage Polish.
     30. A Polish assignment statement  with  an  imbedded  assignment
         statement, such as:
                A=B##+<N=3>
         will not generate the proper Polish fixup block for symbol A.
     31. Phase errors can occur in a PSECTed program that has a symbol
         defined  as a Relocatable, and also as a MACRO/OPDEF/SYNONYM.
         This occurs because of the following:
MCR53.DOC -- Changes from V52(551) to V53(1120)                  Page 17

         A. MACRO maintains a seperate symbol table  for  each  PSECT.
            This  is  done to keep EXTERNAL fixup chains seperate, and
            also for Relocatables since they may  be  referenced  from
            another PSECT.
         B. MACRO expects the two  definitions  for  the  same  symbol
            (Relocatable  and  MACRO/OPDEF/SYNONYM) to appear together
            in  the  same  symbol  table.   MACRO   frequently   makes
            decisions  concerning  the treatment of a symbol using the
            knowledge that both symbol definitions exist.
         C. In a PSECTed  program,  the  two  symbol  definitions  may
            actually  appear  in  different PSECT symbol tables.  This
            can  also  occur  differently  during  the   two   passes,
            depending  on  IF1  and  IF2  conditionals.   Also, if the
            MACRO/OPDEF/SYNONYM  is  defined  in  a   UNIVERSAL,   the
            situation   is  complicated  since  such  definitions  are
            usually entered into the symbol table for the Global PSECT
            when the symbol is referenced.

         Given the above,  it  is  possible  to  reference  the  wrong
         definition  of  a  symbol  during  pass  2  of  the assembly,
         generating a different amount  of  code  than  was  generated
         during pass 1, causing the phase errors.
