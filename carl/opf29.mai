Subject: "All-files problem on F29. TITO"... 

All-files problem on F29.
TITO aborted the all-files save of F29 with "EXCEEDED PROG LIMIT" on tape 13
while saving (USEVAL).  TITO has a limit of 43777 tape positions (18431 files)
per tape and directory (USEVAL) has 18075 files.

Tape 14 was "STORE ALL STARTING WITH (USEVAL)".  That tape as 18075 files from
all of USEVAL, 278 files from UTIL, 61 files from VALDEV, 4 files from VALIDATE,
3 files from VALTELCO, and 10 files from VBURKE, for a total of 18431 files.
It appears that someone tried to APPEND to that tape instead of going on
to tape 15.  Operations called the hotline because of that confusion.

Whenever TITO reaches its limit of 43777 tape positions, you should not skip
the current user, and you should not restart with the current user.  The
proper procedure is to get a directory of the tape, find the name of the last
file on the tape, and go to a new tape, starting with that particular file.

The easy way to look at the end of a file (such as FTA2.DIR) is with the
command "RUN (XEXEC)TAIL;FTA2.DIR".  In this case, it showed the last file as
43777 14 Y6YSF8.ME0   VBURKE        11:42 13-FEB-86  00:00 04-DEC-87    2 TUCLIK
therefore the command "STORE ALL STARTING WITH (VBURKE)Y6YSF8.ME0" should have
been used on tape 15.

There is a hard read error on DSKB15(BPA16) page 3.  Since this page is the 15th
duplicate copy of BOOTS, the error does not affect the system.  However, it
does cause an "HRE" indications on (SYS)HOME.SYS and can only be corrected by
copying out the pack and manually resetting the HRE bit in the UFD.

I suggest running PAKCOPY at the next scheduled downtime.    /Joe

Subject: "The next time the system goes"... 

The next time the system goes down with a UIL stopcode, please mention in
the crash mail which tape drives had tapes mounted on them.  To help us
track down this bug, we also need to know which tape programs (TITO,MAGCON)
were running at the time of the crash.

Subject: Console login. 

The message from Paul Miller on 16-Feb stated that the operator had
problems "where the operator types a ctrl z followed by 'L' to login, I
received the following message on the CTY 'user invalid on this computer'.

What exactly did the operator type?  "^ZL" is not sufficient.  To login
in CONSOLE mode, the operator must type:
	Control-Z, "L", "O", "P", "E", "R", Return.
The first character gets the CTY's attention, the "L" signifies a login
request, and "OPER"+Return is the username.

If this procedure does not work, please send us more details.
When properly logged in, an ASP dump does not need to use REFLAG.

Is anyone actually getting crash dumps from BB2674 when B39's base has problems?
Paul Krumviede (ext 7496) said he would be interested in looking at the slot
and IPI code.

Subject: CPXKON likes 3 strings on 1 controller, BPXKON doesn't. 

One obvious test we all overlooked - running the two pack DSKB on the
three strings using F30's monitor.  It works OK using X32's monitor, but
not using F30's or B39's monitor.  My guess is that some interrupt is
getting lost - it will require debugging at the CTY to find it.

All 3 AR.ARX crashes on F29 show the same problem.
In each case, the PC is at PAGP3R+52, trying to execute HRRZ U,CLOCK.
The contents of location CLOCK are in the cache, and a parity error is detected
in the AR when it gains bit 1.

Subject: Free space on system 33. 

Just before the conversion, F33 was almost 100% full on 24 units.
Formatting in pages allows for 7 pages per track instead of 25 blocks per
track.  (7 pages = 28 blocks.)  The ratio of 28 to 25 is 1.12 = +12 %.
This makes 24 logical units in pages the equivalent of 26.88 block units.
The added 2.88 units at 103500 pages per makes for about 298000 pages free.

F33 now has 288270 pages free.  It's a lot better than the low of 14697 pages
it got down to on 30-Jun.				/Joe

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 14 Jul 88 7:53:46 PDT

(MPL)CTYLOG reads and displays all output to the CTY that is still in the
buffer.  Once it's caught up, CTYLOG sleeps waiting for new messages to
appear in the buffer.  When they do, these messages are reported to your
terminal in real-time.  If you are running CTYLOG at 4:00, 8:00, or 12:00,
you will see the BIGBEN messages on your terminal at the same time they
show up on the CTY.

CTYLOG will keep watching and sleeping until you type a RETURN.

Subject: "?Address check for device TTY" means "no such user (GAMES)". 

Rourke McCusker (the head of QSATS) had a problem that when he typed
"DO CIAO", it aborted with "?Address check for device TTY..." today, but it
was working yesterday.  That obscure error message really means that one
of the directories in his DO list does not exist.  (The DO list had been
set up for him by somebody else in 1983.)  The directory that was deleted
is GAMES.  I fixed his problem by:
	-EDIT INIT.SAI
	<remove "GAMES">
	-LOAD INIT.SAI

Problem:  Bad file (SYS)HOME.SYS on DSKB5(BPA16) page 4.
Fix:      This page is part of BOOTS.  As long as DSKB5 does not get moved
          to BPA0 or BPA10, this will not cause any problems.
          The bad page has been reassigned to the file DSKB5.BAD and
          marked NFS so that TITO will ignore it.

In-reply-to: your message of Sat, 13 Aug 88 12:15:16 PDT

In reference to bad spot on DSKB5 page 4:
No, DSKCLN will not fix hard read errors in HOME.SYS.  In fact, it will
complain that the RIB to HOME.SYS is wrong and refuse to bring the system
up.  Luckily, the read error on cyl 0 head 0 rec 17 was temporary.  I can
now read and write this page.  Therefore I have reset the RIB back to normal.

If the read error had been solid, you would have had to copy out the pack
before the system could be brought up for users.  It's probably worth
copying out the pack that is currently on BPA16 at the next scheduled downtime.

Subject: "F29's AR.ARX crash on 23-Aug was"... 

F29's AR.ARX crash on 23-Aug was caused by an ARX parity error in user mode,
probably bit 1.  I can't say for sure because the word of user core was not
saved in the crash dump.  The contents of (7:1) is reported as being
200000,,000000.  Assuming that the word was supposed to be 0, the bad
parity would come from bit 1 while doing an <IDPB 5,2> where AC 5 has
40 (an ASCII blank) and AC 2 has 350700,,561343.  Note that the latter
matches the page fail word (500) of 777000,,561343 as reported in the
crash mail.					/Joe

long enough for us to fix it.  DO NOT SCHEDULE F29 DOWN UNTIL IT IS FIXED!

Subject: "When operations copied HOME.SYS"... 

When operations copied HOME.SYS to itself,  the HOME pages got released.
Several files in (USEVAL) claimed these pages.  These files had to be
destroyed to get the HOME pages back, so that I copy put them back into HOME.SYS.

There aer 2 critical files on SYS: HOME.SYS and SAT.SYS.  The TYMCOM-X hotline
should be used whenever these critical files have problems.  Copying HOME.SYS
or SAT.SYS to itself will not clear up any read errors, but will clobber the
disk.

Subject: "System F29's file system was damaged"... 

System F29's file system was damaged when the file (SYS)HOME.SYS was copied
to itself in an attempt to clear a hard read/write error on this file.

Joe Smith responded to the mail from OPER regarding this problem and repaired
the damage enough so that a FAST DSKCLN was possible.  However a FULL DSKCLN
was not yet possible.   When the system went down Saturday morning, DSKCLN died
trying to repair the damage.

Carl Baltrunas responded to this problem and after verifying the state of the
file system, deleted all of the files which pointed to the same pages required
by (SYS)HOME.SYS.   DSKCLN was then able to verify and fix the remainder of
the problems with the file structure.


Please examine the file (SYS)RECOV.SYS and restore any file listed so that
all-files taken for the block-to-page file-structure conversion records
valid data for the files that were damaged due to HOME.SYS being overwritten.

Thank you.

Subject: Free space on F58. 

I got a call from Frank Rodriquez at the Fremont Data Center asking me if I
could delete some files from SYS on F58.  He thought that (SYS:58) was using
more space than most other systems.  It is using 57000 pages, which is about
what is used on other systems.  The encloses SZRPT listing shows that SYS is
using up only 2% of the disk.

Rick, do you wish us to pursue this matter?  It would probably be more effective
to prune directories other than SYS.   /Joe

IMPORTANT:  DSKCLN WON'T RUN - HOME.SYS HAS BEEN WIPED OUT!

F29 is OK for now, but if it does down, it will not come back up.  DSKCLN will
abort because HOME.SYS has been overwritten.  Let's pray that F29 stays up
long enough for us to fix it.  DO NOT SCHEDULE F29 DOWN UNTIL IT IS FIXED!

Subject: "When operations copied HOME.SYS"... 

When operations copied HOME.SYS to itself,  the HOME pages got released.
Several files in (USEVAL) claimed these pages.  These files had to be
destroyed to get the HOME pages back, so that I copy put them back into HOME.SYS.

There aer 2 critical files on SYS: HOME.SYS and SAT.SYS.  The TYMCOM-X hotline
should be used whenever these critical files have problems.  Copying HOME.SYS
or SAT.SYS to itself will not clear up any read errors, but will clobber the
disk.

Subject: "System F29's file system was damaged"... 

System F29's file system was damaged when the file (SYS)HOME.SYS was copied
to itself in an attempt to clear a hard read/write error on this file.

Joe Smith responded to the mail from OPER regarding this problem and repaired
the damage enough so that a FAST DSKCLN was possible.  However a FULL DSKCLN
was not yet possible.   When the system went down Saturday morning, DSKCLN died
trying to repair the damage.

Carl Baltrunas responded to this problem and after verifying the state of the
file system, deleted all of the files which pointed to the same pages required
by (SYS)HOME.SYS.   DSKCLN was then able to verify and fix the remainder of
the problems with the file structure.


Please examine the file (SYS)RECOV.SYS and restore any file listed so that
all-files taken for the block-to-page file-structure conversion records
valid data for the files that were damaged due to HOME.SYS being overwritten.

Thank you.

Subject: Free space on F58. 

I got a call from Frank Rodriquez at the Fremont Data Center asking me if I
could delete some files from SYS on F58.  He thought that (SYS:58) was using
more space than most other systems.  It is using 57000 pages, which is about
what is used on other systems.  The encloses SZRPT listing shows that SYS is
using up only 2% of the disk.

Rick, do you wish us to pursue this matter?  It would probably be more effective
to prune directories other than SYS.   /Joe
