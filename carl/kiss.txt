Don't ask a girl if you can kiss her.
If your lips are within 3 inches of hers, that's invitation enough.

Don't try to kiss a girl immediately after you have smoked a cigarette or
a cigar or eaten a hamberger with onions, or worse yet a salad with garlic.
Eat a mint first, or chew some gum.

Don't hold a girl so tight that she can't breathe.
Remember when you kiss that she must breathe through her nose.
Leave at least one of her nostrals free to ?finish.

Remember that  .... (body - both) both yours and hers.
A person can hold their legs in a certain way to protect the object of
their affection against minor surgery. 

When you kiss a girl for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, time, keep your hands
where they belong.  If you try for too much ?(goodies, greedy) too soon,
you might get penalized for being out of hand, or worse yet,
thrown out of the game.

After you kiss a girl, don't ask her how it was.
If you enjoyed it, she probably did too.
