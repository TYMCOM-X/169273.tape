The list of files with read errors came from a log file on F33 created 22-Jun
at 5:00am.  The files themselves look good; they have the right checksums now.
I believe the files got marked bad when the disk hardware acted flakey (the
system couldn't read RIB or data pages) but that's been fixed.  Any more
news as to what when wrong with the hardware?  /Joe

Subject: Found cause of F74 crashes with /D06. 

The dispatch table for the AUXCAL uuo was getting trashed.  This table was
followed by a table with counts of TTCALL uuos, called TTCCNT which was
set up for 20 entries (0 thru 17 octal).  The problem is that UUOCON sometimes
calls the TTYUUO routine with a negative number in accumulator W, such as
for "leave defered echo".  The instruction AOS TTCCNT(W) when W was negative
caused the damage.  This damage would not be noticed until the next poor
sucker tried to read the terminal CLASS setting.

Fix: Add room for -5 thru -1 to TTCCNT.    /Joe

Subject: NETID on CREAUX. 

I have modified SCNSER to pick up bits 1 thru 16 from the LH of the AC used
in the CREAUX uuo.  (Bit 17 means don't zap on reset, bit 0 is unused).
ThThe message that requests permission to build an AUX circuit now has:
  1st byte = 16 hex (26 octal) = Supervisor request
  2nd byte = port number if job has a command port, 0 if detached
  3rd byte = bits 1-8 from AC used in CREAUX uuo
  4th byte = bits 9-16 from AC used in CREAUX uuo.

The EBUS can pick up these two new bytes by defining AUXNETID as a word of
storage and adding MOVE.W DAT3,AUXNETID at label SUPR1 in routine SUPREC.
If the AUXNETID is zero, the EBUS should send ISIS port-0 message 8 to the
node code where the port originated.  That message is:
  1st + 2nd byte = 0 = port 0 message
  3rd byte = 8 = aux circuit request
  4th byte = key = meaningful to dispatcher only (maybe we can use this)
  5th byte = high half of local key, always zero for EBUS
  6th byte = low half of local key = port number from PDP-10
  7th + 8th byte = flag bits, including IIX (maybe we can use 8th byte)
  9th byte = high half of origination host, always zero for EBUS
  10th byte = low half of origination host number = PDP10's host number
  11th byte = size of string to follow
  12th and following bytes = USERNAME:HOST

Next question: Where do we put the extra info into message 8?  Or would it
be better to define a new port-0 message?  Do we want 8 bits of NETID or 16?

These changes are in P035/D07.		/Joe

Craig,  please indicate Osman's title,  I do not know if he is Sr or not as

Craig,  we didn't give the project a title, and I recal talking about a
        disk-repair expert system, so I wanted to clarify what our objective
        was to match the project to your job objective and mine.

Am I presuming too much in saying we will pool the knowledge from all three
experts?  Should I include anyone else?  (For diagnosis, i don't know if
anyone other than Craig could be added; Craig is good at pulling information
out of all of us in a directive manner;  For planned response/repair there
may be help from Rick or BIll R?  comments?)

PS.  I realize I should have asked this stuff while I was at the office, but
     my brain was on vacation even though I was at the office.

Subject: Proposed MDCIS project 



MDCIS Billing for TOPS-10
=========================

    Currently the billing for the OSTC.DEC1 machine running TOPS-10 version
    7.01 is handled by having AT&T read the DAEMON output from SYS:FACT.SYS
    and generate a detail tape for MDCIS.  The detail tape is then processed
    by MDCIS and the charges are added into other AT&T charges for other MDC
    usage and the billing department handles the rest.

    AT&T generates their own bills for their customers while the detail tape
    is being prepared.

    As of 31-Dec-88, AT&T will no longer handle the billing for any customers
    on the OSTC.DEC1 system.

    Any AT&T customers wishing to remain on OSTC.DEC1 will have to be billed
    by MDC directly.  The following proposal outlines what MDFSCO is prepared
    to do to provide a billing system for MDCIS, thereby giving MDC complete
    control of the OSTC.DEC1 system.


    1)  Obtain the license to run the Catholic University Machine Accounting
	Package and install it on OSTC.DEC1 in Saint Louis.

	Time estimate:  1 man month


    2)  Work with MDCIS personnel to determine the rates and service classes
	to be provided for their customers.  Provide training to the system
	administrator for modifying charges as needed.

	Time estimate:  2-3 man weeks
	(depending on complexity desired by MDCIS)

    3)  Work with MDIPS personnel to have summary records produced by the CUA
	accounting package accepted directly into CPIPS.  Options include the
	formal programming review and QA procedures required by MDIPS and/or
	collaboration on the modifications to the report program with someone
	in MDIPS.  [The report program uses standard COBOL report-writer].

	Time estimate:  unknown, depends on MDIPS
	Actual time:    1 man week for report modification and QA


    An option not discussed, however viable, is the generation of billing
    statements directly by MDCIS.  The CUA accounting package is designed to
    produce bills and summary reports from the machine accounting data and
    other sites using this package do indeed print their billing statements
    directly from these reports.  Our modifications to the report generation
    program will be to condense the billing statements into CPIPS records.

    Time estimate:  Same as #3 above, 1-2 man weeks (depending on # of reports)


    As previously discussed, MDFSCO will guarantee installation in three (3)
    man-months.  If installation takes significantly less time, MDFSCO will
    charge only for actual consultant time on the project.


-------------------------
Craig,
  Please note:  my estimates do not total 3 months!
                feel free to add a week to each to bring them closer if
                you feel it is necessary.
  Not split apart (included in installation) is the time to re-modify the
  the AT&T modifications to allow CUA-ACT to work, or to prevent AT&T from
  using the system to generate their own bills.  THis, I feel may be a bid
  for us for ongoing support, or a secondary consultation to be performed
  beginning in January?

  PS.  Am I clear that 4Q'88 will be spent on this and the AI project?  Or is
       the AI project expected to be competed in '89?

Subject: Hotline call for B39 

20-Jul-88 22:08/Joe
Incident: none, just message to call Mike Silva at Fremon Data Center
Problem:  B39 crashed with IME again, 6th time today.
          It passed diags, including 'B' string, but died even on the two-pack
          test system.
Status:   I was unable to login with the system up MANUAL because username
          JMS does not have shut-override on BUBBNET.  (Neither does OPER!)
          System would not stay up long enough to run fast DSKCLN using
          NOINITIA.  I had Mike bring B39 up in CONSOLE mode to copy all
          the crash dumps to tape so they could be restored to X32.
Analysis: All crash dumps are very consistent.  Page fault at USRCLK+4.
          The only way to get there is via:
		CIP5:	SKIPLE	J,JOB##
			 PUSHJ	P,USRCLK	;See if user wants a clock trap
          Location JOB is zero but PREVAC+J is 400.  That is, bit 27 is set
          in ac 2 of AC block 1.  Looks like a problem with SKIPLE or FM.

Disclaimer of Liability

The  user  of  this  test  acknowledges,  understands, and agrees that sex is a
hazardous sport; that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement
at all times; that their partner's condition vary constantly  and  are  greatly
affected  by weather changes and previous use, that dirty sheets, variations in
terrain and bed surfaces,  spouses/pimps/managers,  forest  growth,  rocks  and
debris,  clothed  obstacles,  and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and  customers,  exist  throughout  the  bedroom
area.  Personal  managers  (pimps/spouses)  and sado-masochistic operations and
equipment are  constantly  in  use  and  may  be  hazardous  to  customers  not
copulating  in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
injury can happen at any time, even to customers  copulating  in  control  with
proper  sexual  equipment.   Inherent and other risks are part of the sport and
exist in your partner. As a condition of being permitted to use the  facilities
of  your  sex object, the user of the partner agrees to copulate in control and
within the limits of his/her ability and further acknowledges and accepts these
hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or
damage to property which might result from the customer's use of the  partner's
facilities.

As  a  further  condition  of  being  permitted  to  use the facilities of your
partner, the customer understands and  agrees  (1)  that  in  the  event  of  a
transfer  of  use  by  another  or anything else in the management's opinion is
misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be  revoked
without  refund;  (2)  that  the partner is the property of the harem and, upon
request, he/she must be presented  to  any  authorized  representative  of  the
pimp/spouse;  (3)  that sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times
when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.

Your sexual partner  is  not  transferable;  see  Theft  of  Services,  V.S.A.,

 3    13-Apr-1985  400     CMU/da, fa, tc, no, dt, sv, rz, et al

Version 1 (100)         Created  at  MIT.  Two parallel versions; one for male,
                and one for female. Not much is known about this version.

Version 2 (247)         Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the beginning of
                the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.

Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984 
                First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                former version were short-lived and tended to  be  bug  ridden.
                Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                version and version 2. Added in Genesis/History section.

Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985 
                Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.

Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985 
                Rebuilt  from  the  3.3C.1  source  and the 3.4 (only surviving
                copy) of the Xerox X9700 laser  printer  hardcopy.  Cleaned  up
                same  bugs  in  3.4;  wiped  out a duplicate question; The page
                number was moved from top of the page  to  the  bottom  center;
                this  was to avoid problems trying to coordinate duplex/simplex
                printing by other people and the positioning of  odd/even  page
                numbers. Added in verbose history section.

Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985 
                Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400. After an
                all-night hack session, discovered that the problem  lies  with
                the  version  4  (1400)-1  of Scribe and how it treats @section
                headers and  @begin(text).  Ended  up  making  the  pageheading
                contain  a  Scribe  version  field. Also had to add in an extra
                token @newpage on the page that the questions start;  this  was
                to  preserve  the  last  of  the  @style[pagenumber  (@A)] page
                numbers, preserve the same in the Table of Contents, force  the
                page  number  to  be  1,  make  sure that the Contents get that
                right, and to force @pageheading and @pagefooting.

Instructions for Use

This  is  a  fairly  long  test  consisting  of  four  hundred (400  , CD     ,
                                                                   10    Roman
110010000 ,  620 ,  190  ,  103000.100  ).  It  starts  out   tame   and   gets
         2      8      16             Pi
progressively  worse,  or  better,  depending on your viewpoint. There are many
ways of going about taking this test.  You  can,  of  course,  as  your  right,
guaranteed  by  the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your
room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the funnest  way
to  utilize this test if to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one (1  ,
                                                                            10
I     , 1 , 1 , 1  , 1  ) (read my lips: one) copy of the test, and a bunch  of
 Roman   2   8   16   Pi
friends.  (No  doubt lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)
The person with the copy of the test will be  the  test  administrator;  he/she
will  read  the  questions  out  loud  and everybody else will write down their
answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are  required
to  divulge  their  answers,  that  is up to the group to decide; however, each
person's purity score should be made common knowledge.  (The  person  with  the
highest  score  gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works
great at parties and lets everybody know who's easy and who  isn't,  so  you'll
know who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.

All  questions  in  this  test  pertain  to  events  that  have happened to you
subsequent to your  weaning  and  babyhood  infancy.  Anything  that  may  have
happened  before  such  time  is  considered not standing and void; it's a null
point. The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating  you  AND/OR
you masturbating someone else, not exclusively someone masturbating you AND you
masturbating  them.  We  would also like to define having sex in the homosexual
case; homosexual sex has occurred when you and/or your  partner  (of  the  same
sex) have an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of you and
those of your partner.

We  would  now  like  to  bring  to your attention that there is no passing nor
failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about  getting  a
high score, even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

I. Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best, as does the a  la  mainframe
method.   (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.) Of the easier ways:  count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:

     For people with real calculators (HP):

               <#no ans.> [ENTER] 4 /

     For people with other (dinky) calculators:

               <#no ans.> / 4 =

Well, you asked for it and here it is.  You should note that there are many
different forms of this floating around the world, but almost all are of
the same basic sentiment.  Requested history is also provided care of the
authors of this version.

Disclaimer of Liability

The  user  of  this  test  acknowledges,  understands, and agrees that sex is a
hazardous sport; that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement
at all times; that their partner's condition vary constantly  and  are  greatly
affected  by weather changes and previous use, that dirty sheets, variations in
terrain and bed surfaces,  spouses/pimps/managers,  forest  growth,  rocks  and
debris,  clothed  obstacles,  and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and  customers,  exist  throughout  the  bedroom
area.  Personal  managers  (pimps/spouses)  and sado-masochistic operations and
equipment are  constantly  in  use  and  may  be  hazardous  to  customers  not
copulating  in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
injury can happen at any time, even to customers  copulating  in  control  with
proper  sexual  equipment.   Inherent and other risks are part of the sport and
exist in your partner. As a condition of being permitted to use the  facilities
of  your  sex object, the user of the partner agrees to copulate in control and
within the limits of his/her ability and further acknowledges and accepts these
hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or
damage to property which might result from the customer's use of the  partner's
facilities.

As  a  further  condition  of  being  permitted  to  use the facilities of your
partner, the customer understands and  agrees  (1)  that  in  the  event  of  a
transfer  of  use  by  another  or anything else in the management's opinion is
misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be  revoked
without  refund;  (2)  that  the partner is the property of the harem and, upon
request, he/she must be presented  to  any  authorized  representative  of  the
pimp/spouse;  (3)  that sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times
when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.

Your sexual partner  is  not  transferable;  see  Theft  of  Services,  V.S.A.,
sections 2581 and 2582.

Version 1 (100)         Created  at  MIT.  Two parallel versions; one for male,
                and one for female. Not much is known about this version.

Version 2 (247)         Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the beginning of
                the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.

Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984 
                First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                former version were short-lived and tended to  be  bug  ridden.
                Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                version and version 2. Added in Genesis/History section.

Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985 
                Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.

Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985 
                Rebuilt  from  the  3.3C.1  source  and the 3.4 (only surviving
                copy) of the Xerox X9700 laser  printer  hardcopy.  Cleaned  up
                same  bugs  in  3.4;  wiped  out a duplicate question; The page
                number was moved from top of the page  to  the  bottom  center;
                this  was to avoid problems trying to coordinate duplex/simplex
                printing by other people and the positioning of  odd/even  page
                numbers. Added in verbose history section.

Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985 
                Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400. After an
                all-night hack session, discovered that the problem  lies  with
                the  version  4  (1400)-1  of Scribe and how it treats @section
                headers and  @begin(text).  Ended  up  making  the  pageheading
                contain  a  Scribe  version  field. Also had to add in an extra
                token @newpage on the page that the questions start;  this  was
                to  preserve  the  last  of  the  @style]pagenumber  (@A)( page
                numbers, preserve the same in the Table of Contents, force  the
                page  number  to  be  1,  make  sure that the Contents get that
                right, and to force @pageheading and @pagefooting.

Instructions for Use

This  is  a  fairly  long  test  consisting  of  four  hundred (400  , CD     ,
                                                                   10    Roman
110010000 ,  620 ,  190  ,  103000.100  ).  It  starts  out   tame   and   gets
         2      8      16             Pi
progressively  worse,  or  better,  depending on your viewpoint. There are many
ways of going about taking this test.  You  can,  of  course,  as  your  right,
guaranteed  by  the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your
room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the funnest  way
to  utilize this test if to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one (1  ,
                                                                            10
I     , 1 , 1 , 1  , 1  ) (read my lips: one) copy of the test, and a bunch  of
 Roman   2   8   16   Pi
friends.  (No  doubt lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)
The person with the copy of the test will be  the  test  administrator;  he/she
will  read  the  questions  out  loud  and everybody else will write down their
answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are  required
to  divulge  their  answers,  that  is up to the group to decide; however, each
person's purity score should be made common knowledge.  (The  person  with  the
highest  score  gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works
great at parties and lets everybody know who's easy and who  isn't,  so  you'll
know who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.

All  questions  in  this  test  pertain  to  events  that  have happened to you
subsequent to your  weaning  and  babyhood  infancy.  Anything  that  may  have
happened  before  such  time  is  considered not standing and void; it's a null
point. The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating  you  AND/OR
you masturbating someone else, not exclusively someone masturbating you AND you
masturbating  them.  We  would also like to define having sex in the homosexual
case; homosexual sex has occurred when you and/or your  partner  (of  the  same
sex) have an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of you and
those of your partner.

We  would  now  like  to  bring  to your attention that there is no passing nor
failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about  getting  a

I. Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best, as does the a  la  mainframe
method.   (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.) Of the easier ways:  count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:

     For people with real calculators (HP):

               <#no ans.> ]ENTER( 4 /

     For people with other (dinky) calculators:

               <#no ans.> / 4 =

X17 SPECIAL BACKUP
System X17 (RM03) down due to garbage in page 0 (KS-boot pointer) and
garbage in RIB to DSKCLN.SAV.  Booted from tape, came up in CONSOLE mode
to run (SYS)DSKCLN.107 in CHECK mode.  "DELETE (SYS)DSKCLN.SAV/BAD" and
"RENAME (SYS)DSKCLN.107,(SYS)DSKCLN.SAV".  After full DSKCLN, was able
to restore most of the files in (SYS)RECOV.SYS, but left (CARL)FSLAVE.SAV
and (CARL)MT.SAV alone.  DSKCLN did not detect all files damaged by MUP
because the new file that overlapped the old file got deleted before DSKCLN
had a chance to run (001RPG.TMP in particular).

Two incremental saves have been done: (NOBACKUP)INC11.DIR on 19-Oct-88 and
(NOBACKUP)INC12.DIR on 21-Oct-88.

The "/" is special in TUMS (for PDP-10 addresses, only).  It means:
	WRS/FOO.BAR@B39
to append the message to the file (WRS:39)FOO.BAR or to forward the message
to the list of addresses found in (WRS:39)FOO.BAR depending on what is in the
first line of FOO.BAR.  How about "." as in C.Baltrunas?  -Bill

Subject: The null job is not running on D34. 

SY says that D34 is 100% used.  it lies.  
Many user jobs in the RN queue are not getting any run time, not even the
null job.  PAM has 11 hours of idle time; meaning it has not executed any UUOs
during that time even though it is in a RN state.  Since it is not racking
up TRUs, it is not getting any CPU time.  And when CHKPNT gets stuck, all
user programs eventually grind to a halt in the AC state, waiting on the
ACT: device.  Last night I attached to CHKPNT but it did not output its
"CHKPNT shutting down" message because it was stuck in this funny RN state.

Subject: Re: "/" in username 

Sigh.  I found out about "/" looking at (TUMS)MAILIB.  Sigh.

The idea was that a lot of FSC people who now used ONTYME only, could
use a login name on our test host and we wanted it to conform with what
they were used to with ONTYME.

By the way, unless you parse the username yourself, SAIL doesn't like "."
in a username.  (The same routine is used to scan sixbit username as for
sixbit filename and "gee", the "." says an extension is coming.  I pointed
out this bug years ago to Adele, and it was decided to leave it.  I may
go and put it in myself one of these days.)

Does the documentation for TUMS say "/"?  (I don't recall!)
For ourpurposes, and on our system, "?" could be changed to "\" since
CheckLocal is the only routine in MAILIB that cares.  Then "/" would
be ok in a PDP-10 MAILNAME.   It's legal in a TYMNET username!

Symptom 1: Could no log into X32 - "?LOGINN.SHR not found".
Symptom 2: Later on, while trying to login to X32, got no response;
  typing any character produced a beep.

Problem 1 = WRTSAT on the SAT that had LOGINN.SHR.  This message would
output many times.

Problem 2 = Something had halted the console fron-end.  The CONSOLE light was
on.  Pressing the "CONT" switch got it running.  It said KL10 halted, which
was not true - the lights on the memory box were still flashing because jobs
were still running.  Then the WRTSAT messages came out - many pages of
them.  They had all been buffered up.  The beeps were because SCNSER had run
out of TTY chunks and could not process new login requests.

X32's "CHKPNT no acctg files" was caused by 2 problems.
(UN1)120688.SAT hardware data write error detected.
(UN1) disk quota exceeded.

Fixed the problem by changing the disk quota and starting CHKPNT manually.

John Healy has X17 hooked up to the RP06 string running TOPS-20.
X14 has problems with its disk RH11.  It can boot the monitor, read from
all three RM03's, as long as interrupts are off.  It types out "Highest
memory address is ...", then enables interrupts as it tries to read the
HOME pages.  That is where it is failing.  John will be working on both
systems today.   /Joe

Subject: VUE for SUN 

With the exception of the control sequence for insert-character, I've
patched my one-terminal version of VUE (I've put in the insert-char code
but it is untested), and it is available as (YEUX)SVUE.SHR/.LOW on all
systems.

I may put it into the %1 copy on (SYS) but that's a project for a rainy day
(Oh... it's raining outside... no, another rainy day!!!)

If it doesn't work, or has problems, please let me know... I will expend
some effort to fix it, since I too, want to use it on SUN.

Subject: DSKCLN cannot handle more than 3 million pages in DSKB: 

DSKCLN has to keep 3 copies of the SATs in memory while it is running.
One SAT read from disk, one SAT being built, and one SAT of trouble pages.
The one from disk is used in FAST mode and the trouble SAT is where
multiply used pages are marked.  DSKCLN can only use 256K of memory.  Since
the program is 16K, that leaves 240K for data.  The maximum size of a single
SAT is 80K.  This means 80*1024*36 = 3047424 pages.  F33 is using 12.5 3652
spindles (25 logical units) with a total of 2995200 pages.  DSKCLN cannot
handle the 26th unit - F33 is maxed out!

I had to remove unit DSKB31 and remove the pointers to that unit from the RIBs
of HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and SPAGES.SYS before DSKCLN could run.
