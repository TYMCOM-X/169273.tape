   SYNOPSIS

           Build aux-circuit and pass traffic through to terminal.

   SYNTAX

           TAUX username:host/switch

   DESCRIPTION

           A circuit is built to  the specified user name and host.   If the
           user name  does not match  the current users  then AC  license is
           required to build the circuit.

           Valid switches:

           /D          enable display control character mode
           /E          enable local echo mode

           Once the circuit is established, indicated by the message
                   [network passthrough created]
           the  user  may  enter commands  by  typing  the  escape character
           (initially ^X) followed by a one letter command as follows:

           <eXc>n<cr>  send character with octal value n
           <eXc>D      toggle Display control character mode
           <eXc>E      toggle local Echo mode
           <eXc>H      type this Help message (also ?)
           <eXc>Q      Quit and zap network connection
           <eXc>X      change eXcape character
           <eXc>Y      send Yellow ball
           <eXc><eXc>  send <eXc> character

           where
           <eXc>       is the current network passthrough escape character
                       (initially ^X)

           If the  escape character <eXc>  is typed, but  not followed  by a
           command character, a prompt for the command is issued.

   CAVEATS

           It is a serious violation of security policy, and also very rude,
           to use AC license  to log into a  username for which you  are not
           authorized.
