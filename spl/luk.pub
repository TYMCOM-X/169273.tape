R (SPL)LUK
.description
LUK will search a list of directories for specified files.

File masks should be separated by commas. 
If an extension is left off (no "." in the name) "*" is assumed.  
If the name is null and an extension is given (not "###"), "*" is used. 
A name or extension ending in "*" will be padded with "#"s.

The command line is scanned for a list of directory names, which may
be specified by a series of names separated by commas, or "@" followed
by the name of a file with the names on it.  The command line is 
examined by doing a "RESCAN" and skipping past the first semicolon.
If nothing is specified in the command line (or it is inaccessible), 
and if a file named "LUK.STD" is on your GFDed directory, LUK will 
behave as if it got "@LUK.STD" from the command line.  

New in version 5: PPNs may also be used where user names are taken.
They should be encased in square brackets.  If you have "RF" enabled
you may also specify PPNs with an asterisk for either the GAN or UUN
field of the PPN.  Example: .RUN (SPL)LUK;[1,*],[3,*],(UPL),@MORE
If you do specify a directory by PPN, LUK will translate it to a user
name on output.
On the "File masks: " line, you may type 
.continue;
	"^" to re-enter the directory list
.continue;
or	"?" to print out the Help file (this file)

New in version 6: "*"s may be imbedded in file names or extensions.
What they mean is "any number of characters here including 0".
