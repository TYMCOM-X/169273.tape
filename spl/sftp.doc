   (SPL)SFTP                       Tymcom-X                        (SPL)SFTP


   SYNOPSIS

           Simple file transfer protocol slave program.

   SYNTAX

           R (SPL)SFTP

   DESCRIPTION

           Invokes  a  slave  process  to  handle  simple   file  transfers.
           Transfers are restricted to text files.  There is no  checksum or
           retransmission protocol to detect  or recover from errors,  it is
           assumed this function is provided by the network.

           Commands  consist  of a  four  character command  followed  by an
           optional  argument  followed  by  end-of-line.   The  end-of-line
           convention used to terminate commands determines  the end-of-line
           used in data transfer.

           The slave will answer with the welcome message:
                   220 SFTP server v?? ready.

           The following commands may then be sent to the slave:

           HELO master-system-name

                   This command is optional and merely  provides information
                   for  file  creation and  any  logs that  may  be  kept in
                   future.  Possible responses are:
                           250 okay

           READ filename

                   This command reads a file from the slave system.   If the
                   file is successfully opened, a response
                           252 File data follows
                   is sent followed by
                           <cr><lf><file><^d><cr><lf>
                   In the body, <file>, the character <^d> is sent twice for
                   each real occurance  to eliminate confusion with  the end
                   of file sequence.  The possible failure responses are:
                           550 File not found
                           550 No such user
                           550 Protection failure
                           450 File being modified
                           554 LOOKUP failure
                           501 Illegal file name
                   Also, the non-fatal error message:
                           211-Block mode not available
                   may precede the 252 message in cases where the network is
                   temporarily out of block IO buffers.  If the READ command

                   is terminated by <CR><LF>, no translation occurs.  If the
                   command  is terminated  by only  <LF>, all  occurances of
                   <CR><LF>   in   the  file   (Tymcom-X   end-of-line)  are
                   translated to <LF> when sent (Unix end-of-line).  The end
                   of file mark, <^d><CR><LF>, always contains <CR>.  In all
                   cases,  SFTP will  remove PDP-10  style line  numbers (as
                   left by the SOS editor) and embedded and trailing nulls.

           WRIT filename

                   This commands accepts a  file to be written on  the slave
                   system.  If the file is successfully opened, a response
                           354 Start file input
                   is sent.  The master should then send the contents of the
                   file  using the  same escape  mechanism  described above.
                   After  the end  of file,  <^d><cr><lf>, is  received, the
                   response
                           250 <filename> <length> chars
                   will be sent.  Errors are indicated by the messages
                           550 No such user
                           550 Protection failure
                           450 File being modified
                           554 ENTER failure
                           501 Illegal file name
                   In addition, the non-fatal error message
                           211-Block mode not available
                   may precede the 354 message in cases where the network is
                   temporarily out of block IO buffers.  A <CR>  preceding a
                   <LF> is optional, and  if absent will be provided  by the
                   program  to  meet Tymcom-X  conventions.   In  block mode
                   input (if available), there will be a 15-20  second delay
                   after  sending the  end of  file mark  before  the system
                   responds.

           NOOP

                   Response is

                   This command is typically used for debugging.   It causes
                   the  server  program  to  immediately  terminate  without
                   logging out.

           All  messages  from  the  SFTP  slave  will  be  terminated  with
           <cr><lf>.  Commands and data are not echoed.
