CONNECTING DIABLO

If diablo is hard wired, just  turn red power switch on top  of keyboard
to ON.

Otherwise dial 6001 on telephone.   When you the ringing stops,  and you
hear  a  steady tone,  place  phone in  the  modem with  the  cord where
indicated on the modem.  Press the modem power switch on (the light will
go on).  Then turn on the terminal as above.

LOGGING IN AND OUT:

The first  message that will  be typed on  the terminal is  "please type
your terminal identifier".  Type  "e" ("a" will work also).   This tells
the computer what type of a  terminal you are logging in from.   You can
type the "e" or "a" as soon as the first line begins to type.

(Aside:  It is very hard to  read what is typing.  You can  toggle (turn
on) the  SCROLL switch on  the top  of the keyboard  and the  paper will
scroll up whenever there is a pause to enable you to read the line.)

You then will get  a line telling the node  and port you are  logging in
through like

        -1327-063-

and then you will get the message "please log in:".  Type "systech:" and
the system number of the system you wish to log into.  As an example, if
you were logging into system 33 the line would now look like this:

        please log in: systech:33

If you type  a carriage return at  this point, the message  will appear,
"password:".  You then should type the password, ending with  a carriage
return.  The password will not print on the typewriter.

If you prefer, you can type the password right after the  system number,
separating the  two with  a semicolon, and,  again, ending  the password
with a carriage  return (that tells the  computer you have  finished the
password).

If you have made a mistake  typing the password, you will get  a message
"error, type  password:".  If you  make a mistake  typing the  user name

("systech") or system number you  can hit the "escape" key and  you will
get the prompt again.

You should  get a short  (or sometimes long)  message from  the computer
system to which you are logged in.  If, instead, you get a message "host
down" or "host shut" from the network, try again later.

It is important to end a session by logging out.  The following commands
will log you out: "log", "exit",  "kill" or "bye".  If you have  work to
do on more than one systems,  logout of the first system, and  then into
the second.  At the end, when you are finished, just turn off the Diablo
after the "please log in:" prompt, and hang up the telephone if  you are
using a modem.

TYPING OUT MATERIAL:

MARGINS:

To set the  left margin on the  Diablo, depress the LOCAL  button, space
over, or backspace back to  where you wish the margin, hit  the "escape"
key,  then  the "9"  key.   Then hit  the  LOCAL button  again  (it will
release).

For other settings that you can  do with the LOCAL button down,  see the
posted list, or a Diablo manual.

XEXEC:

You are now  "talking" to the executive  program, which will give  you a
period prompt  when it  is ready to  get a  command.  You  terminate all
commands by a carriage return.

CONTROL CHARACTERS:

A  control character  is typed  by holding  down the  "control"  key and
typing the letter given.  Commonly  "control-C" or "^C" are two  ways of
saying  to  hold  down  the  "control"  key  and  type  a  "C".  Control
characters send special messages to the computer.

Generally,  "control-C" is  a  "stop", or  "exit" command.   If  you are
typing out a  file and the paper  is jammed, two "control-C"s  will stop
the output.

"Control-U" will  cause the computer  to ignore the  line you  have just
typed:  "Control-A" (depending  on the mode you  are in), will  ignore a
character.   Either  "Control-A"  or  the  "delete"  key  will  print  a
backslash, the  character(s) being deleted  and then  another backslash.
The computer ignores  everything between the backslashes.   For example,
if  you  wanted  to  type  "r  (pub)under"  and  instead  had  typed  "r
(pub)undre" you could delete back and retype.  Your line would look like
this:

        .r (pub)undre\er\er

but the computer would read "r (pub)under".

TYPE PROGRAMS AND COMMANDS:

There are many ways of telling the computer to type a file for you.  You
can  use  the "type"  command,  or  run programs  such  as  (mpl)type or
(pub)under.

If you are using "type" you generally want the Diablo to  recognize form
feeds.  To do this give the  command "tty form" at the prompt.   It will
look like this:

        .tty form

Always end all commands with a carriage return.

For "type" or  (pub)under you need to set the top of form.  Position the
paper so that the top of the paper is on the row that will be  typed and
depress the "top of form" button.

To run a program, type "r", space, program name.  For (pub)under type

        .r (pub)under

for (mpl)type type

        .r (mpl)type

and you will then be given  the program prompt (an asterisk) for  a file
name.

FILE NAMES

File names have a name of up to six characters and an optional extension
of up to  three characters.  The name  and extension are separated  by a
period.   In parentheses  before  the file  name  is the  user  name, or
directory.   Thus  (mpl)copy.doc  is  in  directory  mpl,   name  "copy"
extension "doc".

SWITCHES

Many programs  and commands  will let  you qualify  or modify  them with
switches.  Switches  are additional commands  given after a  slash.  For
example, you can specify a range of pages to be typed in  (mpl)type with
the switch "prange" as follows:

        *sample.fil/prange:2:4

will type pages 2 through  4 from file "sample.fil".  You can  give more
than one switch.

(PUB)UNDER

Files generated by the pub program may be typed with UNDER.  If the file
contains underlining, this is the only way to type out the file.  To use
UNDER set the top of form (as above), and:

        .r (pub)under
        *sample.fil

and the paper will advance to the top of the next sheet, print the file,
and then advance to the top of the next sheet.

You can specify  the page of  the file with  which to begin  typing.  To
start on page 3 you would  hit the "escape" key and then 3  after typing
the file name, as follows ("escape" is usually printed "$"):

        .r (pub)under
        *sample.fil$3

(MPL)TYPE

The only files that will not print out properly with (mpl)type are those
with underlining that are generated by the program PUB.  (If you  try to
print out such a file,  underlining will be printed by  overstriking the
line with ^X^X^X.)

TYPE has many useful switches,  but to begin with just worry  about two:
"page" and "exit".  /page will  do three things: enable you  to position
the first line where you wish, count lines and go to the next page after
60 lines, and go to the top of the next blank page after the end  of the
file. /exit will return you to executive (monitor) level  after printing
the file.  Usually you will use (mpl)type as follows:

        .r (mpl)type
        *sample.fil/page/exit

which will type out  "Position paper at top  of form and type  a space".
Roll paper to top of the  next page and type a space.  The  program will
type out the file, then go to the next page, type "EXIT", and return you
to the EXEC level.

Some other useful switches are:

        pstart:n        start printing file at page n
        prange:n:m      print file from page n through page m
        prange:n        print page n from file
        spacing:double  double space output lines
        pend:n          print file through page n

To learn more about (mpl)type get a copy of the documentation.  It is on
line  in (mpl)type.doc.   (mpl)type.hlp contains  a list  of all  of the
switches.

PROBLEMS

If the Diablo won't work properly, some things to check are the settings
inside  the  Diablo  (check  it against  the  other  one--parity  may be
incorrectly set, for  example), the position of  the lever on  the right
side of the platten (should be forward), the paper feed.

You may sometime get  a message that there is  no such file as  the file
you are attempting to type out, or that you cannot read  that directory.
If you  get such a  message, let either  the Tymcom-X librarian,  or the
person who  gave you the  "diabloing" know.  In  most cases  the problem
with  be  either  an incorrect  file  name,  or a  file  with  the wrong
protection.
