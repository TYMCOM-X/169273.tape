	-----------------------------------------

	SPLFIX is a SPOOL data base maintenance tool for deleting
printed files and correcting common SPOOL data base problems.




	When to Run SPLFIX
	------------------

	SPLFIX should be run either when there is a problem running
SPOOL or when disk space is low on a system.
	The most common SPOOL error, "CANT FIND FD", usually can be
corrected by running SPLFIX and giving the command "repair".  
	The command "clean" will delete the files for all requests
printed before the day it is run (these would be deleted in a few days
with the normal updating routine but the space may be needed).




	How to Run SPLFIX
	-----------------

	SPLFIX is on directory UTIL.  The user can run the program by
typing "r (UTIL) SPLFIX" at the monitor level.  The program will print
out a header message such as:

	* Option (? for help) *                                        *
	****************************************************************

	The user can type a "?<cr>" after the prompt "*" to see the
following help message:

	****************************************************************
	* Legal commands are:                                          *
	*                                                              *
	* CLEAN (DIRECTORY) HELP        QUIT         REPAIR (DATABASE) *
	* Option (? for help) *                                        *
	****************************************************************



	To see a more detailed help message displayed on the screen,
the user can type "HELP<cr>".  The following is the help message
displayed:

	****************************************************************
	* CLEAN      Use this to DELETE unwanted files on the (SPOOL)  *
	*            directory.                                        *
	*                                                              *
	* HELP       Repeat this message.                              *
	*                                                              *
	* QUIT       Graceful exit from the program.  If you exit some *
	*            other way, you will not get the appropriate files *
	*            properly updated.                                 *
	*                                                              *
	* REPAIR     Use this to rebuild SPOOL's data base.            *
	*                                                              *
	* Type any character to continue [CONFIRM]                     *
	****************************************************************

	The only legal commands which the user can input following the
prompt "*" are:  "?", "CLEAN", "HELP", "QUIT" and "REPAIR".  The user
needs only to type minimum number of characters for the inputs.  Since
all commands have unique first characters, typing the first character
of a command will be sufficient.  For example, typing "C<cr>" or
"CL<cr>" or "CLE<cr>" will cause the program to execute the "CLEAN"
command.  But if the user types in a mispelled command such as "CLEAM",
the program will output the following message:

	****************************************************************
	* CLEAM is not a command.  Legal commands are:                 *
	* CLEAN(DIRECTORY) HELP        QUIT          REPAIR (DATABASE) *
	* Option (? for help) *                                        *
	****************************************************************


	Repair Command
	--------------

	After the user types in "REPAIR<cr>", SPLFIX will try to
disable SPOOL in order to do the repair job.  SPLFIX will not disable
SPOOL if someone is running SPOOL; in such case SPLFIX will ask the
user whether it should go to sleep for 15 seconds.  If the user response
is "yes", SPLFIX goes to sleep for 15 seconds, then wakes up and tries
to disable SPOOL again.  If the user response is "no", SPLFIX will print
out the message "SPOOL repair was not done" and prompt the user for the
next command input.  Beware that in such a case the SPOOL repair job was
not done!  The user should try to run SPLFIX with the "repair" command
at a later time.
	The "repair" command also automatically does a "clean" command
to delete printed files.  Therefore there is no need for the user to
issue a "clean" command after the SPOOL repair job is completed.
	CAUTION:  SPLFIX's REPAIR command disables SPOOL to do the
repair job.  It will enable SPOOL when the repair job is done.  Whenever
SPLFIX finishes a repair command, the user should RUN SPOOL IMMEDIATELY
AFTER EXITING FROM SPLFIX.  This is to make sure that SPOOL has been
enabled by SPLFIX.  If the user types in "SPOOL", and "?SPOOL NOT FOUND"
appears on the screen, please immediately contact the TYMCOM-X Support
Line (408) 446-6709.
	CAUTION: It is important to let REPAIR complete in order for
the SPOOL data files to be written correctly.



	What to Do In Case of Problems
	------------------------------

	When SPLFIX runs into problems during execution, it prints out
the following message on the terminal and returns the user to the
monitor level:


	****************************************************************
	* Cannot continue REPAIR!                                      *
	* Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709       *
	* .                                                            *
	****************************************************************

	SPLFIX will print out "Cannot continue CLEAN!"  or "Cannot
continue REPAIR!"  depending on which command it is executing.  In either
case, call the TYMCOM-X Support Line immediately so the problem can be
fixed.
