	SPFIX: A Program to Do Spool Maintenance
	----------------------------------------

	SPFIX stands for "SPool FIXer". SPFIX is a SPOOL maintenance
tool to fix common SPOOL problems associated with its data base. 
SPFIX's functions are described in the help message the program
outputs. See the next section "Running SPFIX" for the list of help
message.

	Running SPFIX
	-------------

	The user interface is very simple:  Run the program.  It will
print a herald that includes the version number.  And if it is a
debugging version the herald will remind the user of that fact.  It will
then ask for user input.  By typing a "?<cr>" the user will obtain a
short help message and the program will ask for user input again.  By
typing a "HELP<cr>" the user will see the following more detailed help
message:

CHARGE		Use this command to clear the charges on a request
		that is stuck in 'PROC' status.  Be sure that it
		actually has been completed!

CLEAN		Use this to DELETE unwanted files on the (SPOOL)
		directory.  

COMPARE         Use this command to compare the number of pages and
                characters in SPOOL records and accounting records.
                Accounting records will be corrected, and report
                written in (SPOOL)SPLCOM.FIL.

HELP		Repeat this message.

PENDING		Finds old requests in GDF (Pending status and over
		10 days old, or tape or process status and over 3
		days old).

PRINT		Prints out charges contained in the monthly batch
		file.  Primarily useful for debugging SPOOL/BATCH.

QUIT		Graceful exit from the program.  If you exit some
		other way, you will not get the log file properly
		updated.  In this case, see the file (SPOOL)SPOOL.LOG.

REPAIR		Use this to rebuild SPOOL's data base.  

STATISTICS      This prints out statistics from the GDF file for use
                in debugging or analyzing SPOOL.

UNPROCESSED     Totals page and character counts for unprocessed
                accounting records older than purge date for customer
                requests.  Any amounts represent lost revenue due to 
                operators not charging off requests.

	The user needs only to type minimum number of characters for
uniqueness.  So typing "S<cr>" or "STAT<cr>" will cause the program to
execute the "STATISTICS" command.  Note that "C<cr>" is an ambiguous
input since there are three commands with starting letter "C".  In such
case the program will respond with the message "Ambiguous command!  Need
at least one character more."

	After the user types in a legal command, the program will
execute the command then prompt for another command input in most
cases.  The exceptions are the CHARGE and the REPAIR command.

	For the CHARGE command, the program will prompt for the request
number and confirmation of whether to charge such a request.

	For the REPAIR command, if some other user is running SPOOL
then the program will not disable SPOOL.  If the program is not run
through an aux circuit, it will ask the user whether it should sleep
for 15 seconds then try to disable SPOOL again.  If the user response is
"NO" then the program will prompt for another command input.  Note in
such a case the REPAIR command is not done!  It is important to let
REPAIR complete in order for the SPOOL data files to be written
correctly.  REPAIR also does a "CLEAN" command inclusively.  There is no
need to do a CLEAN command after a REPAIR command is completed.

	During the execution of CHARGE or REPAIR, SPFIX will update
some files with the message "Updating SPLCNT and REMCNT.  Wait...."  If
for some reason the program fails to open a file, it will print out
"LOOKUP failed for <file name>, do you want to try again?".  The
response "YES" will cause the program to try to open the appropriate
files again.  The response "NO" will cause the program to prompt for
another command input.

	SPFIX will indicate if serious errors occur during execution
and print the cause.  For example, "Was not able to rename SPOOL.SAV 
back to (SYS)."

	SPFIX can take input for system number instead of reading the
system number from the system for the rare cases when the two need
to be different. One rare case is that SPOOL is installed using a
different system number than that on the system. User can run SPFIX
by typing "CTEST RUN SPFIX" at the monitor level. SPFIX will print
out "Read system number as:" for the user to input the system number.

	License on SPFIX
	----------------

	If neither SPFIX nor the user has license WF set before 
running SPFIX, then SPFIX terminates with the message "Need WF license
to continue." With the WF license set, the user can run every command
except "REPAIR". REPAIR checks to see if either the program or the
user has SY and GD license set. If neither has the license set, the
program terminates with the message "Need SY and GD license to do 
repairs."

	Both SPFIX.SAV and (UTIL)SPLFIX.SAV should have SY, GD and WF.

	Overview of the Implementation of SPFIX
	---------------------------------------

	The program begins with requiring source files and load
modules.  The load modules are CHNREC and CMDPRO.  CHNREC handles the
opening and closing of file channeles in SPFIX.  CMDPRO processes the
user input and determines if it a legal command.  The source files are
header files for the load modules and a SAIL library file.

	Next, the program defines the file names for the main data base
files and their backups, followed by the utility procedures.  The
utility procedures include printing prompt on the terminal for user
response and printing time in the right format.

	The program then has macros and procedures to define the
structure of the spool and accounting records.  Next, the program has
procedures which set up buffers and pointers to hold the spool and
accounting records from the data base.  There are also procedures to
search for a particular record in the buffers and to reset the status
of such a record.

	Next, there are procedures to process the commands "PENDING",
"CLEAN" and "REPAIR".  REPAIR gets rid of all bad records in the
SPOOL.GDF and SPOOL.FDF files.  REPAIR disables first to make sure no
one else is changing the SPOOL data base files.  This is done by
renaming SPOOL.SAV from (SYS) to (SPPOPER).  SPOOL.SAV will be renamed
back to (SYS) after the repair is done.

	Next, the accounting file globals and procedures start.  The
procedures process the commands "PRINT", "COMPARE" and "CHARGE".

	The last part of the program is a simple procedure containing
help text followed by the main program.  The main program starts with
macros of a list of legal commands. Then the case statement of all
the commands are build at compile time. The program is set up this
way so that it is very easy to add or delete commands in the future.
Then the program forces input from terminal to be upper case ,followed
by printing a herald, followed by opening a log file with the SETPRINT
runtime. Then the program checks to see if either itself or the user
has WF license set. If the WF license is not set, the program terminates.
If the WF license is set, the program prints out a herald, followed by
the main loop.

	The main loop gets a user command and processes it. If the command
is illegal, a short help message is displayed on the terminal. If the
command is legal, the approapriate procedure is called. The exit of the
loop is the "QUIT" command which runs the procedure "ByeBye".  That
procedure contains statements to close the log file, a file on (SPOOL)
whose name has the format "SPLLOG.MMM". If such file exists, the program
appends the log file to the existing log.  If the file does not exist
SPFIX will create it, but still print the message "LOOKUP failed for
(SPOOL)SPLLOG.MMM".
