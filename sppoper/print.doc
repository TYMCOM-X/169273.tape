TOPS-20 PLEASE and PRINT, along with the system commands ARCHIVE,
RETRIEVE, and MOUNT can provide most of the functionality of the present
Tymcom-X BATCH and SPOOL.  If a sufficiently versatile forms name set can
be defined for PRINT, the only user problem will be with attaching
delivery instructions, and adjusting to the different method of file
handling.  Most of the potential problems are in the area of operator
procedures, accounting, and remote printer support.

The lack of a system number or date on PLEASE requests, as well as the
free-form format could make keeping track of the disposition of the
requests difficult.  There are no accounting records written for PLEASE,
and therefore no way to add delivery or extra charges.

There is also no provision for attaching delivery instructions, and no
means of adding the accounting for delivery charges for PRINT requests.
Page count is kept in the accounting records, but no character count is
kept.

In order to provide the flexibility of form types now present in SPOOL, a
variety of forms names would have to be defined and standardized.

There is no operator notification program, (such as 1NOTIFY).  For remote
print locations the interface for the remote printer will need to be
modified, and node maps created.

BATCH AND PLEASE:  

BATCH:

Tymcom-X BATCH is used to make requests to the center operator, with
information about the requestor and delivery instructions included with
the request.  Accounting for the requests is done by the operator running
BCHARGE.  Program access is by "r BATCH".

PLEASE:

TOPS-20 PLEASE is used to communicate with the operator.  The user sends
free-form messages which are printed on the operator terminal (this can be
a remote station operator).  Normally the user waits for a reply, but can
choose not to wait (/NOWAIT) or to request no reply (/MESSAGE).

Tymcom-X BATCH is often used to request that files be archived or
retrieved.  TOPS-20 has specific commands, "ARCHIVE" and "RETRIEVE" for
these functions.

All accounting is done automatically by the system.  There is no provision
for operator input of charges.

SPOOL AND PRINT:  

SPOOL:

SPOOL on the Tymcom-X is run by the user, who is then prompted for the
necessary information, including requestor's name, telephone number, and
delivery instructions and method.  Options include specifying the location
where the request is to be printed.  SPOOL maintains its own data files,
and copies the files that are spooled to the directory SPOOL.  Accounting
is done by SPOOL, BCHARGE and RCHARGE.

PRINT:

There is no SPOOL program on TOPS-20, but the system-level command PRINT,
which places print requests in the print queue, provides similar
functionality.  Various switches enable the user to specify where the
request will be printed (Decnet node), and other necessary information
such as the paper type and file type.  The file(s) are not copied from the
user's directory, but may be deleted from the directory after the printing
is completed.

ANALYSIS OF PLEASE AND PRINT                                   23-AUG-1982


There is no easy way to attach delivery instructions to a PRINT request,
although a 12 character /NOTE switch does allow for a very terse message
to be printed on the banner.  All accounting is done automatically at the
time of printing.  There is no provision for including delivery charges.

DOCUMENTATION

USER DOCUMENTATION:

The "TOPS-20 User's Guide" contains a brief section on PRINT with a list
of the switches available, and a section on PLEASE.  The only explanation
of the PRINT switches is in the "TOPS-20 Command Reference Manual", but it
is complete.

OPERATOR DOCUMENTATION:

The "TOPS-20 Operator's Guide" contains information about operator tasks
for PLEASE and PRINT.  All operator interface with LPTSPL, the line
printer spooler, is through OPR.  The "TOPS-20 Operator's Command Language
Reference Manual" gives full documentation of the OPR commands.

The "TOPS-20 DN200 Remote Station Guide" contains operator documentation
for the operator at a DN200 remote station.

REMOTE PRINTING 

It looks as though it is possible to use PRINT to do remote printing using
the /DESTINATION-NODE:node name:: switch, but there are several problems
to solve:

     1.  The interface for remote locations will have to be modified
     so that locations can identify themselves.

     2.  A new map of printer locations will have to be created, with
     printer locations numbered from 1 to 77 (octal) using the
     present EXEC and QUASAR on TOPS-20.  These numbers (or names)
     would then be used by users to identify print locations.

     3.  The limitation of 63 remote locations may not be sufficient
     for future needs.

     4.  A method for including delivery instructions needs to be
     developed.  Mail could be sent containing the delivery
     instructions and the file name, but this procedure would be easy
     for users and operators to overlook.

     5.  Charging mechanisms for delivery and other information not
     presently included in accounting records (such as character
     count) need to be developed.

     6.  A means of remote operator notification needs to be
     developed.  The alternative would be to require remote operators
     to log into each TOPS-20 system regularly to examine the queue.
     Experience gained with SPOOL suggests that this would be a
     chronic source of delay and oversights.

     7.  Some method of checking node names for validity needs to be
     developed.  A method of allowing the system to select a default
     node for the user who uses the DESTINATION-NODE switch also may
     need to be developed.  Otherwise, users will need more training
     and will be prone to making errors resulting in misdirected
     requests and lost listings.

FURTHER COMMENTS: 

     1.  Users converting from Tymcom-X would need to be made aware
     that the file will be printed as it is at the time of printing,
     and that a copy would need to be made if the file that is
     SPOOLED might be modified before it was printed.

     2.  The only way to retrieve information about completed PRINT
     requests is by reading the system accounting files.

     3.  Some of the options available through SPOOL are not
     available.  These include multipart paper (although that could
     be a paper form type), indent, decollate and katakana (should it
     be supported).

     4.  Definitions for specific forms types will need to be
     developed to match the versatility of SPOOL.

     5.  PRINT has several switches that provide capabilities not in
     SPOOL, such as /NOTIFY, /PRIORITY, and /AFTER:[date and/or time,
     or day of week (or TODAY) and/or time].  A user can SET DEFAULT
     PRINT to set standard switches, and include this in LOGIN.CMD.
     This permits customization of standard printing options.

Remote site printing  

    There is a switch for PRINT that can specify print location:
    /DESTINATION-NODE:node name::.  (This is for a Decnet node.) The PRINT
    request goes into the queue with the destination set and will stay in
    the queue until the request is printed or cancelled.  It will be
    printed automatically when the named node is on-line with a printer
    correctly set.

    SET LOCATION node name:: can set destination for the user.  This sets
    the node for printing and PLEASE.  But it also sets the node for
    MOUNT, which usually would be wrong for a Tymshare system.  SET
    LOCATION can be put in the LOGIN.CMD file.

    There is no validity check on the node name.  This is true for both
    /DESTINATION-NODE and SET LOCATION.  At least the user can get a list
    of valid node names from INFORMATION DECNET.

    The print request for the remote location appears in the queue list
    printed in response to an INFORMATION OUTPUT-REQUESTS command for all
    users, and in the queue lists for all operators.  Center operators
    will see the location switch in the queue listing unless they give the
    /SHORT switch for SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS.  Remote operators will see
    only the items in the queue for that remote location.  The job will
    stay in the queue until it is printed.

    DECNET nodes identify themselves to the host and receive print
    requests.  These nodes are DN-200 remote stations, based on a PDP-
    11/34A that is connected over a synchronous line to the host.
    Operators can change the host number by using the command SET HOST and
    this will connect to another host.  Operators at the remote site have
    a limited set of OPR commands they can use; these include all the
    usual printer controls.

Level of forms    

    TOPS-20 defines forms in the LPFORM.INI file.

    Each line in the file is of the format
           formname:locator/switch1/switch2/switch3...
    where:

      formname is a 1-6 character form name that should be descriptive;
               it is specified by the system manager or operator.
               The first four characters must be unique.

      :locator is an optional locator field containing:

        ALL - all devices, the default
        LPTnn - a specific line-printer unit

      /switch1...
        /ALIGN:filespec
        /BANNER:nn  number of banner pages (default 2)
        /CHAIN:xxx  chain or
        /DRUM:xxx   drum to be used on printer
        /HEADER:nn  number of file header pages (default 2)
        /LINES:nn   number of lines on each page
        /TEXT:xxx   short message typed on operator terminal
                    at the time forms are scheduled
        /RIBBON:xxx type of ribbon to be used on line printer
        /TAPE:xxx   vertical forms control tape or
        /VFU:xxx    VFU to be used
        /TRAILER:nn number of job trailer pages (default 2)
        /WIDTH:nn   characters per line for banner, etc pages

    The above switches provide considerable flexibility but they do not
    allow users to specify the number of lines or to provide a description
    of a special form.  Many of our customers use special forms and
    multipart paper--see the statistics report in Appendix A.

    Since the form definitions are not standardized, it will be necessary
    to design, name and document the forms that will be supported.

SPOOL options 

    PRINT has switches that provide counterparts to all SPOOL options
    except LINES=; it also has some additional capabilities.  The
    switches are as follows (+ indicates features not in SPOOL):

     Command switches:
      /ACCOUNT:account   name to charge (defaults to the logged in user)
     +/AFTER:date and/or time, or day of week (or TODAY) and/or time
      /DESTINATION-NODE:node name::   specifies location for printing
      /FORMS:forms name  defaults to NORMAL
      /GENERIC           use any printer (overrides previous /UPPERCASE,
                         /LOWERCASE, or /UNIT switch)
      /JOBNAME:name      assigns a name to the printing job; defaults to
                         the first six characters of the first filename
     +/LIMIT:n           places a limit of n pages on the output
                         (a default limit is figured from size of files)
      /LOWERCASE         directs the job to a line printer that can print
                         both uppercase and lowercase characters
     +/NOTE:message      labels the header page of output (limit 12 char)
     +/NOTIFY:NO         send message when request completed;
                         (defaults to YES if switch given, otherwise NO)
     +/PRIORITY:n        assigns priority number from 1 to 63 (default 10)
     /SEQUENCE:n         user-assigned sequence number to use when
                         modifying or cancelling request (max: 262143)
     /UNIT:octal number  direct request to specific printer
    +/UPPERCASE          directs the job to a line printer that uses
                         only uppercase characters
    +/USER:username      specifies the owner of the print request
                         (for privileged users only)

  File Switches:
     +/BEGIN:n           starts printing at page n of file
      /COPIES:n
     +/DELETE            deletes file after printing (default for .lst)
      /FILE:type         where type is one of ASCII, COBOL, ELEVEN,
                         FORTRAN
      /HEADER            default
     +/MODE:type         designated mode for printing file; type is
                         ARROW (default), ASCII, OCTAL, or SUPPRESS
     +/NOHEADER
      /PRESERVE          don't delete .lst file
     +/REPORT:title      for COBOL report writer
      /SPACING:type      where type is SINGLE (default), DOUBLE, TRIPLE

    The request is given a request id by the system.  This is used for
    modifying or deleting the request.

    +MODIFY can add or change switches for a request in the output queue.

Handling of files  

    TOPS-20 does not make a copy of the file, but just puts the filename
    in a queue.  This is different behavior from SPOOL, as the file can
    still be modified before it is printed.

    For printing at a center only, copying a file to LPT:  will put the
    file in the SPOOL directory and also into the printer queue for the
    first available printer.  The file name is retained, but the extension
    is lost.  The username is kept in the queue information, and
    accounting is the same as for PRINT.  This procedure will allow
    modification of the file after the COPY without changing the printed
    copy, or, by deleting the original file, will eliminate the disk
    storage in the original directory.  Note that no printing switches can
    be used with this procedure.

support for "intelligent" remote site:    

    Support exists for the DN200 work station.

support for hosts without printer    

    Output can be sent to tape by the operator with START PRINTER nn
    /DEVICE:MTAn.  The accounting record will be identical except that the
    completion record will give the time that the request is stored on
    tape rather than the time that the request is actually printed.  Note
    that there is no control on whether or not the request is ever
    completed.

host numbers 

    When a system is put on Decnet, NETGEN is run to set up a network node
    table that contains the host number.  The DN-200 Remote Station can
    then connect to different hosts with the SET HOST command.

    If the system is not on Decnet the host number is not stored.
    Obviously, on Tymnet there will have to be a means of storing the host
    number.  The system number could then appear on the banner, and also
    be used by a 1NOTIFY-like program.  Such a program will have to be
    developed, or some other procedure developed so that remote sites will
    know where print requests are waiting.

operations notification (like 1NOTIFY)   

    There is no operations notification program for remote sites.

delivery and billing for delivery    

    There is no way to attach delivery instructions to a print request,
    and no method of billing.  Mail messages or PLEASE messages can be
    sent to the operator.

queue vs. manual selection of printing     

    All printing is by queue, but the operator can change priority, hold
    printer requests, requeue, restart, stop and continue printer (among
    other options).  This provides adequate control over the printing.
    Printing will not begin if formsname does not match the line-printer
    parameter, and a message will be printed for the operator, saying that
    forms must be changed.

accounting for requests  

    USAGE file records are written on the completion of a requestese
    include time to process request for spooler runtime and core-time
    integral, disk reads and writes for spooler, number of pages of
    output, number of files*copies, forms type, priority, disposition, and
    output device.

    Extra charges for remote printing could be calculated from the output
    device.  There are no records kept of character counts.  Extra charges
    for special forms, multi-part paper, etc, could be calculated from the
    forms type.

statistics for accounting - report statistics feature      

    The only source for print statistics is the accounting records.  These
    contain information on number of pages, number of files*copies, forms
    type, job name, priority, disposition (REQUE, ABORT, NORMAL), and
    output device.

    There is no record kept of switches used, other than what is in
    accounting records.  There is no record kept of the file names (a
    potential security loophole), and no program to gather and report
    statistics.

status report for user - see next item   

log of requests for user, operations     

    User can specify the /NOTIFY switch to ask for notification when the
    job is completed.  An operator can use SHOW QUEUES PRINTER-JOBS for
    information on pending and in-process printer requests.  Users can use
    INFORMATION OUTPUT-REQUESTS for information as to the status of an
    incomplete job.

    ORION writes a log file of all OPR commands.  This is a chronological
    file which is usually kept for just a few days.  It does not contain
    dates.  For a print request it gives printer number, job name, request
    number, username, and begin and end times for the printing.

software maintenance tools  

    TOOLS has an EXEC-FOR-DEBUGGING-QUASAR; this is the only available

    Documentation for the user is in "TOPS-20 User Utilities Guide"; for
    an operator in "TOPS-20 Operator's Guide".

free form and canned functions    

    PLEASE is strictly free form; It has four commands:  SEND, MESSAGE,
    CANCEL and QUIT and two switches:  /NOWAIT and /MESSAGE.

    ARCHIVE, RETRIEVE and MOUNT are commands used to archive files,
    restore them, and do other tape commands.  Accounting for these
    requests is done by the system upon completion of the request by the
    operator.

    ARCHIVE "marks the file" (sets a bit in the FDB?) and the file cannot
    then be edited or deleted.  The file name remains on the user
    directory, but does not show up on a DIR command unless the /RETAIN
    switch was used for ARCHIVE, or the subcommands /INVISIBLE or /ARCHIVE
    are given to DIR.  The tape VOLID, tape saveset number, and tape file
    number are kept in the FDB (file description block).  MOUNT is used
    only if tape drive allocation is enabled; otherwise the user would
    ASSIGN the tape drive and then send a PLEASE message to the operator
    to mount the tape The operator does the same thing in either case, and
    the accounting is quite similar.  In the first case MOUNTR writes the
    accounting record, while the system does so in the second.  The user
    would normally use DUMPER to write the tape.

accounting mechanisms 

    Accounting records are kept for ARCHIVE, RETRIEVE, and MOUNT, (File
    Retrieval Entries 0016, 0015 and either 0011 or 0012); these contain
    all pertinent information.  There is no provision for billing or
    accounting records for PLEASE requests.

status reporting - hard copy forms for tracking?       

    PLEASE and MOUNT type messages on the operator console, and a record
    is kept in the ORION log file.  The message is in a block on the right
    side of the console.

    The only record of an answered message is in the log file.  Neither
    the message nor the log file contains any dates so searching for a
    specific message could be tedious and uncertain.

operations procedures 

    If there is an "operator in attendance", use of the PLEASE command
    without a switch will cause the PLEASE program to print "waiting for
    operator response" and wait without returning the user to TOPS-20
    command level.  If the operator does not see the message on the
    console, the user will wait until the operator does notice it.  Note
    that an operator can easily overlook the message.  If there is no
    designated operator console, i.e. no "operator in attendance", PLEASE
    informs the user and returns him to TOPS-20 command level immediately.

    QUASAR maintains a list of outstanding messages waiting for a reply
    which the operator can see with the SHOW MESSAGES command in OPR.
    Operators answer with the RESPOND command in OPR.  Each message is
    assigned a number that is used in the response.

    PLEASE messages can be sent to a node name by PLEASE node name::.  If
    there is an operator in attendance at the node specified, the message
    prints on that console.  Otherwise it is printed on the center
    console.

what kind of information do operators get on requests?          

    The request arrives free-form with the job number, username, terminal
    number, and the time the message was sent along with the message
    number for the response.

are there any "canned" routines?    

    The commands ARCHIVE and RETRIEVE mark files for automatic archiving
    and restoration.  When the file is archived using the SAVE/ARCHIVE
    command in DUMPER, the tape volids for each of the two archiving tapes
    are written into the file descriptor block for that file.  The file
    name remains on the user's directory, but does not show up in a DIR
    command unless the user has specified /RETAIN in the ARCHIVE command,
    or uses the subcommands ARCHIVE or INVISIBLE with the DIR command.

will it be easy to develop procedures for Operations?        

    The "TOPS-20 Operator's Guide" has routine procedures for DEC
    operators.  This material will need to be supplemented to reflect any
    changes or additions.
