This is a file of known SAIL manual defects (mainly typos)  that  are
not already noted in the preface or covered by the "incremental" SAIL
manual.  It is primarily an internal document for the  SAIL  hackers,
put  is  being  provided here as a stopgap measure pending a full new
edition for the manual.  This list is, however, not complete in  that
it does not include a number of typos that do not change the meaning.
If, however, you discover any defects in the manual or in the update,
please notify your friendly local SAIL representative.

99R     KVL     The synonym for "SUCH THAT" is "|" and not "'!"

32R     KVL     APPENDIX 5 has nothing to do with the
                bits for IO errors or mode enablings

43L     RHT     FILEINFO documentation is a lie.  You usually get:

                FILENAME
                EXT,,DATE
                prot(9)Mode(4)time(11)date(12)
                negative swapped word count (if did a lookup).
                0  (unless you opened device in magic mode)
                0

                The whole point is that what you get is the six words
                from the last lookup or enter.  For details see the
                monitor manual.

58R     JRL     if a designated bracketed triple is not found
                then bindit is returned and no error message is given

33L     JRL     release now takes a second defaultable value integer
                argument, the close inhibit bits (see RELEAS in UUO
                manual).  These are defaulted to zero when
                unspecified.

72R     KVL     TELLALL does not do an implicit RESCHEDULE as the
                description implies -- it just sets the status of
                the concerned processes to "ready".

102R    RFS     "33 through 36" S/B "33 through 35"

105R    RFS     ". her are several"    s/b " . There are several"

79R,L   KVL     JOBTPC should be loaded with the location of a CALL
                to a non-simple procedure.

92R     JRL     20F will in future surround macro expansions with
                "<>" not "'+',".

38R     RHT     The description of INCHWL is wrong.  Actually, the
                activation character is never included in the string
                and is always put into '9SKIP'9.  (<crlf> puts a <cr>
                into '9SKIP'9 & throws away the <lf>).

24L     RHT     The compiler will not in fact turn division by a
                power of two into an ASH.


37
90L     REG     "... See section 19 about these [compilation errors]"
                should be section 20.

90L     REG     19.1.3 "boundary" is misspelled.

41R     RHT     CVSIX left-justifies the sixbit value it builds.

43L     RHT     In POINT, it is "a PDP-10 byte pointer".

45R     RHT     FORC syntax should be "FORC <identifier> _ ... "

57R     RHT     " ... methods of searching the associative store ..."
                had "store" missing before.

105L    RHT     "omaname" should be "the symbolic name"

110L    RHT     added reference:
                Harvey, Brian  "Monitor Command Manual" SAILON 54.3
                (Dec 1973)
                Also, there is a more current SOS manual: SAILON 50.3

76L     RHT     Should be "REF'9ITEM(VALUE <expression>)"

43L     RFS     For FILEINFO, also should have a note to export users
                like "FILEINFO fills the array with the results of
                the last LOOKUP or ENTER (DEC 10-50 systems).
                Consult your local monitor manual for the format of
                these entries."

28L     JRL     CALLING PROCEDURES FROM INSIDE CODE BLOCKS
                "... procedure is typed, it will return is value in
                AC 1 (a pointer to the second word if the procedure
                is a string procedure)." should be " procedure is
                typed and not a string procedure it will return
                its value in AC 1. String procedures push the two
                word string descriptor corresponding to the result
                on the SP stack."

23L     RHT     The table of precedence for  '$ & '8 is misleading.
                '$ has higher precedence than '8.


26R     JRL     ARRYIN. No indication of how many words were actually
                read is given if EOF is encountered while reading a
                file in DUMP mode.

25L     RHT     The description of the MEMORY[x,<type>] construct is
                very misleading.  There is no restriction on the use
                of this construct as the left hand side of an
                assignment statement.  In fact, MEMORY[x,<type>] may
                be used anywhere a simple variable of type <type> may
                be used.

92R     JFR     The compiler is initialized with /7F.

99L     JFR     In Appendix 3, the entry "STRBRK" should be "STDBRK".
