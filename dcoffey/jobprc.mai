Subject: SUBMIT cannot "find" log file. 

I inserted MID930.LOG=MID930.CTL to have it run immediately.  While the
processor was running my job, I decided to insert it into the queue again,
this time with a date expression of "every day at 00:07".  Appearantly
SUBMIT attempts to create the LOG file just to see if you have license to
write in the specified directory.  This is good.  Unfortunately, SUBMIT does
not handle ENTER error code 3 properly.  It could not ENTER (JMS)MID930.LOG
because the file was being modifed.  The error message it reported back to
me was very misleading, it said "Cannot find log file MID930.LOG, enter name
of log file:".  What sort of potential security risk is it to assume that
error code 3 should be treated as no error at all.  Or to make the program
assume that the user is always allowed to write in his login directory.

Another comment:  While SUBMIT was prompting for a new log file name,
Control-C would not get me out.  Is there any way to cleanly abort in this
case when the user types ^C ?

Subject: Job Processor Sys's Documentation. 

Carl,

In my role as the virtual Bruce Ring, I need to know how the Job processor
handles certain situations:

1.)  User has set the LOGACTION parameter to the the Job Processor System (the
action to be taken with the log file text) to APPEND, and has set the DISPOSE
parameter to the the Job Processor System (the statement of specifications
determining the disposition of the log file) to DELETE.  What happens to the
pre-existing log file info when the job completes normally?  Does the system
delete the whole log file, including the pre-existing info, or does it delete
only the new info, for the current execution of the job?

2.)  Does LOGLIMIT apply to APPENDed log files in toto, or only to the
appended portion, or does it apply at all?

3.)  Does RESTART work?  How is a job restarted?  When is a job restarted?

4.)  Is any MAILER implemented?  Joe has found that a job he entered got hung
starting up the mailer, with no mailer started and therefore no execution of
the job.

5.)  Should unimplemented commands and parameters, like SPOOL, be left in the
"HELP" on-line documentation, or should the on-line documentation be made
unavailable for now?  The following are what I currently believe to be
unimplimented:
	Parameters:
		SPOOL
		UNIQUE
	
	Commands:
		CODE


Most of the rest of my questions are more appropriately directed at Helge,
since they pertain to his program.  I would like to meet with you to discuss
the meaning and naming of some of the commands, parameters, etc.

thx!
D.

Dennis,
  your mail message was too garbled to make any sense of...  I will be
glad to meet with you on Monday, assuming that I feel well enough to
stay the entire day. I am still not feeling well.  sigh...

  much of the intended set of features is somewhat implemented, but
everything is not...  MAIL is not implemented at all.  I actually
removed the mailer code... more on that later.   I think there are a
few misconceptions, and what might be best is for me to present an
overview of how everything works and fits together, including log
files and mail systems in two parts:  1) the intended version, 2) the
current implementation.

  When would be a good time on Monday?

The files are on (WRS:39).  I must emphasize that the file formats for
XEXEC.CTL are different than the previous version.  I suggest transmitting
an empty XEXEC.CTL file and then manually changing it on those systems
which should have something running (e.g. TUMS, FREE).  The documentation
is in the first page of the source.  Below is a session that'll help with
the transmittal.  -Bill

I understand that Carl doesn't want to deal with two kinds of mail, but
I still don't see the need to write a conversion program.  All he has to
do is always send TUMS mail.  Then when a user goes to read it with RPG,
using the MAIL command, it will first look for RPG mail, finding none it
will do a RUN UUO for (MAIL)RDMAIL which will read the mail from PERP.

Or, am I missing something?

Re: Modifications to the system

I made some minor changes to your PRPCHG.DOC file along with one
major revision.

*** MAJOR CHANGE ***
  :RESTART n                Not implemented.  Ignored.

This is now correct!  For the sake of conversion, it is ignored for
the moment.  Later, I may add it in when the Hold$Restart stuff is
working the way I'd like it to work.


XEXEC.RND/SUBMIT.DOC

The CCL option replaces the TMPName option completely.  The old CCL option
is redundant and setting the CCL name (or parameters) will flag the proper
start condition.  If the RUN option is set and parameters are given, the
CCL name will be setup automatically from the first 3 characters of the
command file name if a CCL option HAS NOT been issued previously.

The LOGOUT option has been added to allow a running job to log itself out
without first halting and waiting for the job processor to log it out.
(Waiting to be logged out hasn't really been tested fully, while programs
such as MAILER and ONTMTP log themselves out.  This bit must be set on
these programs, otherwise they will be marked Abort-Logout).

Abort-CCL has been removed.  Apparently Abort-CCL replaced Abort-Run in
an earlier version and Abort-Run was never re-implemented.  So, I have
renamed Abort-CCL to Abort-Run since that is the intent, and I have added
a new condition Abort-Logout which means the job went away without the
job processor's knowledge.  This is now an error.!

I will change the documentation to reflect these changes.

Effective in SUBMIT %1(162), XEXEC %1(173), EXECX %1(174).

Carl,

  If the queue file needs QM license, we're going to need to kill xexec on
some hosts, temporarily.  Since it and/or EXECX has the file open in update
mode, I can't give the file license while the system is running (as far as I
currently know).  All other files are now accurately installed, I believe.

I think every host except 23, 35, 62, 79, 95 & 930 is running the latest
edition.  All files are installed with (believed to be) proper protection and
license, except for (SYS) JQUEUE.SYS.  I was unable to install QM on this file
in the following hosts without (I believe) taking the Job Processor system
down, because XEXEC and/or EXECX had the queue file opened in update mode.
It's in your hands.  the hosts are:  28, 29, 38, 54, 58, 70, 72, 74 & 79.

I looked in some of the queues.  the only glaring discrepancy I found was the
lack of (PJ)PAM on host 35's queue.

I'll finish updating the .DOC files tomorrow.

G'nite. ...

     They are quite concerned about the immediate requirement to convert
     to the new "periodic processing" system.  This is understandable
     considering they had no advance notice to plan for conversion.
 
     Considering this message, I feel they must have more time than ori-
     ginally stated in the message.  I am aware, for technical reasons,
     this conversion must take place prior to year end.
 
     Please give either Greg Marus (x6961) or myself a call regarding this
     issue.
 
     Best regards. Ken

SUBJECT>   PERP job go away
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
=================== EMERGENCY========================================
 
Greg and Ken-san,
 
When I run PERP job ( -R PERP ) Today,
I found the following message.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
                       !!! ATTENTION !!!
 
Announcing a new, better system to run periodic and command file jobs!
 
The new TYMCOM-X job Processor System is replacing PERP, and PCOM and
COM. It has greater reliability, capabilities and efficiency.
 
Documentation is available in the following 2 files:
 
(*6news) SUBMIT.DOC  Reference manual. How to create and enter a
                     job with the SUBMIT command to the host.
(*6news) PRPCHG.DOC  How to convert PERP jobs to job Processor.
 
NOTE: PERP is going away !  Convert to the TYMCOM-X job Processor, now.
 
                                                                Page  2
 
November 20       The ability to run PERP on a TYMCOM-X host, to
                  submit new jobs or examine jobs, will go away.
 
December 1        PERP driver hosts are scheduled to go away.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is serious problem for our clients and us.
We did type out above documents soon and are begining to check
new functions.
But It takes two months to convert from PERP to new facility.
Because we and terminal supplier need to change the contents of 
catalogue file on user's inteligent terminals.
There are about 10 clients and 4 kind of terminals and several
locations ( main cities in japan ).
 
Then , please postpone to stop the current PERP, PCOM until
end of January, 87.
If this put into execution as per schedule,
The services for our clients will be stopped.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Best regards.
K.kamoi

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kamoi-san,
 
I spoke to Dennis Coffey of X support, and Ed Roop of Resources today
about the PERP replacement situation.
 
1. Dennis and Ed were able to give us an extension on the PERP
conversion. However, this extension will be only until December 12, PST,
at which time PERP goes away.
 
The physical removal of the 940s will occur December 15, and Ed says that
they need the window between the 12th and the 15th for an orderly transition
and shutdown.
 
Note that this is a hard drop-dead date, and is showing up on the
bannner messages on hosts 34 and 57.
 
2. Dennis Coffey said that there is a possiblity that for some of the
users, we could handle the conversion by changing the command files on the
PDP-X, while leaving the hard-coded files on the intelligent terminals
the same as they are now.
 
Dennis can give us some help and advice on this, but we need to see examples
                                                                Page  2

in order to find out if this is feasible or not.
 
So, I'm asking you to send to me and to Dennis:
 
        A. Examples of the files that are hard-coded on the intelligent
        terminals;
 
        B. Examples of the corresponding command files on the PDP-X.
 
3. It would also help Dennis if we could have a list of the usernames and
associated host numbers of the customers who user PERP (USERNAME:NN).
 
4. To the best of your knowledge, do you have any customers located outside
of Japan who are using PERP? Do any of them have commands hard-coded in
the terminals?
 
5. Since December 12 is a true drop-dead date,
I recommend that you make the PERP-to-SUBMIT migration the
number one priority at KTL over the next few weeks. We cannot give you
any hope that PERP will be around after December 12.
 
Regards, Greg

Subject: PRPRPL versions and installations 

Newest versions of XEXEC %1(174) and EXECX %1(200) have been distributed
to most systems, (but not all--due to hosts down).  I've installed them
on SYS on 22 but didn't start it since that system seems to be fine...
I've installed them on SYS on 34 and 54 and started them running.  They
appear to be working fine with the restarting scheme we discussed on
Friday.
It's running on 930 and 62 as well.  EXECX is started whenever necessary
and logs itself out after 15 minutes if there is no work to do.

Dennis & Osman, I'd appreciate it if you can make sure this version gets
installed everywhere.  XEXEC %1(174) has DDT loaded to trace the ill-mem-ref
bug (which hasn't occurred since we loaded DDT, sigh).

Dennis,
  Please verify that all three files in SUBMIT have the correct versions
while you are performing installations.  Don't bother to put up the new
EXECX until you have put up the new XEXEC 1%(174).  Also, feel free to
install the files on sys everywhere, but don't bother to kill XEXEC and
restart it on those systems running fine.

Hint:  To find out what version XEXEC is running...
 1) Look at the file (CARL)JQUEUE.LOG to find the last restart message.
     or
 2) SYSTAT <XEXEC>
    R FRMDDT         (or DO FRMDDT, it maybe in MPL)
    job$U            (where job is the jobnumber and $ is escape)

Note:  This is where the previous message came from.

XEXEC %1(176) sends messages like this.  It is not
working completely, as---some of the data is wrong
and I knowest not why.... but it's MAIL.

Please install XEXEC.SAV on all systems... an MHX job
which does:   PJ<ret> OPER$<password><ret> GET(SUBMIT)XEXEC <ret>  SAVE(SYS)XEXEC
is good enough... don't worry about restarting them.... that is part 2.

If you use MHX to your advantage, it can save a lot of time.

PS:  Over thepast 3 days, I'v had TYMNET double echoing... all over the
place, so as I do not know what I'm typing sometimes... am I the only one
who is having these problems? or is it really a TYMNET problem.

SUBJECT>   Job Processor SUBMIT


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm testing the new system SUBMIT and I have some question on it.

1. Is SUBMIT system (Job Processor) available for all day ?
   It did not work on host D34 yesterday. And it did not
   work on host D37 today.
   My job is keeping on Queved-Wait status.

2. I could not received MAIL by MAIL/OPNOTICE command
   though I got message "Mail from TYMCOM-X Job Processor Mailer".
   And it is the same result on both mode XEXEC and XEXECJ.

3. In INSERT command mode, ESC does not work. Job was inserted.

4. I don't understand it clearly. For example, my command file
   contains as follows:
       .MAGNUM
       .WARNINGS OFF    <-------
       TIME
       QUIT
       .SPOOL
       .SPOOL          <--------
       N
       *GASSAN
         :
         :
         :

                                                                Page  2

   Job Processor will force to back to XEXEC mode from MAGNUM or
   SPOOL system and continues the next command line.
   According to the manual, Period prefix character "may be Job
   Processor command or monitor commands. .... (page 3)".
   This means that MAGNUM or SPOOL is user's program for Job
   Processor and Job was interrupted. Is it correct ? If so,
   what is monitor level ? Only XEXEC/XEXECJ/PDP10 mode ?

I'm look forward to hearing from you soon.
We have no time!

Thanks and best regards,
Tak Yasuma

I telecopied the new versin of XEXEC to 35,54,28 & 55,56,58 from 62.
I then copied from 35 to 22,26,29,55  and from 54 to 23,25,27,31,34,57,65
and from 28 to 30,33,38,70,72,74,79

so, the system should be ready to re-install.  MAILER is also fixed on
all systems. (If not, WRS will let us know).  I tested using the bit to
setup he new XEXEC and it works ok.

I generated a new QUEDDT and copied it everywhere with XEXEC 1(200).

New commands...

   RUN QUEDDT
   HELP$G  gives a help message
   INSTALL$G  will set the feature bit to restart XEXEC automatically


so,  simply copy the files to SYS wioth GET/SAVE  and then run QUEDDT
and say INSTALL$G  followed by $G  (where $ is escape)... and unless
XEXEC has died in TI/TO or ^C state, it will restart without human
intervention.

  Fast.... neat... etc.  <pat pat>

Dennis,
I just uncovered a nasty feature of the Job processor: there is a 
conflict with the :GOTO command and the system command GO.  The minimum
abbreviation of GOTO cuses the GO operand to be taken incorrectly as a 
lable.  For ex I had a job with the line:
.GO ONTSLV
the job aborted since it could not find label ::ONTSLV.  
I have changed the job to 
.GO(ENSS)ONTSLV
to see if that will parse better.  In any case it will be preferable
if the :GOTO command had a minimum abbreviation of :GOT so there won't
be any conflicts.

Yasuma-san,
 
Dennis Coffey had been out of the office on Wednesday, and just got
to your Ontyme A80680 on Monday, Dec. 1. We talked about it on the phone, and we
have the answers to some of your questions:
 
1. Ref A80680, Items 1. and 2.: several other users had reported
problems with not getting to SUBMIT at certain times of the day,
and with receiving MAIL. Both these problems are being worked on, and
you should see them fixed very soon. The Tymcom-X Support Group (TXS)
thanks you for bringing the problem to their attention; you should continue
to report any problems that you find.
 
2. Ref A80680, Item 3.: you were the first one to notice the problem
with ESC. Again, thanks for bringing it to our attention; this problem
is also being worked on.
 
3. Ref A80680, item 4: your understanding of "monitor level" is correct--
it does mean only XEXEC/XEXECJ/PDP10 mode.
 
When the job processor sees a period prefix, it first tries to interpret the
command as a command for the job processor itself. If it cannot interpret it
                                                                Page  2

as a job processor command, it issues an ESC (for XEXEC) or a control-c
(for PDP10), and then passes the argument. The ESC or control-c insures that
the command goes to the monitor level.
 
As a result, we think that your command line .WARNINGS OFF will not
work, as it is a MAGNUM command, but will be sent to the XEXEC level,
where it is not valid.
 
4. Ref my J18571, item 3: Dennis looked at this, and agreed that this
is a good way to report the problems to us. (Let us know the
command file name, whether or not we can actually use it, username and
password, etc.) This would save us a lot of time if you run into more
complicated problems during your conversion.
 
5. Dennis also mentioned something that may be helpful to you in your
conversion: PCOM is not going away. PERP will go away December 12, but
it looks as though PCOM will stay indefinitely. I hope this is some help
to you.

Your test of the Job Processor System was performed properly, and was a well
constructed test.  Thank you for telling us about the unexpected results you
experienced.

The reason for your result is the following:  the SUBMIT program inserts a job
into the Job Processor's queue for execution without testing to be certain
that the 'BEFORE <date time expression>' is satisified.  This expression is
tested when the job is requeued, after each execution of the job by the Job
Processor system.

For this reason, the following 'DATES' expression would cause the job to
excute once, even though the 'BEFORE' expression would never be true:
		(job entered at 12:00 noon)
	SUBMIT> DATES EVERY HOUR BEFORE TODAY 8:00 <cr>

The execution of your job at 6:23, rather than at 1:00, was because the Job
Processor system was not running until 6:23.  Your job was run 55 seconds
after the Job Processor was restarted, with a newer version of the program.
This happened because the Job Processor system is being modified and
developed, and was down for a while.  This delay will not happen in the
future.

Regards,
Dennis Coffey

Dave,

  We will not change the minimum abbreviation for :GOTO to :GOT, because many
of the PERP files use :GO, and we wish to allow as much compatibility with
PERP as possible.  I can see how use of the old 940 syntax of "GO <program>"
could cause confusion.  The period-prefix commands are Job Processor
precedent.  These commands are presented to the Job Processor, and then to the
monitor only if the Job Processor can't use it.

  I'd like to offer a suggestion:  instead of using the old 940 syntax, use
Tymcom-X/DEC syntax:  "RUN <program>".  This will eliminate confusion to the
Job Processor.

Dennis

Thanks for your answer.

Almost all of our TYMCOM-X users are using PERP system now
because they want to run their job during a non-prime time period.
So, I tryed to test the job with BEFORE expression while Job
Processor was down. (Please see OnTyme A82671)

Japanese TRU rates are divided into 3 by time period as follows:

       Period                     TRU RATE
    --------------------         ------------
     7:00 am -  7:00 pm           50 yen/TRU
     7:00 pm - 10:00 pm           30 yen/TRU
    10:00 pm -  7:00 am           20 yen/TRU

For example, the following DATES expression might cause the job
to execute after next 7:00 am. rather than 11:00 pm. if
the system was down for a while or the Job Processor
system was down.

SUBMIT> DATES TODAY 23 BEFORE TOMORROW 6

We hope this job will not be executed after next 6:00 am.
even though it was inserted into queue.

Could you tell me how to solve this problem if you can?
Or we have to check start time in job be executed???
                                                                Page  2

Re: BEFORE problem...

I understand the problem a little better now... they want to be
assured that the job will not run during prime time.

My suggestion is that they write a little program to check for prime
and if it is past the deadline for prime time, that they logout to
abort their job.  This is a solution for now... later on, when the
job processor is more stable they should not have a problem... I still
suggest that if they do not want to run during prime time... they do
the checking.

Please wait till we discuss this in prson before answering their mail.
I'm being a little abrupt and unclear and I want to discuss it in a more
reasonable fashion, also maybe get greg marus in on the discussion after
you and i have talked.

Dave,

   The string CAT problem is one we know of.  We have been working on
reliability problems, as higher priority.  We will be fixing it soon.

   When the error shows up you are put into the SAIL run-time library with the
cursor immediately following a carat prompt, on a line after the error
message.  Respond to this with a "C" (just the letter C), for continue, and
the STATUS display will continue.  The error only affects the display of
statuses to your terminal, everything the Job Processor system deals with is
fine.

   It may seem like a nasty bug, but its looks are much worse than its bite.

Re: new feature

EXECX %1(203) and later, !!Not released yet!! now has the following new
commands.

    :SILENCE       same as :DEFINE $LOGGING=0
                   if a log file is enabled, this silences output to
                   the log file until a :DEFINE $LOGGING=1 or :REVIVE
                   command is seen.
    :REVIVE        same as :DEFINE $LOGGING=1
                   if a log file is enabled (not LOG:NONE) then resume
                   sending output to the specified log file.

    :ERROR <ch>    specifies the character in column 1 which causes an
                   error to be assumed, thus stopping the job or (when
                   :IF is implemented) can be tested.  Can be read or
                   displayed via the $Error keyword.

    :NOERROR       clears the :ERROR character, declaring that all such
                   program related errors which print "?msg" etc, will
                   not cause the job to abort.

Note:  These commands are intended to work as the TOPS-10 equivalents and
       reasonable documentation can be found there for full explanations.


Dennis,  THIS IS NOT RELEASED -- DO NOT INCLUDE THIS IN YOUR DOC FILES --
Joe,     YOU ASKED FOR IT... YOU GOT IT!  (:SILENCE & :REVIVE)

PS:  What do you think about :WARN %   (joe?)
PPS:  I forgot to say, :ERROR<cr> resets the error character to "?" and
      the character must be a printable character.  (Space is illegal).

There is a feature in TOPS-10 MIC that allows you to disable special
treatment of charactes in column 1 of the control file.  Such a feature
would be nice in EXECX that tells it to ignore ".", "*", and "=" in
column 1 (but still look for ":").  By adding a single line at the top
of a file, old CTL files could then run with the new system.

What shall we name this command?  How about ":NOMONITOR" to disable and
":MONITOR" to enable it.    /Joe

Subject: Priorities of parameter assignments. 

I don't like the current implementation.  It is not intuitive.  One macro
preprocessor does the following:

1) When the macro is expanded, the names of the parameters are read from
   the first line of the macro definition and assigned default values.
2) Positional parameters are read from the line that invoked the macro, matched
   up with the defined parameters.  Non-null positional parameters override the
   default values.  Excess positional parameters are thrown away.
3) Keyword parameters (if any) are read from the line that invoked the macro.
   Their values override the current definitions, even if the new value is
   null.  Any keyword name that does not match a defined name is ignored.
4) New values can be assigned to the parameters inside the macro.  The most
   recent definition overrides any previous definition.
5) New parameters can be declared and assigned values in the macro.

Note that the above scheme clearly defines what happens, in chronological
order.  There are no real priorities, it's just that the latest definition
overrides any previous definition.

XEXEC could do this if it put off processing the parameters option until
after it read the :PARAMETERS line.  Wait until after the defaults have been
assigned before checking for positional and assigned parameters.

				/Joe

P.S.  Dennis mentioned new nomenclature; "assigned" parameters are the ones
      with "name=value", keywords are "$TRUE", "$DAYTIME", etc.  I agree.

The current implementation is NOT that much different than what you have
described above.  I will try to put together a similar (as "intuitive")
description which makes more sense than the previous explanations.

I will also put together a description of how the implementation works
step by step.  One thing not mentioned in the the documentation is that
you may have multiple :PARAMETERS statements (and they "add" by simply
continuing the previous statement(s).
    :PARAMETERS A,B,C          is the same as
                                 :PARAMETERS A

  eg.  MURADMIN entered DELETE<cr>  and it wiped out a bunch of stuff...
       I found that a specified request number setup the QM/AS/any user

       perform various things on anyone's jobs at the moment!!!!!!!!!!!

Carl,

  One of the bigger users of PERP, and now XEXEC, has a job which would well
qualify as a RUN-type job, except a very important parameter is passed to the
program in the Project Code field.  Can this be done for a RUN job under
XEXEC, the way it now exists?

  He would benefit greatly from being able to use NO HALT, so the Project Code
is needed.

  All this is an attempt to make the job reliably run continuously.  If there
are any angles I've missed in this effort, please let me know.

Dennis,
  SUBMIT %1*203* lloks ok, please try a few tests to see if it works.

  I did see that it has a bug in the LIST code which prints all requests
  up to a cancelled request, doesn't print the cancelled one, and doesn't
  print anymore eitehre.... I will fix that later tonight.  If you want to
distribute %1(203) to KTL hosts now, and after I fix the otehr bug we can
transmit it to all hosts... sound good?

Send me mail on what you do... /Carl

Dennis,
  SUBMIT version %1(204) is ready for you to check, then distribute.  I
will transmit it to, :54, :~r74 and :55 each in dallas fremont and cupc.
I will leave it up to you to check and retransmit to the other systems.
(I am putting it into submit only... not in SYS).

Carl,

It has another bug:  a job cannot be inserted with no log file.  A SHOW on
such a job has a log file listed, as:  "(<username>)*".  This occurs when the
job is entered with an asterisk in the logfile parameter of the command line,
or with a carriage-return response to the LOGFILE: prompt.  Of course, this
may already be in 1(200).  I didn't try it there.  I'll do that now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Nakano-san,
 
I just spoke again to Dennis Coffey, and he gave me some more information
about the way that the time limits in SUBMIT work. Please pass this
information to anyone at NIS who would be interested:
 
1. There are two ways that you can set a time limit when you use SUBMIT.
One way is the way that you are using, by giving a :TIME command in the
first line of the command file.
 
2. You can also answer the OPTION> prompt when you SUBMIT the job, as follows:
 
OPTION>TIMELIMIT 180
 
3. When you ran your test, it looks like you did not give the TIMELIMIT
OPTION. That is why your MAIL says "; Limits:   Time 60". 60 minutes is
the default limit, and the MAIL system gets its information from SUBMIT,
not from the command file..
 
4. Dennis Coffey strongly recommends that you use the OPTION>TIMELIMIT 180,
rather than the :TIME 180 method for setting the time limit.
 
The reason is this: SUBMIT checks with the program that is used to schedule
maintenance and to bring down the host. Let's say that you use the
OPTION>TIMELIMIT 180, and ask for the job to start at 2000. Let's say that
the host is scheduled to be brought down at 2130, which is 90 minutes
                                                                Page  2

after the job is scheduled to start. SUBMIT will not start that job,
because it knows there is a chance that the host will go down before the
job can complete.
 
On the other hand, if you use :TIME 180 in the command file, the job will
start, even though the host could go down soon. That's because if the
time limit is in the command file, SUBMIT does not know the limit until
after it starts the job and reads the commands.
 
5. You can get information on running time with the following command, which
you can insert at many places in the command file:
 
 :REMARK \$TIMELIMIT\
 
Dennis says that wherever you have this command, the log file will show the
number of minutes remaining, from your timelimit. For example, if you set
OPTION>TIMELIMIT 180, and the job takes ten minutes to get to the first
 :REMARK \$TIMELIMIT\ in the command file, then the log file will show
170 at that point (180-10=170).
 
Regards, Greg

Thanks for your quick answer.

1. We know the current version of SUBMIT does not support control-D.
   So when we converted to SUBMIT, in the section of the SPOOL job
   where we have the control-D substituted a regular carriage return
   as follows:

      ADDITIONAL DELIVERY INST. TO CONT-D: <cr>
                                           ----

   The problem happened where we have to enter the file names such as
   follows:

      ENTER FILES:
      m07.lst,m08.lst, .......... ,m16.lst,dummy.lst<cr>
      --------------------------------------------------

   I entered 88 characters / line.
   I had no problem when I entered fewer characters than 80 / line
   and we did not have such a problem as long as we were using the PERP.

2. We don't need the advance release of the new version on D34.

3. I understood some differences between TIMELIMIT option and ':TIME'
   command. we follow Dennis Coffey's recommendation and will use
   TIMELIMIT option rather than ':TIME' command.
                                                                Page  2


4. I found out a new problem about SUBMIT such as follows:

   SYSTEM NUMBER: D34

   COMMAND FILE:

      MAGNUM
      Q

   ENTERING THE JOB INTO THE QUEUE

      -SUBMIT<cr>
       ----------
      TYMCOM-X Job Processor %1(204) dd-mm-yy hh:mm:ss
      SUBMIT> DATE TODAY AT 23<cr>
              --------------------
      SUBMIT> LIST<cr>
              --------
      %No requests processed.
      SUBMIT> INSERT TEST1.CMD TEST1.LOG<cr>
              -------------------------------
      OPTIONS[Insert]: <cr>
                       ----
      Job 'TEST1' Inserted. Req # nnn
      SUBMIT> LIST<cr>
              --------
      %No requests processed.
      SUBMIT> QUIT<cr>
              --------

   Could you tell me why Job 'TEST1' was not inserted into the queue
   when I entered LIST command between DATE command and INSERT command?
   Where this job 'TEST1' gone away!

Thanks and regards,
Hideo Nakano

Subject: Significant change to EXEC commands 

Due to the overwhelming cry for monitor commands that do not
conflict with job processor EXEC commands the following is
now true in EXECX %1(216) and later:

:command   is ALWAYS a command to the job processor
.command   is ALWAYS a command to the operating system
*line      is unchanged (program data)
=line      is unchanged (program data)~r

For TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 command files, a pseudo mode is used to
designate commands which works like the old EXECX, with the one
difference that in TOPS10 mode, "." is the command prefix char
and in TOPS20 mode, "@" is the command prefix characer.  In both
of these modes, :command is illegal and ::label does not work!

in %1(217) and later, the pre-declared keyword $Format contains
the string "TYMCOMX", "TOPS10" or "TOPS20" and may be set by the
user.  in some future version of SUBMIT the FORMAT option will
allow users to submit jobs in each of the available formats.

/Carl                The documentation should be updated and shipped
                     at the same time %1(216) or later is distributed.

Nakano-san,
 
Thanks for your execellent report on the problem with SUBMIT. I
spoke to Dennis Coffey and found out what is happening:
 
1. The current version of SUBMIT does not support control-d.
I believe that you are timing out in the line in your SPOOL job that
is normally ended with a control-d. SUBMIT is getting stuck at that
point.
 
2. Dennis says that there will be a new version of SUBMIT released later
this week. If you have a customer emergency, we can probably release the
new version on D34 earlier, if you need us to do this. The new version will
support control-d.
 
The documentation for the new version is expect to be ready by 1/8 PST
(= 1/9 JST). There are some differences between the way the new version
behaves, and the documentation for the version you are using now.
 
3. There is a code-around that will work in both versions:
 
A. In the section of the SPOOL job where you have the control-d, substitute
a regular carriage return.
 
B. In the next line, use the command:
 
                                                                Page  2

 :SEND CHAR 4
 
This will have the same effect as control-d.
 
4. Let us know if you need the advance release of the new version on D34.
 
Regards, Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Nakano-san,
 
I just spoke to Dennis Coffey, and Dennis has let me know the answers to
some of your questions:
 
1. Ref. M55435, item 1:
 
Thanks for clarifying this point for us. Dennis has done some tests, and
confirmed that the problem is with line length, not with control-d. Dennis
has identified this as a monitor problem, and it will be fixed eventually.
 
However, right now there are other monitor projects that have a higher priority,
so we cannot give you a date that this will be fixed. In the meantime, we
suggest you use one or the other of the following code-arounds:
 
A. Put the list of filenames into a file, with @ as the first character of
the filename (for example, (@FILE1). Then give this file name in response to
the prompt:
 
ENTER FILES:
@FILE1
 
B. Since the SPOOL parser ignores carriage returns, you can simply break
the file list into two or more lines, and then eventually force acceptance
with the :SEND CHAR 4, as follows:
 
                                                                Page  2

ENTER FILES
 mo7.lst,mo8.lst,(c/r)
 m16.lst,dummy.lst(c/r)
 :SEND CHAR 4
 
2. Ref M55435, item 4, TEST1 job vanished:
 
Dennis gave me the following explanation: the LIST command has the effect
of reading and erasing any DATE that you have set. If you need information
on the status of the existing job queue, Dennis says the old PERP commands
DISPLAY, EXPRESS, and TEST will also work in SUBMIT. DISPLAY, EXPRESS, and
TEST will give you the information, but they will not change the DATE
status.
 
With that in mind, let's look at what happened during your test:
 
SUBMIT> DATE TODAY AT 23(cr)  (at this point you've set the date and time for
                              the next job you will put in the queue.)
 
SUBMIT> LIST (cr)        (at this point LIST has read and deleted the DATE
                          you just entered.)
 
SUBMIT> INSERT TEST1.CMD TEST1.LOG(cr)
 
OPTIONS[insert]:(cr)
 
Job 'TEST1' Inserted. Req # nnn
                         (at this point, SUBMIT puts the TEST1 job into the
                         queue. However, it now has no DATE specified, so it
                         defaults, and starts running TEST1 immediately.)
 
SUBMIT> LIST (cr)       (At this point TEST1 has already started to run, so it
                        is no longer in the queue. That's why SUBMIT then says:)
 
%No requests processed.
 
This is the explanation that Dennis gave to me. A way to check this would be
to look for the TEST1.LOG file. If we're correct about the way this works,
the TEST1.LOG should be out there, with a creation date and time the same as
the date and time that you typed in the INSERT. Did this happen with your test?
 
Hope this is of some help to you; let us know if you have any more questions.
Thanks and regards, Greg

Thanks for your excellent answer.

I could simply break the file list into two lines, as follows:

ENTER FILES:
m07.lst,m08.lst,<cr>         {*1}
m16.lst,dummy.lst<cr>

{*1} when we put a comma "," in front of carrige-return,
     SPOOL accepts the comma as a continuation character.
     So, I didnot use :SEND CHARACTER command.

     I tried to test this way and I had no problem.

Thanks and regards,
Hideo Nakano

  I am pleased that you have success with SPOOL.  The ability of a comma to
function as a line continuation character, when placed before the carriage

Subject: KTL's SUBMIT Problem: long line. 

Greg,
  You may want to clarify or correct the information that you sent to
KTL about the work-around for their line which was too long.  The following
paragraph numbers refer to the paragraphs in your Ontyme to KTL (J30467).

Re.  1. A.:
    We do not allow filenames which include an at-sign "@" as any part
    of the name.  The SPOOL program accepts @FILE1 to mean read the
    contents of the file "FILE1" as though it was entered at the terminal.
    Thus, they may put their list of filenames in FILE1 and respond to
    the spool prompt as follows:

    ENTER FILES:
    @FILE1<cr>
    ----------

Re:  1. B.:
    There was some confusion about the SPOOL parser.  It does NOT ignore
    carriage-return characters when it is accepting file names.  SPOOL
    terminates it's scan for file names when it sees the first <cr>.

    In interactive mode, SPOOL accepts the character (^J) control-J or
    line-feed as a continuation character.  This is NOT the same as the
    new-line key on some keyboards.  It is the 2nd character of the
    sequence <cr><lf> which the monitor reads whenever a <cr> is entered
    by the user.  The only way the Job Processor can pass the <lf> character
    alone through the EXEC to the SPOOL program is to use the following
    awkward construct in the command file:

    =FILE1,FILE2,FILE3,...,FILEn<cr>
    :SEND CHARACTER 12<cr>
    =FILEo,FILEp,FILEq,...,FILEw<cr>
    :SEND CHARACTER 12<cr>
    *FILEx,FILEy,FILEz<cr>

    Note:
    This example uses the "prefix-character" feature of EXEC which says
    an equal-sign ("=") in column 1 means "SUPPRESS SENDING <cr> AT END
    OF LINE" so that a line-feed (octal 12) character immediately
    follows both filenames given "FILEn" and "FILEw" but not "FILEz".
    The asterisk in column 1 means this is data to a program, send the
    carriage-return normally.

Please contact Dennis Coffey if you need more assistance with this
problem.  Thank you for your patience and your help in pointing out any
problems you have found in the Job Processor system.

The new RDMAIL is now on all systems.  I've checked them all by hand and
found a number of them screwed up - just goes to show that if you want it
done right, do it yourself.  Anyway, all systems now have the current
version of everything.

About MAILER being deleted from the queue.  Is there any condition that
would cause it to be deleted automatically?  If so, there clearly needs
to be a way to override that.

Subject: SUBMIT/XEXEC 

I'm putting the most current versions of XEXEC, EXECX and SUBMIT on SYS 
on all three of our machines (930, 62 and 95).  I believe that some of the
problems occurring with XEXEC et al are things which were "fixed" in one
of the latest versions.

Re: SUBMIT %1(205) supersedes SUBMIT %1(204)
Changes are to default the username field when a non-privileged user asks
for all jobs for his username or all jobs of name 'x' for his username,
and fix the bug where SUBMIT looped forever on deleted records until they
went away (and they didn't if XEXEC wasn't running).

Re: EXECX %1(222) supersedes EXECX %1(220)
Changes were to use the right default username when none was specified on
the :COM filename  command line.  Previously it was using the logged in job's
username (and the logged in job was EXECX running under OPER) and thus the
:COM command appeared not to work (unless you were OPER).

Dennis,
  Please review the "bugs" you asked me about concerning these areas and
check that the documentation conforms to the current behavior.  Let me know
if we need to make any additional changes to the wildcard/verify code.

Also not mentioned properly above... in EXECX, :TIME is now short for the
new :TIMELIMIT command and :TRULIMIT has been added.  In SUBMIT, "Y" now
works for "YES" in response to the verify prompt.  It was checking for the
entire word.

Subject: Running SUBMIT on the 2020s. 

P034/P-10 is the latest monitor supported on the KS machines.  SUBMIT will
not run on the P034/P monitor.  SUBMIT requires P034/P37 or P035/B.
P035/B cannot be supported on the 2020 until KSFEFS is modified to put
BOOTS in the right place on disk.

There are no software conflicts between P034/N and P034/P, which means that
S59, S60, S92, S264, S301, and Mallenkrodt's M169 can be upgraded with no
problems.  S443 is running P034/K which may be a hassle.  Upgrading W1051
will take as much effort as upgrading TRW from P034/J to P034/P.

I would like to see all of the 2020 systems upgraded to P034/P or better
by the end of June 1987.

We've been having problems with Submit that you may be able to shed some 
light on.  For starters, runniong jobs on system 26 during the day seems flaky.
Jobs run fine at night but after about 8 am they will be queued but the times will
be hours ago, i.e. they are not getting executed on time or even close to it.
Then when they do get executed, the log files are empty except for 
Req #xx completed message.  It should
have the results of the command file execution.  None of the commands get
executed but the job does not get aborted with any error.
 
The second problem we are having is with Abort-License errors.  I have 
determined that if you modify any job that has license set then that job
will abort-license the next time it is run.  However we have had jobs
abort that were not modified in any way.  for example, one job ran all night
without error then had an abort-license in the morning.  These jobs
are building aux circuits so at the minimum I'm setting AC license.
 
On the plus side, I've had backup jobs in the queue for months and have never had
problems with them executing so its strange when I do have problems.
 
By the way, you might pass on a request for enhancement of submit:  It would
be extremely useful to add a weekday parameter for the date request.  
PERP used to have it.  If you want to run something several times a day
but not on weekends (which we often do) then it is very difficult (if 
not impossible) to get the date request setup properly.  It would be so 
nice to be able to say: 
date weekdays at 10 and weekdays at 12
for example.

An interesting anamoly I discovered regarding the jobs that were
run by submit but had empty log files.  I had called the command file 
'lstat.sw'.  Changing it to 'lstat.sub', making the extension 3 char 
instead of 2 makes it run ok.  Another bug I would say.

Dave,
  1.)  The day vs. night execution dependability will require some further
investigation.  It MAY be due to an excessive number of jobs being in the
host's Job Processor's queue for executio9n at the same time.  I'll check.
  2.)  The way the date and time expressions are parsed makes a 'weekdays'
expression impossible without re-writing all the date/time code.  So sorry,
but we just can't do it---we don't have the staff to commit to it.
  3.)  the 2 character vs. 3 character command file extension specificity is
a 'feature' we did not know about.  Thanks much for letting us know.  We'll
look at making it more flexible.
