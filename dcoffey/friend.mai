Subject: Directions to here from Cupertino. 

    from Cupertino, take I-280 South.

    At the big freeway interchange in San Jose, take I-680 'North'.

    In Fremont, exit at the WASHINGTON BLVD.  exit.  Turn right from the exit
ramp onto Washington Blvd.
(Effectively make a left from original direction of travel).

    From Washington Blvd., turn right onto DRISCOLL BLVD.  
(It is the first electric signal, just before the railroad crossing).

    From Driscoll Blvd. turn left onto PASEO PADRE PARKWAY.  
(It is the first electric signal).

    From Paseo Padre Parkway turn left onto WALNUT AVE.  
(It is the second electric signal; it's in the more "downtown" type area,
after the residential area).

    From Walnut, turn right onto LIBERTY ST.  
(It is the first electric signal).

    Our building (39100 LIBERTY St.)  is on LIBERTY, on your right.  
(It is just before the end of the block you are in, just after the two-story,
glass and redwood-veneer building on your right.)

    Our driveway is just BEFORE our building.  Our building entrance faces
Liberty.  You should be able to park in a "Visitor" parking spot in front,
near the entrance.  If none there, park anywhere.

    Ask the receptionist for me.

Subject: Porting programs between CPM and MSDOS. 

There are 3 programs you should know about.
1) DOSFLX - Runs under CP/M, can read and write MS-DOS format floppies.  It
   fully understands MS-DOS subdirectories, and does READ, WRITE, TYPE, and
   DIR of the MS-DOS disk.

2) RDCPM - Runs under MS-DOS, can read and do directories of CP/M floppies.
   Note: It does not write CP/M floppies.

3) AME86 - Applications Migration Executive - Allows well behaved CP/M
   programs to run under MS-DOS.  Originally designed to allow programs,
   tools, and compilers to run on an MS-DOS system after the appropriate
   files have been transferred to the MS-DOS disk.

I should have AME86 on one of my floppies, if not, I know where to get it.

Subject: "C" Compiler. 

O.,

	I have re-copied both compilers, using new disks and Johnny Duckett's
PC.  This time they both work.  However, the 'apprentice'-C still goes into
their VED editor when it find a syntax error, and the VED editor does not work
on a Rainbow.

	I have ordered an upgrade from 'apprentice' to 'Prime', since the
'Prime' version does work on a Rainbow---it gives an error message without
putting you into their editor.  In the interim you can have a copy of the
'Prime' compiler, since one of the two compilers we have is the 'Prime'
version).  The two are very similar.  Below are the only differences I know
of.

	The 'Prime' version can handle bigger programs than the 'apprentice'
version because:  it initially compiles to assembly language and is then
assembled; it has utilities in seperate, smaller library files, while the
'apprentice' has them all in one file; it has a linker to call in only what is
needed of the relocatable object files.  The 'Prime' version can link together
several modules (files).  The documentation for the 'Prime' version is only 60
pages in addition to the 'apprentice' documentation.

	Compiling and running a program on the 'apprentice' is done with the
following commands:

	AC <program>		; Where source name is "<program>.C".
				:   Compiles and creates executable object
				;   code, filename "<program>.COM".
	<program>		; Runs program, object file <program>.COM.

There is no reason or chance to link anything in.  Everything available is in
the Run-Time Library (file AC.RTL) which is called every time.

	Running the 'Prime' version is a little different.  Basically, you
compile and assemble, link, and then run.  The commands are:

	CC <program>		; Where source name is "<program>.C".  This
				;   command both compiles and assembles.
	LN <program>.O C.LIB	; Link the relocatable object (<program>.O) in
				;   with any modules and the basic C library
				;   and (optionally)  any other libraries
				;   named, like M.LIB.
	<program>		; Object file name is "<program>.EXE".  This
				:   command runs the program.

	This should be enough information to do homework for now.  I'll make a
copy of my C "Prime' Rainbow disk tonight---I can't find any disks today.

Subject: Can't login over shut to Fayez. 

After asking Fayez-Sarofim to bring up the system using KMCMAN, I was unable
to login.  I received the following:
        please log in: jms:370;
        shut ^G
        host shut
        please log in:
They must be running a version of LOGINN that does not allow login over shut.

This is the procedure they use to bring up the system normally:
        ^\                      Control-backslash
        KS10>ZM                 Zero memory
        KS10>BT                 Get BOOTS
        BOOTS:/S4               Set sense-switch 4
        BOOTS:CONSOL            Load SYS:CONSOL.SAV
        >CONS                   Go into CONSOLE mode
        please log in: ^Z L OPER
        .O GOD                  Get all license
        !R NODLOD               Reload the KMC
        !R RELOAD               This zeros sense-switch 4 and loads SYSTEM.SAV
        BOOTS:(SYS)SYSTEM.SAV   This is automatic as a result of RELOAD.SAV
        DSKCLN runs

At one time, the only way you could run NODLOD on a 2020 was by running a
special monitor (SYS)CONSOL.SAV that had the CIOPR uuo implemented.  I don't
know if KMCLOD.SAV will run on H370-P034/J-5.  The version of INITIA they have
does not attempt to run KMCLOD.  Note that if the operator is unable to set
license, then he can't run NODLOD or RELOAD, therefor DSKCLN does not get run.

The problem started when the disk got clobbered, and the operator restored all
files from a backup tape after using "O GOD" instead of REFLAG.  They are
restoring all files now.                /Joe

Subject: SUBMIT & Windows. 

Carl,

    I've found a bug in SUBMIT:  when I entered "14th day every 12 months", it
gave me  "14TH DAY EVERY 9 MONTH".  I may not have its wording quite right,
but I am certain that it somehow translated "every 12 months" into "EVERY 9
MONTHS".  Not what we want.


    I've talked with Craig about moving our offices.  He supports the idea!
He even spent some time with us mentally laying out the new configuaration:
pacing off the distances & planning what we need and where we'll get it.  He
was almost as excited as we are!  He seems to really like the idea!  

    He said that to accomplish the goal we need a drawing for Yasou, with
sufficient accuracy, scale and detail that Yasou can do the erection of the
panels while we're not here -- maybe even while we're at DECUS!  There are a
couple of details that need to be settled.  These, we can democratically
figure out when we're all here -- tomorrow.


    See you tomorrow,  /D.

Subject: C_Prime Compiler. 

O.

  I've figured out how to compile, assemble and link a program, using the
write-protected Aztec C_Prime disk, with the source code and possibly some
#INCLUDE files and some modules and/or library files on the source code disk.
Here's the way to do it:

	Put "C_Prime" disk in drive "A:", source code disk in drive "B:";

	Boot MS-DOS from drive "A:";

	Enter, after "A>" prompt:

SET CCTEMP=B:		;(so compiler won't try to write tmp file to drive A)

	Then enter, after "A>" prompt:

SET INCLUDE=A:		;(so compiler will search drive A: for #INCLUDE files)

	Then enter, after "A>" prompt:

CC [-IB:] B:<prog>	;(specify drive B: for #INCLUDE files (if needed for
			;  any non-standard ones on the drive B: disk), and
			;  compile "B:<prog>", writing output to "B:<prog>.O")

	Then enter, after "A>" prompt:

LN B:<prog>.O [<.O or .LIB files>] A:C.LIB
			;(link main object module "B:<prog>.O" with any
			;  relocatable object files or library files needed,
			;  and (finally) the main C library file on disk A:)


	Result:  executable file:

B:<prog>.EXE

Just to get any needed coordination done, here are my Thursday plans:  I only
wish to attend 2 Thursday sessions, starting at 12:30.  I'll be in the office
to give any needed coverage, and get some moderately urgent work done.  I'll
leave Fremont about 11 am.

I just noticed X62 has crashed.  It crashed twice Monday:  it just got hung
with parity error lights on for both MI & memory.  I ran MEMTST, and got
plenty of completed, error-free iterations of the test.  Joe tells me that
Steve Capik has found that the power supply has been irregular:  varying in
output over time, reguiring fairly frequent readjustments.  I think Steve
should be called as soon as he gets back from vacation, Monday.

I noticed several garbled mail messages, so I hung 930, stopped its microcode
long enough for the base to notice, and then reloaded the F3.  The problem is
something in P034/P34 that affects all processors - COMMON does not clean up
after itself when taking the system down like is used to.  In the process of
fixing that, I will look into passing more information across reloads.  Such
