	software may have changed since. I am not aware of what changes may be

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

Peter,

    I am sorry I was not clear in my last message to you.  We will
provide the new INITIA to you, if you agree to test it.  I assume that
you do agree to test it, from your last message, so I am placing it in
username SYSMAINT on host S443.  If you wish it in another username,
please let me know.

    I apologize for my delay in responding.

    I have placed a copy of the new version of INITIA.SAV in the
SYSMAINT directory on host S443.  the file does not have, but must have
to run, the following licenses:  OP SY ST JL.  I hope this is adequate
for your test -- I hope you can set the licenses on the file.

  Dennis and Carl,
 
  I have now tried out the INITIA you have provided me with on host 443.
 
  I am afraid that the result is not positive. The system gets to the fol-
  lowing point :
 
    512K OF MEMORY ONLINE.
 
    System in auto-restart, running INITIA
 
  .. and then seems to hang forever.
 
  Could you please investigate further into this problem ?
 
  Thank you, and have a good weekend, Peter.

     I am responding to your Ontyme on behalf of Peter Haas.
 
     The information you obtained from your available references is valid.
     In addition, you might also add the name Albert Handelmann (TT.EM) as
     the contact person for Germany.
 
     I am not certain what documentation you have been using, but I sug-
     gest that you obtain a copy of the International First Aid Handbook
     to use as a reference in the future.  The handbook is updated regu-
     larly and is available on-line by logging onto any tymshare 370.
     After log-on "ATT INTLIB" (no read password required) then at the
     next prompt type "IFAH".  You will then be prompted to supply output
     formats.  If you do not have a complete copy, I suggest that you
     print an entire copy with the command "IFAH PRINTER ALL" to use as a
     reference and type updates to specific sections as necessary.
 
     Please let Peter or me know if you have further questions.

Hank,

    1.)  Re.  the network line:  I dialed the wrong number when calling
you with the answer about getting it re-connected, and spoke with Jack
Nagel.  I told him who he should contact in Tymnet to get his line's
connetion straightened out.

    The name I gave him is:  Julie Wagner;  Tymnet H.Q., San Jose;
phone:  (408)446-5359.  Jack seemed pleased.

    2.)  Re. documentation for BIONIC.  The only documentation I'm
aware of is the user documentation file in the (*6NEWS) directory on
proportedly all of the Tymcom-X PDP-10 hosts of the old Tymshare.

    Any more on BIONIC will take deeper searching.


                                                     I hope this helps you,

PS:  In looking over the message I had just sent, I realize that I had left
out an important bit of information:  the name of the documentation file for
the BIONIC program.  The file name is (*6NEWS) BIONIC.DOC.  It exists on hosts
26 and 34, and should be on all hosts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I am an Applications Consultant in the Houston office and need your help
with Fayez Sarofim's software upgrades.
 
I have recently received the Fayez Sarofim account responsibilities from
D'Juanna Beer.  She has explained the software update problems and solutions
that your group worked with her on.  Today I talked with Michael Sugden, and
he questioned whether he had received his software upgrades.  He said that his
monitor is out of date and the other programs must be upgraded before
it can be updated.  However, I note from M. Chinn's Ontyme to D'Juanna on June
6 that the version of CHKPNT (and not the monitor) that they have is not
able to support the newer versions of SETND OPPS, and that they need
a new version of CHKPNT first.  So, let's review the software upgrades that
were supposedly copied to F.S.'s SSINSTALL directory (or to SYSINST - not the
correct directory).

I had Michael Sugden check his SSINSTALL directory.  There were some Magnum
programs there, which he will install, but none of the above.  He later
checked SYSINST and found the copies of DIRIT, FILCOM and CHKPNT listed
above.
 
Please transmit all programs which have been previously approved for installa-
tion (including the monitor utility programs) to F.S.'s SSINSTALL directory.
Please notify me via Ontyme as soon as these have been transmitted so that
I can notify M. Sugden.  I would like to be caught up on these upgrades
as soon as possible so that the customer will receive the software which
he is paying for.  Please let me know if there is something else that I can
do to expedite this process.

Have you sent the software upgrades to Fayez Sarofim yet?  Please remember
to notify me, or F. S. will not know that they are there to install.

Thanks.

Regarding your message about Fayez Sarofim's software---

Michael Sugden At F.S. said that tape transmittal is fine; in
fact he prefers to receive it that way.  When it is ready to be
sent, just let me know.

Marla,

It appears that we have agreement, and progress toward satisfying F.S.!
I'll let you know when the tape of programs is ready to send.  

We are currently examining the latest version of the monitor (operating
system), plus several monitor subsidiary programs and monitor-related
utility programs for inclusion in the transmittal.  I'll let you know
just which programs will be included.

Hank,

	I don't know any more than when we talked yesterday.  I have
have tried to log in to host 169, but its base was down yesterday and is
still down today.

	I have spoken to Bud Reinhardt, and as of yet have not gotten
any important additional information from him.  I have talked with
Tymnet Network Control about the host's base (node 5303) being down.
The base is a LSI-11 micro-Tym-Base.  The code is a non-standard (for
Tymnet) product, under the responsibility of Dennis Ernst.

I have tried talking with Dennis about reloading the node.  Dennis is
out of town for a week, at a national standards meeting.  I'll try again
with Bud, to see if he can reload the node from 169.  Until the node is
reloaded I can't do anything for them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

For your information:  I have, through some research, obtained a copy of
our contract with Fayez.  You have been quite right:  we are contracted
to provide them with software support.  We will do so with as much speed
as is possible, considering the amount of research involved.  

We believe that Fayez is planning to soon change to MAGNUM on a VAX
machine.  If so, they may now be somewhat resistant to changing software
that they have grown quite familiar with--this is the case with our
other 2020 customers.  We recognize that this does not mean they will
not expect software support for their VAX, when delivered.  We are and
will be willing and able to provide them with contracted support.

I hope this memo indicates our clearer understanding of our support
responsibilities.  If I am wrong about their plans to move to a VAX, I
would appreciate clarification.  

Thanks!

Peter,

    I am sorry I was not clear in my last message to you.  We will
provide the new INITIA to you, if you agree to test it.  I assume that
you do agree to test it, from your last message, so I am placing it in
username SYSMAINT on host S443.  If you wish it in another username,
please let me know.

    I apologize for my delay in responding.

    I have placed a copy of the new version of INITIA.SAV in the
SYSMAINT directory on host S443.  the file does not have, but must have
to run, the following licenses:  OP SY ST JL.  I hope this is adequate
for your test -- I hope you can set the licenses on the file.

  Dennis and Carl,
 
  I have now tried out the INITIA you have provided me with on host 443.
 
  I am afraid that the result is not positive. The system gets to the fol-
  lowing point :
 
    512K OF MEMORY ONLINE.
 
    System in auto-restart, running INITIA
 
  .. and then seems to hang forever.
 
  Could you please investigate further into this problem ?
 
  Thank you, and have a good weekend, Peter.

     Saeki-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding Spool system and
     problems with node  3575 in Tokyo.
 
     I have spoken with Jan Krivanec and Dennis Coffey on this subject.
     First of all, the problem has now been resolved on host 34; you
     should now be able to submit a Spool request and have the sytem react
     properly for nodes 3371, 3575 and 3717 (in Osaka).  If you experience
     any difficulties, please give us a complete description of the prob-
     lem.
 
     Secondly, we have found that the spool map, for printer locations, is
     not always updated in a timely fashion when transferred (automat-
     ically) from host 8 (master system) to other hosts; this means manual
     intervention is required and is how Dennis fixed your problem today.
 
     We'll try to avoid such problems in the future, but we have no way to
     be sure except for your prompt analysis of the problem, if it should
     occur in the future.
 
     Let me know if any questions.  Regards. Ken
 
     P.S. Jean-Francois, node 3000 has also been manually updated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kamoi-san, Saeki-san,

Thank you for your memos on BIONIK. I am sorry it has taken so long for
me to do anything about it. All I can say is that it has been an
extremely busy and difficult week for everyone here in the U.S., also.

Today I talked with several people about the BIONIK (and BIONIC)
situation. For everyone's benefit, I would like to sum up a few
points:

1. Kamoi-san, I think that Phil Spies is not the person who is responsible
for BIONIC--I think that Carl Baltrunas (and maybe Dennis Coffey) are the
people who work with BIONIC. I spoke with Carl today, and I have passed
copies of your memo on BIONIK source (A77317) to Carl, Dennis, and Gary.
I am also copying Phil, Gary, and Dave Smith on this memo, because all
the products--BIONIK, BIONIC, new HSA, and the base--all have to work
properly together.

2. Gary Masters reports that there are still BIONIC (as well as BIONIK)
problems. Gary says that, with the new HSA, BIONIC works sometimes, and
other times does not work. (He says that BIONIC will work properly all
the time if you come through one of the old HSA nodes.)

3. Aki Saeki says that BIONIK will not work, either through the new
HSA or the old HSA. Aki says that he was able to get BIONIK to work
once, when he tried it at about midnight JST (=0700 PST). This situation
                                                                Page  2

has been going on for about a week--i.e., the problems started at the
end of the last weekend in November.

4. Just some speculation on my part:  one thing that both the BIONIC
and BIONIK problems have in common is that both programs do not fail
100% of the time. Perhaps there is  something in the critical path
(host-base-network-HSA node) that breaks down now under "heavy" loads--
perhaps a timer or some kind of counter?

5. Something else about the BIONIK problem to me seems very strange:
according to KTL, they are having the problem on all hosts, both
when they go through the new and old HSA in Tokyo. However, I just
checked with operations, and found out that host 57 still has it's
Varian base, not a Tymnet-II base. This means that KTL can try to
use BIONIK (which has not changed) through a Varian HSA node to get to
a PDP-X with a Varian base--and BIONIK still fails???

Aki--can you confirm this point for us?

Anyone--can anyone think of something else that has changed recently
that could cause this? If we could pinpoint what is fouling up
BIONIK even in a Varian-Varian path, I think we might have a clue to
all the BIONIC(K) problems.

6. One more question for KTL and for Gary: what exactly do you mean when
you say that BIONIC(K) doesn't work? Does it disconnect? Does it hang and
not do anything? Does it transmit garbage? Or what?

7. KTL-san--now that you have the source code for BIONIK, you can try
to make some test versions that will work properly. If you want to
change the code, compile it, and test it, you may be in the position to
solve the problem yourselves. (In fact, I am not sure if it was TUS or KTL
that modified BIONIC into BIONIK several years ago.)

Carl and Dennis--with all the changes being made to the net, the bases,
and HSA, I don't think we can bank on KTL making the fix themselves. Maybe they
will get lucky, but maybe they won't. Anything either of you can do to get
BIONIK up and runnning again would be greatly appreciated--KTL has customers
out there who need to use BIONIK in production systems, so the matter is
quite urgent.

Look forward to hearing from everybody on this one.

Thanks and best regards,

Greg

Greg -

Bionic does not work in the following manner...

If one watches the batch run from the remote end the run appears to
go normally up to and including the point where the "FILE NAME" is provided...
this should be followed by receipt of "READY FOR INPUT" from the host... 
instead what is (sometimes) received is

READY FOR INPUT 
 
 

0 RECORDS INPUT

and of particular importance is that these two records are received in the SAME
block... since the remote station is dependent upon receipt of either the
"READY FOR INPUT" string or its terminating (EOT) as its signal to begin
transmitting data any, situation in which the signal to begin transmitting
data and the notification that no data was received are received by the
remote station at the same time although presumably NOT sent by the host 
at the same time would appear to be the result of variations in network
performance.

Some additional comments on the BIONIC problem...

BIONIC does work with OLD Varians, but somewhat differently than I remember...
following receipt of READY FOR INPUT and the transmission of the data file
I have received several (4 I believe) 80 character lines (apparently the first
several lines of the file being transmitted being echoed back to me preceeding
the (n) LINES INPUT message... the data transmitted was received intact... 
apparently part of it went to two places.

BIONIC appeared to work fine from the period when Phil Spies included the
YELLOW BALL patches intended to fix a previous BIONIC problem until the
aftenoon of Nov 27th... upon return to work on Dec 2nd I recompiled and 
loaded the then current versions of the server slot as well as the BBXS slot.
Changes had been made to both since the previous version I had been testing.

All reported observations are using the 3780 mode of bisync
 
 
Greg, please distribute this to all individuals being copies on the BIONIC
problem... if Terry Silva is not on your list please add her... EDI.T/SILVA

Thx  Gary Masters

     Eric, thank you for the Ontyme memo of November 19th, regarding the
     CTF accounting project.  I have checked with responsible parties here
     and have the following response or comments; I'll use your item num-
     bers as reference:
 
      1.  It appears you need very little additional information because
          you have taken care of most all issues yourself;
 
           a.  Tymcom 370: Nikki Marsh has indicated support will be
               available as required.  CTF will be notified if any changes
               take place.
 
           b.  Tymcom X: I have discussed this area with Dennis Coffey.
               User names CTMKTG1 and CTMKTG7 are valid on host 930 and
               the two Oper names mentioned are also valid.  However, Den-
               nis would prefer for you to access the information in the
               "INFO" data base on a host other than 930, as the Tymcom X
               group plans to eliminate many of the Oper names (Read
               files) from this host.
 
               Dennis can allow for "INFO" to be available on any host you
               choose, at the same time it is updated on host 930.  I
               imagine you would prefer host 90 for this data?  Please
               let me know the following:
 
               Is host 90 your preferred host for this information?
 
               How much informaton from "info" do you require?

 
Cegi Tymshare accounting project                                    Page 2
 
 
 
               Do you anticipate any problem if your "RF" license is
               removed from host 930?
 
               Regarding Perp, Telecopy and PCOM:  PCOM and Telecopy will
               continue to be supported and available for your needs.
 
               PERP will eventually disappear, possibly as early as Janu-
               ary '86, due to problems which you may already be familiar;
               if not early '86, then likely by December '86.  Is Perp
               critical to your operation, as long as PCOM is available?
               The Tymcom X group is working on an alternative to PERP,
               but timing is uncertain at this time.
 
           c.  Validations:  You will continue to have access to these
               database(s); user name CTOPSMGR is already valid on host
               74.
 
               Changes are being made at present time, for security rea-
               sons, as related to these data bases; therefore, Jan Kriva-
               nec requires the following information from you as soon as
               possible:
 
               Which user name will you use (we assume it to be CTOPSMGR)?
 
               Which OPER name will be used?
 
               The above two items must be set up in a file, for security
               reasons, so you'll be authorized to use the X22 validations
               data base.
 
               Specifically, which files will you require (i.e.
               USERDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS etc.)?
 
               Jan will notify CTF of any future changes, prior to changes
               being made.
 
           d.  Tape library: I spoke with Bob Jacobs.  Bob states the cen-
               tral tape library is generally accessed via a 370 by exe-
               cuting the command TAPELIB EXEC, which builds an 'auxiliary
               circuit' to host 74 (TAPELIBE).
 
               Since I know nothing about Tapelib, please let Bob know if
               you require any additional information on this item.
 
      2.  You apparantly do not require any additional tools from MIS or
          CP/CMS.
 
      3.  I understand you will also do accounting for Tymcom X host S90,
          three hosts in total, for now.
 
      4.  I'd suggest we continue with the present accounting arrangement
          (MIS continue to supply e-o-m invoices, detail, royalty and MRD

 
Cegi Tymshare accounting project                                    Page 3
 
 
          files) through January '86, or perhaps longer, in order to
          insure that all is working on both sides.
 
          AND, that you are able to supply me (or royalty accounting in
          St. Louis) with the royalty accounting for all 3 hosts.  I would
          prefer to receive the same information as is presently supplied
          by MIS but I realize you do not have the relevant royalty code
          available.  Can you give me an indication what can be supplied?
          I would need totals of connect, tru and pru (prime, n-prime and
          Batchtym) by user name and host as the present MIS system sup-
          plies.  Is this workable?  This is the one and only item that we
          require from your hosts (i.e. royalty information for 3rd party
          vendors).  Please let me know your thoughts?
 
      5.  Implementation plan appears fine except for issues in item 4
          above.
 
     Conclusion: All parties involved have indicated they will keep CTF
     informed on any changes, cancellation of specific entities etc.  The
     groups are CMS/CP (Tymcom 370), Tymcom X, Validations, MIS and the
     Tape Library.
 
     Do you have a specific plan on the best means for communicating these
     changes?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kamoi-san, Saeki-san,

I just got through meeting with Gary Masters; Gary was running some
tests on BIONIC. I think everyone would be interested in the results,
which have raised some interesting questions.

1. Gary was testing userids on hosts 34 and 57, the hosts with KTL
customers. Host 34 has a Tymnet-II base, and host 57 still has the
Varian base.

Gary was using a PC emulating a 3780. He had a test file with 100
records. He tried using both old HSA and new HSA.

On both hosts, using old HSA, the BIONIC sessions terminated normally.
When we came in through the new HSA, the file was closed too quickly;
the remote terminal was still sending data, but instead of going to
the data file, the host was trying to interpret it as commands.

I'm not sure if this is related or not, but this looks very much like
the MOVETERM problem Tak Yasuma reported today in his A79655.

2. Some questions for KTL:

        a. Aki, can you confirm or deny Question 5 in my memo J85041?
        Does BIONIK fail even when you have old HSA and a Varian base,
        such as the one on host 57?
                                                                Page  2


        If you can find any combination of node, base, and host where
        BIONIK works, I think you should just move your customers
        there.

        b. Just to see if it would complete cleanly, we tried running
        BIONIK, but we could not find a copy to use. KTL, can you
        tell us on what username the current version of the BIONIK
        object code is? We want to try it, even if it is not working.

        c. Now that you have found a copy of BIONIK source, have you
        been able to modify it so that it will work? (If so, we will
        be very interested in the U.S. and Europe, because we still have
        BIONIC problems.)

Look forward to hearing from anyone with anything to contribute.

Thanks and best regards,

Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I recently spoke to Carl Baltrunas about the BIONIC(K) situation. Here
is what he told me:

1. Carl is in the process of rewriting BIONIC. In the new BIONIC there
will be a katakana option, so there will be no separate BIONIK program.

2. In the new BIONIC, the syntax will be slightly different:

Old BIONIC:     -R BIONIC
                RUN

New BIONIC      -R BIONIC
                KATAKANA
                RUN

or

                -R BIONIC
                ASCII
                RUN

or

                -R BIONIC
                RUN

The default is ASCII, so the last two options work the same. However,
                                                                Page  2

ASCII-KATAKANA is a toggle, so you can move both katakana and ASCII
files in the same BIONIC session.

3. The ASCII option creates 7-bit files. The katakana option creates
9-bit files with 8 bits of data.

4. Carl is hoping to have the new version of BIONIC up and working
by 12/16, PST. There is a chance, but no guarantee, that it may be
working earlier when the network conversion goes through on 12/15 at
0300 PST. You will just have to give it a try early 12/15 JST, and see
what's working. Carl says he will send an Ontyme to everyone as soon as
he has it ready.

5. Carl mentioned one other possibility that you could use in the meantime,
and while your customers are changing the syntax in their job streams.
(Carl also said that there was no guarantee that this would work, but you can
try it:) Since you did find a copy of the BIONIK source, you could try
making a version of BIONIK with a sleep call in the earliest part of the
program, and give ta very high value for the sleep parameter. Carl, like
Gary Masters, believes that a lot of the trouble we are seeing are from
differences in timing, where one process starts and the other process is not
ready for it yet, or has timed out.

Good luck to everyone; Carl, we look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Greg

Greg,

  I've completed a version of BIONIC which handles both ASCII and KATAKANA
in the normal non-HSA mode.  I have been unable to do any testing using an
HSA so I cannot confirm whether it works properly or not.

  My new version implements the "fix" that P. Spies, D. Smith and I agreed
on last week.  However, I have heard conflicting reports about whether the
"fixed" version of BIONIC actually works with the new HSA code.  I haven't
connected with P. Spies to discuss these reports in the past 3 days, so if
you can send me an ONTYME to TXS.C/BALTRUNAS requesting a copy of the new
BIONIC and a "test" directory or system to try it on, I'll be happy to
prepare a pre-release version.

The ASCII file mode writes 7-bit characters 5 per word.  The KATAKANA file
mode writes 9-bit characters (8 bits from the BLOCK I/O buffer and the 9th
is always 0) 4 per word.  If this is NOT what you expect, please inform me
prior to requesting the test version.

Thank you all for your patience.

/Carl

Carl,
Thanks for your good news on new BIONIC.
     
The current BIONIC via new HSA has still problems which were
appeared with old HSA.   
Sometimes it is OK, and sometimes it is NOT OK.   
     
So we will try your new BIONIC, please let us know the instruction,   
and the directory which it stroed in.   
However, we have no responsibility of official test for the code, so  
we can only try it and send some report to you .  
     
Anyway we will happy to try it.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC in C34, and also was suurprised 
to find that (SYS)BIONIC on C34 and C57 were replaced as new ones.    
Are they well tested ?? I don't think so.    
     
From the observation of my so many trials, I found as follows.   
     
Trials via new HSA  
------------------  
     
        Any command for new BIONIC can't be accepted and BIONIC  
        replys "Unrecognized command, enter ? for help" for any input.
        So I can't do transmission and even can't do QUIT from BIONIC.
     
        At last night, BIONIC works well except the problem which we alrady
        reported about it, but this morning no BIONIC inthe 
        world works. I supporse there is some problem in command scanning  
        portion of the code.  
     
        PLEASE GO BACK (SYS)BIONIC TO OLD ONE, and KEEP IT UNTILL YOU CAN  
        GIVE US THE CODE WITHOUT PROBLEM.    
     
Trials in ASYNC
---------------
     
        Sometimes BIONIC closes just after "READY FOR INPUT" without  
        waiting data input, with following messages.   
     
                BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                0 RECORDS INPUT    
     
        BIONIC echoes some lines of input data and not echoes some lines   
        in one trial with any change ofinput mode.
     
     
About display of messages
-------------------------
     
        Please display messages in uppercase letters from BIONIC,
        because some our CRT can't display lowercase letters, which   
        is used for current messages.   
     
Best rgards,   
Makoto

    The BIONIC rewrite is complete!  It has been placed on directory (SYS) on
systems 34, 55 and 57 for testing by all concerned parties.  I ran tests this
afternoon and could not get the new version to fail with (and without) the
new HSA.

    The features of both BIONIC and BIONIK are incorporated in the new
BIONIC program.  The new calling procedure is as follows:

            Katakana mode              Ascii mode     (default)

            -R BIONIC                 -R BIONIC
            *KATAKANA                 *ASCII          (may be omitted)
            *RUN                      *RUN
            OUTPUT TO FILE: filename  OUTPUT TO FILE: filename
            READY FOR INPUT           READY FOR INPUT

            (if through an HSA interface, 4 blank lines are printed)

            .... data transferred here ....

            nnn RECORDS INPUT         nnn RECORDS INPUT
            -                         -

ASCII mode is the default and simply calling BIONIC in the old way (by
omitting the command "ASCII") will create an ASCII mode file on the disk.

In 2780 mode (through an HSA), this version of BIONIC will wait for the
first end-of-file indicator (EOF) after the filename is sent (the HSA sends
a yellow-ball through the network) for up to 5 minutes.  After receiving
the EOF, BIONIC enters block mode and reads data until the HSA sends the
second EOF at the end of the data.

In non-2780 mode, this version of BIONIC reads data until the base times
out (a 16 second wait with no data).  A ^Q is sent just prior to the text
message "READY FOR INPUT" and a ^S is sent after just prior to the message
"nnn RECORDS INPUT".  (Note: For non-2780 mode, there are no differences
in operation between the old version of BIONIC and this version.

Please ONTYME me with the results of your testing so that this version
may be propagated to all PDP-10 hosts.  Thank you!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


FYI--

Due to the severe problems with the newest version of BIONIC
(checksum PEDMUM), Ihave asked operations to restore the previous
version of BIONIC (checksum VISMUJ) to SYS on hosts 34 and 57.

This was in response to telephone and Ontyme requests from KTL
(ref A88225 and  A88226.) KTL's reason for wanting the old version is
that it apparently worked at least some of the time for some of
their customers. They are not able to get the  new (PEDMUM) version
working under any circumstances from a bisynch terminal.

I asked operations to do the restoration rather than going through
regular channels (whatever they are these days), because KTL could
not run the tests until the late Friday PM (PST) release, and they
have customers coming up late Sunday PM PST, Monday AM JST. Operations
were the only people around over the weekend.

Carl, Dennis, Gary, can I make a suggestion: how about moving the
PEDMUM version of BIONIC to FTSYS? That way, a customer anxious to
try to use the new version could alter his command file to get to it,
but a customer who is having luck with the old version won't be forced
                                                                Page  2

into doing any testing while we are still having problems.

The SYS:55 version is still the new PEDMUM version.

Look forward to any new developments or suggestions.

Thanks and regards,

Greg

Carl,
     
I tried your new BIONIC in (UPLKT:34).  
     
I tried   
     
   1. Transmission into ASCII file under default mode ( without ASCII 
      command)  ...... 5 trials    
     
        3 trials: abort with display    
     
             ILL MEM REF for page 000400 at user PC 001102  
     
        2 trials: BIONIC close just after READY FOR INPUT without waiting  
                  data input and displayed   
     
                  BLOCK INPUT ERROR.    
                  0 RECORDS INPUT. 
     
   2. Transmission into ASCII file with ASCII command  ..... 5 trials 
     
        4 trials: Abort with ILL MEM REF .......  
     
        1 trial : Can't send data with BLOCK INPUT ERROR.....    
     
   3. Transmission into Kana file with KATAKANA command   ..... 5 trials   
     
        In evry trial, I could send kana file and BIONIC closed normally.  
     
        However, a problem , I found in the sent file. 
     
        When I send data in following manner,
     
        <Stx>AAAAA(Irs>BBBBB<Irs><Irs>CCCCC<Irs>DDDDD<Irs><Etx>  
     
        I expect followings in a sent file.  
     
        AAAAA<Cr><Lf>    
        BBBBB<Cr><Lf>    
        <Cr><Lf>    
        CCCCC<Cr><Lf>    
        DDDDD<Cr><Lf>    
     
        However actually I got
     
        AAAAA<Cr><Lf>    
        BBBBB<Cr><Lf>    
        CCCCC<Cr><Lf>    
        DDDDD<Cr><Lf>    
     
        One empty record (<Cr><Lf>) was ignored.  
     
About trial 1 & 2   
     
  After aborting with ILL MEM REF ...., I found the file was not closed    
  normally and was not able to handle it with display **FILE BEING    
  MODIFIED**.  
  So I supporse there is some problem in file closing portion under ASCII file  
  handling mode.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Gentlemen,
     
I would like to summarize and report to you regarding many problems   
which occured from last Friday evening(jst). 
This summary is only problems which I have got now ( monday 
24 dec. morning ..jst ). 
     
The environment are as follows:    
     
    1. HSA terminal for test ......DATA-100 of our office   
                                   ( connected by hardwire )
     
    2. The node code of HSA is version 1.05 ( released date dec. 19 pst)   
     
1. Bionic and Bionik of old version
     
   As you know, This program does not work.  
   The problem is that the file does not close when the transmission  
   from terminal to host was completed. 
   It does work occasionally. 
     
2. New Bionic  
     
   ASCII option:    
               please refer Mr. Ogura's ontyme ( msg# A89114)    
     
   KATAKANA option: 
               It seems that the program does works apparentlly. 
               But, It seems that the "blank" records are not transmited.  
     
3. Punch and Kpunch (pdp-10)  
     
   This program does work but does not work occasionally.   
   According to monitor of Data Scope,  
   Sometimes , the sequence seems to be changed in some place ( host or    
   base or node ) as follows: 
     
   (1)  <stx>(dc2)data<irs>data<irs><etb>.........
     
   (2)  <stx>(dc2)<irs><etx>....<eot> <stx>data<irs>data<irs><etb>.....    
     
   The case (1) is same as VALLIAN node and the program does works.   
     
   The case (2) is that the actual data is removed from punch selection.   
   In other words, the program does not work.
     
4. When the terminal was disconnected from node by power off of terminal   
   or modem reset or etc. ,   
   The logged user is not diconnected ( or logoff ) from host untill  
   the center operator execute "kill jobs" by our request.  
     
    a. We can't execute "kill jobs" from async terminal.    
     
    b. The user-id's setting is "logout on disconnect".
     
5. When we entered "WHO" command from HSA terminal ,   
   The answer from host are not printed / displayed on the terminal.  
     
   ha reverse, the msg "OUTPUT BEGIN" of moveterm receive into 
   disk.  
     
   And receiving "EOT" from node in bad timing causes terminal down.  
     
As i mentioned above , I have so many problems in current systems.    
Please find the reason why they occure and fix them as soon as   
possible. 
Or We will lost all HSA user in Japan.  
     
Thanks.   
kamoi
     
p.s. I don't know logic and timing of "EOT" transfer(in/out)
     through HSA node .  
     Please explain us in detail.

Subject: Bionic release %1(2) ** BUG FIX ** 

To all concerned:

		    *** Merry Christmas ***

I would like to thank Mokoto Ogura for testing the new BIONIC and finding
the ILL MEM REF caused by an off-by-one oversight on my part.  This bug
has been fixed in version %1(2).  Please, I would like you to try this
new version again.  It is located on (FTSYS)BIONIC.SAV on systems 34, 55
and 57.  It is also on (SYS)BIONIC.SAV on system 24, (OHTA)BIONIC.SAV on
system 57 and (UPLKT)BIONIC.SAV on system 34.

To Phil Spies:

    The problem cited with blank records being dropped as they pass through
the HSA seems to me to be a bufferring problem.  Please take a look to see
if this in in the HSA code.  (Multiple <irs>'s).

To Mokoto Ogura:

    This should solve the ILL MEM REF problem you saw.  (The ILL MEM REF
occurred after you had already processed 4 data pages and was the next
data byte on the 5th page).  It will not solve the problem of "blank"
lines, i.e. <stx>data<irs><irs>data... (see note to Phil Spies).  Please
make a test on both system 24 and your production system(s).  I do not
know what is causing of the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR", but I have noticed that
it occurs consistantly only the "first" time I try to run BIONIC.  Every
additional time,  BIONIC works ok.


    Let me know the results of any further testing.  Thank you all.

Carl,
     
I tried your new BIONIC on host 34 and 24.   
     
Trials via Async    
----------------    
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (FTSYS)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
     
        I tried 10 times in one session and get   
     
          6 trials : Ok  
          4 trials : NOT Ok with  BLOCK INPUT ERROR.   
                                  0 RECORDS INPUT.
     
     
Trials via HSA 
-------------- 
     
        Tried by (FTSYS)BIONIC on C34 and by (SYS)BIONIC on C24. 
     
        In both code, the situation seems to return to the last  
        Saturday's which I mentioned in my OnTyme (A88226). 
        Any command for the BIONIC on (FTSYS:34) or (SYS:24)
        can't be accepted, and the BIONIC replys "Unrecognized command ...."    
        for any input at "*" prompt.    
     
     
Carl, I beleave you had already tested it well, especially via Async. 
So I can't understand why such a problem appeared......
     
        By our location, by some routing of network, or by just a program  
        error ..... etc ???   
     
One question: in the BIONIC, does the same command scan routin analize
a command via Async and via HSA-Bisync,  or two routins, one for Async
and another for Bisync, are ready for the code ?  
Because I wonder why the BIONIC can recognize a command via Async and can't
do it via Bisync.   
     
     
In Japan, our office is closed during the next week by NEw Year holidays.  
However, I will ready to test it when you send another version of it. So   
please send an OnTyme to KTL.TOKYO and make a copy to KTL.OGURA, which I   
will check by appropriate timing at home.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,

  I cannot be sure how your Bisync equipment works, but it is possible
that when a line of data is transmitted, it is padded to a standard size
such as 80.

  I simulated this action with BIONIC version %1(2) by adding blanks to
the end of my command line.  I also received "Unrecognized command,...".

  There is now a new version, %1(3), which contains code to remove both
leading and trailing blanks from the command line.  Please test this new
version when you have time.  It is in all the proper places on systems
34 (FTSYS)(UPLKT), 55 (FTSYS), 57 (FTSYS)(OHTA) and 24 (SYS).

  *** Have a happy New Year Holiday ***

Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC.  
     
Via Async 
--------- 
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 11 times in one session and got ...    
     
        6 trials : Ok (1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th trial)  
        5 trials : Not Ok with BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                               0 RECORDS INPUT.   
     
        And I found the sequence of OK/NOT-OK is the same as yesterday's.  
        However I don't know the sequence has some meaning or not ....
     
Via HSA   
--------  
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 10 times and  
     
        5 trials : Ok    
        5 trials : Not Ok    After EOT sending from terminal,    
                             the host replys nothing.  
     
        - "Ambigious command ......" message 
     
          When terminal send R (UPLKT)BIONIC with some trailing blanks,    
          BIONIC replys above message as follows. 
     
     
          Terminal sends 
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs><Etx>  
     
          Response from node(host), echo and others    
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<--- 56 blanks ----><irs> *        <irs>Ambi 
          gious command, please re-enter.<irs>*<irs><etx>   
     
     
          I also know that, in the New BIONIC, blank(s) input at "*" prompt
          causes the message. 
     
          This is not a problem for my current operation, but how can I    
          understand it ???   
     
     
        - In evry NOT-OK case, I can close the BIONIC by additional   
          operation as follows.    
     
          Term     Last data record ... <irs><etx>       <eot>   
          Node                                     <ack>        ..... 
     
                ....... No response from node .......  
     
          After 10 min.  
     
          Term    <enq>      <stx><-- 80bytes record --><irs>      <eot>   
          node          <ack>                                <ack>    
     
          So I send one more dummy text after actual data, BIONIC closed.  
     
          I don't know about the ball-logic, but I guess, in somewhere,    
          the first EOT is eaten by someone and BIONIC does not know  
          about it. 
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,

    I have fixed the problem of blank records causing an error message
when entering commands to BIONIC.  I believe that I have also solved the
problem behind the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR." message.  Apparently some things
do NOT work as they are documented to work.

    I have put my newest trial version, %1(6) [version 1, edit 6] in the
(FTSYS) directory on systems 34, 55 and 57, in the (SYS) directory on 24,
in the (UPLKT) directory on 34 and in the (OHTA) directory on 57.

    Please run your tests on this version on systems 24 and your production
systems.  If the tests are successful, then I will release this version to
the (SYS) directory as soon as possible.  If the tests fail, then I would
like you to run your tests on another internal system which has a different
type of TYMNET-II base.

    Thank you very much for your attention and co-operation.

    ****  Happy New Year Holidays ****

Carl,
     
Today, I tried your new BIONIC in UPLKT:34 through HSA, and found interesting   
matter.   
     
- I made trials under following 2 methods.   
     
        Method-1 : Send data , which you can see (OGURA:34)TEST.128, 128 char   
                   * 100 recs, with blank compression (by Igs).  
                   This file contains 2 all-blank records which are   
                   compressed as   
     
                        <Igs><7F><Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs>    
     
                   per a record.     (Total 128 blanks/rec) 
     
                   In past 2 weeks, I tried under this method.   
     
        Method-2 : Send the same file with truncating traling blanks. 
                   Under this method, the all-blank record is sent as single    
     
                        <Irs> 
     
- And as far as I know, Phil's OnTyme (I95298) is not reflected for KTL's  
 HSA yet. 
     
     
At the trial   
     
In method-1     5 trials 
-----------    
     
        2 trials : Ok    
        3 trials : fail with the same situation which I mentioned in my OnTyme  
                    A90038, 28-Dec-85. (No reply from node after data sending)  
     
In method-2     10 trials
-----------    
     
        Every trial is OK !!     However the all-blank records are ignored.
     
So, from the observation, I thought IGS cause some problem, and I tried    
another data which did not contain blank compression. You can see the file 
(OGURA:34)TEST2.128, 128 char * 100 recs.    
However it was not OK. BIONIC did not reply after data sending. So IGS may not  
be a cause of the problem.    
     
Then I guess a single IRS has some meaning at Terminal-BSC-HSA-Base-BIONIC ???!!
And please remember my OnTyme (A88428,23-dec-85), in which I reported the  
same experience under katakana mode of your BIONIC.    
     
However, I'm not sure, in this kind of problem, what number of trials is enough 
for the test. Even in the method-2, I don't know 11th trial may fail or not.    
     
     
And I also tried (UPLKT:34)BIONIC via async 10 times, and found every trial
was OK. I didnot experience which I got in past trials via async.

THE PROBLEM WHICH THE MULTIPLE CHARCTERS FOLLOWED BY MULTIPLE BLANKS ARE   
CONVERTED TO BLANKS WAS FIXED BY NEW PATCH FILE OF HSA.
THE MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE USING OUR SERVICE IN MULTI-COUNTRIES AND
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP THEM.    
COULD YOU LET ME KNOW WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED ON YOUR SIDE?   
THANKS AND REGARDS. 
     
P.S. 
 ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN LOS ANGELS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AT 9:20 ON JAN.16 
 (JST). COULD YOU CHECK WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURED BEFORE OR AFTER IT WAS    
  FIXED ?

1. MULTIPLE CHARACTERS BEFORE MULTIPLE BLANK BEING CONVERTED TO BLANKS.    
    THIS PROBLEM DID NOT OCCURS.   
     
2. "EOT" SEQUENCE TROUBLE DID NOT OCCUR.
     
3. DATA LOST PROBLEMS DID OCCUR (NOT SOLVED) 
     
4. RESPOND TIME IS DELAY(TIME-OUT PROBLEM, IS NOT SOLVED.)  
     
5. FILE COULD NOT BE CLOSED(TYMCOM-X).  
     
6. HSA IS HOLDING LINE AFTER JOB ON TYMCOM WAS KILLED. 
     
WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED 
COMPRETELY. OFF COURSE, OUR CUSTOMERS TOO.   
THANKS AND REGARDS.

Subject   : Trials for BIONIC through revised base program on C34
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
     
At the noon of last saturday (18-Jan) in JST, I was informed by the president   
Asama, he is staying in Cupertino, that some base program of C34 was revised.   
     
Then I tried BIONIC as follows.    
     
Trial-1   
-------   
     
        18-Jan 13:30  --  14:40   (JST) 
     
        1.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC          .... OK  
        1.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.3  10 trials for (UPLKT:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.4  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC          .... OK  
     
        I thought a base program of C57 was not revised yet. So I checked  
        the difference between revised-base and not-revised-base.
        However both had the same conclusion.
        And I didn't know (FTSYS:34)BIONIC was the same one as (UPLKT:34)BIONIC,
        which is %1(6). So I checked the UPLKT's. 
     
trial-2   
--------  
     
        18-Jan  17:05  --  17:20    (JST)    
     
        2.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC        ..... ok   
        2.2  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC        ..... ok   
     
     
Trial-3   
--------  
     
        20-Jan  9:20  --  10:30      (JST)   
     
        3.1  5 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC
                3 trials ( from the 1st to the 3rd ) was not OK. 
                In every trial, BIONIC closed normally but some data was lost.  
                2 trials were OK.  
        3.2  5 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC         ..... OK 
        3.3  5 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC           ..... OK 
     
Trial-4   
-------   
     
        20-Jan  18:30  --  22:00  (JST) 
     
        4.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed but some 
                data was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
        4.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC          .....OK
        4.3  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed, but some data
                was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
     
     
From the observation of the trials, every BONIC(SYS:34,FTSYS:34,UPLKT:34, and   
SYS:57) seems to be closed normally and I think the current situation is a bit  
better than the last week's, however it is not enough to say the problem   
is fixed. 
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

YOUR ONTYME SAYS:  "2.  BIONIC FILES 'NOT BEING CLOSED ' PROBLEM OCCURED ON
C57 6 TIMES BUT DID NOT OCCUR ON C34."  PROBLEMS WITH 'BIONIC' CAN OCCUR
BECAUSE THE USER RUNS THE WRONG VERSION OF 'BIONIC'.  THE CORRECT, FIXED
VERSION OF 'BIONIC' IS IN ONE DIRECTORY ON C57, AND IS IN THREE DIRECTORIES ON
C34.  THIS CORRECT VERSION OF 'BIONIC' HAS NOT BEEN ACCESSED SINCE JAN 22.
THE VERSION OF 'BIONIC' WHICH WAS USED ON JAN 23 TO JAN 24 WAS THE OLD
VERSION.

IF ANY OF THE PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY BIONIC, THE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE ELIMINATED
BY THE USE OF THE NEW, CORRECTED VERSION OF BIONIC.  IF ANY OF YOUR CUSTOMERS
HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE NEW, CHANGED VERSION OF 'BIONIC', PLEASE TELL ME, IN
ONTYME.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS WHICH VERSIONS OF 'BIONIC' ARE CORRECT, WHICH
VERSION WAS RUN ON JAN 23 OR JAN 24, AND WHEN EACH WAS LAST USED.

                 CREATION      LAST ACCESS   CORRECTED

THIS TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE COPIES OF OTHER VERSIONS OF 'BIONIC'.  THESE OTHER
VERSIONS OF 'BIONIC' ARE IN DIRECTORIES 'UPLKT', 'OHTA' ON HOST C57, AND SOME
PERSONAL DIRECTORIES ON HOST C34.  I BELIEVE THAT THE COPY OF THE CORRECTED
'BIONIC' IN 'MAROIL' ON HOST C34 IS SOMEONE'S PERSONAL COPY.  I BELIEVE THAT
THIS COPY IS NOT FOR GENERAL USE.

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when we have a problem
 
      PERP: we are still waiting for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.


      Regards,
      Dennis

I spoke to Jill Neidrauer, who owns the JMARCIN userid. Jill was
testing replacements for some of the validations programs which
now run on the 940s and will have to be replaced.

I explained the situation with the Japanese customers on host 34.
Jill understands the situation completely, and we should not see
any more problems with the JOB CAPACITY EXCEEDED message.

     Phil, Henri Tocheport of Sligos has recently requested that we elimi-
     nate the old Batch arrangement whereby Batch requests submitted by
     users in branch 38 are dumped into the SLIBATCH directory.  It seems
     they no longer have a need for the "translation" of such requests and
     prefer to have them placed in the standard BATCH (OPS) directory.
 
     I have spoken with Carl Baltrunas about this issue.  What we would
     like to do is eliminate both the Sligos and Cegi Tymshare special
     arrangement whereby Batch requests are dumped to either the SLIBATCH
     or FBATCH directory, depending on the branch number of the requestor.
 
     So, the question is: Would you foresee any problem in eliminating
     this special lookup arrangement within the Tymcom X Batch system?  I
     suspect most, if not all, of your billable clients are on host S90,
     therefore translation is likely not required; basically, no need for
     two requests when one will do, directly to BATCH directory.
 
     Please let us know if you have any objection to eliminating the code
     within the Batch program which performs the above process.  It would
     likely make the Batch mechanism more efficient by eliminating the
     branch lookup code and could allow for easier enhancement to the code,
     if required in the future.
 
     We look forward to your earliest response.  Regards. Ken

KEN,

I JUST RECEIVED YOUR MEMO ABOUT TYMCOM X BATCH PROGRAM.
I THINK YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE CODE WITHIN THE BATCH PROGRAM WHICH PERFORMS
THE "SPECIAL ROUTE" BETWEEN SLIBATCH AND FBATCH DIRECTORY.
ACTUALLY IT WILL BE BETTER ALL BATCHES ARE STORED  AND MANAGED FROM
FBATCH DIRECTORY. IN FACT SINCE MAY SLIGOS SUBMITTED A FEW BATCHES WENT
DIRECTLY TO SLIOPER DIRECTORY. IL WILL BE EASIER FOR THE OPERATORS
TO HANDLE TYMCOM X S90 FROM ONLY ONE DIRECTORY.

THANK YOU AND BEST REGARDS.  PHIL

     Phil, thanks for the memo regarding Batch program on the X's.
 
     Your memo stated:  "Actually it will be better all batches are stored
     and managed from FBATCH directory."
 
     I'm a little confused by this because the 'standard' procedure does
     not use the FBATCH directory to my knowledge; in fact, I'm not cer-
     tain of the directory used via the standard Batch program.
 
     In any event, I am requesting Dennis Coffey and Carl Baltrunas, via
     copy of this memo, to proceed with the change which will eliminate
     the transfer of Batch requests to either the SLIBATCH or FBATCH
     directory (as based on district number of the user).
 
     If this is contrary to your understanding, please let me know imme-
     diately.
 
     Best regards. Ken

  Ken,
 
  As of yesterday, the problem we had  has been solved for 3 systems.  The
  systems are  : 83, 170, and  264. This leaves  59, 60, 92, 301,  and 443
  which still don't have TELECOPY or PERP.
 
  I realise that you may not have had up-to-date information on our exist-
  ing 2020's. Please note that host 184  is temporarily off the network as
  it is being replaced by a VAX.
 
  I do not know why the three systems are now able to create circuits nor-
  mally to IX's, so  I have copied in all persons  contacted previously. I
  hope someone will be able to explain this problem soon !
 
  Best regards, Peter.

     Eric, I believe the last correspondence on this topic was your memo
     dated February 17th (A22104).
 
     Due to other commitments and priorities during past two months, I
     have spent little time on this subject.  Also, many other items have
     an indirect affect on some of the issues, therefore I have not con-
     sidered any of the items critical from a viewpoint of timing.
 
     In reponse to your memo, please note the following which refer to
     your item numbers:
 
      1.  According to Dennis and Carl Baltrunas, the INFO data base will
          eventually reside on all Tymcom X hosts.  Eventually, the OPER
          names may be removed from host 930, but no action is being taken
          at this time.
 
          More information will be supplied on these items in the future.
 
          The replacement for PERP is forthcoming, as has been indicated
          by TXS in the past; should be a matter of a few weeks at most.
 
      2.  Jan understands your needs.  Oper names Jay and Stratman are
          already valid.
 
      3.  As you are likely aware, the Commercial Billing system will
          migrate to St. Louis by September.  I do not think we should
          eliminate the regular accounting process (invoices and detail
          supplied by MIS and/or St. Louis), even though you have your own
          accounting in place.  I say this because it may cause unforseen

 
CT Accounting Project                                               Page 2
 
 
          problems (e.g. Tymshare UK e-o-m accounting as related to usage
          of hosts S51/S53).
 
          At this point in time I am not concerned about Royalty account-
          ing being supplied by your system because 1) the e-o-m process
          will continue as referenced above 2) vendor royalty payments are
          now the responsibility of ACS rather than IOD (MDISI) and 3) CT
          CT has their own agreements for Express and Focus.
 
     That's the extent of my comments at this time.  Best regards. Ken

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I maintain the spool data bases on the Tymcom-X hosts.  Hosts 34, 36 and 57
are among these hosts.  Users have requested SPOOL jobs to be printed  at
printer location 76, from these three hosts.  

I believe that printer location 76 is in Tokyo.  The information about that
remote site that is in the SPOOL data base is as follows:

	PRINTER LOCATION NUMBER 76
	KOKUSAI TYMSHARE, LTD.  
	13-5, KUDANKITA 1-CHOME 
	CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO 102   
	JAPAN 

	(03) 262-8711     

Requests that were shown in the data base to be PENDING and were entered prior
to May 1, 1986 have been deleted from the data base.  The following is a copy
of the data base's current list of SPOOL requests that should have been
printed at remote location 76 but are still shown to be PENDing:

REQUEST    DATE   STAT  LOC   USERNAME

  host 34 (Cupertino)
34939   1-MAY-86  PEND  R76  HYTECH

57938   7-MAY-86  PEND  R76  OHTA
57942   8-MAY-86  PEND  R76  OHTA


Please fill these requests or delete these requests, as is proper, and let me
know what is done about them.  Also, please let me know how I should handle
similar information about PENDING requests when I discover such information in
the future.


Thank you,

     This simply means the PDP/KL host S90, located in St.-Cloud, France,
     will be permanently shut-down at the end of this month.
 
     Bruce; I assume you'll remove the PDP-10 software support charges

Carl, Dennis,
Below I'm reproducing memo A78374 from Makoto Ogura of KTL. As he
mentions, KTL was not able to reproduce the problem reported by
their customer, but they did find something strange on C57. If you
need more information on this from KTL, could you contact Ogura-san
directly at KTL.TOKYO?
 
Ogura-san, when you have more information on this problem next week,
will you let Carl and Dennis of X support know about it.
 
I'll ask both sides to keep me in the Ontyme loop; let me know if there's
anything else I can do to help with this.
 
Thanks and regards, Greg

Greg san, 
     
Now, I have strange problem on C57.
This afternoon, A-AIS users on C57 called us and informed that Katakana tools   
did not work well. (UPLKT)KPUNCH said "CAN NOT OPEN FILE:xxxxxxxx" and the 
specified file has no problem. We could not reproduce it at our side, however   
the users still reported the problem to us. Also I found some unmatch between   
WHO and SYSTAT. All which I saw is related to DIRECTORY of the system.
     
Is there anychanges on C57 or C57's directory control ?
     
As we could not reproduce it at our side, we will check more next week.    
So if possible, please check on C57 and let us know it before our checking 
at user terminal.   
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ogura san,

I believe the problem on host C57 has been fixed.  The problem was in the GFD
program.  Under one set of conditions the problem would occur.  When the user
used GFD to get access to another directory, then used the GFD command
(without a username) to return to his logged-in directory, he would not get to
his own directory but would get "lost".  

This problem began occuring recently.  I believe it was fixed about 24 hours
ago.  If the users continue to have trouble, please let us know.

Regards,
Dennis Coffey

Subject: P034/P will not run on a 2020 with only 256K. 

TRW tried to bring up the P034/P monitor on their system.  It complained
about not having 512K, then died with stopcode PGENDP (alias SWPNDP) when
it ran out of core pages for DSKCLN + INITIA.

I tried duplicating the problem on 95 by removing 4 memory boards.  Sure
enough, /P dies with only 256K.  It runs with 384K, but really wants 512K.
P034/J runs in 256K but P034/P does not.  It may be possible to diddle with
some defaults (like reducing free-core) to squeeze into 256K, but I wouldn't
want to support it.  I suggested that Dennis recommend they get more
memory - used 2020 parts should be fairly cheap.  /Joe

Joe,
  A "telephone meeting" is planned by TRW for 2pm Tuesday, with you planned as
an important participant.  Tina is going to initiate a conference call to
coordinate, schedule and plan the installation of the last 128K of memory,
burn it in, and re-install the /P-10 monitor.  The conference call will
include 2 or 3 org. levels of TRW, 2 or 3 org. levels of FSC LA area hardware
Field Svc., 2 or 3 people from Network Sys. Co., Carson Janes, you and me.

  FSC, in LA area, wil supply the 128K of memory on trial basis.  When new
memory is burned in and appears reliable (we're suggesting a week burn in),
the host will be booted with the new monitor.  Carson and Craig are talking
about you going on-site for booting with the new monitor.

  You can see, we need you on the conference call.

  See you,
  -D.-

Re:  2020 System Game Plan.

Cheryl & Mark,

Following up from the Dec2020 meeting last Tuesday (2/17/87) @TRW 505/8,
this is a list of things we discussed and the future plans to get to
support the monitor:

01.  The current monitor (J-60) is not supported by Tymnet.  But the new
     monitor (P-10) which is currently supported.  We have requested 
     Tymnet to send TRW a letter to indicate Tymnet will support the old
     monitor until TRW upgrade to the new monitor thru the new CMF system
     replace.  (Nadyne Sotto)

02.  A new monitor (P-10) needs to be run @512KB of memory.  (Defined by
     Joe Smith & Dennis Coffey)

03.  TRW's persueing the additional 128KB of memory.  (Fred Halverson)

04.  A hardware audit of the Dec2020 system has been requested of FSC
     (Dennis Rice - 2/18/87 after 10:00p.m.)

05.  The hardware audit will be sent to Communications Dept. for copy
     (Robert Nowell & Tina Ngo) and also to Joe Smith to confirm the
     H/W & S/W compatibility.
     If compatible, Joe Smith will be on-site when the new monitor is
     installed.  (one day only!!!)

06.  Target all of the key programs to be ready for the new monitor (P-10)
     (Robert Nowell & Tina Ngo)

07.  Set up a scheduled plan for Dec2020 project.  It contains H/W & S/W &
     support.  (Tina Ngo)

08.  Joe Smith will confirm the MERGE program (Blaine Anderson's Acct.)
     with the new monitor compatibility or incompatibility.

09.  Field Services Company needs to get back to TRW with an escalation
     procedure from NSSC for H/W & S/W.  (Dennis Rice)

10.  When the new monitor is installed, Joe Smith will set up the crash
     program on TRW's system to notify him immediately when a problem
     occurs.

11.  McDonald Douglas Co. needs to send TRW SOURCE CODE for the utilities
     programs.  (Nadyne Sotto needs to discuss internally about this issue
     and she will get back to TRW.)

If anyone has any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to give me
a call @714/385-7485 or send me an ontyme TRWISD.T/NGO.

                     Best Regards........Tina!!!

Joe,

Following is a list of key programs, which's TRW currently using.
We want to get the latest version SOURCE CODE and the CKSUM of all these
programs.  Also the procedures how to install to current level of version.
Can you send this requested to Joe Smith & Dennis Coffey for us?
Therefore, we can work on S/W to be ready for the new monitor (P-10).
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a ring at
714/385-7485 or send me an ontyme.

  Above crashes with P034/N, CRA029 from P035/B
CRA029  6-Mar-87 21:03  MAGSTS/ 160200 = Tape hardware error

MAGSTS is tape drive status, CRS1 in the RH11 connected to the TM02/TU45.
100000 = bit 15 = SC   = Special condition (set if TRE or MCPE get set)
 40000 = bit 14 = TRE  = Transfer Error
 20000 = bit 13 = MCPE = Massbus Control Parity Error (TM02 sent bad parity)
  4000 = bit 11 = DVA  = Device Available (tape is on-line)
   200 = bit 07 = RDY  = RH11 is Ready (should always be on in any dump)

Crashes 020, 021, 024, 025, 026, and 029 all indicate that there is something
wrong with the tape drive.  The problem appears to only occur after EOT has
been reached.  Field Service needs to run diags on the drive - tell them
"We keep seeing bit 13 get set in register CSR1 of the tape's RH11".

On another subject, crashes 004, 006, 007, 011, 012, 013, 014, 016, 017, 018,
and 019 all have STOPPC/SCNSER:GOBIO2+12, which was fixed 8-Apr-86 in P034/P22.
The patch is in (OSARC)BIOZAP.PAT and is in P035/B but is not in P034/P-14.

Differences between P034/P-10 and P034/P-14 monitors:
  Patch #11 RESET.PAT did not solve anything (SIMUUF still occurs)
  Patch #12 cancels the gobbler after zap (crashed EBUS bases, not LSI-11)
  Patch #13 changes the scheduler fairness (affects busy systems like 39)
  Patch #14 made INFO stopcodes work on KI (does not affect KL or KS)

Therefore /P-10 is suitable for use on the 2020 systems, it is not worth
patching /P-10 to /P-14 level.    /Joe

Nadyne:

The tape for TRW has not yet been shipped to Cheryl London.  Putting the
software, sources and documentation together for the customer is taking quite
a bit of time -- I've been working on it for 2 weeks.  I'm quite close to
getting everything to tape, today.  Fremont data center will be shipping the
tape to Cheryl London today.

Subject: TECO macro for F-S (host 370). 

Joe,

Help, please.

I've received word from Fayaz-Sarofim that the TECO marco that you wrote for
them [(FS7:370)FILTER.TEC] gets some kind of kind of overflow error when
working on their (BIG) data files.  They are giving us a file on their host,
for testing:  (FS7:370)PRC15.IN.  Can you do something, or recommend some
procedure?

Thx!  -D-
