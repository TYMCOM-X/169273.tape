Subject: Locating the sources to system programs using FINDIT.TEC 

If you are looking for the sources to a particular program, you can often save
yourself some trouble by checking if the information is already on-line, on
system 930 in the files (JMS)*.WHR.  These WHR files are created when I try
to find where the sources are.          /Joe Smith, 26-Nov-86

How to use FINDIT.TEC

A) Make sure that you have (SYS) in your DO list after (XEXEC).
   See (JMS)RPGINI.CTL for an example on how to do this.

B) Copy (JMS)FINDIT.TEC to your directory.

The above two steps need to be done only once.

C) Have MHX run FINDIT on all systems, creating a .WHR file.

D) Mung the WHR file using FINDIT.TEC to clean up the file and add host numbers.

E) Optionally sort the WHR file if you want to.

Example of step C - running FINDIT via MHX

01	.MHX
02	hosts: 10S
03	commands (end with ctrl-D):
04	O$
05	FINDIT
06	TELEC#.*,AUXMO#.*
07	
08	SYSNO
09	record? Y
10	output file: TELECO.WHR
11	detach? Y

01 Start (MPL)MHX.
02 Tell MHX to go to all PDP-10 systems (as defined in JOBS.DAT).
03 Prompt from MHX.
04 Type "O", ESCape, and your OPER password.  Note that MHX turns off echo
   while it is reading the password.
05 Run (SPL)FINDIT on each system
06 Tell FINDIT to look for TELECO.SAV, TELECF.223, and AUXMOX.SAV.
   TELECF.223 is the FDM file for version 22.3, therefore when searching for
   sources and FDM files, it is a good idea to have # as 6th char of filename.
07 Blank line is required to get out of FINDIT.
08 Dummy line, I put it in out of habit
09 Control-D to end commands, MHX asks if you want to record output in a file.
10 My convention is to use *.WHR to keep lists of where files are.
11 Detach.  You can monitor MHX's progress from another terminal.  MHX changes
   its name (as reported by SYSTAT) to be "MHX:nn" when going to host nn.

Example of step D - MUNGing the file
In this example I use a different WHR file and show only the significant lines.

12	.DIR KLKS.WHR
13	KLKS    WHR      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
14	.MUNG FINDIT,KLKS.WHR
15	FINDIT V2 - Fix output from FINDIT by putting username after file name
16	29:
17	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:29)          15  07-Dec-78  14:49  ALL  RD  NO
18	62:
19	ACCESS.MSG  (KS2020:62)         2  24-Feb-81  14:45  ALL  RD  NO
20	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:62)          12  09-Jul-80  20:25  ALL  RD  NO
21	"Done

12-13 The log file does not show up until MHX is done.
14 The MUNG command runs (SYS)MUNG.SAV which runs (JMS)TECO.SHR.  The first
   argument is the name of the commands file (FINDIT.TEC), the argument after
   the comma is the name of the file that FINDIT.TEC is to work on.
15 FINDIT.TEC identifies itself.
16+18  Each host number is typed as it is found.
17,19-20 Note that username and host have been moved to the middle of the
   record.  The filename is now in column 1 where it can be sorted.  Every
   line of the file is typed out, you can use Control-O to suppress it.
21 FINDIT.TEC is done.

Example of step E - SORTing the file

22	.DIR KLKS.*
23	KLKS    WHR      25  26-NOV-86 1552    ALL RD  NO     12044
24	KLKS    BAK      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
25	.SORT KLKS.WHR=KLKS.WHR
26	SORTED 774 RECORDS

22-24 The BAK file can be deleted.  It is created in case you run FINDIT.TEC
  on a WHR file that has already been MUNGed once.
25 (XEXEC)SORT takes OUTPUT.FIL=INPUT.FIL, sorts in ascending order, using
   the entire line as a key.
26 SORT is done.
27 I sometimes massage the sorted WHR file by replacing "(SYS:22)" with
   "(SYS:*)" and deleting the redundant lines that say that XXX.SAV was
   installed on all systems on the same day.

Subject: CTY log has wrapped on 930. 

To see the internal log of all CTY output on 930 or 62, set license and
RUN (MPL)FILDDT.  Answer "/M" for "File:".  Then type "17046$0T" (using
ESCape for $).  That will show the last 2560 characters that have been
typed on the CTY, plus parts of the Control Block for APA0, since $0T
stops all the first null (ASCIZ).  By the way, the "CB"+Linefeed that
is typed at the end is the CB for APA0.  By some wild coincidence,
SIXBIT/APA0/ = BYTE(7)"C","B",LF,0.  Awesome.

Subject: New program: (SPL)CPY %1 


Currently in distribution is CPY version %1 which replaces most of the
functionality of the (SPL)COPY program in a slightly modernized form.
This new program uses the ARGS/ARGPAR command-line scanning package and
may be run via special command mode as a pseudo monitor command.  Type
"CPY ?" for a list of switches and normal command usage.

This program may also be run from the job processor by passing the command
line in the PARAMETERS option in SUBMIT.   This was the main reason for
the release of this program.  A user may now run a periodic job which will
run (SPL)CPY.SAV as an automatic distribution mechanism.  Using the new
/UPDATE switch file data which hasn't changed will not be re-transferred.
However, there is one drawback that TELECO-AUXMOX has and that is the
protection on the destination file will be reset to ALL RD NO each time
a copy is attempted even though no data is transferred.

An example run:
    !CPY ACCESS.MSG,SUBMIT.SAV/HOSTLIST:38/SUPERSEDE
    username [SUBMIT]: <cr>
    [logging in as SUBMIT]
    Hosts: 38
    [Telecopy in frame 8]

    !TYPE 008TEL.COM
    REPLACE
    NO UPDATE
    ONLC
    (SUBMIT:62)ACCESS.MSG,(SUBMIT:38)ACCESS.MSG
    (SUBMIT:62)SUBMIT.SAV,(SUBMIT:38)SUBMIT.SAV
    QUIT


Note:  multiple hosts may be specified separated by commas, * and 10s
       are accepted to mean all-hosts (or if /CENTER is specified, all
       hosts in the same data center as the host you are currently on).

Documentation is forthcoming... someday.

Subject: "CPY will not provide any capability"... 

CPY will not provide any capability of sending a file to/from a directory
other than the user's own, if the user does NOT already have license or
a password set.  I'm confused about your reply ...  CPY is merely a COPY
replacement.  It does allow being GFD'd to one directory and sending files
from another, but if TELECOPY requires a password, they will still need to
specify it somehow...  talk to you about it later.

Subject: New version of FINDIT. 

The new version if (SPL)FINDIT.SAV has been telecopied to all systems.
It puts the host number and file name in fixed locations so they can be
sorted.  (JMS:930)FINDIT.DOC has been updated to describe FINDIT.TEC version
3.  This version automatically sorts the WHR file when it is done.  /Joe

Subject: FIND dies on Hard Read Error. 

I found a problem running FIND under MHX.  If any file FIND is looking at has
a hard read error, FIND will die with "?Illegal Memory Reference at PC 031267"
which clears the terminal's input buffer.  MHX will sit there forever.

I have created (INFO)RESTRT.MEM and added it to the INFO tree as "RESTART".
It tells what needs to be loaded first after a power failure.  The document
lists our current configuration - it will be updated as the F3's and 2020's
get moved around.  /Joe
