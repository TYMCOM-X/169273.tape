INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

                     INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP




                                                    May 7, 1986


A Message from Bob Fischer to all ISG Employees. . .

     Over the past couple of weeks, I've heard many questions 
about ISG's first-quarter performance.  Today I want to address 
some of those questions and give you a better perspective not only 
on the first quarter, but on the remainder of this year.

     By now you've probably read in the papers that ISG posted 
first-quarter 1986 revenue of about $268 million, with a pre-tax 
loss of around $41 million.  (That loss included some $15 million 
in acquisition writeoffs.)  These results were very close to our 
first-quarter objectives.  In fact, we came within a few million 
dollars of our revenue plan and within a couple hundred thousand 
dollars of our earnings plan.

     You may have heard -- from me or from your organization's 
management -- that there was an earlier version of our operating 
plan that had us making about the same level of revenue but losing 
a lot less money than we did in the first quarter.  You may not 
have known that in March we adjusted our plan to take two major 
factors into account.  The biggest single factor was the sale of 
Dynatax.  Since most of this business's 1986 earnings were planned 
to occur in the first quarter, the divestiture lowered our 
earnings expectations for the quarter (though it improves our 
earnings picture for the rest of the year).

     The second major factor takes a little more explaining.  When 
we were putting our operating plan together last fall, we went 
back to the business units several times to ask them to find ways 
to improve their 1986 earnings plans.  When we finally reached an 
agreement, we had only a few days to submit a consolidated 
operating plan to MDC.  In the process of that consolidation, the 
last round of improvements agreed to by the business units was 
spread evenly throughout the year.  The business units, however, 
in finalizing their individual plans, put more of these 
improvements into the last three quarters of 1986.  When we 
adjusted the ISG consolidated plan to make it consistent with the 
individual business unit plans, the result was a lower earnings 
target for the first quarter, with more of our planned earnings 
moved into the last three quarters.

                       FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY


Page 2


     There were a few other factors.  These included the 
implementation of intercompany pricing, organizational changes 
such as the dissolution of McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems 
Company, the decentralization of some Group-level staff functions, 
and the reallocation of some G&A expenses.  But the point is that, 
contrary to rumor, we did not change the plan to give ourselves a 
target we could hit.  We did it for legitimate business reasons.  
And the key thing for you to remember is that these changes to the 
plan did not lower our overall 1986 earnings objective.  We have 
to earn relatively more over the rest of this year than we did 
under the earlier version of the plan; that means we have our work 
cut out for us in the last three quarters.

     The revised plan was the reason behind the executive message 
John McDonnell and I put out on April 18, 1986.  In fact, I've 
heard almost as many questions about that message as I have about 
the changes in the plan.  Before I go any further I want to answer 
a few of those questions.

     First of all, why did John McDonnell and I feel the need to 
send out such a message?  In light of the change in the plan, I 
was concerned that you would read about our first-quarter results, 
try to relate them to our original plan, and become more concerned 
than you should be.  So John and I sent our message out to let you 
know that our first-quarterings results were in line with 
what we expected under the revised plan.

     Why didn't the message include our first-quarter numbers?  
That was because we published the message just before MDC released 
its first-quarter results.  To avoid problems with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, it is MDC's policy not to discuss results 
internally until they are publicly available.

     Why was John McDonnell's signature on the message?  That was 
because John agreed with me that after all the emphasis we had 
placed on ISG's first- and second-quarter performance, his 
signature would make it clear that ISG's first quarter had 
satisfied not only my expectations, but MDC's as well.

     Actually, our first-quarter results included some very good 
news.  Three-quarters of our businesses at least came close to 
their earnings plans for the quarter.  Even better, more than half 
of our businesses exceeded their earnings plans.  I'm further 
encouraged by the fact that we made money in March.  What's even 
more encouraging to me, though, is the fact that all of our 
businesses are making good progress in resolving their key 1986 
issues, and I believe we'll see the results of that progress over 
the next three quarters.

                       FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY


Page 3


     As I noted above, we have a pretty steep ramp to climb, but 
I'm confident we can do it.  We'll get some help from the 
cost-cutting measures we've already taken, which will pay off over 
the remainder of the year.  And, again, I believe we're taking the 
right steps within the individual businesses to give us the 
results we need.

     In short, there's still a lot to do but we've got good reason 
to be positive about ISG's prospects for the rest of 1986.  I'm 
counting on you to keep up both your belief in ISG and your 
efforts to make the business a success.  I'm also counting on you 
to keep letting me know what's on your mind, and we're providing a 
new way for you to do that.  You can now get a question to me by 
calling a toll-free number -- 1-800-562-2983.  This line will be 
answered Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (CDT).  
(Within the 314 area code, the number is 232-7122.)  You should 
ask for Ann MacDonald, our hot-line coordinator, who will take 
your question, along with your name, office address and office 
phone number.  I'll see to it that your question gets a personal 
reply or is answered in my monthly ISG Spirit column.

     I promised myself I'd keep this message brief, since I'm sure 
you have a lot to do.  Thanks for all your hard work.  We've got 
239 days to go.  Let's make every one count.



Sincerely,

Subject:      SMOKING POLICY

                                                                   


Many of our employees and visitors prefer to conduct their 
business in a smoke-free atmosphere.  While we respect each 
individual's right to smoke or not, we are also responsible for 
providing a comfortable, safe and healthy workplace.

The following guidelines are an attempt to appropriately balance 
the preferences of both smokers and nonsmokers.

    o    Employees who smoke should do so primarily in their 
         immediate work areas, should respect the wishes of their 
         fellow employees, and should observe all designated 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Employees may designate their office/cubicle or work area 
         as a smoking or no-smoking area.  "No Smoking" signs are 
         available through stationery.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in elevators, hallways, 
         libraries and restrooms.

    o    Smoking will not be permitted in meetinagreeable 
         to all participants.

    o    Smoking will be permitted in designated areas within 
         breakrooms, dining areas (other than the food service 
         areas), lobbies and reception areas, provided that these 
         areas are properly ventilated.  Such areas must be 
         clearly designated and have adequate separation from 
         no-smoking areas.

    o    Smoking is not permitted in areas where it would endanger 
         lives, damage equipment and/or otherwise pose a safety 
         hazard.  These areas will be designated accordingly.

    o    Management has the responsiblity to resolve disputes 
         which may arise and to make reasonable accommodations for 
         all employees.



Page 2


In addition to these guidelines, all ISG organizations must ensure 
that smoking policies for their work locations are in accordance 
with any local government ordinances.

The successful implementation of this policy will require your 
cooperation, courtesy and accommodation of individual 
preferences.  Questions regarding this policy should be directed 
to your local Human Resources organization.




R. A. Fischer
Chairman

     ========================================================================
     The Monthly Newsletter of the APPLIED COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS COMPANY
     from
     ACS MARKETING PUBLICATIONS, Cupertino, CA . . . July 22, 1986
     ========================================================================
     
     
       . . . Tym/COMM 4.0 RELEASED AUGUST 6:  MORE FOR THE SAME PRICE . . .
     
     Tym/COMM 4.0 now offers more, but at a price that keeps this product
     competitive with CrossTalk and SmartModem.
     
     New features include...
     
     X.PC, an advanced async communications protocol that enables users to
     connect to up to 15 different hosts or network services
     TYMGEN, a simple menu-driven means to set parameters (a breeze for
     novice users)
     SNAPSHOT, a feature that "takes a picture" of scrolling data
     REPLAY, the feature that displays that picture
     
     Enhancements for the novice and the experienced Tym/COMM user:  improved
     menus, monitor color control, and 20 new procedure statements
     
     Tym/COMM's excellent support continues through the Customer Service
     Center 800 number and with a revised user's guide that documents the new
     features.
     
     All this for the competitive price of $295.  However, the other guys
     don't offer site licensing.  (Yet!)  According to product manager Rose
     Hayden, corporations want good discounts, and site licenses are an
     effective way to offer discounts.
     
     New data sheets accompanied the July NEWSFLASH.  Demo diskettes are
     available.  To learn more about the new features or to obtain a demo
     diskette, contact Rose Hayden at ACS.R/HAYDEN.
     
     
              . . . ONTYME VERSION 22:  JUST AROUND THE CORNER . . .
     
     The release of OnTyme Version 22 is scheduled for mid-August, 1986.  The
     new features are highlighted below:
     
     Pathway--enables users to access any computer on the TYMNET network
     XMODEM Protocol--provides error-free file transfer
     X.ONTYME--increases throughput, efficiency, and saves money
     The Reply command--sends the contents of the workspace to the original
     recipients of the message
     Subject line--the text supplied by the sender appears in the message
     header and all the message lists (in, out, old, long, short, etc.)
     
     For a more detailed description of Pathway, XMODEM, and X.ONTYME, please
     see the enclosed data sheet.

     The Newsflash congratulates the following marketing reps, who have
     closed, renewed, or enhanced significant new business.  New business is
     indicated by an asterisk.

       . . . NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL PILOT CLOSES--BIG ONTYME ACCOUNT . . .
     
     ACS Sales Specialist Diane Biegel and Sales Rep Claire Pribula closed an
     OnTyme application with the National Cotton Council of America for a
     pilot to run 9/86 through 1/87.
     
     The OnTyme pilot will enable the National Cotton Council, located in
     Memphis, Tennessee, to save time and money and to communicate between
     
     - farmers and the USDA
     - its staff members
     - dealers and customers of the cotton industry
     
     GTE Telemail came in with a figure 30% lower than ACS.  But ACS got the
     close due to our superior consulting services, our ability to address
     the National Cotton Council's long-term needs, and the fact that
     Telemail has inferior error checking.
     
     Pribula first called on the National Cotton Council in September '85.
     In May '86, she got the RFP.  She contacted Diane Biegel, and, with the
     help of Nancy Browning, Bill Price, Nancy Shelton, Nick Corsano, and the
     Customer Service Center, made the close in July '86.
     
     According to Nancy Browning, ACS Manager of Business Development, this
     foot in the door has great potential for big future business!
     
     
                  . . . HOW TO PREPARE A WINNING PROPOSAL . . .
     
               by Patt Christie, Sr. Section Mgr., Marketing Media
     
     How well you prepare proposals may determine the success of your
     organization.  Here are some suggested mechanics from a just-announced
     book written to help you market your services:
     
     * Begin each new section at the top of the page
     * Be sure that no section is more than three times the number of pages
       of any other section
     * Place the table of contents and a list of exhibits and appendixes in
       the front of the proposal
     * Try to limit lists to six items; make nine the maximum
     * Include exhibits in the text adjacent to where the exhibit is noted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     * Avoid acronyms, abbreviations, and colloquialisms.  Write for an
       uninformed audience that has moderate interest
     * Limit sentence length.  Sentences that run more than 30 words and
       contain more than two ideas are difficult to follow
     * Include a "you will receive" benefit statement for each "we will do"
       statement

                  . . . PUBS SYSTEM STILL SEMI-OPERATIONAL . . .
     
     All publications printed befWhat's Selling?"  All are packaged by 25.
     
     ACS publishes many collateral pieces to assist your sales efforts.
     Check them out.

     LEGENDS...
     
     How many basketball players can shoot, pass, and rebound?  How many
     football players can run, pass, and defend?  How many baseball players
     can run, hit, and pitch?
     
     How many ISG Sales Reps are maintaining existing business relationships,
     selling the big ticket items, and building a growing base of business?
     It's a lot to ask, but all three of these are critical to our long-term
     success.
     
     The pressure is on to close big opportunities before the end of the
     year.  It's business as usual -- right?  Come 1/1/87, you'll be asked
     "what have you done for me lately" by you-know-who!
     
     In between selling those "big ones," why not sell two or three pieces of
     ACS business?  Come January, you might have an "extra" $15,000/mo.  By
     June, with our nurturing, you've got $30,000/mo.  By year end, the
     combined ongoing revenue from these closes could be worth half a million
     dollars a year!

Subject:      STATUS OF ISG MERIT REVIEW PROGRAM AND EMPLOYEE 
              SAVINGS PLAN

                                                                   


In the past few months, there has been considerable discussion 
over two ISG-wide issues:

    o    When will merit increases be reinstated?

    o    What changes, if any, will be made in the ISG Employee 
         Savings Plan?

The purpose of this memo is to let you know where things stand 
regarding these issues.

We plan to resume ISG's merit review program in January 1987.  
While I cannot provide details just yet, I can assure you that 
whatever process we use will address the fact that some 
individuals have gone longer than others without a merit review.  
I realize that the suspension of such review has been, at best, a 
major inconvenience for all of us.  However, it really has 
bettered our chances of achieving ISG's earnings objective.  I'm 
counting on your continued patience until we've finished the job 
we set out to do this year.

As for the ISG Employee Savings Plan, you received word several 
months ago that we were considering changes in the way matching 
contributions are handled.  After careful study, however, we have 
decided to make no changes in the plan at this time.

Subject:      NEW ASSIGNMENT/PROMOTION FOR BILL FREEMAN

                                                                   

It gives me great pleasure to announce the promotion of Bill 
Freeman, currently Director of Business Management, Computer 
Systems in MDISI.  Effective August 11, Bill will assume the 
position of Vice President, Research and Development for the 
Computer Systems Company.  Bill will be based at CSC headquarters 
in Newport Beach, California and will report to myself.  The 
following individuals will report to Bill:

    Steve Vernon, Vice President, UK Development
    Bill Schrader, Vice President, US Development
    Frank Reinhart, Vice President, Advanced Product Development

Bill's extensive background in sales, marketing, and business 
management within the computer industry over the past 12 years has 
provided him with the skills that I feel are important to the task 
of coordinating our internal worldwide engineering functions as 
well as coordinating with the sales and marketing entities which 
distribute our products.  Bill's experience in his most recent 
role of translating MDISI market needs into specific product 
development requirements will be invaluable to this effort as 
well.

I feel that this level of coordination will allow us to remain 
competitive by targeting our efforts on products to meet the needs 
and demands of our internal and external clients.  Through the 
coordinated efforts of this organization with the worldwide 
manufacturing organization under Greg Lawson (Vice President, 
Manufacturing), CSC will be even better positioned to deliver high 
quality competitive products.

In support of ISG objectives to eliminate all unnecessary 
approvals and delegate responsibility to the lowest practical 
level, this directive eliminates the requirement to obtain 
management authorization prior to engaging in Short Term Business 
Travel.  Based upon this directive, ISG Organizations should also 
eliminate the requirement for preparation of redundant forms 
containing information which will be reflected on travel expenshe opportus.

Management will retain responsibility for review and control of 
travel expenditures through approval of travel expense reports, 
and tracking of travel expenses charged to departmental budgets.

ISG Organizations are expected to incorporate these guidelines 
into their Company level direcresponhe opportuon within 
each Company.  Organizational travel practices should be revised 
to conform with this Directive as soon as possible, but no later 
than December 31, 1986.

ISG Policy Interface Coordinators and Travel Accounting functions 
can contact Clifton S. Carter in St. Louis, at (314) 233-6544, 
with questions and for assistance in incorporating this concept 
into your existing procedures.

All other Business Travel and Reloche opportuines remain as 
stated in ISG Management Directive 215.

Subject: New phone numbers for Bldg. C former occupants. 

The folks from Bldg.  C, including the Resource Planning & Management unit and
the Software Distribution & Installation unit, have moved to Solar Way, so
they have new phone numbers.

On top of this, the tie line between here and Solar Way has been taken out.
Because of this, you have to get out of the old Tymshare telephone network
into the public phone network, then dial the exchange and the whole 4-digit
extension number to reach anyone over there.  This is also true of the PDP-10
operators, and Lenny.


the numbers are:

Ed Roop				415/498-2562
Julian Minh			415/498-2560
Vivian Hyatt			415/498-2563

    RPM:
Resources			415/498-2514
Jan Krivanic			415/498-2556
Landa Morris			415/498-2557

    SDI:
Bob Jacobs			415/498-2558
Khanh Nguyn			415/498-2559
Ingrid (Dolovitchenyj) Lopes	415/498-2564

I'm sure there are others, but these are the only ones I can think of whom we
would need to know.
