SUBJ:  SPOOL's current limitation to Tymsat node numbers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in our telephone conversation, the SPOOL program on the
SDS-940's and the PDP-10's cannot cope with Tymsat numbers greater than
3776 <octal>.  If a user logs in to his host from a Tymsat with a node
number greater than this limit and attempts to have a file listing
printed on a fast line printer through use of the SPOOL program, the
program cannot associate his logged-in Tymsat with a printer location.

This limitation is historically due to the binary word size of the
Tymcom-IX hosts.  These hosts have a 24-bit word size.  The file used by
the SPOOL program on both types of hosts associates the Tymsat number in
one half-word with the printer location number in the other half of the
word.  This limits the Tymcom-IX's to a maximum of 11 bits (3776 octal)
to encode node numbers, since the last bit is used to differentiate
in-house users from customer users.

The SPOOL program on the Tymcom-X hosts was written assuming that this
limit would not ever cause a problem, and thus did not leave memory bits
in the program available for expanding the range of node numbers.  One
bit in the Tymcom-X hosts' program can be "scrounged" to increase the
range of node numbers available to SPOOL to a maximum of 7776 <octal>.
Doing so would make Tymcom-IX SPOOL unable to directly assign a printer
for users of these nodes, would require re-writing some of Tymcom-X
SPOOL and re-formatting its data file (initially about 1 week's work),
and would regular manual updating of the data file on the Tymcom-X's
which associates node numbers with the line printers.

The updating of this data file is currently done by SRA, using a program
on host 8 (a 940) then distributed to all IX's and X's by the PJ system,
who's driver is on host 8.  Migrating this updating program to a Tymcom-
X would require about two weeks' work.  The automated distribution of
this file to all Tymcom-X's would require migrating the PJ system's
driver program to a Tymcom-X host:  about one month's work.

There is a "kludge" around this problem:  the current limitation can be
side-stepped with a little effort on the part of the user.  Any time his
logged-in Tymsat is not in the list of Tymsats associated with line
printer locations, he can run the program SPNODE (1) which gives a list
of node numbers associated with each printer location.  When he submits
a SPOOL request, he then provides SPOOL with the number of a node
associated with the line printer of choice, over-riding the default to
his logged-in Tymsat as the node number which the SPOOL program uses to
choose the printer.

Another "patch" around this problem is swapping node numbers so that
each Tymsat to be associated with a printer location has a node number
less than 3777.

As of our conversation, this node number limit has not been a problem.

**************************
Dennis,  this information is NOT true.  I think that you got a few
things a little confused in putting this into a memo.  The limit is
7777 not 3777 in the monitor, but is 3777 in SPOOL.  I said we could
scrounge for another bit in the monitor making it 17777, but there
is no reason why SPOOL couldn't change....

  Dennis,
 
  We have been transferring large amounts of  files from Tymcom to VAX for
  some time now, and a method which works is the following.
 
  Tymcom X  : Write tapes  using HPASCII  mode, fixed length  records, not
  blocking records , no CRLF in tape records, no labels.
 
  VAX: Use the CONVERT utility to convert the fixed format tape records to
  VAX RMS records with appropriate carriage control.
 
    On the VAX :
    $ MOUNT/FOREIGN/BLOCK=<record_length> <tape_device>
    $ CONVERT/FDL=SYS$INPUT <tape_device> <filename>
    RECORD
    FORMAT VARIABLE
    CARRIAGE_CONTROL CARRIAGE_RETURN<control Z>
 
  This method  has 2 drawbacks  : It uses  a lot  of tape (no  blocking of
  records, etc), and  for variable length files on Tymcom  X creates fixed
  length record files on the VAX with a lot of trailing blanks.
 
  We have developed a program on the  VAX which reads MAGCON labeled tapes
  with a special format, saving tape space, and restoring files on the VAX
  as variable length record files.
 
  If you are  interested in having this  program, as well as  the Tymcom X
  counterpart that  creates command files  to write  the tapes, I  will be
  glad to  send them to  you. I do not,  however guarantee that  they will
  function correctly  for all types  of files,  or that they  are entirely
  reliable for character type files.
 
  Best regards, Peter.
                                    -1-

David,

    I hope our conversation about UNDELE and DELETE/ACCESS <date> has
been helpful.  We will review the request for the modificaton to DELETE
when we receive it.

    A quick summary of what we spoke about, re. BATCH:

1.)  the BATCH operator's terminal will NOT expand tabs;
2.)  long lists of files, etc., should be placed in an EDITOR created
	file which the BATCH request references, for the operator to
	read.  this solves two problems:  the line editor expands tabs
	into eight blanks, to effectively tab over in a form that the
	old-fashioned teletype terminals can read, and the person using
	the line editor can manually justify the columns.

    The use of an EDITOR file has three advantages:
1.)  the buffer size limitation of the BATCH message is no longer a
	problem;
2.)  the line editor does not place tabs (^I) into the output file
	(tabs are not expanded by the operator's terminal, causing his
	listing of the BATCH request to jam all the columns together),
	but immediately expands all tabs into consecutive blanks; and
3.)  the editor is MUCH easier to use than the VERY limited editing
	capabilities of BATCH.  

Note:  Use of the EDITOR to create the listing file should be done
before submitting the BATCH request, so the file will be available to
the operator immediately upon his receipt of the BATCH request.  The
BATCH request and the EDITOR file should both contain some cross-
reference information; e.g.:  (in BATCH request:)  "Please restore <n>
files, as listed in file <filename> to directories <usernames>"; (in
file:)  "Information for BATCH request by <name of person doing BATCH
request>, on <date>:  . . .  ".

My research into the host 54 users move has turned up the following
information:


1.)  All responsibility and authority for determining which host an
application will reside on lies in the System Resource Allocation Group.


2.)  The space need for the MENTRY application system is 135,000 disk
pages.  (Per Kim Holland, NTS, X7433 in Cupertino):

  The FEs use their regional accounts to use MENTRY        5000
(usernames ENFE, CNFE and WNFE).  These accounts           5000
each need 5000 pages.                                      5000
  MENTRY itself needs 45,000 pages in username TYMDATA    45000
  Username NTS needs 5000 pages                            5000

monitor netowrk performance) needs 70,000 pages           70000

SUBJ:  Idea to Control Disk Space Used by Node Code Files on Tymcom-X
	Hosts (25 & 70).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Beryl,

Last week's meeting with you and the Code Generators was fruitful.  I
believe we have worked out a means of deleting only unneeded files, such
as old "BK ..."  files for nodes which have stable current "ND ..."
files.  The solution I provided the staff in the meeting was only
temporary -- a means of getting the job done until a more effective,
efficient solution is found.

I've discussed your problem with the manager and staff of the Tymcom-X
Operating System Unit, and we would like to offer a suggestion or two,
for a potential solution which might offer multiple advantages over the
current method of storing the information contained in the .TYM, .CMD
and .Cnn files.


1.)  Since this information all appears to be pretty much the same type,
it appears to be a good candidate for a data base system.

The data base system could be designed to hold all the variable parts of
the source code needed to generate the node code.  It could have for
each node all the variable information needed in a .CMD file, and all
the parameter values needed for a .TYM file.  Thus, instead of 2 pages
of PDP-10 memory for a .CMD file and 2 pages of memory for a .TYM file,
all the variable information could be stored in one record in the data
base's data file.

Procedures would be included in this data base system to generate the
.TYM file and the .CMD file for a node and for each of its slots.  These
procedures need be stored on the PDP-10 only once, saving much space.

This proposed data base system could save the "old" information for the
node code in such a way as to keep it as backup.  The system could
include the ability to automatically delete backup data more than one
generation old, and could even allow choice of backup files for deletion
based on last access date.

In addition to the savings of disk pages provided, the proposed data
base system would provide the additional advantage of greatly reducing
the number of files in the directory.  This would greatly improve access
time to each node's data, and improve the operating system's access time
to individual files (e.g., for deletion), and allow the code generators
better control over the files and data sotred in the directory.

The proposed data base system would have some disadvantages:  it would
require some time to develop, and some change of procedure for code
generators; the data for a .TYM file or a .CMD file would no longer be
in the source code file with the expanatory comments; generating the
.TYM and the .CMD files would depend on procedures of the data base
system; immediate access to the .TYM files and their comments would not
be so available.


2.)  A much simpler way of keeping the files organized and of keeping
the number of files in the directory restricted would consist of placing
the files for each node in different directories:  the developmental
files in one directory, the current files in another directory, and the
backup files in another directory.  When a file is to change status,
such as go from 'current' to 'backup' status, the renaming would consist
of renaming from one directory to another directory, which can be done
with license set.

This would make each directory smaller, making access and deletions
quicker and more reliable, and would make it easier to maintain the
directories.  When the new Tymcom-X hosts are available for node code,
this might be worth considering.

3.)  Another system that has been suggested in our meeting, that I am
beginning to investigate, is a Code Management System.  Proprietary
software packages are available to manage source code for different
generations of code for a variety of systems.  These packages provide
efficient use of disk space, easy access to the code, and efficient
management of the information.

Information about these Code Management Systems for PDP-10s is available
from the DEC user community.  that is where I will look.

Dennis,
  This is the information I have on the PJ problem on system 74.
On 11/18/85, yesterday the same problem occured, with the same type
of information as below. This problem has been occuring on system 74
with alarming frequency. 
  It appears to me that PAM is caught in a loop, using a lot of system
resources but never getting done. 
  This is important because the Tymnet accounting collector is on this
system and uses PJ to start its jobs. When PJ is in this state
no accounting jobs are started.
 
  Please look into this problem. 
 
       Thanks,
          Fred

     Saeki-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding Spool system and
     problems with node  3575 in Tokyo.
 
     I have spoken with Jan Krivanec and Dennis Coffey on this subject.
     First of all, the problem has now been resolved on host 34; you
     should now be able to submit a Spool request and have the sytem react
     properly for nodes 3371, 3575 and 3717 (in Osaka).  If you experience
     any difficulties, please give us a complete description of the prob-
     lem.
 
     Secondly, we have found that the spool map, for printer locations, is
     not always updated in a timely fashion when transferred (automat-
     ically) from host 8 (master system) to other hosts; this means manual
     intervention is required and is how Dennis fixed your problem today.
 
     We'll try to avoid such problems in the future, but we have no way to
     be sure except for your prompt analysis of the problem, if it should
     occur in the future.
 
     Let me know if any questions.  Regards. Ken
 
     P.S. Jean-Francois, node 3000 has also been manually updated.

I assume your message was informational only, and not a request for
action on my part.  I appreciate the info about DEFNOD -- I don't
remember your having mentioned that one previously.

I thank you for DEFPRI and DEFNOD -- they should greatly help us keep
the SPOOL node map current, with ease.

   Subject: REQUIRED USERNAMES ON NEW PDP-10S
 
   Dennis,
 
      We have two categories of usernames on the PDP-10's:  one, userids
   that are required on all machines  to perform our basic software dis-
   tribution and validations support functions, and two, userids that we
   have traditionally  done our  development work on,  but which  do not
   need to be on more machines than just a few.
 
      Here is  the list of  category one  names, those that  we actually
   require on all machines.
 
        ARCHIVES       CUD10          QASYS
        VALDEV         USEVAL         SALTYRON
        SPPOPER        SSBACKUP       SSINSTALL
        SSPAMBIN       SSPAMSYM       SSPERP
        SYSNEWS        TAPELIB        *6NEWS
        SRATECH        SRAVAL         SRA
 
 
      Three of these names, QASYS, SYSNEWS,  and *6NEWS, I have not been
   able to completely verify the need for.   I have been assured by oth-
   ers here that they are probably essential.  I'll be able to determine
   their status soon, and  I'll let you know if we're  able to drop them
   from this list.
 
      There are  also many names which  are clearly necessary  but which
   don't exactly fall into our  jurisdiction.  SSPERP, for example, will
   probably be claimed by  someone else.  But in cases like  this, it is
   better to have overlap than to miss some essential userid.
 
                                                        yours,   Lee

SUBJ:  Reply to your msg., re. required usernames.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lee, thanks for your complete and timely reply.  Regarding the usenames
still in question, I can say that SYSNEWS and *6NEWS are necessary.  I
cannot speak for QASYS, except that I believe it contains programs that
Ingrid uses.

Which brings up another issue:  I have learned since we talked that I
also need a list of necessary programs and data files.  To make the
meaning of "necessary" clear, let it be defined as:  used during the
regular course of business during a month.

The purpose of this 'survey' of the people who support the Tymcom-X
systems is to get a 'bare-bones' definition of a Tymcom-X host.  We can
thus save much disk space, and bring up any new host 'clean'.  I know
you, particularly, can appreciate that.

                            Thanks much for your support in this effort,

                            Dennis

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Here is the list of nodes that I said I would send you.  These are the
Tymnet-I node numbers referenced by the SPOOL program.

    There should be a Tymnet-II node number for each of these nodes, if the
node was converted to Tymnet-II.  The evolution from the listed node number to
the Tymnet-II node number might not be direct, but might be through other node
numbers.

    To keep SPOOL working properly, we must have accurate node numbers.

    Thanks!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

Preliminary tests show it works fine after my few penciled-in changes.
It is ready for testing by the consumer.  I will try to talk to Phil
Spies and Dave Smith before giving this to anyone to insure that there
is no "other" problem which we are unaware of.

Jo,

Thanks very much for the list of node number updates.  Your mention that the
list is (was) outdated is quite correct.  We are pleased to get the
information necessary for bringing the hosts' tables to the present, and
thereby provide better support to Tymcom-X users (including Tymnet and N.T.D).

WE WOULD LIKE TO SUMMARIZE THESE PLOBLEMS AGAIN AND LIKE TO ASK YOU   
TO SOLVE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
     
( PROBLEMS )   
     
  1) NETWORK/HOST DOES NOT RESPOND OVER 20 OR 30 SECONDS FROM SENDING 
     "USERNAME;PASSWORD" TO RECEIVING THE ECHO.   
     USER'S TERMINALS AND COMPUTERS CAN NOT LOGIN CAUSED BY TIME-OUT. 
     
  2) BEFORE DATA TRANSFER USING MOVETERM OR BIONIC, USERS TERMINALS   
     SEND A COMMAND (FOR EXAMPLE: "SEND" WHITCH MEANS UPLOAD).   
     NETWORK/HOST DOES NOT RESPOND OVER 24 SECONDS FROM SENDING A
     COMMAND TO RECEIVING THE ECHO.
     
  3) IN THE WAY OF DOWNLOAD, NETWORK/HOST SEND "EOT"   
     TO USER'S COMPUTERS AND THEY HANG UP.   
     
  4) EVEN THOUGH SENDING LAST RECORD WITH (USING BIONIC),   
     FILE ON TYMCOM X IS NOT CLOSED.    
     WE DON'T KNOW WHERE "EOT" GO AWAY. 
     
  5) EVEN THOUGH USER'S TERMINALS OR MODEMS POWER OFF, 
     THE LOGGED USER IS NOT DISCONNECT (LOG-OFF) FROM HOST UNTIL 
     A CENTER OPERATER KILLS THE JOB.   
     
ALL OF THE ABOVE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OCCURING SOMETIME IN THE U.S. ,   
EUROPE, AND JAPAN.  
WE THINK THERE ARE CAUSES OF THESE PROBLEMS IN HSA OR NETWORK BECAUSE 
1),  2),  3)  AND 5) OF THE ABOVE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN OCCURING ON  BOTH 
TYMCOM  X  (BIONIC)  AND 370 (MOVETERM) AND BIONIC WAS  WORKING  WELL 
BEFORE THE CONVERSION.   
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO USE ALTERNATIVE METHOD AND WE ARE GETTING  
TOWARD CLOSE OF BUSINESS.
BECAUSE  THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE A SURE IF THEY CAN MAKE A  CONNECT 
WITH OUR NETWORK EVERY DAY FOR INSTABILITY OF OUR NETWORK.  
THESE PROBLEMS BROKE OUR CUSTOMERS' RELIANCE ON OUR SERVICE AND US,   
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR SEVEN YEARS.   
ANYWAY, WE STORONGLY HOPE TO SOLVE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
COULD YOU TELL US WHO WILL SOLVE THEM WITH RESPOSIBILITY AND WHEN/HOW 
THEY WILL BE SOLVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ?    
     
BEST REGARDS,

     Jan, due to elimination of Tymnet I nodes in Europe and Japan, the
     following nodes should be removed from the Printer location indi-
     cated; this will include the regular node number plus those with a
     plus (+) notation:
 
     Printer location 64 (CTF): 64, 145, 213, 751, 1004, 1020, 1075 and
     1124.
 
     Printer location 69 (TT): 1164
 
     Printer location 70 (TUK): 1001 and 1154
 
     Printer location 76 (KTL Tokyo): 1270 and 1271
 
     Printer location 88 (KTL Osaka): 1272
 
     I also note that printer location 40 has the company name
     mis-spelled; MCDONALD should be replaced with McDonnell.
 
     Let me know if any questions.  Best regards. Ken

Subject: DIRECTORY CKSUMS 

Bill,

I have had a problem with cksums matching for a directory on two
different systems.  I had a operator dump to tape an entire directory,
then restore it to a different system, I have not been able to get the
cksums for the entire directory (using "^" in cksum) to match since.  I
have checked the individual cksums for each file and they match.  I did
some reasearch using an empty directory by creating and deleting files
and comparing the overall cksum.  I think that the order of the files
within the directory will not affect the directory cksum.  I was not
able to do an exhaustive test of this hypothesis, is this correct?  The
order of the files is the only difference I can detect in the
directories.  If the order of the files does not matter do you have any
ideas how the cksum could differ in this case?

Thanks, Dan
----------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe you can look into this.  I have no explanation, unless one of the files
has actually been altered.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 
Received: from X930.Tymnet by C36.Tymnet; Fri, 28 Feb 86 0:01:02 PST

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

Joe,

      I've looked at SYSTAT on host 36.  The update looks good!  

      I noticed that some of the elements in that field are only 8 characters
long ("DETACHED" and some of the already existing explicit node names),
causing non-alignment of the following 3 fields (port #, program name and
program size).  I know this is probably something that you are already taking
care of--it looks like the NODES.MAP update data input is not complete.

The PUB macro definitions are in (XEXEC:39)MAN.DFS.  Also there are some
examples, look at *.PUB.  If anyone in your group has a Unix manual, look
at it to get the style this is fashioned after.  Please comment.  Make a
copy of the file in each directory and change the first line so the name
of the directory will come out right.  -Bill

*****************************************************

The enrollment for tyour class is up to 18!  I also
invited ACS and NTD.  The areas of interest listed
so far are:

     -  PDP-10 resources - running PERP and detached jobs
     -  available editors
     -  overview of languages available
     -  how to do a compile to get a program listing (and not run
        out of disk space)
     -  how to save terminal output on a disk file
     -  how PDP-10s implement utility programs
     -  how to compile Assembly and FORTRAM programs
     -  meaning of PDP-10 Base
     -  What is operating system of PDP-10


Some redundancy here, but I listed ALL the areas mentioned.

Will keep you up to date on enrollments.

SUBJ:  Field Service Company's Network Access: This Building. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      I've received a phone call from Tymnet:  FSC's access to Tymnet in this
building, both for terminals and for our hosts, is not 'legal'.  I.e., Payment
Systems Co.  pays for the engines in this building and for the synchronous
network line to connect to the public network.  Pmnt. Sys. Co.  is billed by
Tymnet for this service.  We do not pay for it at all.  I am told, by Tymnet,
that our traffic "degrades Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s service", and that our use of
service purchased by another company is not allowed.

      I have discussed this with Pat Diamond, and he has agreed to handle the
solution of this problem.  He and I discussed some alternatives, and the
suggestion which he said he will persue most strongly includes:  the
installation on site here (as a 'lab' machine--self installed) of a Tymnet
Engine that FSC owns; and upgrading the line(s) (from here to Solar Way) which
Pmnt. Sys. Co.  'owns', from 9.6 Kbps to 14.4 Kbps.

      Our lab machine would be the pass-through connection for our micro-
Tym-Bases and would provide any terminal connections we might need to take off
Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engines.  The only traffic that Pmnt. Sys. Co.'s engine
will have may be pass-through traffic.  We could share costs for the lines
with Pmnt. Sys. Co., connecting one line to their machine and the other to
our machine.  Pat tells me that this would probably provide service MUCH more
quickly than ordering new phone service from Pac. Tel., and--if Sal Spinelli
of Pmnt. Sys. Co. agrees--be less expensive.

      Pat tells me that he will contact Sal next week:  Sal is in Irvine this
week, but next week will be available at Tymnet, Orchard Parkway.  He will be
in meetings there next week about their network access problems, but be able
to be reached by the Tymnet operator.

Subject: Network access change: Liberty. 

      Discussion of this pending change with Joe Smith has shown this to be an
opportunity:  if we get the lab node, we could have an ISIS machine which
would allow an Async Host Interface TYMCOM slot, as well as a Async Terminal
Interface CONSAT slot.  The Host Interface slot could allow us to bring the
the 2020 (host 95) into the network quickly, plus we could put the consoles
for the hosts on them -- allowing us to use the consoles remotely (through
network sub-addressing).

      Another alternative could be connecting to the Albrae St.  location.
This could provide redundancy, if this were in addition to the lines discussed
previously.  If we order any lines, I believe ordering directly from Pac.
Tel. will will be significantly less expensive than ordering from Tymnet.
Tymnet's monthly charge for service between here and Solar Way:  Tymnet's
monthly charge would be over $700 -- the advantage they offer is Tymnet
Network Control's reporting of and follow up on the line outage.

      Pat suggested another cost-saving alternative for redundancy from our
engine to the network:  a dial-up Network sync line, rather than a 4-wire
dedicated line.

Subject: Follow-up on the Class
From: Dennis Coffey Tymcom-X <DENCOFF@C36>

Bill,

      I want to do a follow-up questionnaire with our students of last week.
I'm getting a class list with students' Ontyme names from Janie.  Janie tells
me that constructing the questionnaire of multiple choice, rating scale and
fill-in type questions is the only way we're going to get our questions
answered.

      The type of questions I'm going to ask are:
Rate the class, 1 - 10.
Rate the presentation by Dennis, 1 - 10.
Rate Dennis's preparation, 1 - 10.
Rate the presentation by Bill, 1 - 10.
Rate Bill's preparation, 1 - 10.
Of the topics covered Thursday, were there any specific topics that you felt
unnecessary?
Of the topics covered Thursday, were there any specific topics that you felt
were inadequately covered in the presentation?

      I think we should offer another class, to cover at least TUMS, PCOM,
PEAK (with better preparation/presentation), WHEREI, QUOLST, RECORD, SORT,
START/REENTE, COPY/TELCHK, PUB/UNDER, a few of the lesser known valuable
utilities, and whatever gets enough requests.  I think we would do well to
organize the presentation by topic and give the students a syllabus.

      I'd like your thoughts on these ideas.

			Dennis

      P.S.  I'll pass on to Carl the suggestion that after a program is
FINISHed the MONITOR does an automatic CORE 0.  (I think that's effectively
what was suggested and you concurred with.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following users need to be validated for use of LOADII.  All users
are members of the Tymcom-X Systems unit -- the organization which writes and
maintains the Operating System and utilities for the Tymcom-X hosts.  

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

     Peter, I spoke with Dennis Ernst today regarding the aux-circuit
     problem reported by you on April 8th and 10th.
 
     Dennis believes this to be a known bug, which has been fixed in the
     next version of code; this newest version will be tested very soon.
 
     Dennis will send you an Ontyme once more verification and testing has
     been completed.  Best regards.

The new base has been installed on systems 25, 36 and 54 on 4/19/86
after NTD's internal testing on 2 NTD systems. So far, we have not received
any problem report on LOADII Data Lost or Buffer Zapped with system 25
or 54. By this Friday (4/25/86), if everything looks positive - nobody
complains about the new base, we will carry out the installation plan
as shown above.

If you have any concern about the base installation, please call me ASAP at
(408)-942-5190 or send an Ontyme message to nss.f/chen.

Dennis,

I hate to bother you but I have been having a real problem with some
PERP jobs.  I am responsible for maintaining several directories, one
rather large (> 35,000 blocks).  I have been able to get the PERP job to
work but I have run into the same problem many times.  This is the
output from the AFDPRP.T00 file:

The "security violation recorded" message is something I added to the
init file used by this account.  The account is (postech), 65 is the
master, with 25 and 70 as backups.  I have tried setting no init file in
the past, as it seems to hang while running it, but it never seems to
help, it still "hangs" right after log-in (I will try again tonight with
no init file).  The only way I have ever been able to clear up this
"hang" is to delete the perp job and re-submit it (sometimes several
times!).  I don't see how this is involved with my problem, to be
honest.

I can't stress the importance of fixing this problem, we have only one
system with the current code (65), so when this system goes down we have
real problems, many of our dedicated machines are updated each week with
new usernameslots in public machines are reloaded with
old code by Tymnet.  We backed our code out of the Tymnet directories
about one month ago, this was because so much of our code was out of
date by the time it was backed up to the Tymnet and Tym5 directories
that it just wasn't worth it.  Bill, if you see any error you know how to
correct, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance for looking into this,

I talked to John Kopf on your AFD/PERP problem and he suggests that you
run AFDAUX with a T; at the end of the command...
    .GO (POSTECH)AFDAUX;:25;(POSTECH);AFDGT1;T;
which will cause the session to be traced to the terminal.  Then
you can see what whent wrong.  I suspect that since AFD stuffs the
input buffer (a method which is documented as guarenteed to screw
up every now and then - in this case, I suspect, "now") and your
init program is exchanging yellow/orange balls to measure response
time (even on AUX circuits) that this is causing the problem.  I
propose you change your INIT program to only do the response time
stuff on non-aux circuits.  

Hopefully between these two suggestions you will be able to resolve
the problem.

Subject: Node 5303's inability to enter Tymnet. 
From: Dennis Coffey Tymcom-X <DENCOFF@C62>

The following is what I've learned from looking at Tymnet's PROFILE data base,
(CURR11:57) CG5303.MAC, and the output of PROBE's "HOST nnnn" command:

      1.)  PROFILE shows the Kernel host for node 5303  to be 3598.

      2.)  (CURR11) CG5303.MAC shows the kernel host for node 5303 to be 3590!

      3.)  The "HOST 3590" command to PROBE shows an Engine in Houston to be
using host number 3590 as a kernel host, and the Houston Engine is up and in
the public network.  This would preclude node 5303, with k-host 3590, from
entering the network.  

      NOTE:  at the time of my looking, the k-host number Tymnet thinks
belongs to node 5303 -- 3598, as shown in the PROFILE data base -- was not in
use anywhere in the public network!  If the PROFILE data base can be trusted,
this may well be the kernel host number to use, to get node 5303 back into the
public network.

      The customer is not accessable through the public network, and I need to
get thier host into the net to get Frank Seigal to do some debugging of thier
MAGNUM.  (Frank does this as a favor, and doesn't have the tim to mess with a
modem.  I need them in the net, so Frank can get their MAGNUM running so they
can start thier Q.C. lab working again.

Thanks!
Den

Received: from X930.Tymnet by X62.Tymnet; Tue, 1 Jul 86 13:05:56 PDT

I found some interesting facts when looking to see what characters can be
used to specify optional switches to programs that parse usernames.  Page 6
of the NETVAL ERS says usernames can be up to 20 characters, they can contain
the letters A-Z, digits 0-9, " ", "#", "&", "*", "$", ",", ".", "/".  Note
that slash and poundsign are part of the username, a comma is legal but not
recommended (in case the user wants to build a circuit from X.25 to TYMNET).

It also says that the dash "-" is ignored on aux circuits.  If you try to
build an aux circuit to "LINK-10", the sup ignores the hyphen, looks up the
name "LINK10", and completes the circuit.  If the username has a hyphen in
it, (such as "NTD-SECURITY"), then NOBODY can build an aux circuit to that
name (the sup says that "NTDSECURITY" is not in the MUD).

This is an interesting way to build usernames that not even AC license can
crack.					/

SUBJECT>   TELECO problem - follow up of call to Dennis Coffey on 10/8


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Special Interfaces Unit is experiencing a problem with TELECO
which is causing delays on a high-priority release of test software
promised this week to a customer.  When copying the source file
(BSCDEV:39)bbxsvv.rrr with TELECO, the resulting target file has a
different checksum.  The file being copied is an ASCII source file
which was built by concatenating a number of smaller files.  We have
done the following tests:
 
1.  Using a "gateway" statement to cause the file to be copied into
    another directory on 39, the source file is TELECOpied.  The
    checksum of the target file does not match, but a DIF (defaulted
    and with /BIN) show no differences encountered.  TELECO parameters
    were defaulted.
 
2.  The same test was done using /BINARY option with bytesize=7, left
                                                                Page  2

    fill, 5 bytes to a word.  We get the same results as in the first
    test (including the same checksums).
 
3.  The same test was done using /IMAGE option.  Again, the results
    are similar to "1" and "2", except that the target file checksum
    is different from the one that results from the first two tests.
 
NOTE:  Attempting to TELECO the result file from test 1 causes TELECO
to print the following message:
  "There are "holey" pages in your file.  Do you wish to proceed?"
We answer YES, and then TELECO seems to be in a loop, printing:
  "Holey page table not properly sent to the Donor - will try again."
 
The two files (from test 1) appear to have an equivalent assembly
output file (NIB); this is still being checked.  Even if this
workaround can be used, if it checks out, this is not acceptable for
software distribution, since it represents a lengthy procedure which
must be followed to verify that each target file is OK.
 
Please advise as soon as possible regarding solutions or other
alternatives.  Let me know if anything else is needed in addition to
this memo.  Linda Maurer of Special Interfaces will be following up on
this problem.

Subject: Found the source of the TELECOPY problem on B39. 

I tried many various commands, then discovered that there were two versions of
TELECOPY on the system.  Bad checksums occurred only when I typed "TELECOPY" or
"DO TELECOPY" instead of "R TELECOPY".  (FTSYS)TELECO.SAV dated 16-Apr-81,
version 21, is the culprit.  The correct version is in (SYS)TELECO.SAV, versi?, last modified in 1986.

I have deleted the obsolete version of TELECOPY from FTSYS.  Let me know if
this solves the problem.

     Bill, I have a user that is currently on the 940 using Super FORTRAN
and, as you must know, the 940's are going bye-bye.  I need to move this
user to the KL-10's.  Can you please let me know what differances, if any,
there are between the 940 and KL-10 versions of Super FORTRAN.  Also, will
there be any problem in moving this users files from the 940 to the KL-10?
I hate to put a rush on this, but I need to know this info asap.  Thanks.

Dennis, this is probably more appropriate for your group to answer, or
possibly somebody in IPC or ACS.  At any rate, I don't know anything about
SUPER FORTRAN except that the PDP-10 and 940 versions use the same manual
so they ought to be pretty similar.  There is always file naming problems.
Telecopy is probably the best way to move the files.  Please reply directly
to Jim and CC me.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: Update: spt. call answers. 

Carl,

   I've had a call or two.  I'm going to need you to answer them for me.
Here's the list:


1.)  MDC MIS in St. Louis, re. billing for the 10's, has a MAGCON problem,
since some ASCII characters have not EBCDIC equivalent.  The tapes being
created with MAGCON are getting some kind of error in conversion, resulting in
multiple characters in the ouput tape for one ASCII input character  (I
believe).  I have told the man in St. Louis that St. Louis MIS/Accounting must
decide what they want for EBCDIC representation for non-EBCDIC ASCII
characters.  We're going to have to modify MAGCON's conversion table for their
use (again!).  (Small world:  it's the same input data that I had trouble with
2 years ago!  This time the end user can get what he wants in conversion.)

Dale Reitzler, MIS Project Leader, is the one who wanted to know if MAGCON
pads out the last block.  Please give him the answer you gave me -- I ran a
test and confirmed what you had said.  It sure'nuff does.  He's O.K.  His
phone number is 314/233-5165.  He has Mark Nichols, from Cupertino, on site.


2.)  Frank Rodriguez, "Tymshare" MIS, Cupertino (X 6333), is having a problem
with an accounting program on C70 -- since the move from bldg.  A to C24's
hardware.  His problem is with (BILLING10)GETRTY.  [SHR & LOW]).  He's getting
a COBOL run-time error message ("MEMORY PROTECTION VIOLATION @ USER LOCATION
<nnnn> LIBOL ...").  I understand that the drives are Winchesters that were
just moved down the street.

Despite the fact that some other files on C70 got corrupted in the move, I
find no evidence that his object code file is corrupted (see (DENCOFF:62)
GETRTY.LOC -- number of words and cksum same as all other systems).  I'm
stumped, unless (sudden flash!)  file protection or license got changed in the
move.


3.)  JULIE MORK, Ranier Bank (S1051), is having a MAGNUM problem.  she's
getting the MAGNUM error message:  "DISK FULL OR QUOTA EXCEEDED FOR A
TEMPORARY INTERNAL FILE."  Too late to call her back, I realized that she's
probably doing a sort on a large data set.  Her problem occurs when she's
working with a MAGNUM relation called "SERVICE_HISTORY".  Here are the stats:
"Relation" contains 95962 records, occupying 3518 pages.
Username RBFMDA (sp?) is valid for 300,000 pages.
PSP command shows 29683 pages available.

She runs out of core when running a MAGNUM procedure "ZERO_YEAR_TO_DATE_
HISTORY", which does something with SERVICE_HISTORY.  That relation is the one
common factor to the failure.  She's probably doing some sorting on it.  The
one way to determine with certainty (that I can think of) to check on the
"running out of core" hypothesis is to be logged in, running SYSTAT with the
CONT switch while she's running her trouble causer.


That's all I can think of, right now.
/D.

Carl,
 
    I've done the other test you requested; this was a "vanilla"
TELECO between Bubbnet hosts 39 and 36 using defaults.  The results
are the same as what we saw with gateway copies (rocky road!).  Here's
a summary:
 
When copying original file from 39 to 39 using gateway statement:
    original file:  (BSCDEV:39)BBXSVV.RRR     checksum is JAQPEJ
    target file:    (EBUELL:39)BBXSVV.RRR     checksum is WUKBIJ
 
When copying original file from 39 to 36 - no gateway:
    original file:  (BSCDEV:39)BBXSVV.RRR     checksum is JAQPEJ
    target file:    (ANEWMAN:36)BBXSVV.RRR    checksum is WUKBIJ
In this case, this was the result of the second try.  The first
attempt aborted with the message:
    TRANSFER ABORTED DUE TO UNEXPECTED CONTROLLER CODE
 
    I appreciate your help on this.
 
Regards and thanks,
   Adele

Carl,

We found that if we "pulled" the files on System 39 to System 26, 
from the System 26 side, instead of "pushing" them from System 39,
that we could telecopy successfully.  This gives us a solution for
now, and, hopefully, gives you an additional clue to resolve the
problem.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: New version of TAUX on SPL. 

Version 21 outputs the name of the circuit when it is build and when it
is deleted.  It also restores the previous behavior where Control-G comes
out as BEEP instead of "^G" (so the bell from wrong OPER password comes
thru).  The switch character has been changed to ! since / and # are legal
in TYMNET names and/or sub-hosts.  See (SPL)TAUX.INF for more info.




			/Joe
Bill: We don't really need two versions of TAUX (on XEXEC and SPL) - one
should be deleted.  And since TAUX does not respond to CCL entry, the
comment referring to CTEST should be removed from TAUX.PUB.

Contact:  Dallas Operations, (214)637-7445, Greg, System 25.

Problem:  System 25 had been down the previous evening with disk or
          controller problems.  Joe was expecting to use the system for
          testing but was unable to have access until after 10 PM.  They
          has some minor problems which Joe talked them through when the
          system was brought up.  This call was to find out how to delete
          some files DSKCLN had marked as bad.  The file names were all
          jumbled punctuation characters with a few letters thrown in.

Solution: I checked the ribs and the UFD data pages for errors and found
          everything intact.  Then I renamed all the files except the bad
          ones into OSNF and deleted *.* to remove the weird file names.
          I restored the files to BASELINE and told operations to restore
          from the all-files and incrementals anything that was lost.

07-Nov-86 18:00/Carl
Contact:  Fremont Operations, (415)498-2588, System 74.

Problem:  System crashed with no CTY output during the ASP restore.

Solution: Initially told operations that there should be no reason that
          they could NOT continue the restore at the beginning of the
          current tape.  Talked to Osman and found that the reason for
          the rebuild was that they were having problems since the head
          crash earlier this week.  I called operations back and told
          them that it would be better to restart the restore from tape
          one, to insure that everything was in order.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

     As of this memo there are two pack copy programs. PAKCOP.SAV and
     PAKCP5.SAV.

     PAKCOP.SAV is the same old pack copy which we have been using on
     the Memorex 3675's and Ampex DM-331's. You must still use this 
     program when you work with 3675's and DM-331's, but there have been
     some enhancement added to it.

     PAKCP5.SAV is the new version which only works with the Memorex 
     3650 and 3652 disks which we have started to put on the PDP10's.

     Operationally, procedures of both program are the same as before.
     Only one command REFRESH, has been changed to ZFORMAT.

     If a 3650/3652 pack can not be ZFORMATed on the PDP10 because of
     a defective track, which must be done at least once when they are
     put on the PDP10 to work with TYMCOM-X operating system, defective
     track could be rewritten (fixed) under IBM/VM system using FIDS
     SA (Surface Analysis). This has been allready tested and proven to work.

     If there is any question feel free to give me a call at (415)794-2513
     or send mail to user name OSMAN on PDP10' or FSC.O/GUVEN on ONTYM.
     Thank You..

The hotline call for system D54 was a complaint that (SYS)RCHARG does not work.
Control-T shows that it is continually in the RN state, SYSTAT shows it has
no files open.  It has Control-C trapped, therefore the only way out of the
program is to turn off the terminal (zap the circuit).

Has this symptom been seen before?   /Joe

Kamoi-san,
 
I spoke to Dennis Coffey of X support, and Ed Roop of Resources today
about the PERP replacement situation.
 
1. Dennis and Ed were able to give us an extension on the PERP
conversion. However, this extension will be only until December 12, PST,
at which time PERP goes away.
 
The physical removal of the 940s will occur December 15, and Ed says that
they need the window between the 12th and the 15th for an orderly transition
and shutdown.
 
Note that this is a hard drop-dead date, and is showing up on the
bannner messages on hosts 34 and 57.
 
2. Dennis Coffey said that there is a possiblity that for some of the
users, we could handle the conversion by changing the command files on the
PDP-X, while leaving the hard-coded files on the intelligent terminals
the same as they are now.
 
Dennis can give us some help and advice on this, but we need to see examples
                                                                Page  2

in order to find out if this is feasible or not.
 
So, I'm asking you to send to me and to Dennis:
 
        A. Examples of the files that are hard-coded on the intelligent
        terminals;
 
        B. Examples of the corresponding command files on the PDP-X.
 
3. It would also help Dennis if we could have a list of the usernames and
associated host numbers of the customers who user PERP (USERNAME:NN).
 
4. To the best of your knowledge, do you have any customers located outside
of Japan who are using PERP? Do any of them have commands hard-coded in
the terminals?
 
5. Since December 12 is a true drop-dead date,
I recommend that you make the PERP-to-SUBMIT migration the
number one priority at KTL over the next few weeks. We cannot give you
any hope that PERP will be around after December 12.
 
Regards, Greg

Subject: Version 43 of PASSWORD 

I've made changes to PASSWORD as noted below.  The sources and supporting
files are in (WRS:62)PASSWO.* and are ready for QA and transmittal.  It
is currently running on systems 36 and 39 in Bubbnet.  This version will
not work in the public net until Jill releases the latest version of NETVAL
in the next couple weeks.  Since there is a significant security improvement
from this version, as well as improved user friendliness, it is strongly
suggested that its release be as expedient as possible.  Please let me
know if there is any way I can help.  Thanks -Bill

Differences between password version 40 and password version 43:

1. The user is now prompted for his network password.  This is done regardless
of which user's password is being changed.  The verifies that the person
running the password program is authorized to make the change and prevents
someone from walking up to a logged in terminal and changing the password.

2. Changes have been made to allow the program to work in BUBBNET.

3. Two new error messages have been added:
	PWBAD# = 18	?password not correct for user <>
	PWNTV# = 19	?command not implemented by NETVAL: <>

4. Security has been improved by providing an audit trail in the NETVAL
operator log.  The audit trail includes the host, node, port, and job
numbers and the user name making the change.  Also date and time in UTC.

Dennis, Carl,
 
1. For your information I am reproducing below A80625 from Hideo Nakano
of  KTL, concerning problems with reading an opnotice.
 
2. Dennis, you already have a related memo, A80680, from Tak Yasuma,
concerning some problems he ran into running SUBMIT tests.
 
3. In light of the short amount of time that we have, I'd like to make
soem suggestions to KTL that will really speed up our ability to help
you with this conversion:
 
A. Send all reports, etc., directly to Carl and Dennis, and copy me.
 
B. Rather than typing in excerpts of code in your Ontymes, let us know
the names and locations of the files that you are using, so that we can
look at the entire file.
 
C. Let us know which files we can actually run to SUBMIT jobs here,
without messing up anything in production systems.
 
Otherwise, tell us that the file should not actually be used at our
                                                                Page  2

end, but that we should only look at the code.
 
D. If you do give us access to files that we can try to use ourselves,
please let us know the login password for the userid where the file resides.
I am not sure if SUBMIT is sensitive to issues such as GFD vs. login,
differences in INIT files between userids, and differences in license
levels.
 
However, if we can do a true log-in to the userid you're using, we can
get as close as possible to the same environment that you have.
 
(Note: remember the BUGREP program? Nothing to stop you from using it.)
 
E. If you run into a reproducible problem, please try making a clean
reproduction of it using the (MPL)RECORD program. That way, we can
study the problem from your file first, and it will be easier for us
to try our own tests.
 
Thanks and regards, Greg

Do you know PERP driver hosts are scheduled to go away
on December 12 and the new Job Processor System, SUBMIT
is available on a TYMCOM-X?

We have still many user on the TYMCOM-X such as Marubeni,
A-AIS and .... Almost all of them are using PERP and PCOM
now. So we must convert to the Job Processor untill
December 12.

Today I tryed to test the Job Processor, but I could not 
have a good result.

After the Job was executed, I recieved the message
"[opnotice waiting]" at my terminal. However I could not
type out this message on my terminal.

I asked this problem to host(D34) operator and get the answer
as follows:

        At that point it just sat there apparently stuck. The only
problem that seems visable to me is the memory difference. The system
has 256K and the monitor expects 512K. But I did see something that
may get us later on. We use the RELOAD program to reload the system on
IPL and that pgm looks specifically for the (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV file NOT hte
NEWMON.SAV file. I am concerned that perhaps there are other dependancies
that we have not uncovered....I suggest we have a conference call and
discuss these...is the new monitor genned for 2 tape drives(TU45's) etc...

        Anyway let's get together and talk during the week of 12/1 & 12/5.

   From:    LEE CORBIN
 
   Subject: REQUIRED USERNAMES ON NEW PDP-10S
 
   Dennis,
 
      We have two categories of usernames on the PDP-10's:  one, userids
   that are required on all machines  to perform our basic software dis-
   tribution and validations support functions, and two, userids that we
   have traditionally  done our  development work on,  but which  do not
   need to be on more machines than just a few.
 
      Here is  the list of  category one  names, those that  we actually
   require on all machines.
 
        ARCHIVES       CUD10          QASYS
        VALDEV         USEVAL         SALTYRON
        SPPOPER        SSBACKUP       SSINSTALL
        SSPAMBIN       SSPAMSYM       SSPERP
        SYSNEWS        TAPELIB        *6NEWS
        SRATECH        SRAVAL         SRA
 
 
      Three of these names, QASYS, SYSNEWS,  and *6NEWS, I have not been
   able to completely verify the need for.   I have been assured by oth-
   ers here that they are probably essential.  I'll be able to determine
   their status soon, and  I'll let you know if we're  able to drop them
   from this list.
 
      There are  also many names which  are clearly necessary  but which
   don't exactly fall into our  jurisdiction.  SSPERP, for example, will
   probably be claimed by  someone else.  But in cases like  this, it is
   better to have overlap than to miss some essential userid.
                                                         yours,   Lee

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lee, thanks for your complete and timely reply.  Regarding the usenames
still in question, I can say that SYSNEWS and *6NEWS are necessary.  I
cannot speak for QASYS, except that I believe it contains programs that
Ingrid uses.

Which brings up another issue:  I have learned since we talked that I
also need a list of necessary programs and data files.  To make the
meaning of "necessary" clear, let it be defined as:  used during the
regular course of business during a month.

The purpose of this 'survey' of the people who support the Tymcom-X
systems is to get a 'bare-bones' definition of a Tymcom-X host.  We can
thus save much disk space, and bring up any new host 'clean'.  I know
you, particularly, can appreciate that.

                            Thanks much for your support in this effort,

                            Dennis

    Here is the list of nodes that I said I would send you.  These are the
Tymnet-I node numbers referenced by the SPOOL program.

    There should be a Tymnet-II node number for each of these nodes, if the
node was converted to Tymnet-II.  The evolution from the listed node number to
the Tymnet-II node number might not be direct, but might be through other node
numbers.

    To keep SPOOL working properly, we must have accurate node numbers.

SUBJ:  SPOOL's current limitation to Tymsat node numbers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As discussed in our telephone conversation, the SPOOL program on the
SDS-940's and the PDP-10's cannot cope with Tymsat numbers greater than
3776 <octal>.  If a user logs in to his host from a Tymsat with a node
number greater than this limit and attempts to have a file listing
printed on a fast line printer through use of the SPOOL program, the
program cannot associate his logged-in Tymsat with a printer location.

This limitation is historically due to the binary word size of the
Tymcom-IX hosts.  These hosts have a 24-bit word size.  The file used by
the SPOOL program on both types of hosts associates the Tymsat number in
one half-word with the printer location number in the other half of the
word.  This limits the Tymcom-IX's to a maximum of 11 bits (3776 octal)
to encode node numbers, since the last bit is used to differentiate
in-house users from customer users.

The SPOOL program on the Tymcom-X hosts was written assuming that this
limit would not ever cause a problem, and thus did not leave memory bits
in the program available for expanding the range of node numbers.  One
bit in the Tymcom-X hosts' program can be "scrounged" to increase the
range of node numbers available to SPOOL to a maximum of 7776 <octal>.
Doing so would make Tymcom-IX SPOOL unable to directly assign a printer
for users of these nodes, would require re-writing some of Tymcom-X
SPOOL and re-formatting its data file (initially about 1 week's work),
and would regular manual updating of the data file on the Tymcom-X's
which associates node numbers with the line printers.

The updating of this data file is currently done by SRA, using a program
on host 8 (a 940) then distributed to all IX's and X's by the PJ system,
who's driver is on host 8.  Migrating this updating program to a Tymcom-
X would require about two weeks' work.  The automated distribution of
this file to all Tymcom-X's would require migrating the PJ system's
driver program to a Tymcom-X host:  about one month's work.

There is a "kludge" around this problem:  the current limitation can be
side-stepped with a little effort on the part of the user.  Any time his
logged-in Tymsat is not in the list of Tymsats associated with line
printer locations, he can run the program SPNODE (1) which gives a list
of node numbers associated with each printer location.  When he submits
a SPOOL request, he then provides SPOOL with the number of a node
associated with the line printer of choice, over-riding the default to
his logged-in Tymsat as the node number which the SPOOL program uses to
choose the printer.

Another "patch" around this problem is swapping node numbers so that
each Tymsat to be associated with a printer location has a node number
less than 3777.

As of our conversation, this node number limit has not been a problem.

**************************
Dennis,  this information is NOT true.  I think that you got a few
things a little confused in putting this into a memo.  The limit is
7777 not 3777 in the monitor, but is 3777 in SPOOL.  I said we could
scrounge for another bit in the monitor making it 17777, but there
is no reason why SPOOL couldn't change....

David,

    I hope our conversation about UNDELE and DELETE/ACCESS <date> has
been helpful.  We will review the request for the modificaton to DELETE
when we receive it.

    A quick summary of what we spoke about, re. BATCH:

1.)  the BATCH operator's terminal will NOT expand tabs;
2.)  long lists of files, etc., should be placed in an EDITOR created
	file which the BATCH request references, for the operator to
	read.  this solves two problems:  the line editor expands tabs
	into eight blanks, to effectively tab over in a form that the
	old-fashioned teletype terminals can read, and the person using
	the line editor can manually justify the columns.

    The use of an EDITOR file has three advantages:
1.)  the buffer size limitation of the BATCH message is no longer a
	problem;
2.)  the line editor does not place tabs (^I) into the output file
	(tabs are not expanded by the operator's terminal, causing his
	listing of the BATCH request to jam all the columns together),
	but immediately expands all tabs into consecutive blanks; and
3.)  the editor is MUCH easier to use than the VERY limited editing
	capabilities of BATCH.  

Note:  Use of the EDITOR to create the listing file should be done
before submitting the BATCH request, so the file will be available to
the operator immediately upon his receipt of the BATCH request.  The
BATCH request and the EDITOR file should both contain some cross-
reference information; e.g.:  (in BATCH request:)  "Please restore <n>
files, as listed in file <filename> to directories <usernames>"; (in
file:)  "Information for BATCH request by <name of person doing BATCH
request>, on <date>:  . . .  ".

Carl,

I've looked at (HELGEM:62) SUPCHK.WOK, and at the SUPCHK.SAI in
(SUBMIT:33)SUPCHK.FDM.  I did a DIFF on the SUPCHK.WOK & SUPCHK.SAI files in
(HELGEM:62).  There is no significant difference between the 2 versions, in
the 'CheckMail' routine.  

I looked at the 'CheckMail' routine.  I have seen some possible problems.
That routine has some code I don't understand.  (Of course, that may be due to
the level of my knowledge of SAIL.)

Operations tells me that SUPCHK performs the 'something wrong' loop in the
CheckMail routine every 15 minutes, since Bill's patch to RPG MAIL.

I got real tired of getting mail returned from people who never read their
new mail.  40 disk pages from OPER:33 to be exact.  So, I made a little
two instruction change to RPG to fix this problem.  Simply, it does a
RUN on (SYS)RDMAIL before doing OUTSTR ["NO MAIL"].  Its very simple, it
won't hurt anything, and it will save me a great deal of grief.  Please,
I beg of you, transmit it as soon as possible, if not sooner.  The source
is in (MPL:62) with backups in RPG.155 and RPGMAI.155.  Thanks -Bill

PS - I know its not the ultimate solution, but I think its an adaquate
migration path until something better comes along.  Please!

This is pretty much what I had called you about yesterday afternoon.  I
believe I have found another possible route to fix your "message returned
because mail not read in 30 days" problem.  

The data centers use a program (SUPCHK) to monitor all OPER mail, all BATCH
requests, etc., on all hosts in their data center.  The program would not be
difficult to change, to enable it to run RDMAIL.  

This would take care of the problem of TUMS mail not read by OPER.  It would
not take care of other users, though.  Maybe we should leave things as they
are.  What do you think?

Subject: The new PDP-10 bases need to be validated. 

Whenever new hardware is assigned to be used as a PDP-10 system, we in TXS
need to be notified as early as possible to modify the configuration files,
and Validations need to be notified so that the new base can be added to the
class of PDP-10 bases.  Failure to do this can cause problems for any of our
customers that need to build aux circuits.

I noticed this problem when I tried to build a circuit to CUD10:930 from the
new KL in Solar Way.  Its base, node 10350, was not in the group and class
list that CUD10 is valid for.

There was not much of a problem when C70 moved from Cup-A to Cup-C since it is
the backup for the private nets and is not used much.  But I see the potential
for severe problems when C22 is moved to the hardware with a new base node.

If what I fear is true, then all of the private net users can log in to F22,
but none of them can build circuits out.  They will not be able to get LOADII
or NAD to build a circuit to their private nodes.  And since C70 is running on
a relatively new base, it is possible they won't be able to C70 either.

Subject: C22 F22 Information 

Joe, Osman,...
   To add to the morass of confusion...  for what appeared to be no reason
at all, system 22's accounting device was released at 3:20am and the system
went to BOOTS.  Fremont OPS forced a FULL DSKCLN at 3:35 and attempted to
bring the system back up.

   Apparently, CUPC OPS must have take the system down, because around that
time they were starting to do the ASP rebuild of system 22 in CUPC and the
operator forgot about F22 (and since the packs say the same thing, C22 at
the moment there must have been some confusion).   Anyway, CUPC OPS forgot
to do a CHANGE SYS and came up as C22 (after taking F22 down!) and began the
ASP restore.  C22 is on hardware AA base node 2100!

    F-22 finished full DSKCLN sometime between 4:15ish and 4:45ish when OPS
called the hotline because they couldn't login to F22 even though the CTY
said that DSKCLN was completed.  They complained that it told them it was
shut.  (I believe that this information came from probe).

    I tried to login to 22 and got what appeared to be a super-shut system.
OPS reassured me that DSKCLN sait it was done and initialization completed.
I asked OPS to tell me more of what happened.  I went in with probe to check
on 22 and it said SHUT and up on node 2100.  I asked OPS what node F22 was
on and they said 3374.  Hmmmm!  I asked them to check and the base itself
was flashing 3374 they told me.

  I logged in to 930 and printed the conf file and it said 3374, but very
nicely (thank you joe or osman) commented out was hardware 'AA' node 2100!
I then explainded that I thought 22 must have been brought up in CUPC.  I
called BLDG-C OPS and Tom told me they were doing an ASP restore and they
were on the third tape.  I had him check, and apparently the operator had
forgotten to do a CHANGE SYS.  >>ARRRRGH<<<  Tom said he'd have them stop
the ASP and start over after bringing the system back up with a CHANGE SYS.

  I called fremont OPS back and told Lynn that my suspicions were correct.
OPS in CUPC had come up on the net with C22 and that was why F22 went away.
I suspect that CUPC logged in to F22, saw that it said C22 and took it
down... that explains why F22 went down without Fremont OPS knowing about
it, and C22 up on the net SHUT explains why F22 would not come into the
network answered.

  F22 came back up at 5:12 and ran a FAST DSKCLN and was up answered by
5:20 am.  C22 is up as "12 SHUT 0 IIX-N EBUS SLOT# 1" and all is well in
the world.

  (except that I've lost another hour of sleep and both my wife and I
   were awakened unnecessarily.. sigh)

action is neccessay to insure these nodes are set up correctly, i e. in
the correct GROUP TABLE and MAGNUM Data bases.

For your information System 33 will be coming up on NODE 2333 the weekend
of 30 January 1987.  It is presently on NODE 6415.

Users on these systems must be able to build aux circuits to and from these
Systems.

The two new NODES in Fremont ND 3374 and ND 10350 are here.  If Vialidations

Subject: Bug in TELECO/AUXMOX - dies after TALK ALL. 

At 20 minutes before 10pm, AUXMOX stopped working on system 55.  It died
again, 10 minutes before 10pm.  I was watching with SYSTAT CONT:30.  It
was receiving 5 pages per 30 seconds up until the message "System going
down in 10 minutes" showed up on my screen.  Then it hung for about 5
minutes, not receiving any data.  About that time TELECO on 930 gave up
waiting and aborted.  AUXMOX should have requested that TELECO re-transmit
the last packet.  Bug.

Subject: Product distribution proposal 

In the past, there have been various schemes to push files around to
one or more systems in order to keep software versions up to date.  Some
of these schemes involved people time to verify that the system was up
and running, that the proper software was being distributed, that the
proper license and protection were propagated and... and... and...

Most of these systems were too time intensive to work without someone
keeping track of what was happenning.  All of these systems relied on the
distribution of products from the source system to each of the destination
systems.  Most of these systems have fallen into disuse and much of what is
now running on our systems is not properly supportable.

I would like each of you to think about the ramifications of a replacement
distribution system that relies on pulling the software from the source
system automatically whenever it detects a discrepancy between the released
version of the product and the available version.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------

In thinking over the new SETOP database which will be centralized on one
host and how the individual changes would be distributed, some rather new
and obvious solutions came to mind.  If it was the responsibility of each
host to update it's OPER database, all changes could be marked on the
central system whose only responsibility would be to notify the outlying
systems that they needed to pull an update.

This same idea could be utilized in a software product distribution scheme
where product information is kept in one or more centralized places with
proper authorization for license and access to specific directories.  Each
individual system would have a similar "stripped-down" database which has
only the information needed by that system.  This individual database would
be updated by authorized users (or programs) whenever a new release is made.
The master database would have copies of the information for verification
and tracking purposes (including an audit trail).

Periodically, an XEXEC subjob would check to see that the software on the
system matched the database.  Any discrepancies would generate a separate
subjob to re-install the proper software with the correct license, protection
and checksums.  Mail would be sent to the appropriate authorized users for
any action taken (eg. Changing license or protection, restoring the file
from the source, requesting the file from the latest backup, etc).

The hierarchy of authorized users could be product managers, operations,
security people and the like.  I've begun to put together a list of needed
information about products, people and systems and I would appreciate
greatly any comments on the idea.

Since the security aspect is linked into the new SETOP, I will be making
my initial concentration in that area (two stones with one bird).

Carl,
  I like your idea!  I'm quite impressed!  I think it will be a fantastic way
of keeping software current.  I see the following potential advantages:
* Automated -- much less human intensive (as you mentioned).
* It could be implemented without humongous effort ("two stones with one
  bird", as you said).
* it could keep things current, even when new versions are accidently replaced
  by older versions from backups.  (I think this happens all too often.)
* It can be elegant in its power, reliability and simplicity of use.

Rick,

  The execution failure of SLIFAC's PCOM job is probably a one-of-a-kind
failure, caused by some system glitch.  If it is caused by PCOM, I can provide
no information about its cause, with the information currently available to
me.  I need to know much more of the details about the PCOM job:

	1.)  the name of the PCOM command file;
	2.)  the name of the log file produced by the aborted job's execution;
	3.)  the date and time of the aborted execution;
	4.)  exactly when during the job's execution the ab-end occurred; 
	5.)  the location of any system rfecord of the aborted execution, and
	6.)  exactly how the unusual (aborted) execution differed in
appearance from the normal executions.

  This is the information which would be most helpful in finding the cause of
the problem, from among that which is most likely to be available.  If the
user needs to know the cause of the failure, the requested information is
necessary.  However, we do not promise that this information is sufficient to
diagnose the problem.

Sincerely,
Dennis Coffey, Tymcom-X Systems

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2558, System F33.
Problem:  Front-end 11 died, tried to run TAKEIT to bring system down, but
          CHKPNT was stuck with JACCT on (it was waiting for the SETUUO to
          finish typing on the CTY which was not responding).
Solution: Logged in, tried to set license to use MDDT, but got stuck in ML
          because CHKPNT was stuck.  Told them to get FSC to try to clear the
          PDP11 that KLDCP could deposit nonzero in 30.  Else power off KL.

Subject: Can't load micronet from D57 anymore. 

Help!  System 57 went away.  Right now we have absolutely no way to reload
6657 if it goes down.  We can't use NODLOD on 930 because it's 930's base.
We can't use NODLOD from 95 because routing from 6760 to 2346 is not working.
We can't use LOADII from 57 now that it's gone.  We can't use LOADII from 39
because of passwords thru the gateway.  We would like to use LOADII from 95
but it is not authorized to do so.

Could you go through channels and get LOADII working for us on system 95?
And as a backup, get NEW11 validated on F26 and D31 (since our micronet is
sort of a private net)?

Cheryl,

  You are right:  the job had run to completion.  It has requeued itself.  The
run is completely normal.  Everything is as it should be.
  The mention of the ending as "abort" when the command file reaches the
"QUIT" command is a "minor" bug.  (The bug is minor in that it doesn't
interfere with the proper running of the job, but we admit it does "lie" to
the users, scaring them.)  
  We are about to release a version with several things fixed or enhanced,
including this bug.  In the interim, please accept that this "abort" message
that gives no reason really means normal termination.

Regards,
Dennis

Cheryl,

  I neglected to tell you in my previous OnTyme, that you can check the status
of a job and, when necessary, requeue the job yourself.  It's easy.  

  Log in to TQ:35, then give the "SUBMIT", "LIST ...", and (if needed)
"REQUEUE" commands.  The following is a sample session, with comments
interjected and set off with square brackets.  User input is in lower case, in
response to the hyphen prompt or the "SUBMIT>" prompt, and is underlined.


        -submit
         ------
        TYMCOM-X Job Processor  %1(205)  16-Jun-87 12:10:58

[ The following command gives all needed info about the job's status: ]

        SUBMIT> list bldinx *

[ If the job's "Next Run" is not in the future, and/or the "Status" is not
"Queued-Wait" but is "Abort ...", the job must be requeued, with the following
command.  Otherwise, you can just "QUIT" from SUBMIT. ]

DATE: June 22 1987 


Dennis,

I spoke with Sandy about the nodes we would like to pull Bubbnet spool
requests off of and she said that nodes 2154 and 2031 would be the best.
Her reasoning was that there is currently a print station hanging off of
node 2154, and that once we get in the new building node 2031 would have
the print station connected to it. I don't know what sort of modifications
that this would involve to get the system 39spool requests to print
remotely at either one of these nodes, nor do I know if it is possible.
If you have any questions, comments or tests
that you would like run please call 446-7062 or send me an ontyme ntd.d/hopkins.
                                               thank you

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

SUBJ:  A new, more reliable way to run the ALERT program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jeff,

  The following method should work for you.  It will automatically restart
your ALERT program at system startup, and every hour, if ALERT is not running.
If your ALERT program is running at the time SUBMIT tries to run it, a new
execution of your ALERT program will not be started.  (This is done with the
default setting of the UNIQUE option of the Job Processor system).  

  We did not offer you this option before, because we were initially concerned
that the Job Processor system could run out of jobs.  Now that we have some
experience with it, we know that this is not an immediate problem.

  The plan is:

1.)  Notify me, and I will give you file (NETALERT)AALERT.CTL, on host 25.

2.)  Run SUBMIT:
        a.) delete jobs ALERT and ALERTT;
        b.) enter a new job AALERT, by using the following commands to INSERT:
                DATE EVERY 1 HOUR REFERENCE 00:00
                INSERT AALERT.CTL
                <cr>
                TIMELIMIT 10
                MAIL ERROR
                <cr>
        c.) QUIT out of SUBMIT.

3.)  You can now eliminate file (NETALERT:25)ALERTT.CTL.

4.)  TELECOPY file AALERT.CTL to (NETALERT) on the other hosts.

5.)  Do steps "2." and "3." on the other hosts, with the following change to
the DATE line:
        a.) one of the other hosts:
                DATE EVERY 1 HOUR REFERENCE 00:20
        b.) the lasst host:
                DATE EVERY 1 HOUR REFERENCE 00:40



  The file AALERT.CTL contains the following commands to the Job Processor
system:
        .submit
        *insert alert.shr
        *
        *timelimit 0
        *mail error
        *restart start
        *detach
        *
        *q


  The Job Processor job, AALERT, runs SUBMIT to insert a job to run the ALERT
program, to start just one execution, immediately.  If ALERT is already
running, the UNIQUE option in the job ALERT prevents the Job Processor system
from starting ALERT again.  If ALERT starts and finds ALERT running from
another host it will quit and log off this host.

  If AALERT doesn't successfully complete the SUBMIT job to enter ALERT,
within 10 minutes, AALERT will go away.  (ALERTT should never take more than 4
minutes to complete, so 10 minutes is plenty of time.)  This time limit will
open up a job slot in the Job Processor system, a job slot which would
otherwise be tied up with the hung-up AALERT job.  This will also free up the
JOB name (NETALERT)ALERTT, so it can be re-run at the next hour's execution
time.

  If you have any questions, please call.

Subject: Running D56 with 200. ports 

Joe ..

Do you see any problem running D56 with 200 ports.??
D56-P035/C is cut with 200 ports and ready come up with it, right?
Roy R. is asking us to come up with 200 port monitor first and
after couple of days, he will have network reload the base code
which is cut for 200 port.

56XB03.SAV, 56XB04.SAV, 56XB08.SAV, 56XB10.SAV, and 56035C all have 200
ports.  56XB03.SAV is dated 6-May, we tested it, but never bothered to put
it on NEWMON.  Suggest running 56035C instead.

Subject: 56035C rebuilt for JOBS=160 (as well as PORTS=200). 

System 56 is currently running a monitor with 128 jobs and 128 ports.
If there are more jobs using two ports each (such as LOADII, TELECO, AUXIO, etc)
than there are jobs detached (CHKPNT, PAM, XEXEC, etc), then the system will
run out of ports before it runs out of job slots.  When this occurs, the SUP
will tell the CONSAT output the message "host out of ports" as the reason for
failure of the login request.

Back in May, we boosted PORTS to ^D200.  That by itself would allow about 3
more jobs to get logged in, and then SCNSER will have to output the message
"frame capacity exceeded" when all 127 jobs were in use.  That would not
really solve the problem.  Therefore I have boosted JOBS to ^D160.  CONF56.MAC
has been updated in (M33:930,:34,:33) and (OSP:33), and the new 56035C.SAV
copied to (M33:56).

Setting JOBS=160 and PORTS=200 should keep them happy for a while.  I would
expect the KL to get bogged down before they exceed 159 jobs.

Subject: Removing license from NAD. 

(SYS)NAD.SAV has Write Files license.  This is a very serious security breach.
I ran a test and verified that this allows unprivileged users destroy accountingdata, the oper password file, and anything else they want to.  If no-one comes
up with a valid reason not to within 24 hours, I will remove WF from all copies
of NAD.

Subject: Autologout .. 

=======================================================================

From: UPTHEGROVE
Date: JULY 29,1987 12:13
G'day!

I'm trying to investigate using the AUTOLOGOUT feature for
some of international customers.  Twice I have entered
SET AUTOLOGOUT, and waited 15 minutes for logoff.  At exactly
15 minutes, system 37 has crashed.

On the PDP-10, I am UPTHEGROVE, and there is an init file,
(UPTHEGROVE)INIT.SAI, which may, or may not, contribute.

My ONTYME is ISITPR.D/UPTHEGROVE.  I would like to know what you find out.  

I could sure use the autologout feature, especially if possible
to use at init time.

Best regards,  Dan

=======================================================================

	I tested on X95 and X930, it work correctly w/o crashing system.
Steve Atwell said, he tried on D37 and worked correctly also.  So there
might be something unique to network node he is originated and/or pass-
through nodes he is coming to D37.  I will follow up on this and find
out under what circumtances problem could be duplicated.

Subject: D37 crashes fixed. 

You can delete all the previous messages about the crashes on D37 from the
inactivity timer.  The real problem is that INTKIL.PAT was not applied to
any of the /B, /B-1, /B01, or /B04 monitors inDallas.  The only system that
had the patch was D55.  SYSTEM.SAV has been patched now.  /Joe
