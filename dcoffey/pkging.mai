      The following documents the proposed upgrade(s) of the operating system
software which we would like to install on the CEGI systems and system 90.
  

      Program Name:  SETOP.SAV
      Current Version:  14
      New Version:  20

      Comments:

New version provides greater security.  This version has been on one system
for 18 months.
Note that passwords must conform to new standards.
This is only for system 90.

      Changes between versions:

Version 20:  enforces the new TYMNET password standard of an embedded
non-alphabetic character.  The new Validations psuedo-license is added.

version 17:  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.
Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

      Program Name:  OPPS.SAV
      Current Version: 3
      New Version:  4

      Comments:
This version on one system for 2 years.  New password standard enforced.  This
will installed only on system 90.

Changes between versions:
version 4:
  Adds new TATTLE record to provide audit trail of all operations.
  Adds restrictions to enforce new password standard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Program Name:  TITO.SAV
      Current Version: 15.13
      New Version:  16.3

      Comments:
New error messages are provided.  This version on systems for 2 years.  No
changes affect MAGNUM, and larger files can now be stored.  (This version is
already on 90 and 184.)

      Changes between versions:

      Version 16.2:
This version again changes the code associated with setting the file "dumped"
bit to check the monitor version against P034/K16 to determine whether to use
CLOSE FIL,DMP or to continue using the code installed in versions 15.14 &
16.1.  [Introduced module GETVER.MAC]

      Version 16.1:
This version changes the code associated with setting the file dumped bit.
The "Exclusive ENTER" was a "no-no".  It cloberred license on files with more
license than most operators have.  Fix was to comment out the "ENTER".

      Version 16.0:
This version fixes the problem TITO had with counting blocks from zero "0"
instead of one "1" for very large files when they had to extend across three
or more tapes.

      Version 15.14:
This version implements the following reliability enhancements:
  o Permit files greater than <1 reel> + 65,536 pages to be stored.
  o Ignore UFDs with GANs greater than 377777.
  o Compare lookup blocks before and after on a STORE ALL CHANGED to
    only set the DUMPED bit if they match, thus preventing truncation.
  o Let OPER know if NSF or BDA set on a file and which one it is.

New error messages:
  o NEW FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.
  o MISSING FILE ... NOT MARKED AS DUMPED.
  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED DO NOT DUMP.
  o FILE NOT DUMPED ..., MARKED BAD ON DISK.

     The following documents the proposed upgrade(s) of the operating system
software which we would like to install on system 169.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program Name: DIRIT  
      Current Version:  33
      New Version:  33.1

      Comments:
Minor code change to delete a bug.  No visible change to any users.  Has been
on at least one other system for 3 years without problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program Name:  UNDELE

      Comments:

We would like to install this program and provide the documentation which is
currently available to other users.  This program has been used in its two
versions for more than 3 years (second version released Mar 1984).

I am enclosing a copy of the file UNDELE.DOC which is the file which explains
the use of this command, and is installed in the system to provide user
documentation.  The user may also type the /HELP switch while using the
command UNDELETE to receive information on possible options.  

-------
"UNDELETING" FILES

     The UNDELETE command will restore a file that has been deleted
during the current login or gfd session, if the UNDELETE ability has
been enabled. 

     The general form of the UNDELETE command is

   -UNDELETE [file identifier1,file identifier2...] [switches]

file identifier    Specify the file(s) to be restored.  The usual wild
                   cards can be used (#, *, "ALL").

     If no file identifier is specified, all files deleted during the
present login or gfd session are restored.  

     When UNDELETE is enabled, all files that are deleted can be
recovered until the user either logs out or gfd's to another directory.
UNDELETE is enabled by giving the command

   -UNDELETE/ENABLE

and disabled by the command

   -UNDELETE/DISABLE

Both enabling and disabling remain in effect until they are changed,
and do not need to be typed at the beginning of each session.

     The UNDELETE command switches are:

  Switch                        Function

/LIST               List all files that have been deleted.

/RECOVER            Recover specified files, or all.  (default)

/PURGE              Expunge specified files; they cannot then be restored.

/SELECT             Select action to take for a list of files,
                    or rename a single specified file.

/ENABLE             Enable UNDELETE capability.

/DISABLE            Disable UNDELETE capability.

/BEGIN              Enter UNDELETE program.

/FAST               List only filename, extension and success message.

/?                  Type the on-line help message.


     If a user attempts to recover a file when another file by the
same name exists, UNDELETE will give the error message 

    "**ALREADY EXISTING FILE!**"

If this occurs the user can then use the /SELECT switch to rename the
file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the new name for the file.

     /SELECT can be used with a list of files to select the action to
take for each file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the action to take.
Responses, and their results are:

  Response               Action

  Control-R          Recover this file with the old name.
   <CR>              Skip this file, do not recover.
  Control-D          Expunge this file; it cannot then be recovered.
  name Control-R     Recover this file and rename it to "name".
  name <CR>          Recover this file and rename it to "name".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      Program Name:  CHKPNT
      Current Version: 30.2
      New Version:  30.3

      Comments:
A fairly minor change which insures that accounting data will be written even
when the "debug" switch is set.  This could prevent the loss of revenue
information in the event of a crash.  There would be no apparent changes to
users.

      Changes between versions:
The following is the programmer's information log which records the changes
between versions.

30.3    /TODD  10-21-82: Previous versions of CHKPNT did not write 
        records because debug switch was on.  Fixed this so that we 
        charge for interrupted sessions.

SUBJ:	I have a copy of Fayez Sarofim's contract

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

For your information:  I have, through some research, obtained a copy of
our contract with Fayez.  You have been quite right:  we are contracted
to provide them with software support.  We will do so with as much speed
as is possible, considering the amount of research involved.  

We believe that Fayez is planning to soon change to MAGNUM on a VAX
machine.  If so, they may now be somewhat resistant to changing software
that they have grown quite familiar with--this is the case with our
other 2020 customers.  We recognize that this does not mean they will
not expect software support for their VAX, when delivered.  We are and
will be willing and able to provide them with contracted support.

I hope this memo indicates our clearer understanding of our support
responsibilities.  If I am wrong about their plans to move to a VAX, I
would appreciate clarification.  

Thanks!

Subject: Qs. re. a couple of utilities. 

1.)  SYSTAT:  version on hosts is 61.6 (we think--result of VER on
program is "470061 021006"); and object code's files license varies:
most have WC HF, but a couple vary.  Do you know anything about 61.6
(not in archives, last archived is 61.5), and do you know what license
should be set on the file on all hosts?)

(Last transmittal we can find is for ver. 61.5.  Last ver.
found in ARCHIV data base is 61.3.)


2.)  (MPL)ICP:  What is proper protection:  AL RD RD, ALL RD NO or ALL
RUN RUN?  (This differs from host to host.)  What is proper license to
be set:  RC HF RF, RC HF R or WC RF HF?  (also differs host to host.)
Program not archived, transmittal not found.

3.)  (SRAUTIL)FTICP:  do we do anything with it?  Who would we contact
about this program (not in transmittal data base nor in our file
cabinet)?

4.)  DSKMAP:  no transmittals found; ver.  in transmittal data base is
1.1, version report by VER command on hosts is 2.56 ("032002 000056").
Do you know anything about sources, etc. for this one?

5.)  (SPL)SY:  apparently not transmitted:  nothing found in transmittal
data base or file cabinet.  Various checksums for .SAV file, but ver.
is consistent at 2.72.  Protection varies between ALL RD NO & ALL RUN
RUN.  License varies between:  none, RC SY and SY RF.  What do you know,
or where can I learn about this one?


Whether these operating system-related informational utilities are for
"general" use or for our section, Craig wants them archived and
transmitted to the hosts so they will be consistent for us and all
users.  Any of the above requested information will help us in doing
this.

	Thanks!

Subject: Operating System PACKAGEs: (SPL) & (MPL) Software 

Craig,

   Carl recommends that programs currently in the SPL directory (System
software section Program Library) and the MPL directory (Monitor unit
Program Library) be packaged as a separate set of packages.  After
discussion with him I see his point.  I'd like to discuss this with you;
we are currently packaging some of these 'subsidiary operating system-
related utilities' with more intrinsically operating system-related
software.

thanks,
Dennis

Ingrid,

    I am checking with CEGI-Tymshare re. the installation of the
programs in the package onto host 90.  (I gave you some mis-information
about who is responsible for the host:  90 is in France--CEGI--while the
local development machine is 95.)

    I will give you an answer about installation of the software on 90
when I hear back from Peter Stratman.  I will also ask him about giving
you license on 90 for your installations.  I will let you know whether
you will be getting license, and will let you know when you have it on
90.

We can't find any sources for this program, anywhere.  Do you know where

Another item:  I've talked with Craig, and we have concurrence about the
'packaging' of SPL programs completely seperate from the SYS programs.
In fact, he agrees with all your suggestions that I passed along to him
(which were all that I could remember).

Dennis,
  re: BOOTS.DMP ... I'm not sure, the whole BOOT mechanism is a mess on
                    the TYMCOM-X systems. ...mostly no documentation. I
                    or someone will have to research it.
  re: SYSTAT documentation probably stops at the point when they last
                    decided they had time to document what they had done
                    other than in the transmittal documentation.

  who to ask?  not to be facetious, but I'll give you the answer that
               was given to me when I asked what to do when I got this
               message "please see your tymshare representative"

  YOU are your tymshare representative...  YOU are the person to ask
  about finding out information about SYSTAT and why,where,who,etc. for
  any documentation...

Yes, I know... sigh!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     We are currently involved in upgrading and making current various
programs related to or part of the TYMCOM-X operating system.  These changes
are being implemented in groups/packages of related programs, eg.:  those
determining a session in the system (LOGINN, GFD); setting master license
(SETOP, OPPS); processing commands to the operating system (LISTER, LOADER,
RPG); etc.

     Please make certain these changes are acceptable to the customer, and
notify us of their acceptance.  We strongly recommend/request that you
convince the customerof the value of these cost free upgrades:  these newer
versions will be consistent with the software on the Tymshare PDP-10's, and
earlier versions will not remain supported.

     The following documents the proposed upgrade(s) of the operating system
software which we would like to install on system 169.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program Name: DIRIT  
      Current Version:  33
      New Version:  33.1

      Comments:
Minor code change to delete a bug.  No visible change to any users.  Has been
on at least one other system for 3 years without problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Program Name:  UNDELE

      Comments:

We would like to install this program and provide the documentation which is
currently available to other users.  This program has been used in its two
versions for more than 3 years (second version released Mar 1984).

I am enclosing a copy of the file UNDELE.DOC which is the file which explains
the use of this command, and is installed in the system to provide user
documentation.  The user may also type the /HELP switch while using the
command UNDELETE to receive information on possible options.  

-------
"UNDELETING" FILES

     The UNDELETE command will restore a file that has been deleted
during the current login or gfd session, if the UNDELETE ability has
been enabled. 

     The general form of the UNDELETE command is

   -UNDELETE [file identifier1,file identifier2...] [switches]

file identifier    Specify the file(s) to be restored.  The usual wild
                   cards can be used (#, *, "ALL").

     If no file identifier is specified, all files deleted during the
present login or gfd session are restored.  

     When UNDELETE is enabled, all files that are deleted can be
recovered until the user either logs out or gfd's to another directory.
UNDELETE is enabled by giving the command

   -UNDELETE/ENABLE

and disabled by the command

   -UNDELETE/DISABLE

Both enabling and disabling remain in effect until they are changed,
and do not need to be typed at the beginning of each session.

     The UNDELETE command switches are:

  Switch                        Function

/LIST               List all files that have been deleted.

/RECOVER            Recover specified files, or all.  (default)

/PURGE              Expunge specified files; they cannot then be restored.

/SELECT             Select action to take for a list of files,
                    or rename a single specified file.

/ENABLE             Enable UNDELETE capability.

/DISABLE            Disable UNDELETE capability.

/BEGIN              Enter UNDELETE program.

/FAST               List only filename, extension and success message.

/?                  Type the on-line help message.


     If a user attempts to recover a file when another file by the
same name exists, UNDELETE will give the error message 

    "**ALREADY EXISTING FILE!**"

If this occurs the user can then use the /SELECT switch to rename the
file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the new name for the file.

     /SELECT can be used with a list of files to select the action to
take for each file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the action to take.
Responses, and their results are:

  Response               Action

  Control-R          Recover this file with the old name.
   <CR>              Skip this file, do not recover.
  Control-D          Expunge this file; it cannot then be recovered.
  name Control-R     Recover this file and rename it to "name".
  name <CR>          Recover this file and rename it to "name".

      Program Name:  CHKPNT
      Current Version: 30.2
      New Version:  30.3

      Comments:
A fairly minor change which insures that accounting data will be written even
when the "debug" switch is set.  This could prevent the loss of revenue
information in the event of a crash.  There would be no apparent changes to
users.

      Changes between versions:
The following is the programmer's information log which records the changes
between versions.

30.3    /TODD  10-21-82: Previous versions of CHKPNT did not write 
        records because debug switch was on.  Fixed this so that we 
        charge for interrupted sessions.

Subject: Qs. re. a couple of utilities. 
From: Dennis Coffey <DENCOFF@26.Tymnet>

1.)  SYSTAT:  version on hosts is 61.6 (we think--result of VER on
program is "470061 021006"); and object code's files license varies:
most have WC HF, but a couple vary.  Do you know anything about 61.6
(not in archives, last archived is 61.5), and do you know what license
should be set on the file on all hosts?)

(Last transmittal we can find is for ver. 61.5.  Last ver.
found in ARCHIV data base is 61.3.)


2.)  (MPL)ICP:  What is proper protection:  AL RD RD, ALL RD NO or ALL
RUN RUN?  (This differs from host to host.)  What is proper license to
be set:  RC HF RF, RC HF R or WC RF HF?  (also differs host to host.)
Program not archived, transmittal not found.

3.)  (SRAUTIL)FTICP:  do we do anything with it?  Who would we contact
about this program (not in transmittal data base nor in our file
cabinet)?

4.)  DSKMAP:  no transmittals found; ver.  in transmittal data base is
1.1, version report by VER command on hosts is 2.56 ("032002 000056").
Do you know anything about sources, etc. for this one?

5.)  (SPL)SY:  apparently not transmitted:  nothing found in transmittal
data base or file cabinet.  Various checksums for .SAV file, but ver.
is consistent at 2.72.  Protection varies between ALL RD NO & ALL RUN
RUN.  License varies between:  none, RC SY and SY RF.  What do you know,
or where can I learn about this one?


Whether these operating system-related informational utilities are for
"general" use or for our section, Craig wants them archived and
transmitted to the hosts so they will be consistent for us and all
users.  Any of the above requested information will help us in doing
this.

	Thanks!

From: Dennis Coffey <DENCOFF@26.Tymnet>

We've found the executable binaries on the 20s (BOOTS.DMP), but have no
sources.  There is nothing in the transmittal data base or the archive
data base.  Do you know anything about sources, etc.?

Subject: Operating System PACKAGEs: (SPL) & (MPL) Software 
From: Dennis Coffey <DENCOFF@26.Tymnet>

Craig,

   Carl recommends that programs currently in the SPL directory (System
software section Program Library) and the MPL directory (Monitor unit
Program Library) be packaged as a separate set of packages.  After
discussion with him I see his point.  I'd like to discuss this with you;
we are currently packaging some of these 'subsidiary operating system-
related utilities' with more intrinsically operating system-related
software.

thanks,
Dennis

SUBJ:  OPRTLS Package on host 90. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingrid,

    I am checking with CEGI-Tymshare re. the installation of the
programs in the package onto host 90.  (I gave you some mis-information
about who is responsible for the host:  90 is in France--CEGI--while the
local development machine is 95.)

    I will give you an answer about installation of the software on 90
when I hear back from Peter Stratman.  I will also ask him about giving
you license on 90 for your installations.  I will let you know whether
you will be getting license, and will let you know when you have it on
90.

                                                                  Dennis

Subject: "BOOTS.DMP": 2020s' Bootstrap Program 
From: Dennis Coffey <DENCOFF@26.Tymnet>

We can't find any sources for this program, anywhere.  Do you know where
we might look, or who might help us find sources, control files, etc.?

Another item:  I've talked with Craig, and we have concurrence about the
'packaging' of SPL programs completely seperate from the SYS programs.
In fact, he agrees with all your suggestions that I passed along to him
(which were all that I could remember).

Later,

From: Dennis Coffey <DENCOFF@26.Tymnet>

1.)  Do you know anything about the version of BOOTS on the 2020's (I
believe it's 'BOOTS.DMP')?  We are unable to find any sources for
archiving.

2.)  Do you know anything about the dependence of SYSTAT on Monitor
versions -- especially SYSTAT v. 61.3, 61.4 & 61.6?  Or do you know who
I can/should ask about this?  the SYSTAT.INF file stops at v. 57.

Thanks!

Dennis,
  re: BOOTS.DMP ... I'm not sure, the whole BOOT mechanism is a mess on
                    the TYMCOM-X systems. ...mostly no documentation. I
                    or someone will have to research it.
  re: SYSTAT documentation probably stops at the point when they last
                    decided they had time to document what they had done
                    other than in the transmittal documentation.

  who to ask?  not to be facetious, but I'll give you the answer that
               was given to me when I asked what to do when I got this
               message "please see your tymshare representative"

  YOU are your tymshare representative...  YOU are the person to ask
  about finding out information about SYSTAT and why,where,who,etc. for
  any documentation...

Yes, I know... sigh!

SUBJECT>   Fayez Sarofim Software Upgrades


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I am an Applications Consultant in the Houston office and need your help
with Fayez Sarofim's software upgrades.
 
I have recently received the Fayez Sarofim account responsibilities from
D'Juanna Beer.  She has explained the software update problems and solutions
that your group worked with her on.  Today I talked with Michael Sugden, and
he questioned whether he had received his software upgrades.  He said that his
monitor is out of date and the other programs must be upgraded before
it can be updated.  However, I note from M. Chinn's Ontyme to D'Juanna on June
6 that the version of CHKPNT (and not the monitor) that they have is not
able to support the newer versions of SETOPS AND OPPS, and that they need
a new version of CHKPNT first.  So, let's review the software upgrades that
were supposedly copied to F.S.'s SSINSTALL directory (or to SYSINST - not the
correct directory).
 
PROGRAM         NEW                DATE OF
                VERSION     NOTIF. OF    APPROVAL FOR    F.S.'S CURRENT
                            UPDATES      INSTALLATION    COPY
-------         ---------   ---------    ------------    -----------------
SETOP.SAV       20          5/15/85      5/17/85         8/26/80
OPPS.SAV        4           5/15/85      5/17/85         1/1/64
TITO.SAV        16.3        5/15/85      5/17/85         5/ /85
MONITOR UTILITY PROGRAMS    5/22/85      ?
DIRIT           33.1        5/31/85      6/14/85         7/6/81
PIP             20.0        5/31/85      6/14/85         1/26/77
FILCOM          20.16-3.3   5/31/85      6/14/85         6/1/83
UNDELE                      5/31/85      6/14/85         5/16/84
CHKPNT          30.3        5/31/85      6/14/85         5/20/83
 
I had Michael Sugden check his SSINSTALL directory.  There were some Magnum
programs there, which he will install, but none of the above.  He later
checked SYSINST and found the copies of DIRIT, FILCOM and CHKPNT listed
above.
 
Please transmit all programs which have been previously approved for installa-
tion (including the monitor utility programs) to F.S.'s SSINSTALL directory.
Please notify me via Ontyme as soon as these have been transmitted so that
I can notify M. Sugden.  I would like to be caught up on these upgrades
as soon as possible so that the customer will receive the software which
he is paying for.  Please let me know if there is something else that I can
do to expedite this process.

Have you sent the software upgrades to Fayez Sarofim yet?  Please remember
to notify me, or F. S. will not know that they are there to install.

Regarding your message about Fayez Sarofim's software---

Michael Sugden At F.S. said that tape transmittal is fine; in
fact he prefers to receive it that way.  When it is ready to be
sent, just let me know.

Marla,

It appears that we have agreement, and progress toward satisfying F.S.!
I'll let you know when the tape of programs is ready to send.  

We are currently examining the latest version of the monitor (operating
system), plus several monitor subsidiary programs and monitor-related
utility programs for inclusion in the transmittal.  I'll let you know
just which programs will be included.
