Kamoi-san,
 
I spoke to Dennis Coffey of X support, and Ed Roop of Resources today
about the PERP replacement situation.
 
1. Dennis and Ed were able to give us an extension on the PERP
conversion. However, this extension will be only until December 12, PST,
at which time PERP goes away.
 
The physical removal of the 940s will occur December 15, and Ed says that
they need the window between the 12th and the 15th for an orderly transition
and shutdown.
 
Note that this is a hard drop-dead date, and is showing up on the
bannner messages on hosts 34 and 57.
 
2. Dennis Coffey said that there is a possiblity that for some of the
users, we could handle the conversion by changing the command files on the
PDP-X, while leaving the hard-coded files on the intelligent terminals
the same as they are now.
 
Dennis can give us some help and advice on this, but we need to see examples
                                                                Page  2

in order to find out if this is feasible or not.
 
So, I'm asking you to send to me and to Dennis:
 
        A. Examples of the files that are hard-coded on the intelligent
        terminals;
 
        B. Examples of the corresponding command files on the PDP-X.
 
3. It would also help Dennis if we could have a list of the usernames and
associated host numbers of the customers who user PERP (USERNAME:NN).
 
4. To the best of your knowledge, do you have any customers located outside
of Japan who are using PERP? Do any of them have commands hard-coded in
the terminals?
 
5. Since December 12 is a true drop-dead date,
I recommend that you make the PERP-to-SUBMIT migration the
number one priority at KTL over the next few weeks. We cannot give you
any hope that PERP will be around after December 12.
 
Regards, Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm testing the new system SUBMIT and I have some question on it.

1. Is SUBMIT system (Job Processor) available for all day ?
   It did not work on host D34 yesterday. And it did not
   work on host D37 today.
   My job is keeping on Queved-Wait status.

2. I could not received MAIL by MAIL/OPNOTICE command
   though I got message "Mail from TYMCOM-X Job Processor Mailer".
   And it is the same result on both mode XEXEC and XEXECJ.

3. In INSERT command mode, ESC does not work. Job was inserted.

4. I don't understand it clearly. For example, my command file
   contains as follows:
       .MAGNUM
       .WARNINGS OFF    <-------
       TIME
       QUIT
       .SPOOL
       .SPOOL          <--------
       N
       *GASSAN
         :
         :
         :

                                                                Page  2

   Job Processor will force to back to XEXEC mode from MAGNUM or
   SPOOL system and continues the next command line.
   According to the manual, Period prefix character "may be Job
   Processor command or monitor commands. .... (page 3)".
   This means that MAGNUM or SPOOL is user's program for Job
   Processor and Job was interrupted. Is it correct ? If so,
   what is monitor level ? Only XEXEC/XEXECJ/PDP10 mode ?

I'm look forward to hearing from you soon.
We have no time!

Thanks and best regards,
Tak Yasuma

Dennis, Carl,
 
1. For your information I am reproducing below A80625 from Hideo Nakano
of  KTL, concerning problems with reading an opnotice.
 
2. Dennis, you already have a related memo, A80680, from Tak Yasuma,
concerning some problems he ran into running SUBMIT tests.
 
3. In light of the short amount of time that we have, I'd like to make
soem suggestions to KTL that will really speed up our ability to help
you with this conversion:
 
A. Send all reports, etc., directly to Carl and Dennis, and copy me.
 
B. Rather than typing in excerpts of code in your Ontymes, let us know
the names and locations of the files that you are using, so that we can
look at the entire file.
 
C. Let us know which files we can actually run to SUBMIT jobs here,
without messing up anything in production systems.
 
Otherwise, tell us that the file should not actually be used at our
end, but that we should only look at the code.
 
D. If you do give us access to files that we can try to use ourselves,
please let us know the login password for the userid where the file resides.
I am not sure if SUBMIT is sensitive to issues such as GFD vs. login,
differences in INIT files between userids, and differences in license
levels.
 
However, if we can do a true log-in to the userid you're using, we can
get as close as possible to the same environment that you have.
 
(Note: remember the BUGREP program? Nothing to stop you from using it.)
 
E. If you run into a reproducible problem, please try making a clean
reproduction of it using the (MPL)RECORD program. That way, we can
study the problem from your file first, and it will be easier for us
to try our own tests.
 
Thanks and regards, Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Do you know PERP driver hosts are scheduled to go away
on December 12 and the new Job Processor System, SUBMIT
is available on a TYMCOM-X?

We have still many user on the TYMCOM-X such as Marubeni,
A-AIS and .... Almost all of them are using PERP and PCOM
now. So we must convert to the Job Processor untill
December 12.

Today I tryed to test the Job Processor, but I could not 
have a good result.

After the Job was executed, I recieved the message
"[opnotice waiting]" at my terminal. However I could not
type out this message on my terminal.

I asked this problem to host(D34) operator and get the answer
as follows:

FROM: OPER, NOV 26, 1986       1:11
ATTN:  HIDEO NAKANO
REF:   PPR #34660
AS YOUR QUESTION ON HOW TO GET THE
INFORMATION TO TYPE OUT, I'M NOT SURE.
WE HAVE RECIEVED THE SAME MSG'S AT OUR
TERMINALS, AND WE HAVE'NT YET FOUND A WAY
TO GET ANYTHING TO TYPE OUT.  SORRY IF I

Please check this problem soon and could you tell me how to
get the message.

Subject: Locating the sources to system programs using FINDIT.TEC 

If you are looking for the sources to a particular program, you can often save
yourself some trouble by checking if the information is already on-line, on
system 930 in the files (JMS)*.WHR.  These WHR files are created when I try
to find where the sources are.          /Joe Smith, 26-Nov-86

How to use FINDIT.TEC

A) Make sure that you have (SYS) in your DO list after (XEXEC).
   See (JMS)RPGINI.CTL for an example on how to do this.

B) Copy (JMS)FINDIT.TEC to your directory.

The above two steps need to be done only once.

C) Have MHX run FINDIT on all systems, creating a .WHR file.

D) Mung the WHR file using FINDIT.TEC to clean up the file and add host numbers.

E) Optionally sort the WHR file if you want to.

Example of step C - running FINDIT via MHX

01	.MHX
02	hosts: 10S
03	commands (end with ctrl-D):
04	O$
05	FINDIT
06	TELEC#.*,AUXMO#.*
07	
08	SYSNO
09	record? Y
10	output file: TELECO.WHR
11	detach? Y

01 Start (MPL)MHX.
02 Tell MHX to go to all PDP-10 systems (as defined in JOBS.DAT).
03 Prompt from MHX.
04 Type "O", ESCape, and your OPER password.  Note that MHX turns off echo
   while it is reading the password.
05 Run (SPL)FINDIT on each system
06 Tell FINDIT to look for TELECO.SAV, TELECF.223, and AUXMOX.SAV.
   TELECF.223 is the FDM file for version 22.3, therefore when searching for
   sources and FDM files, it is a good idea to have # as 6th char of filename.
07 Blank line is required to get out of FINDIT.
08 Dummy line, I put it in out of habit
09 Control-D to end commands, MHX asks if you want to record output in a file.
10 My convention is to use *.WHR to keep lists of where files are.
11 Detach.  You can monitor MHX's progress from another terminal.  MHX changes
   its name (as reported by SYSTAT) to be "MHX:nn" when going to host nn.

Example of step D - MUNGing the file
In this example I use a different WHR file and show only the significant lines.

12	.DIR KLKS.WHR
13	KLKS    WHR      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
14	.MUNG FINDIT,KLKS.WHR
15	FINDIT V2 - Fix output from FINDIT by putting username after file name
16	29:
17	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:29)          15  07-Dec-78  14:49  ALL  RD  NO
18	62:
19	ACCESS.MSG  (KS2020:62)         2  24-Feb-81  14:45  ALL  RD  NO
20	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:62)          12  09-Jul-80  20:25  ALL  RD  NO
21	"Done

12-13 The log file does not show up until MHX is done.
14 The MUNG command runs (SYS)MUNG.SAV which runs (JMS)TECO.SHR.  The first
   argument is the name of the commands file (FINDIT.TEC), the argument after
   the comma is the name of the file that FINDIT.TEC is to work on.
15 FINDIT.TEC identifies itself.
16+18  Each host number is typed as it is found.
17,19-20 Note that username and host have been moved to the middle of the
   record.  The filename is now in column 1 where it can be sorted.  Every
   line of the file is typed out, you can use Control-O to suppress it.
21 FINDIT.TEC is done.

Example of step E - SORTing the file

22	.DIR KLKS.*
23	KLKS    WHR      25  26-NOV-86 1552    ALL RD  NO     12044
24	KLKS    BAK      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
25	.SORT KLKS.WHR=KLKS.WHR
26	SORTED 774 RECORDS

22-24 The BAK file can be deleted.  It is created in case you run FINDIT.TEC
  on a WHR file that has already been MUNGed once.
25 (XEXEC)SORT takes OUTPUT.FIL=INPUT.FIL, sorts in ascending order, using
   the entire line as a key.
26 SORT is done.
27 I sometimes massage the sorted WHR file by replacing "(SYS:22)" with
   "(SYS:*)" and deleting the redundant lines that say that XXX.SAV was
   installed on all systems on the same day.
