Corporate Management of Productivity - An Empirical Study
  McInnes, J. Morris
  Strategic  Mgmt  Jrnl  (UK)   v5n4  PP:  351-365  Oct/Dec 1984
CODEN: SMAJD8  ISSN: 0143-2095  JRNL CODE: SMJ
  DOC TYPE: Journal Paper  LANGUAGE: English  LENGTH: 15 Pages
  AVAILABILITY: ABI/INFORM
  The results of a questionnaire survey of corporate  managerial
approaches  to productivity are reported.   The sample contained
146 large industrial firms, 96 from the US, 25 from the UK,  and
25  from Japan.   Responses from the complete sample are used to
construct  a  managerial  interpretation  of  productivity.    A
comparison is then made among the 3 national samples.   Although
productivity improvement was cited as being an  issue  of  great
corporate  concern  in  all 3 nations,  it was assigned a higher
priority by the  British  and  Japanese  than  by  the  American
managers.    The  British  and American managerial approaches to
productivity seem to be broadly similar, with the exception that
the  former  concentrate  much  more  single-mindedly  on  labor
productivity  as  the  primary  issue.    The Japanese responses
demonstrate a proactive,   long-term  approach  to  productivity
management,   with  research  and  innovation  being  given  the
preeminent role.   Implications of  these  results  are  briefly
discussed   and   directions  for  further  research  suggested.
