INITA command bug fix

INITA is the PROBE command to reset and clear accounting.
Correct number of available accounting blocks
immediately after "INITA" command completes.
Correct number of available accounting blocks after 
"THAW" command completes.
Verify protocol and operation using both Public Network
Collector program and Raw Accounting Merger (RAM).

4 Meg Sup

Design and reconfigure the supervisor to take advantage of an
additional 3 meg of memory. This also requires changing the kernel's
MAC assignments and probably making other modifications to the kernel
such as address checking. Most of the additional space will be used for
the MUD cache. I don't know what the cababilities of the current MAC
are, i.e. whether it supports 4 meg of memory or not. If it does not,
then I'll have to investigate what hardware alterations will be required.
[1 month]

Speed Path Finding

I have already performed an examination of the current path finding
algorithym in connection with the circuit too long problem and I am work-
ing on a document explaining in more and better detail exactly how the
algorithym works. In order to find a better path finding scheme, it would
first require studying current articles, literature, and technical papers
that discuss the subject. I would also have to find or develope some way to
analyze and compare different algorithyms so that an objective evaluation
could be made after trying some of them on Bubbnet.
[3 months]

MXP sup

I assume that the MXP sup would be a cluster of sups interconnected
together by some high speed medium, and that the purpose would be improved
reliability. It would have to be determined how the mxp sup fits in with
plans for concurrently active sups, or other plans that call for removing
accounting and other functions. Much research would have to be done on my
part to learn about the high speed medium. It would also have to be studied
how the sup would be reconfigured and modified, especially in light of the
other changes being done.

SHTS macro

Alter the macro so that if a user calls it with a search flag other
than -1, then the flag will be restored to -1 before the macro is exited.
[2 weeks]

Circuit path too long

Determine exactly how the current path finding routine operates,
and what software conditions cause a DIRLIST overflow. Talk with netcon
people to get info on condition of network at time the message appears.
Determine if problem is software/configuration problem, or network
architecture problem. If software related, see what sort of feasible
solutions might be possible. If problem is network related, make sug-
gestions for improvement. Also, write a good, detailed explanation of the 
path finding algorithym because the little documentation that is available
is not very clear, well written, or able to be comprehended quickly and
easily.

Supervisor keep alive problem

The Node Code / Supervisor interface
for ISIS and non-ISIS Supervisors will be enhanced to prevent the
false Frozen and SUP Stop indications on the Node Code during supervisor
initialization.  This will involve some mechanism of informing the Node Code
of the Supervisor initialization.  [3 weeks]

SHRSVC default to true

The SHRSVC switch for the Supervisor disk
handling will be modified to be default to true and all Supervisor 
configurations will be assembled and loaded to insure integrity. [3 days]

Load Tools for Split Configuration

Some mechanism will be implemented
to allow the SUP, Kernel and Slaves to be bound into one loadable file.
Will require either substantial modification of Sup and Slave segment usage
(to free up Seg E) or a new MERLIN-like program to do the bind. [2 months]

Debug Tools

The Split Kernel has been modified to support debug users
for each slave and the Sup.  Debug usernames can be specified at assembly time
and a mechanism to snapshot (trap) registers in running code is in place.  The
use of the traps and the structure of the Kernel users has yet to be 
documented and should be complete by April 1.

SIO ring copy boot proms

The SIO ring boot program will be burned into
PROMS and tested. [1 month]

Release 41 to SOURCE

Stabilize the Supervisor and Split Kernel source
by May 15 and fully deploy in Bubbnet for integrity monitoring.  Set up
sample command and Tymfiles and complete load instructions for ISIS and
non-ISIS configurations.  [1 month]

Make SUP 41 run on ISIS 6

The Supervisor and ISIS will be modified to
use ISIS Slot Recovery to load the Supervisor code from disk instead of
the current specialized mechanism. [2 months]

New file system
.continue;
Disk check on initialization
.continue;
Revised file layouts for capacity requirements

The SUP, Kernel and Slaves will be modified to utilize
an intelligent file structure.  Features will be, central file table of 
contents from which all file access and location will be controlled,
file headers and identifiers, and file integrity checking.  Capacity
requirements will be considered in the design process to insure
fulfillment of future file requirements.  An additional initialization
phase will be added to insure file integrity at startup time. [3 months]

Upgrade utility slot for 300MB disk

The ISIS Utility slot will be modified
to support the 300MB disk for all utility functions. [1 month]

UUN in needle

This feature is required for Televerket.
The circuit request and needle messages have been changed to allow a
request for the SUP to send the UUN back to the circuit originator
in the needle.
(see memo from Bill Soley,
"Proposal for New Needle and Circuit Request Message Formats",
Tymshare, NTD, 8 Mar 84.)

Host Names

Sometimes thought of as 32 bit host numbers.
The methods used to extend needle formats mentioned in the above paragraph
allow room for implementation of this.
It should be noted that what is really being requested is
arbitrarily assignable host names
(which just happen to be numeric in this isolated customer's case).
Current plans are to implement 12 character alpha-numeric names.
This will require extensive work in the validations software area.
[3 months (SUP side only)]

Proxy Login Capability

This is a mechanism allowing a value added passthrough such as CMT,
the MUX, X.PC or a Menu Server to obtain a capability (a 32 bit key)
from the supervisor when the original user circuit is built.
The capability may then be repeatedly passed to the supervisor in place of
the password to allow the server to build normal terminal circuits on
the behalf of the user without needing to know the user's password.
(see memo from Bill Soley, "Proxy Login Capability", Tymshare, NTD,
24 Feb 84.)

Node 64 bug

Problem arises from race condition with Tymnet-I base building
an aux circuit.  Node 64 (in Paris)
seems to be most likely to have this happen.
Interim solution appears to be to increase timeout.
Long term solution is to eliminate Tymnet-I.
[1 week]

Network analysis tools:

Design and implement performance analysis tools to allow network to
be better managed.
This includes work on ANSI X3.102 standard.
C. Holmberg had shown me one of tools to measure the performance
of SYNC engine.
[3 months]

Release 41 to (SOURCE)

The source code for SUP 41 are already in CCDA.
Some modifications might be needed before release.
Documentation needs to be filled in and checked.
[1 week]

Revise MUD formats

Tony has some documents for new MUD formats.
Recent considerations need to be incorporated into plan,
such as value added passthroughs.
Port addressing,
host names (32 bit host numbers).
[3 months]

Origin only hosts

Implement ability for host to declare itself origin only or destination only
in order to restrict circuits.
The message formats between SUP & Node have already been approved
from Node-Code Unit.
