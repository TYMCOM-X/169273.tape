For the COMPILE, LOAD, EXECUTE, and DEBUG commands, RPG checks to see if the
program sources need to be compiled.  It does this by 1) determining which
source file to use, 2) checking the output binary file, and 3) calling the
appropriate language translators.

If you do not specify an extension, RPG will try all the extensions listed in
the "source" column below.  Then it checks if the REL or other binary file
is present.  If not, or if the source file was modified after the binary file
was created, then the source needs to be compiled.  RPG calls all the needed
compilers, then calls LOADER to read in the binary files for the LOAD, EXECUTE,
and DEBUG commands.

Note:  You can tell RPG to run a different compiler by using the CTEST SETPROC
and CTEST ADDPROC commands.  See "CTEST" for more information.

Text: DO; The DO, SETDOLIST and ADDDOLIST commands                        page 1

The wonderful "DO" command

Purpose:	Provide a command to simplify running common programs

Format:		-DO program
		-CTEST SETDOLIST = dolist
		-CTEST ADDDOLIST = dolist
	A dolist is some number of directories separated by commas.
	Directories may be specified as (USERNAME) or [gan,uun].  In
	addition the special names DEFAULT or LOG may be used, to
	indicate the directory currently GFD'd to and the directory
	this job is logged in as respectively.

Use:	Behaves very much like RUN (or R), but will search a list of
	directories in the order specified until it finds a program
	of the appropriate name.  [Currently, the default list is
	DEFAULT, LOG, (SYS)]

Restrictions:	All directories are assumed to be on device DSK.  The
	default list is actually represented as the null list, so
	an initial "CTEST ADDDOLIST=(UPL)" will set the do list to
	a single entry, rather than appending (UPL) to the default.
	The "DO" command will ignore the list if a directory is
	specified.  Since the "DO" command code is in RPG, a RESCAN
	from the program will not succeed. (Thus programs which reread
	the command line and check for ";program commands" will not
	find the proper results.)

RPG 133.0   September 7, 1978        W.R.Soley

Version 133 of RPG now contains the following new features:  1) New switch for
DIRIT - /AUTHOR, 2) New mail saving capability.  The first is self explanatory.
The second is normally off.  It is invoked by giving the command
"CTEST SETMAIL <file.name>" to RPG.  The file name given must be in your
directory and in most cases should have the name "MAIL.BOX".

Text: RPGHISTORY; Modification history                                    page 1

155.0	19-Oct-82 Carl
Fixed code in 151.0 to allow ^G to echo as BELL as per request
of COEES and MAGNUM.

154.0	01-Oct-82 Carl
Fixed problem in /YESTERDAY switch to DIRIT to determine the date
correctly for end-of-month and end-of-year and february on leap
years.

153.0	03-Jun-82 Carl
Fixed problem in RDLUD to correctly read the lud when a username
hashed to LUD block 0.  Previous versions used 0 as flag for block
in memory and 0 meant file not read, thus usernames in block 0
did not work for any RPG functions/conversions.

152.0	14-May-82 Carl
Added /YESTERDAY to dirit commands list and modified the message
typed out by an illegal switch.

151.0	12-May-82 Carl
Fixed MAIL,POSTMAN commands to not allow special characters to be
printed in mail messages.  Control chars > ^char, rub > ^#, tilde ^%.

150.0	08-Apr-82 Carl
Fixed bug in RPG/RPGINI which expected a null word after the last
word in the INI record list.  Forced a null every time.

147.0	08-Feb-82 Carl
Divided RPG into separate modules RPGUNV, RPGINI, RPGMAI, RPG and made
changes to make it assemble under MACRO %53B.  Incidently, changed the
/PROJ switch to DIRIT to be a full /PROJECT, and added /CASE to the
list of DIFFER switches, (/K to FILCOM).

146.0	19-Nov-81 Carl
Added "VUE" command to always run (SYS)VUE regardless of your
EXEC mode.

144.1 23-Jan-81 Carl
Bugfix to duplicate get LOGGED-IN PPN and store in LOGPPN# at startup
time, before it get's used.  *** NOTE *** I triedimply move it &
RPG broke, (ILL MEM REF), so it is in both places still.

143.1	05-mar-80 AAA
Bugfix at SND4A missing [] around asciz literal.

143.0	03-mar-80 AAA
Bugfixes to 142.6 which correct use of AC's in SMALA,
and loop at ML collecting and printing mail. T3 is now
holy, since it contains mail file block number.

142.0 thru 142.6 Jan and Feb 80 AAA
Implement "arbitrary-length mail" SEND and MAIL commands,
and clean up bugs which existed in previous mail code
causing XOBLAM to get garbaged on C33 and elsewhere.

140.1	07-jun-79 A.Atkinson
1) Changed SEND command panic terminate when letter too
	long.  Now  prints last few chars of letter that did
	make it into mail.
2) Fixed bug in SEND of file contents; SN3B code
	was getting chars from dsk and depositing them via T4
	without regard for the restriction that the buffer
	pointed-to by T4 is 100 words long.
140.0	23-MAR-79 S.D.Daniels
  1) Fixed bug as  per TSR #57193 (.RDL extension for SFO). Page
	38, lines 3000:3600 (rerel+5...).  The file extension
	code was bizarre: after HLRZ t1,fl2 there was:
	 skipn t2,intext(t1);  movsi t2,'rel';
	 skipn t1,oext;  move t1,t2;
	 movem t2,oextp; movem t1,lext;
	(LEXT is extension to check date/time on)
	(OEXTP is extension used in emitted command)
	Symptom was SFO used REL, not RDL files.  (OEXT had RDL).
	Current decision: (OEXTP and LEXT both get same)
	 If OEXT (specified file) exists then use it, else
	  If INTEXT(T1) exists then use it, else use ".REL"
	This may fix "com foo.=foo.sai" as well.

137.0	19-JAN-79 S.D.Daniels
  1) Bug "fix" v134 introduced an "out of core" on a huge compile
	command.  GTUNO allocates too much core to find a user and
	never releases it, and user name => ppn routine search of
	known names never would find a name.  Current fix: find the
	name.  For later: separate LUD search (mail code) from user
	name conversion, and use LOOKUP for the conversion.
	PPSR #900131
  2) Also for later: Figure out how ###RPG.TMP should work with
	respect to GFD, LOGOUT, and LOGOUT. (clearly wrong now.)
136.0	10/27/78 W.R.Soley
  1) Changed the SEND command routine to call the special mailbox
	routines to eliminate the need to send mail to one's self
	in order to retain a copy.

135.0	10/26/78 W.R.Soley
  1) Changed special mailbox routines to output packets packed
	two to a block.

134.0   17-OCT-78 S.D.Daniels
  1) Added the DO command (run with a path of PPNS) which uses
	record type 8 as a list of PPNS to try to runthe file.
  2) Added the SETDOLIST and ADDDOLIST (both CTEST) commands to
	operate on the path records.
  3) Made RPG look for and use the logged in PPN for ###RPG.TMP
	and RPG.INI
  4) Some cleanup in associated routines (SCAN esp).

133.0	9/6/78 W.R.Soley
  1) Added the SETMAIL (CTEST) command to create record type
	7 for special mailbox.
  2) Added code to MAIL command to save mail in a file.
  3) Added the switch /AUTHOR to DIRIT (/O).
  4) Added the switches /AUTHOR and /PROJECT to the DIRIT help
	message.

CTEST SETMAIL will generate a record type 7 in the  RPG temp
file.  The format of record 7 is as follows:
        XWD 7,6
        EXP 5
        XWD <gan>,<uun>
        SIXBIT <name>
        SIXBIT <extension>
        EXP 0,0

Once this record exists in the RPG temp file, any MAIL  commands given
thereafter will append  one disk block  containing the mail  packet in
the first  100(8) words to  the named file  for each mail  packet read
from the system mailbox.  The format of the mail packet is:
        0..1    SIXBIT <sender's username>
        2       <sender's PPN>
        3       <date sent (DEC format)>
        4       <time sent (ticks past midnight)>
        5..n-1  <list of PPNs who have not recieved yet>
        n       -1
        n+1..77 ASCIZ <message>

For simplicity,  this file  may be simply  manipulated by  the program
SYS:MAIL which is self-documenting.
