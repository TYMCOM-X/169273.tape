  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3605,3643,3900] Triprolidine shares the toxic  potentials  of
other antihistamines, and the usual precautions of antihistamine
therapy should be observed.  (See Cautions in the Antihistamines
General Statement 4:00.)
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3645,3253,3900]  Like  other  antihistamines,    triprolidine
should  be  used  with caution in infants and young children and
should not be used in premature  or  full-term  neonates.   (See
Cautions:    CNS   Effects  and  Pediatric  Precautions  in  the
Antihistamines General Statement 4:00.)  [3645,3253] Use of  the
drug   in   children  younger  than  4  months  of  age  is  not
recommended.(169)  Children younger than 6 years of  age  should
receive   triprolidine   only   under   the   direction   of   a
physician.(169)  [3645,3253,3423]  The  manufacturer  recommends
that  children younger than 12 years of age receive conventional
or  extended-release   capsules   of   triprolidine   in   fixed
combination  with  pseudoephedrine only under the direction of a
physician.
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3655,3643]  There  is  inadequate  experience  with  use   of
triprolidine   in   pregnant  women  to  determine  whether  the
potential for harm to the fetus exists. [3655,3643] There are no
adequate and controlled studies to date  using  triprolidine  in
pregnant  women,   and  the drug should be used during pregnancy
only when clearly needed.
  [3645,3873] Because  of  the  potential  for  serious  adverse
reactions  to  antihistamines  in  nursing  infants,  a decision
should be made whether to discontinue nursing  or  triprolidine,
taking into account the importance of the drug to the woman.
  TEXT:
  CARCINOGENICITY
  [3663]   Long-term   studies   in  animals  to  determine  the
carcinogenic potential of triprolidine have not  been  performed
to date.
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3653]  Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits using dosages
up to  70  times  the  usual  human  dosage  of  the  fixed-dose
combination  of triprolidine and pseudoephedrine (Actifed)  have
not revealed evidence of  impaired  fertility  or  harm  to  the
fetus. In an epidemiologic study in pregnant women, there was no
evidence of increased risk of teratogenicity associated with use
of triprolidine in fixed combination with pseudoephedrine during
the first trimester,  although a modest association could not be
ruled out.(263)

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  ADVERSE EFFECTS
  [3605,3623] Pseudoephedrine may cause mild CNS  stimulation,   especially  in
patients who are hypersensitive to the effects of sympathomimetic drugs. [3605]
Nervousness, excitability, restlessness, dizziness, weakness,  and insomnia may
occur.  Headache and drowsiness have also been reported.  Large doses may cause
lightheadedness,   nausea,   and/or  vomiting.   [3645,3603]  In addition,  the
possibility of other adverse effects  associated  with  sympathomimetic  drugs,
including fear, anxiety, tenseness, tremor, hallucinations,  seizures,  pallor,
respiratory  difficulty,   dysuria,   and  cardiovascular  collapse  should  be
considered.
  Although   oral   administration   of   usual  doses  of  pseudoephedrine  to
normotensive patients usually produces negligible pressor  effects,   the  drug
should   be   used   with   caution   in  hypertensive  patients.   [3605,3623]
Pseudoephedrine may increase the irritability of the heart muscle and may alter
the rhythmic function of the ventricles,  especially in  large  doses  or  when
administered  to  patients  who are hypersensitive to the myocardial effects of
sympathomimetic drugs. [3605] Tachycardia or palpitation may occur. One patient
who received 120 mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride every  4  hours  developed
multifocal  premature  ventricular  contractions which disappeared within a few
days after the drug was discontinued. [3605,3250] In addition,  pseudoephedrine
may  have  precipitated  an attack of atrial fibrillation in an infant.  It was
postulated that the patient may  have  had  previously  unsuspected  idiopathic
atrial  fibrillation,   and therefore may have been especially sensitive to the
myocardial effects of the drug.
  [3605,3003] Fixed  dermatologic  eruptions  (erythematous  nummular  patches)
developed in 2 patients after a combination containing 60 mg of pseudoephedrine
hydrochloride  and  2.5  mg  of  triprolidine  hydrochloride  was administered.
Sensitivity testing indicated  that  pseudoephedrine  was  the  cause  of  this
reaction.    [3605,3003]   In   one  patient  with  latent  Horner's  syndrome,
administration of  pseudoephedrine  in  combination  with  triprolidine  caused
anisocoria.
  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
  [3250,3645]  Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of
sympathomimetic amines.  [3250,3645,3613] Overdosage of sympathomimetic  amines
in  patients  older  than  60  years  of  age  may  cause  hallucinations,  CNS
depression,  seizures,  and death.   Extended-release  preparations  containing
pseudoephedrine  should  therefore  not be administered to these patients until
safety has been established by administration of a short-acting preparation.
  [3645] As  with  other  sympathomimetic  drugs,   pseudoephedrine  should  be
administered with caution to patients with hyperthyroidism,  diabetes mellitus,
ischemic  heart  disease,   elevated  intraocular   pressure,    or   prostatic
hypertrophy.   [3645,3623]  The  drug  should  be  used cautiously,  and may be
contraindicated,  in patients who are hypersensitive to the  effects  of  other
sympathomimetic  drugs.   [3645] Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated in patients
with severe hypertension  or  severe  coronary  artery  disease  and  in  those
receiving  monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors.   (See Drug Interactions:  Monoamine
Oxidase Inhibitors.)
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3250,3645]  The  extended-release  preparations   containing   120   mg   of
pseudoephedrine hydrochloride or sulfate should not be administered to patients
younger than 12 years of age.
  PREGNANCY AND LACTATION
  [3655] Safe use of pseudoephedrine during pregnancy has not been established.
[3645,3870]  The  drug  may be distributed into milk and should not be given to
nursing women because infants may be especially susceptible to its effects.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3605,3643,3900] Chlorpheniramine and  dexchlorpheniramine  share  the  toxic
potentials of other antihistamines,  and the usual precautions of antihistamine
therapy should be  observed.   (See  Cautions  in  the  Antihistamines  General
Statement 4:00.)
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3645,3253,3900]    Like    other   antihistamines,    chlorpheniramine   and
dexchlorpheniramine should not be used in premature or full-term neonates. (See
Cautions:  CNS Effects and Pediatric Precautions in the Antihistamines  General
Statement  4:00.)   [3645,3253]  Conventional chlorpheniramine preparations and
extended-release preparations of the drug should be used  in  children  younger
than  6  years of age and in those younger than 12 years of age,  respectively,
only under the direction and supervision of a physician. Safety and efficacy of
dexchlorpheniramine in children younger than 2  years  of  age  have  not  been
established.  Safety and efficacy of extended-release tablets containing 4 or 6
mg of dexchlorpheniramine maleate have not been established in children younger
than 6 years of age or in those younger than 12 years of age, respectively.
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3655,3643] There are no  adequate  and  controlled  studies  to  date  using
chlorpheniramine or dexchlorpheniramine in pregnant women, and the drugs should
be  used  during  the  first  2  trimesters  only  when clearly needed.  In one
epidemiologic study,  use  of  chlorpheniramine  was  not  associated  with  an
increased  risk  of  teratogenic  effects;   however,  only a limited number of
pregnant women received the drug in this study.(198)  Because of  the  risk  of
severe   reactions   (e.g.,    seizures)    to   antihistamines   in  neonates,
chlorpheniramine or dexchlorpheniramine should not be  used  during  the  third
trimester.
  [3875]  It  is  not  known whether chlorpheniramine or dexchlorpheniramine is
distributed into milk,  but other antihistamines (e.g.,  diphenhydramine)  have
been  detected  in  milk.(137,138)   [3645,3873]  Because  of the potential for
serious adverse reactions to antihistamines in  nursing  infants,   a  decision
should   be   made  whether  to  discontinue  nursing  or  chlorpheniramine  or
dexchlorpheniramine,  taking into account the importance of  the  drug  to  the
woman.
  TEXT:
  MUTAGENICITY AND CARCINOGENICITY
  [3663]  The  mutagenic  and  carcinogenic  potentials  of chlorpheniramine or
dexchlorpheniramine have not been determined. In a long-term (103 weeks)  study
in   rats,    the   incidence   of   tumors  associated  with  chlorpheniramine
administration was similar to that in untreated animals.  There was no evidence
of  mutagenesis  induced  by chlorpheniramine or its nitrosation product in the
Ames microbial mutagen test.
  PREGNANCY, FERTILITY, AND LACTATION
  [3653] Reproduction studies in animals  using  dexchlorpheniramine  have  not
been  performed  to  date,   but reproduction studies in rabbits and rats using
chlorpheniramine maleate dosages up to 50 and 85 times the usual human  dosage,
respectively,   have  not  revealed  evidence  of harm to the fetus.  Decreased
postnatal survival in offspring of rats receiving 33 and  67  times  the  usual
human dosage of chlorpheniramine maleate has been reported.
  [3613]  Impaired  fertility  has  been  reported  in  female  rats  receiving
chlorpheniramine maleate dosages approximately 67 times the usual human dosage;
however,  more recent studies  in  rabbits  and  rats  using  more  appropriate
methodology  and  dosages up to 50 and 85 times the usual human dosage have not
revealed evidence of impaired fertility.

  [3585]  Dosage  of  dexchlorpheniramine maleate is approximately 50%  that of
chlorpheniramine maleate.
  DOSAGE [3526] Chlorpheniramine Maleate
  [3525,3553] For self-medication in adults and children 12 years  of  age  and
older,   the  usual  oral  dosage of chlorpheniramine maleate is 4 mg every 4-6
hours,  not  to  exceed  24  mg  in  24  hours.(100,169)   Alternatively,   for
self-medication,   adults and children 12 years of age and older may receive an
extended-release formulation containing 8 or 12 mg of the drug twice  daily  in
the morning and evening, not to exceed 24 mg in 24 hours. [3555] The usual oral
dosage of chlorpheniramine maleate for self-medication in children 6 to younger
than  12  years  of  age  is  2  mg every 4-6 hours,  not to exceed 12 mg in 24
hours.(100,169) Under the direction of a physician,  children 2 to younger than
6  years of age may receive 1 mg every 4-6 hours.(100,169)  Under the direction
of a physician,  children 6 to younger than 12 years of age  may  be  given  an
extended-release  formulation containing 8 mg of the drug once daily at bedtime
or during the day, as indicated.
  [3525] In adults,  a single dose of 10-20 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate  may
be administered subcutaneously, IV,  or IM for the relief of allergic reactions
to blood or plasma,  or IV in the adjunctive therapy of  anaphylaxis.   In  the
treatment  of uncomplicated allergic conditions in adults (when oral therapy is
not feasible or is contraindicated),  5-20 mg may be given  parenterally  as  a
single dose. The maximum parenteral dosage of chlorpheniramine maleate is 40 mg
daily.  [3555] Some clinicians state that children may be given 0.0875 mg/kg or
2.5 mg/m2 subcutaneously 4 times daily.

hours,  not to exceed 12 mg in 24 hours.(169)  [3555] The usual oral dosage  of
the drug for self-medication in children 6 to younger than 12 years of age is 1
mg every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 6 mg in 24 hours.(169) Under the direction of
a physician, children 2 to younger than 6 years of age may receive 0.5 mg every
4-6 hours, not to exceed 3 mg in 24 hours.(169)
  [3525,3553]    The   usual   dosage   of   dexchlorpheniramine   maleate   as
extended-release tablets is 4 or 6 mg at bedtime  or  every  8-10  hours  while
awake in adults and children 12 years of age and older. [3555] The usual dosage

  CHEMISTRY
  [3115]   Brompheniramine   is   a   propylamine   derivative   antihistamine.
Brompheniramine  differs from chlorpheniramine in the substitution of a bromine
atom for the chlorine atom of the latter compound.
  STABILITY
  [3305,3640]  At  temperatures  less  than  0DGC,   crystals   may   form   in
brompheniramine  maleate  injection;   if  this  occurs the injection should be
warmed to 30DGC to redissolve the  crystals.   [3345]  Brompheniramine  maleate
elixir  and  injection  should  be  stored  in  light-resistant containers at a
temperature less than 40DGC,   preferably  at  15-30DGC;   freezing  should  be
avoided. Brompheniramine maleate tablets should be stored at a temperature less
than  40DGC,   preferably  at 15-30DGC;  the extended-release tablets should be
stored in well-closed containers.
  SEE PRINTED BOOK FOR ILLUSTRATION
  TEXT:
  CHEMISTRY
  [3113,3580] Dexbrompheniramine,  the  dextro  isomer  which  is  commercially
available  only  in  combination products,  is approximately twice as active as
brompheniramine on a weight basis.  [3133,3143] Brompheniramine maleate  occurs
as  a  white,  crystalline powder and is freely soluble in water and soluble in
alcohol.  [3123] Brompheniramine has pKa  values  of  3.59  and  9.12.   [3153]
Brompheniramine maleate injection has a pH of 6.8-7.0.
  STABILITY
  [3323]  Brompheniramine  maleate injection has been reported to be physically
incompatible with some drugs,  but the compatibility depends on several factors
(e.g.,  the concentration of the drugs,  specific diluents used,  resulting pH,
temperature).   Specialized  references  should  be  consulted   for   specific
compatibility information.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3205]  Antihistamines  (histamine  H1-receptor  antagonists)   competitively
inhibit most of the pharmacologic actions of histamine.
  [3205,3603] Ethylenediamine derivatives have  relatively  weak  CNS  effects;
however,  drowsiness may occur in some patients.  Adverse GI effects are common
with this group of antihistamines.
  [3205,3603] Drugs in this group commonly cause CNS  depression;   with  usual
doses,   drowsiness  occurs  in about 50%  of patients who receive ethanolamine
derivative antihistamines.  The incidence of  adverse  GI  effects  with  these
antihistamines  is relatively low.  [3225,3900] Dimenhydrinate (see 56:22)  and
diphenhydramine are also used as antiemetics.
  [3605,3203] Propylamine  derivatives  cause  less  drowsiness  and  more  CNS
stimulation  than  the  other  antihistamines and thus are suitable for daytime
use.
  [3225,3900] Most phenothiazines are used principally as  antipsychotics  (see
28:16.08);   however,   some are useful as antihistamines,  antipruritics,  and
antiemetics.
  [3225,3900] Buclizine, cyclizine,  and meclizine are used in the treatment of
motion sickness. (See 56:22.) Hydroxyzine is used as a tranquilizer,  sedative,
antipruritic, and antiemetic. (See 28:16.08.)
  TEXT:
  [3113] Most antihistamines are substituted ethylamines.  In  general,   these
molecules consist of 3 portions: R1 = nucleus, X =  a linkage such as nitrogen,
oxygen, or carbon, and the ethylamine group.  Antihistamines can be depicted by
a general formula:
  SEE PRINTED BOOK FOR ILLUSTRATION
  [3183]  R1  is composed of aromatic and/or heterocyclic groups,  which may be
separated from X by a methylene group.  Hydrogenation of the rings  in  the  R1
portion of the molecule decreases antihistamine activity. Usually,  activity of
an antihistamine is increased by substitution of a halogen  atom  in  the  para
position  of  the  phenyl  or  benzyl  group of R1.  For maximum activity,  the
terminal nitrogen of the ethylamine group  should  be  a  tertiary  amine  with
methyl  groups  or  a  small  cyclic  moiety in R2 and R3.  In optically active
compounds, the dextro isomer (e.g., dexchlorpheniramine, dexbrompheniramine) is
usually more active than the levo isomer.
  [3113] Antihistamines can be classified on the basis  of  X  substitution  as
follows:
  [3112] ETHYLENEDIAMINE DERIVATIVES

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3205]  The  term  antihistamine has historically been used to describe drugs
that act as H1-receptor antagonists.(149,150)  Although drugs  that  antagonize
H2-receptors  are also commercially available (e.g.,  cimetidine,  ranitidine),
these drugs generally are not referred  to  as  antihistamines  but  rather  as
H2-receptor antagonists.(149,150)  Antihistamines competitively antagonize most
of the smooth muscle stimulating actions of histamine on  the  H1-receptors  of
the GI tract, uterus, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscle.  The drugs are
only feebly antagonistic to bronchospasm induced by antigen-antibody reactions.
Antihistamines also effectively antagonize the action of histamine that results
in increased capillary permeability and the formation  of  edema.   H1-receptor
antagonists also suppress flare and itch which accompany the endogenous release
of histamine.
  TEXT:
  [3203] Histamine is a physiologically active, endogenous substance (autacoid)
that binds to and activates histamine H1-  and H2-receptors at various sites in
the body.(149-151) The principal pharmacologic effects of histamine involve the
cardiovascular system, extravascular smooth muscle (e.g., bronchial tree),  and
exocrine  glands  (e.g.,   stimulation  of  salivary,  gastric,  lacrimal,  and
bronchial secretions).(149-151) Histamine can also stimulate some nerve endings
and thus causes itching.(149)  [3203,3900] (For additional information  on  the
pharmacologic  effects  of  histamine,  see Histamine Phosphate 36:36.)  [3203]
Characteristic cardiovascular effects of histamine include direct and  indirect
microvascular dilation (involving H1- and H2-receptors)  and increased vascular
permeability (thought to  principally  involve  H1-receptors);   intracutaneous
injection  of  histamine produces a ""triple response''  of local reddening,  a
bright halo or flare,  and wheal formation.(149-151)  In  allergic  conditions,
histamine and other substances (e.g.,  slow-releasing substance of anaphylaxis,
prostaglandins, kinins, serotonin) are secreted from mast cells, basophils, and
other  cells  in  response   to   antigenic   stimulation.(149,150,152,153,172)
Histamine  binds  to  and  activates  specific  receptors  in  the nose,  eyes,
respiratory tract,   and  skin,   causing  characteristic  allergic  signs  and
symptoms.(100,149,150,152,153)
  [3243]  Antihistamines  appear to act by blocking H1-receptor sites,  thereby
preventing the action of  histamine  on  the  cell;   they  do  not  chemically
inactivate  or  physiologically  antagonize  histamine  nor do they prevent the
release of histamine. [3203] Antihistamines do not block the stimulating effect
of histamine on gastric acid secretion,  which is mediated by  H2-receptors  of
the parietal cells.  [3203,3900] &For information on the effects of H2-receptor
antagonists, see Cimetidine 56:40 and Ranitidine 56:40.
  [3183,3203] The basic ethylamine group is common  to  antihistamines  and  to
anticholinergics, ganglionic and adrenergic blocking agents, local anesthetics,
and antispasmodics;  antihistamines also may be expected to exhibit these other
activities. [3203] Some antihistamines also demonstrate a quinidine-like effect
on  myocardial  conduction,   and  they  may  enhance  the  pressor  action  of
norepinephrine.   [3243] The antiemetic and antimotion-sickness actions of some
antihistamines appear to  result,   at  least  in  part,   from  their  central
anticholinergic  and CNS depressant properties.  The effects of diphenhydramine
on parkinsonian syndrome and drug-induced  extrapyramidal  reactions  are  also
apparently  related  to  its  central  anticholinergic  effects.   Although the
antipruritic   effect   of   the   drugs   in   conditions   associated    with
histamine-induced  pruritus  appears to result from a peripheral antihistaminic
effect and possibly a local anesthetic effect,(149,171)  the sedative effect of
antihistamines also appears to contribute to their antipruritic activity.(171)

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3805]  Little  information  is  available  on  the  pharmacokinetics of most
antihistamines.
  ABSORPTION
  [3815]  Antihistamines  reportedly  are  well  absorbed  following  oral   or
parenteral  administration,   but  various  salts  may  differ  in activity and
toxicity because of differences in solubility or absorption.  [3205] There  may
be some decrease in effectiveness with prolonged use of these drugs, although a
substantial  degree  of  tolerance  to  the  antihistaminic  effects  does  not
generally occur. However, tolerance to the sedative effects may occur.
  DISTRIBUTION
  [3825] The distribution of most antihistamines has not been studied.   [3825]
Those  compounds that have been studied show highest concentration in the lungs
and lower concentrations in  spleen,   kidneys,   brain,   muscle,   and  skin.
[3853,3825]  Unlike other currently available antihistamines,  terfenadine does
not appear to appreciably distribute into the CNS  at  usual  dosages.(154-167)
[3875] Small amounts of the drugs appear to be distributed into milk.
  ELIMINATION
  [3835]  The  metabolic fate of most antihistamines has not been studied.  The
drugs appear to be extensively metabolized, chiefly in the liver,  and excreted
in  urine  as  inactive metabolites within 24 hours.  Negligible amounts of the
drugs are excreted unchanged in urine.
  TEXT:
  ABSORPTION
  [3803,3203] The least soluble antihistamines are often the  least  toxic  and
may  have  a  slow  onset  but  prolonged  duration  of action.  Following oral
administration of antihistamines,  symptomatic  relief  of  allergic  reactions
usually  begins  within  15-30  minutes and is usually fully developed within 1
hour.  The duration of action is variable but symptoms are usually relieved for
3-6  hours after oral administration of most antihistamines.  Some of the drugs
have a longer duration of action.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3225]  Antihistamines  are  most often used to provide symptomatic relief of
allergic symptoms caused by histamine release.  The drugs are not curative  and
merely provide palliative therapy.  [3225,3003] Antihistamines are used only as
adjunctive therapy to epinephrine and other standard measures in the  treatment
of  anaphylactic  reactions  and laryngeal edema after the acute manifestations
have been controlled.  [3225] Individual patients vary  in  their  response  to
antihistamines.  A specific antihistamine that provides dramatic relief without
adverse effects to one patient  may  produce  intolerable  adverse  effects  in
another patient.  Trial of various antihistamines may be necessary to determine
which drug will relieve the patient and cause minimal adverse effects.
  OTHER ALLERGIC CONDITIONS
  [3225] Antihistamines are  often  effective  in  the  treatment  of  allergic
dermatoses,  but effectiveness varies with the causative agent and symptoms may
return when the drug is stopped.  The drugs are useful  in  the  management  of
allergic  conjunctivitis  caused  by  foods  or inhaled allergens.  Allergic or
hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and other
drugs may  be  amenable  to  antihistamine  therapy.   Pruritus  and  urticaria
accompanying  these conditions are usually temporarily relieved;  edema is more
resistant and serum sickness is not benefited.  Some  antihistamines  may  also
symptomatically   relieve  itching  accompanying  atopic  dermatitis,   contact
dermatitis,  pruritus ani or vulvae,  and insect bites.  The drugs may also  be
used in the treatment of dermatographism.  Patients with dermatographism who do
not experience adequate relief with an antihistamine  (H1-receptor  antagonist)
alone  may  benefit  from  the  addition  of  an  H2-receptor antagonist (e.g.,
cimetidine, ranitidine).(173,174)
  Symptoms of mild transfusion reactions not caused by ABO  incompatibility  or
pyrogens may be alleviated by antihistamines.  [3225,3643] The drugs should not
be added  to  blood  being  transfused.   Antihistamines  may  be  administered
prophylactically  to patients with a history of transfusion reactions,  but the
drugs should not be  given  routinely  to  patients  receiving  blood.   [3225]
Antihistamines may also be useful to prevent sequelae following desensitization
procedures  and allergic reactions to radiographic contrast media.  [3225,3643]
It must be kept in mind  that  prophylactic  use  of  antihistamines  may  mask
incipient  signs of allergic reactions,  and the patient's hypersensitivity may
not be recognized until a serious reaction occurs.
  OTHER USES
  [3225] Antihistamines have been used in the symptomatic treatment of  chronic
idiopathic  urticaria;   occasionally,  patients who do not experience adequate
relief with an antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist)  alone may  benefit  from
the addition of an H2-receptor antagonist.(176-179) However, in one study,  the
addition of an H2-receptor antagonist did not provide a substantial increase in
response (as determined by reduction in whealing).(175)
  Some   antihistamines   (e.g.,    buclizine,    cyclizine,    dimenhydrinate,
diphenhydramine,   meclizine,   promethazine)  are useful in the prevention and
treatment of motion sickness and they  are  considered  the  drugs  of  choice.
Buclizine,   dimenhydrinate,   and  meclizine have been used in the symptomatic
treatment of vertigo associated with diseases affecting the  vestibular  system
(e.g., labyrinthitis,  Meniere's disease).  Nonphenothiazine antihistamines are
less effective than the phenothiazines in controlling nausea and  vomiting  not
related to vestibular stimulation.
  Some antihistamines, especially the ethanolamines such as diphenhydramine and
doxylamine,   are  used  for  their  sedative  effect  as nighttime sleep aids.
Pyrilamine is included in the  formulation  of  some  proprietary  sleep  aids;
however,    safety   and  optimum  dosage  have  not  been  established.   Some
antihistamines  such  as  diphenhydramine  have  been   used   effectively   as
antitussives.
  Diphenhydramine  is  used to decrease rigidity and improve voluntary movement
and  speech  in  the  treatment  of  parkinsonian  syndrome  and   drug-induced
extrapyramidal reactions.
  [3225]  Although antihistamines are frequently used for symptomatic relief in
the  common  cold,   evidence  of   effectiveness   remains   to   be   clearly
established.(100,129,130)  Antihistamines are considered effective in relieving
rhinorrhea and sneezing associated with the common cold,(130,169)  but evidence
of  efficacy  in relieving oronasopharyngeal itching,  lacrimation,  or itching
eyes associated with this condition currently is lacking.(169)
  TEXT:
  NASAL ALLERGIES
  [3223]  Antihistamines  are  most  beneficial  in  the  management  of  nasal
allergies.   Seasonal  allergic  rhinitis  (e.g.,   hay  fever)   and perennial
(nonseasonal)  allergic rhinitis are benefited more than perennial  nonallergic
(vasomotor)   rhinitis.  Antihistamines generally provide symptomatic relief of
rhinorrhea, sneezing, oronasopharyngeal irritation or itching, lacrimation, and
red, irritated,  or itching eyes.(100,149,168-170)  The drugs generally are not
effective  in  relieving symptoms of nasal obstruction.(100,170)  Chronic nasal
congestion and headache caused by edema of the paranasal sinus mucosa are often
refractory  to  antihistamine  therapy.   In  the  treatment  of   hay   fever,
antihistamines  are  more  likely to be beneficial when therapy is initiated at
the  beginning  of  the  hay  fever  season  when  pollen   counts   are   low.
Antihistamines  are  less  likely  to be effective when pollen counts are high,
when  pollen  exposure  is   prolonged,    and   when   nasal   congestion   is
prominent.(149,151,168)
  [3223,3003]   Investigators   have   questioned   the   routine,    prolonged
administration  of  fixed  combinations   containing   antihistamines,    nasal
decongestants,      anticholinergics,     analgesic-antipyretics,     caffeine,
antitussives,  and/or expectorants.  Single-ingredient products are safer  than
combination  products,  while also facilitating dosage adjustment.  There is no
evidence that  combinations  containing  2  or  more  antihistamines  are  more
effective  than  one antihistamine or that combinations of subtherapeutic doses
of 2 or more antihistamines are more effective than therapeutic  doses  of  one
antihistamine.   Antihistamine combinations containing an analgesic-antipyretic
and/or nasal decongestant;  an  antitussive  and  nasal  decongestant;   or  an
antitussive  may  be  rational  if  each  ingredient  has demonstrated clinical
effectiveness  and  is  present  in   therapeutic   dosage.(100)    Combination
preparations  generally  should  only  be  used  when symptoms amenable to each
ingredient  are  present   concurrently.(100)    Combinations   containing   an
antihistamine and an expectorant or bronchodilator are irrational.(100)
  OTHER USES
  [3223,3573]  Diphenhydramine and tripelennamine may be used topically for the
temporary relief of itching associated with various skin  conditions  including
minor  burns,   sunburn,   minor cuts or scrapes,  insect bites,  or minor skin
irritations.  [3223,3573] Some antihistamines have also  been  used  for  their
topical  or  local  anesthetic  effects in ophthalmic,  urologic,  proctologic,
gastroscopic, otolaryngologic, and dental procedures.  However,  topical use of
the drugs is generally unwarranted because local hypersensitivity reactions may
result. (See Cautions: Sensitivity Reactions.)
  [3223,3643]  Antihistamines  are  usually not effective in treating bronchial
asthma and should not be used in the treatment of severe acute asthma  attacks.
However, the drugs may be used with caution to treat hay fever in patients with
both  hay  fever  and asthma.  Some clinicians believe that the anticholinergic
effects (e.g., reduction of nasal secretions)  of some of these drugs may cause
thickening  of  bronchial secretions resulting in further airway obstruction in
asthmatics, especially those with status asthmaticus.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3605]  Adverse  effects,   which  vary  in  incidence  and severity with the
individual drug,  are caused by all antihistamines;  however,  serious toxicity
rarely occurs.  Individual patients vary in their susceptibility to the adverse
effects of these drugs which may disappear with continued therapy.  [3605,3253]
Geriatric patients may be particularly susceptible to dizziness, sedation,  and
hypotension.
  CNS EFFECTS
  [3605] CNS depression is common  with  usual  dosage,   especially  with  the
ethanolamine derivatives. Sedation, ranging from mild drowsiness to deep sleep,
occurs most frequently; however, in the treatment of allergies, this effect may
be therapeutically useful. Dizziness,  lassitude,  disturbed coordination,  and
muscular weakness may also occur.  In  some  patients,   the  sedative  effects
disappear  spontaneously  after the antihistamine has been administered for 2-3
days.  [3645] Individuals who perform  potentially  hazardous  tasks  requiring
mental alertness or physical coordination (e.g., operating machinery, driving a
motor  vehicle)   should  be  warned about possible drowsiness,  dizziness,  or
weakness.  [3645,3773] Patients  should  also  be  warned  to  avoid  consuming
alcoholic  beverages while taking antihistamines,  since alcohol may potentiate
these CNS effects.(169) [3645] Patients using diphenhydramine or doxylamine for
self-medication  should  be  warned   that   the   drugs   may   cause   marked
drowsiness.(100,169,197)  [3605] Terfenadine appears to cause fewer adverse CNS
effects,  including effects on psychomotor performance  and  reactivity,   than
other currently available antihistamines.(154-156,159,165,180-191)
  [3605,3253]  Some patients,  especially children,  may experience paradoxical
excitement  characterized  by  restlessness,   insomnia,   tremors,   euphoria,
nervousness,   delirium,   palpitation,   and  even seizures.  [3603,3253,3645]
Patients should be warned that  phenindamine  may  be  particularly  likely  to
occasionally  cause  insomnia  and  nervousness  in  some individuals.(100,169)
[3645,3603]  Antihistamines  may  also  precipitate  epileptiform  seizures  in
patients  with  focal  lesions of the cerebral cortex,  and the drugs should be
administered with caution in patients with seizure disorders.
  GI EFFECTS
  [3605] Adverse GI effects  of  antihistamines  include  epigastric  distress,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.
  SENSITIVITY REACTIONS
  [3603,3625,3573]  Rash  and  photosensitization  may occur;  hypersensitivity
occurs  most  frequently  after  topical  administration   of   antihistamines,
especially   with   the   ethylenediamine   derivatives.    [3625]  Once  local
hypersensitivity to a topically administered  antihistamine  occurs,   systemic
administration  of that drug or any other drug in its chemical class will cause
systemic contact dermatitis.  Cross-sensitivity with other  chemically  related
drugs such as local anesthetics may occur.
  OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS
  [3605]  Adverse  anticholinergic effects of antihistamines include dryness of
mouth, nose, and throat; dysuria; urinary retention; impotence; vertigo; visual
disturbances;  blurred  vision;   diplopia;   tinnitus;   acute  labyrinthitis;
insomnia; tremors; nervousness; irritability; and facial dyskinesia.  Tightness
of the chest, thickening of bronchial secretions,  wheezing,  nasal stuffiness,
sweating,   chills,   early menses,  hypotension or hypertension,  tachycardia,
extrasystoles,  toxic psychosis,  headache,  faintness,  and  paresthesia  have
occurred.
  Rarely, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia,  and
pancytopenia have been reported in patients receiving some antihistamines.
  PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
  [3645] Antihistamines  having  substantial  anticholinergic  activity  (e.g.,
ethanolamines) should be administered with caution, if at all, in patients with
angle-closure   glaucoma,   prostatic  hypertrophy,   stenosing  peptic  ulcer,
pyloroduodenal obstruction,  or bladder neck obstruction.  [3645,3243]  Because
the  anticholinergic  effect  of antihistamines can reduce the volume and cause
thickening  of  bronchial  secretions  which  may  result  in  obstruction   of
respiratory passages,  the drugs should be used with caution and only under the
direction of a  physician  in  patients  with  asthma  or  chronic  obstructive
pulmonary  disease  if  clearance  of  bronchial  secretions is a problem.(169)
[3645] In addition, antihistamines should be used with caution in patients with
increased intraocular pressure,  hyperthyroidism,  cardiovascular disease,   or
hypertension. The drugs are contraindicated in patients with asthmatic attacks.
  [3605,3900] For additional cautions, contraindications, and drug interactions
with  the  phenothiazine derivatives,  see the Phenothiazines General Statement
28:16.08.
  PEDIATRIC PRECAUTIONS
  [3645,3253]  Antihistamines  should  not  be  administered  to  premature  or
full-term  neonates.  Young children may be more susceptible than adults to the
toxic effects of antihistamines.(307,308) (See Acute Toxicity.) Patients should
be warned that children may be at increased risk for experiencing CNS stimulant
effects  with  antihistamines.(100,169,307)   (See  Cautions:   CNS   Effects.)
[3645,3523,3900]  Although the relationship and possible mechanism(s)  have not
been elucidated,(203-207)  respiratory depression,  sleep  apnea,   and  sudden
infant  death  syndrome  (SIDS)  have occurred in a number of infants and young
children  who  were  receiving  usual   dosages   of   phenothiazine-derivative
antihistamines  (i.e.,   promethazine,   trimeprazine).(202,203,206,207)   (See
Cautions:  Pediatric Precautions in Promethazine 4:00 and  Trimeprazine  4:00.)
For additional information, see the individual monographs in 4:00.
  PREGNANCY AND LACTATION
  [3645,3653]  Safe  use  of  antihistamines  during  pregnancy  has  not  been
established;  therefore,  the drugs should not be used in women who are or  may
become  pregnant  unless  the  possible  benefits outweigh the potential risks.
There is considerable controversy regarding the teratogenic potential,  if any,
of  doxylamine,(169,268-271,273-306)   and  the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)  is continuing to  evaluate  data  and  information  to  determine  if  a
relationship  between doxylamine use during pregnancy and adverse fetal effects
exists.(169)  [3645,3653,3900] For additional information,  see the  individual
monographs in 4:00.
  [3645,3873]  Some  manufacturers  state  that  antihistamines  should  not be
administered to nursing women,  since the drugs may inhibit lactation and small
amounts appear to be distributed into milk. In addition, nursing infants may be
at risk for serious adverse effects (e.g.,  CNS effects)  if antihistamines are
present in milk.
  TEXT:
  [3603,3683] Most mild reactions may be relieved by a reduction in  dosage  or
changing to another antihistamine.
  GI EFFECTS
  [3683,3573] GI symptoms may be decreased by administering the drug with meals
or with milk.

  MANIFESTATIONS
  [3613,3253] Although antihistamines have relatively high therapeutic indices,
overdosage may result in death, especially in infants and children.  Overdosage
may cause CNS stimulation and/or depression. In young children, CNS stimulation
is dominant.  Symptoms of  antihistamine  toxicity  in  children  may  resemble
atropine overdosage and include fixed dilated pupils, flushed face,  dry mouth,
fever,   excitation,   hallucinations,   ataxia,   incoordination,   athetosis,
tonic-clonic  seizures,  and postictal depression.  [3619] Overdosage in adults
usually causes CNS depression with drowsiness or coma which may be followed  by
excitement, seizures, and finally postictal depression. [3613,3253] In children
and  adults,   cerebral  edema  and upper nephron nephrosis,  a deepening coma,
cardiorespiratory collapse,  and death may occur.  Symptoms of overdosage occur
within 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingestion;  death may occur within 18 hours.
Acute toxicity has been reported following topical overdosage of tripelennamine
in a child.(213)
  TREATMENT
  [3683] Treatment of acute antihistamine overdosage  consists  of  symptomatic
and supportive therapy including artificial respiration,  if necessary.  If the
patient is conscious, has not lost the gag reflex,  and is not having seizures,
emesis should be induced;  however,  the manufacturer of trimeprazine says that
emesis should not be induced because dystonic reaction of the head and neck may
cause aspiration  of  vomitus.   While  phenothiazine-type  antihistamines  may
exhibit  an  antiemetic  effect,   ipecac  syrup may still be effective in oral
poisonings with these agents if given early (usually  within  1  hour)   before
toxic or antiemetic effects appear. If emesis cannot be induced, gastric lavage
and  administration  of activated charcoal are indicated;  an endotracheal tube
with cuff inflated should be in place to prevent aspiration of vomitus.  Saline
cathartics (e.g., magnesium sulfate)  may be administered.  Vasopressor agents,
such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine,  may  be  administered  if  necessary.
Epinephrine  should  not  be  used,   especially with phenothiazine overdosage,
because epinephrine may lower the blood  pressure  further.   Analeptic  agents
should  not be used since they may cause seizures.  Physostigmine may be useful
to counteract the CNS anticholinergic effects  of  antihistamine  intoxication.
Diazepam  can  be given IV in the management of seizures that do not respond to
physostigmine.  Hyperthermia may be treated with cold packs  or  sponging  with
tepid water; sponging with alcohol should not be used.

  CNS DEPRESSANTS
  [3775] Additive CNS depression may occur when antihistamines are administered
concomitantly with other CNS depressants including barbiturates, tranquilizers,
and  alcohol.   [3775,3643] If antihistamines are used concomitantly with other
depressant drugs, caution should be used to avoid overdosage.
  EPINEPHRINE
  [3775,3643]   Phenothiazine-type   antihistamines    (e.g.,     methdilazine,
promethazine,   trimeprazine)   may block and reverse the vasopressor effect of
epinephrine.  If patients receiving phenothiazines require a vasopressor agent,
norepinephrine or phenylephrine should be used; epinephrine should not be used.
  MONOAMINE OXIDASE INHIBITORS
  [3775]   Monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)   inhibitors  prolong  and  intensify  the
anticholinergic effects  of  antihistamines.   [3775,3643]  Antihistamines  are
contraindicated in patients receiving MAO inhibitors.

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3765]  Antihistamines  may suppress the wheal and flare reactions to antigen
skin testing.(309-317) Considerable interindividual variation in the extent and
duration of suppression have been reported,  depending on the antigen and  test
technique,   antihistamine  and dosage regimen,  time since the last dose,  and
individual response to testing.(309,311,312,316,317)  In one study,  usual oral
dosages  of  chlorpheniramine  or diphenhydramine suppressed the wheal response
for about 2 days after the last dose, promethazine or tripelennamine suppressed
whealing for about 3 days,  and hydroxyzine suppressed  whealing  for  about  4
days.(309)   Combined  use  of  an  H1-   and  H2-antagonist  appears to have a
synergistic suppressive effect on immediate and  late  cutaneous  reactions  to
skin  test  antigens.(316,317)   [3765,3643] Whenever possible,  antihistamines
should be discontinued about 4 days prior to skin testing procedures since they
may prevent otherwise positive reactions to dermal reactivity indicators.
  TEXT:
  [3763] In one study,  topical application  of  an  antihistamine  (i.e.,   2%
pyrilamine  maleate  cream)   to  the  skin  test site 10 minutes after antigen
testing decreased pruritus but did not suppress wheal or flare 10 minutes after
application.(318)

  ABRIDGED TEXT:
  [3575]  Antihistamines are usually administered orally.  [3575,3643] Although
some of these drugs may be given IV, IM, or subcutaneously, most antihistamines
are  not  administered  parenterally  because  they  frequently   cause   local
irritation. Some antihistamines may also be administered topically, but topical
use  of  the  drugs  is  generally  unwarranted  since  local  hypersensitivity
reactions may result.  [3525] Dosage of antihistamines should be individualized
according to the patient's response and tolerance.

uses,  and dosage and administration  of  antihistamines  available  as  single
entities, see the individual monographs in 4:00.
