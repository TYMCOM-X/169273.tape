The following is a response to comments prepared by Jerry Talken dated
August 8, 1986.  I will cover the points in sequence.  Please let me
know of any further concerns or questions.  I expect a meeting should be
setup when we feel we are ready to finalize some of the issues which
have been left to "general customization".  The most significant of
which is probably the user login syntax.  Thank you -Bill

1.  I believe a GED has been sent to Su Heisler for distribution to SWBT.

2.  All of the addressing schemes mentioned in the comments under (2.) are
within the constraints of the proposed implementation.  Since there is some
uncertainty as to exactly what will be desired in the future in view of
evolving standards, I would suggest a supervisor based implementation of
the abbreviated address scheme with any exceptions that develop being
handled at the interface.  This will present a uniform login procedure
across all types of interfaces.

3.  Any abbreviation scheme which is uniform across all interfaces is
probably best implemented in the supervisor.  Any scheme which is unique
to some subset of all interfaces should be implemented in the interface.
The objective is to avoid interface-specific code in the supervisor.  The
impact on SWBT is as follows:
 *  All users are subject to schemes implemented on the supervisor, while
    schemes in the interface may select specific users.
 *  Implementation on the supervisor requires modification of less code.

4.  The example shown in the comments is not correct.  There is no colon
after the options field.  To be more precise, here is the exact syntax
in Backus-Naur Form (BNF):

<login-string>	::=  <option-field> <user-field> <host-field> <password-field>
<option-field>	::=  <NULL>  |  <options>
<options>	::=  <control-char>  |  <control-char> <options>
<user-field>	::=  <user-name>  |  <X.121-spec>
<user-name>	::=  <alpha-char>  |  <alpha-char> <non-term-chars>
<host-field>	::=  <NULL>  |  ":" <host-spec>
<host-spec>	::=  <host-number>  |  <host-name>  |  <X.121-spec>
<host-number>	::=  "*"  |  <num-chars>  |  <num-chars> "." <num-chars>
<host-name>	::=  <alpha-char>  |  <alpha-char> <non-term-chars>
<X.121-spec>	::=  "-" <DNIC> <NTN>  |  "-" <RPOA> "-" <DNIC> <NTN>
<DNIC>		::=  <num-char> <num-char> <num-char> <num-char>
<NTN>		::=  <num-chars>
<RPOA>		::=  <num-char> <num-char> <num-char> <num-char>

<non-term-chars>::=  <non-term-char>  |  <non-term-char> <non-term-chars>
<num-chars>	::=  <num-char>  |  <num-char> <num-chars>

<control-char>	::=  <CONTROL-A>-<CONTROL-Z>
<non-term-char>	::=  <alpha-num-char>  |  "*"  |  "."  |  "-"  |  "#"
<alpha-num-char>::=  <alpha-char>  |  <num-char>
<alpha-char>	::=  "A"-"Z"
<num-char>	::=  "0"-"9"

This represents the standard syntax.  SWBT customization would alter the
syntax slightly.  Differences include:
 *  Implied DNIC with a leading 1 to flag a DNIC follows.
 *  Extraneous "-" "(" ")" "+" " " ignored.

5.  Options are simply control characters.  There is no change proposed
from the existing options (e.g. ^I=interactive, ^R=flow-control, etc.).

6.  The ability to assign arbitrary addresses to ports has existed only
for incoming calls.  The address currently generated by Tymnet for an
outgoing call is a function of the host and port numbers.  To allow an
arbitrary address for outgoing calls, it will be necessary to assemble
a table of addresses into each interface in addition to the central
validation in the Master User Directory (MUD).  Perhaps the trade-off
involved here requires more discussion.

7.  This falls out of the way a host name is validated.

8.  If only one PIN per account were to be allowed, there would be no
restriction on the character set used in the PIN.  If more than one PIN
per account is required, the PIN would be limited to the characters which
are legal in a user name.  This includes all alphanumeric characters and
some punctuation.

9.  Development cost and time for Subnet Confinement Facility (SCF) and
a PC based validation aid are not included in the $150,000 figure.

It is correct the two user access profile entries are required for each
LATA as a result of IC preselect.  It is also correct that the maximum
is 58 entries.  Section 4.5 and Table 4 state that 57 is the typical
size for a normal user, not the maximum.  We will be able to handle at
least 64 access profile entries which would allow for an expansion of
3 more LATAs.

There is no way planned to force a user to specify an RPOA.  One way
which comes to mind is to define a host, NEED-RPOA, and give it a
message, "Error, no carrier preselected, please specify RPOA.".  The
NEED-RPOA host would then be specified as if it were the preselected
carrier's gateway in the user access profile.  It would also appear
in all gateway group definitions.  Note that the host would not need
to actually exist, but only have a number assigned.

10.  Yes, since a separate host name is validated for each LATA for
each RPOA, the intra-LATA-with-RPOA blocking capability can be enabled
or disabled based on the LATA or the carrier, or both.

11.  I believe this is what is intended, but I will have to check with
the X.25/X.75 interface people.  Should X.25 users have the abbreviated
form or the canonical form?
