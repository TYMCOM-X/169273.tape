Subject: 8BBS - CBBS Differences

    8BBS is generally implemented as a superset of the CBBS program running
on Ward & Randy's system in Chicago.  As nearly as we can tell, 8BBS does
everything that CBBS does except for reporting the number of characters sent
by the system and the caller.  There are many subtle enhancements in 8BBS
that may not be apparent to someone used to CBBS.  Some of these are...
 . 8BBS Has several features connected with your name that are automatically
        set whenever you dial in. These include such things as terminal
        characteristics (nulls, echo, line-feed) and whether you are a
        novice or expert user (The "U" function is used to set these)
 . 8BBS Allows you to define a password that must be used for you to log in.
 . 8BBS Tells you when you have a message waiting. It also tells you the
        range of the new messages since your last time on the system.
 . 8BBS Allows you to sequentially retrieve messages (that is, you can
        automatically read all the messages from any starting point
        by the use of the "^" or "-" characters during retrieve.)
 . 8BBS Allows messages to be 'private' i.e. they can be read (or
        summarized) only by the sender or receiver).
 . 8BBS Allows you to see previous users ("Z" function)
 . 8BBS Allows you to yell for and talk to the operator ("Y" function)
 . 8BBS Allows you to set your terminal width ("F" function)
 . 8BBS Reports message range on Retrieve and Summary functions.

      8BBS supports comm line speeds of 110, 150 and 300 baud. The
character format is 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity.  Someday this
may be expanded to allows other formats and higher baud rates.

      If you notice any other differences, please let us know!

Subject: 8BBS#1 Hardware/software

This system uses a DIGITAL PDP 8/E Minicomputer system
with 32K of core (yup, core!) memory, two 1.5 Mby hard
surfaced disk drives (RK05J's), dual floppies (RX01),
DECtape (TU56), clock, powerfail/autorestart,
printer (LA180), video console (VT52W), a Novation
4103B autoanswer modem, and various other assorted
stuff.
The 8BBS software runs under OS/8 Commercial BASIC,
with a machine code (PAL 8) communications package.
The operating system is OS/8 (which is very much like
CP/M in at least it's commands).



Message number 3 is 113 lines from SYSOP
To All at 01:23:45 on 12-Nov-80.
Subject: 8BBS Revision History, Ver: 2.1 to 3.9

02-Jul-80: Version 3.9

   Bug fixes; logs user to log file as soon as he logs
in, no longer crashes if user enters long names.  S and
Q summaries also show message range.

26-May-80: Version 3.8

   Added Z function to allow a user to see previous
callers in reverse chronological order.

23-May-80: Version 3.7

   Fixed bug with multiple entries in USR files for
the same user.

21-MAY-80: Version 3.6

   A few things were changed due to user comments.
1. You can get the messages since your last call
   by typing "S;1,D"
2. Read protected messages need no passwords.
3. Messages with lots of blanks unpack right now
4. SYSOP is notified of unsuccessful (K)ill attempts
   so that we can kill messages you forgot the
   password to. 

 8-MAY-80: Version 3.5

   Lots of bug fixes, and some enhancements to existing
code were added here. TALK to Sysop is a little better,
message retreive gives the message limits (except to
experts).

28-APR-80: Version 3.4A

   Added (Y), Yell for Sysop function and (O), Other
BBS systems function. 

24-APR-80: Version 3.4

   Added a blank line between message summaries, user 
name in upper or lower case now matches for private
message retrieval.

22-APR-80: Version 3.3

   This version now does message packing to optimize
usage of the available disk space.

21-APR-80: Version 3.2

   This version now has a utility that the SYSOP can use 
to TALK with a caller on-line.

20-APR-80: Version 3.1

   The recipient of private (read protected) messages
no longer need know the password in order to read them.

19-APR-80: Version 3.0

   This version has line feed on/off support.

17-APR-80: Version 2.9

   This version has an improved operator TALK facility.
It also supports read password protection. That is, a 
message cannot be read without the password.

13-APR-80: Version 2.8

   This has a few bug fixes (i.e. message edit bug).
It also has a feature that allows you to specify
terminal parameters (rubout type, etc) to be used each
time that you log in. See (H)elp keyword USER for more info.

7-APR-80: Version 2.7

   The new user help is more extensive then before. Also,
a bug that kept you from getting some help files has been
fixed. Also, the echo of input is in the same case as what
is typed (i.e. if you type in lower case, but the system
is in upper only, it still echoes in lower case.)  The
(G)et message and message password protection features are
now implemented.

3-APR-80: Version 2.6.

   This version has better modem control code (i.e. it works).
Also, the selective summary feature is also in.

2-APR-80: Version 2.5

   This version has faster message retrieve and summaries,
carrier detection, and (finally) does message flagging.
(That is, if you have been left a message, then you will
be told.)  If you have noticed any bugs/problems or things
that you don't like, tell us. (Please don't say something
like 'This system stinks!'. Tell us why)!

22-MAR-80: Version 2.4

   New functions! Now have message storage / retreival
capabilities.

15-MAR-80: Version 2.1

   Initial version. Wish us luck!
your comments in the Goodbye section.
      Dick
                                                        




Message number 4 is 67 lines from SYSOP
To All at 01:23:45 on 12-Nov-80.
Subject: 8BBS Revision History, Ver: 4.0 to 4.9

 5-Sep-80: Version 4.9

   Fixed problem with new user getting incorrect messages. 
The terminal width Fold point code works again.  Also fixed
problems with sequential message retrieve starting at a
non-existent message #.

19-Aug-80: Version 4.8

   A text entry bug was fixed. Also, added support for 110
and 150 baud.

16-Aug-80: Version 4.7

   A 'get message' bug was fixed. Also, a high message
number report bug was fixed.

13-Aug-80: Version 4.6

   You can now specify sequential retrieval similar to the
Q and S commands. For example, to read all the messages to
you since number 1000, you can type R, then '1000,t=john doe'.
The specifiers are T for to, F for from, S for subject. Typing
'R;1000,-' lists all messages starting at number 1000.
   Also, the message range is updated at logout and the
question about leaving comments treats just a RETURN as a no.

 4-Aug-80: Version 4.5

   Internal code cleanup, fixed message flagging bug,
added ^C code for Z function.

30-Jul-80: Version 4.4

   Added on line SYSOP commands, fixed bug with TAB after
72 characters, fixed bug in logout hours.

22-Jul-80: Version 4.3

   Some login code and file size parameters were changed
to allow slightly faster checking of the user name file.
We also added sequential message retrieve capability using
the "^" character.

19-Jul-80: Version 4.2

   A lot of code was re-written and cleaned up for this
version. 8BBS now has a line width setting feature. Also,
we now convert TABS to spaces so that users that don't
support them will be able to read messages with embedded
TABS.

10-Jul-80: Version 4.1

   We have added a feature that allows a user to define
a password. This keeps other users from dialing in with
your name. Also, the system prints the range of the
messages entered since your last call.

 4-Jul-80: Version 4.0

   We put in a few fixes in this version to help improve
system reliability. The date rolls over at midnight, and
your time on the system is reported correctly if you stay
over midnight. Another change is that read protected
messages cannot be summarized by anyone but the sender
or receiver.

Subject: Faster log on procedure

Some users have asked if there is a fast way to log into 8BBS. 
The following procedures will get you on in a minimum ammount
of time.  After you press RETURN, type C or ^C to stop the
'Welcome' text. The 1st question asks if this is your first
time on the system. At this point you can enter answers to
several questions. If you have a UPPER/lower case terminal you
can type, "n;Joe;Smith;y" or "N;N;JOE;SMITH;Y" if you are using
an UPPER case only terminal.  Try to be sure to enter your name
correctly.  { Bernard }

To All at 19:05:21 on 22-Jul-80.
Subject: 'Nuther Nifty.. the ^

       8BBS Ver 4.3 now supports sequential message retrieval.  This feature
allows you to retrieve all available messages after a specifed message 
number.  This means you no longer have to type in each message number you
wish to retrieve.  Sequential message retrieval is activated by using the
"^" character. (Usually shift-6).  It works very much like the ^ on ABBS.
       Some examples...
Function: R;1100;^     tells 8BBS to retrieve messages starting at msg 1100.
Message: 1140;^    will retrieve msg 1140 and later messages.
       or if you are in Message Retrieve and have already retrieved a msg
Message: ^     will continue to retrieve sequential messages after the last
       message retrieved.  Remember, the  ^  is only valid after an initial
message number has been specified.
       Use S,s or ^S,^Q to suspend and resume transmission.  You can also
still use C,^C or O,^O to skip messages that don't interest you.

Subject: 8BBS User Password

    Optional system access password is now available for
those users that wish to use this feature.  This feature
can be used to prevent anyone else from logging in to
8BBS under your name.  This prevents someone from using
your name to read your private messages or leaving 
embarrassing messages under your good name.   To set up 
your password, use the U function.  If no password is
specified, the system will not ask you for one, if
you install your password, you WILL need it to gain
access to 8BBS on future logins.  Remember, the system
access password is optional and is for those who
wish to use it.   Regards,  { Bernard }

Subject: Lost or Missing Messages

Hi Patrick (and others),
       Occasionally when you log in the system will tell you that
"There are new messages for you, Numbers: XXXX, YYYY, ZZZZ".
You might find that when you attempt to Read one of those messages
that it no longer exists.  This can happen because the person that
left the message changed his mind and deleted it, or if you haven't
been on the system for a long time the message might have been
purged out.
       When the system tells you that there are new messages for
you it doesn't mean that they still exist, it means that at one
time those messages were entered for you and are NOT neccessarily
still available.
       Regards,..

Hi Jim,
   The Read Protect msg code has been written to allow secure messages even
for those users that don't have an access password.  Currently only the
SYSOP can kill a RP msg.  RP msg's are not (G)et'able during msg entry.  We
may be able to change some of these restrictions with the next version.

Subject: Selective msg search

Hi Ian,
   I don't know much about optimal search algorithms, but 8BBS has a
selective search algorithm that DOES allow you to find a match if the
arg is found anywhere in the search field.  You asked about the "To:"
field;  you could enter  R;4800,T=MACK  that would retrieve all msg's
above #4800 that had the string "MACK" anywhere in the "To:" field.
   This also works for the "From:", "Subject:" and "Date:" fields.  
If you go to NOVICE mode, I think the Q or S commands ask you if you
want to learn how to search.  The HELP file also contains info.  Regards,..

This msg may be of interest to those engaged in activities that would
cause concern to PT&T.  
   Be aware that PT&T security DOES log into 8BBS looking for 'incriminating
material' that might be of use in their investigations.
   Also note that there is reason to believe that certain other 8BBS users
are working for PT&T security on a 'contract basis'.  That is, they give the
'appearance' of being active, helpful phone-computer phreaks (even though
working for PT&T).
   I've also seen a msg on the SC CBBS that indicated that several gov't
agencies and police dep'ts are co-ordinating their monitoring activities
of public access message systems.

Some examples:

 R;-200,S=DEC   scans last 200 msg's for 'DEC' in 'Subject'
 R;2000,D=JAN   gets any msg's entered in January
Upper or lower case will match.

Subject: Insides of telephones

Normally, there are three wires which come out of a telephone, red
and green, which are used for "TIP and RING" -- the stuff needed to
make the phone work (Tip refers to the tip of a phone jack, Ring to
the center or RING connector, and sleeve (which doesn't normally go
to phones) is the sleeve of the jack.
 
The yellow wire may not be connected to anything inside.  In the
old days it was connected to one side of the bell in order to make
it easy to set up party lines.  Now it usually goes to nothing.
 
Your switchhook is connected to the red and green (it's a double
pole switch, usually) and all of the rest of the phone EXCEPT the
bell is on the far side of the switchhook, disconnected from the
line when not in use.
 
The bell usually has four wires.  Two of them go to the capacitor
which is between the A and the K terminals.  The other two go to
the line (RED and GREEN, but sometimes one goes to YELLOW).  If
the bell is out of the circuit, there is nothing connected to the
line when the phone is on hook.

Subject: New ONYX in Santa Cruz

     There is a new ONYX Systems Inc. computer in Santa Cruz.
ONYX is a Z-8000 version of UNIX Version-7.  It has many editors
and file-utilities, and a few games.  The number is:
(408) 425-8000 (300 baud)
once you are connected, type a few @'s, and then type
(in lower case) 'guest' and press return.  There is no password,
and you will be immediately logged in.  This account has all
the priveledges of regular accounts.  The system can only hold 8
people at a time, so I do not encourage lots of people to use it
at once.  Once you are logged in, wait for the prompt '% '.
Then you can enter commands.  Almost all commands are program names.
The 'shell' (command parser) has a few commands of it's own, but
you will not use those features of it very much at the beginning.
Some control-char commands are:
control-c: interrupt
control-x: kill current line
control-s: stop output temporarily
control-q: re-start output
control-h: erase last character (will not visually erase it)
Continued in next message.

Unfortunately, the system has a lousy help system (there is no
command 'help' per se).  The 'man' command, which looked up sections
in the UNIX User's manual, does not work any more, as we were
running out of disk space, and the manual too up too much.  If you
use this system, and don't know about unix, I recommend you get the
"Unix User's Manual, Version-7".  To get a list of commands,
type:
ls /bin /usr/bin /usr/ucb/bin
Here are some important commands:
ls: list files in '.' (current directory)
    in the form "ls dirname' it will list files in 'dirname'
    in the form "ls filename" it will list "filename"
cd dirname: change default directory (.) to "dirname"
who: find out who is on the system
logout (or control-d): log out of the system
ex: form usually 'ex filename': edit "filename"
ps: find out your current processes
write: in the form "write username": write to 'username' (if logged in)
mail: in the form "mail username" sends mail to username (does
      not have to be logged in).  Type in message.  End with newline

From previous message:
     and control-d
     in the form "mail", sees if you have mail.
cat filename: prints 'filename' on your terminal.
All files, except ones in your default directory, take the form:
/dirname
or
/filename
of
/dirname/filename
or
/dirname/dirname/filename
or
/dirname/dirname/dirname/... etc.  each '/' shows a link between a directory
and a file. (which might be another directory, etc.).  The file
structure is the typical branching binary tree, with dirs nested
in dirs nested in dirs, etc. ending in the file you want.
The root directory is '/' so 'ls /' will give you a list of everything
at the top.  Anyway, that is all for now.  Try it out, and let me know
what you think on this system.         -Tim Bessie (tim @ ONYX)

Subject: 8BBS V5.6 Changes

The latest version of 8BBS has a few changes that should make
things happen faster for most users. The user name search routine
has been completely rewritten to speed up searches.
Now, when you leave a read protected message, the system makes sure
that the user's name is known before the message is entered.
In previous versions, this was not checked, and the message was
unreadable.
A problem that caused the number of nulls saved for a user to be
corrupted has been fixed. You should set the number of nulls that
you want, and then use the U function to save the setting.
If you notice any problems with this version, let us know.

Subject: Msg# 801 on SC CBBS

Have you had a chance to read the interesting msg on SC CBBS from Michael
Starr?  It says that PT&T is using a TRS-80 as an input monitor to 'record'
ALL data that is entered into this system.  That would include your names,
locations, and contents of RP msg's.  Should this be of any concern to
you?
   I'm interested in knowing how many users are using just a 'dumb' terminal
and how many users have some form of programmable 'computing' power
available.  It wouldn't be too dificult to encrypt msg's before entering
them.  If you have a 'smart' system it could also be used to decrypt the
msg's you get back.
   Even if SC CBBS msg# 801 is a 'fake' or just a scare, it might be fun
to do some experimenting with msg encryption/decryption.  Let me know
if you are interested.  Regards,.. (to PT&T's TRS-80 also).

Subject: New system

New system up in California,software is still
undergoing revision so if you have any *reasonable* suggestions
I will consider implementing them,it's running on an HP-2000 (*Augh*)
but what can I say, The Public access acct# is B007 w/no password,
for those of you lucky enough to have avoided HP 2000's the format
is HEL-B007,,1 preceded by a few Carriage returns & linefeeds (To get
the systems attention) It will eventually say "PLEASE LOG IN" at
which point you type the above.It is more or less multi-user tho
if someone is using one of the files for whatever program you
happen to be running you get put on hold. Also yes,there is a
Chat mode for users to talk to eachother. And of course (almost
thought I was going to forget didn't ya) the dialup numbers to get
onto this thing are: (415) 653-2152, 653-7202 & 7203 (Rotary)
Please don't abuse it or we will definatly lose it,the operator
will yank the account if he gets any attempted crashing ect..
Have fun & give it a call.

THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONCERN THAT THE PHILADELPHIA CONFERENCE
WILL ATTRACT CERTAIN TYPES OF LOW-LIFE. NO, NOT JUST COMPUTER
AND PHONE HACKERS, BUT TELEPHONE SECURITY, AND POLICE.
SO FAR, SECURITY ON THE CONFERENCE HAS BEEN A LUCKY ACCIDENT.
THAT MEANS THAT SINCE WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WAS GOING TO
BE HELD, WE ALL KEPT IT "SECRET". NOW THAT A LOCATION HAS
BEEN FOUND, WE ARE STILL ONLY INFORMING THOSE WITH "NEED TO
KNOW". IF, IN FACT, THE FORCES OF LAW AND BELL SHOULD TRY TO
BREAK UP THE MEETING, IT MIGHT DO THEM SOME GOOD TO CONSIDER
ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION. IF THEY BUST THAT MANY PHREAKS, WHAT
COULD THEY ALL DO WITH THEIR LAST PHONE CALL? BESIDES, THEY WOULD
MUCH RATHER ATTEND AND LEARN THE PHREAK STATE OF THE ART.
IT WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN BUSTING, AND GIVE THEM A GREATER
NET RETURN. IF THEY STILL BUST AFTER READING THIS MESSAGE,

thing to have nasty actions taken

if something nasty has happened to
you  and you are mad and need someone
to jump on. But to jump on  somepone

After reading the messages to/from Our Friend Harry, the thought

he is unable to get any other way. Maybe he's known to a few phreaks
by his real name, and the phreaks are refusing to give him numbers,

OK my friends, there are alot of claims of daring-do when it
comes to inside knowledge (and finding out inside knowledge)
of The Phone Company. In many Telcos are such things as the First
Wednesday report. They used to be compiled on the first Wednesday
of each month. Can someone get ahold of a First Wednesday for
two or three exchanges in San Jose? I'd be curious to see what
all the busy signals are doing to the 296 exchange. Would this be
any reason for concern on Pacific Bell's part? All you "Social
Engineers" (a term for those who get their info from sweet
talking telco personnel) should co-ordinate your activities, so
that 4 of you aren't getting the same data at once, thereby
causing some REAL concern.

Hi Steve,
   I presume you are not discouraged about the effort required to get

   For a while we did show the connect time in the Z file, but it doesn't
quite all fit on a 80 char line if a user has a long name and long location.
New users are the greatest abusers in terms of length of stay, but I'd
guess that the average is about 20 mins.  Regards,..

Hi Russell,
   Sorry 'bout your uncooperative printer.  I can't think of anything
that 8BBS does that would cause problems at 110 baud.  You do hit
RETURN at least 3 times to get down to 110 don't you?  The first 2 times
will give garbage printout. Or else you could use the 'A' function to 
alter the baud rate.  We send 2 stop bits, 8 data bits, no parity.

       From reading your marginally-readable messages on
this system, it is apparent you do not make use of the
handy line-editor that SYSOP has deigned to be incorpor-
ated in 8BBS.
 
       We have heard you, and other retarded typers,
lament, "I haven't had time to learn the editor."
 
       And I say to you and these others, this is not
not a matter of time, but a matter of apathy!
 
       Before you SAVE your next garbled message, do
the 'H' command to learn about EDIT, LIST, and most
importantly: RETYPE.

Hi Kerry,
   There is no fixed policy regarding msg deletion.  Some get deleted
immediatly (if neccessary).  Others get deleted by the recipent, but
most of them just lay around 'til I get ready to do a file 'squish'
when I remove many old messages.  'Old' generally meaning greater than
500 msg's ago.  Often if the 'Subject' has some coherent info in it, it
may stay around longer.  I usually do a 'squish' sometime early in the
week to reclaim disk space.  
   The user log that is seen with the 'Z' function usually gets cleared
every evening after work.

I may even give my awesome weapon to some unstable country like

have to worry about it. In case you are curious,the device I plan
to use will probably be some form of anti-proton packet in a magnetic

rip most of the crust off,then secondary charges will smash the earths

Subject: Interesting VT100 Escape sequences

The following escape sequences have bizarre effects on VT100
terminals:
 
$[2;9y         Infinite Self Test
 
$[154q         Solid Tone
 
$[155q         "Sticky Fingers" -- high speed auto-repeat and "music"
 
For all of these, the terminal must be in ANSI mode, so it may be
appropriate to send a $< first, just in case.
 
To get out of Infinite Self Test, most terminal users will have to
resort to the power switch, although unplugging the keyboard long
enough to allow it to fail the keyboard test is more clever.  The
other two can be stopped with a "SET-UP"->Reset -- as long as the
Set-up key hasn't been disabled...

Why are you using such a primitive weapon? I mean, no
offense intended (it must be tough to reinvent the wheel)
but it really is out of date. Modern planetary destructors
are using mucch more efficient and economical devices. One
example: if you shop around you can get an unstable sun
really cheap, these are loots of fun to drop on a planet,
you can even just put it in orbit around the original sun
and let thhe people fry for a while -- if you're doing
extorsion you can really change public opinion. I won't
bore you with more devices; get onto 7BBS, i don't recall
the number, there are a lot of planet-phreaks out there
who would be glad to tell you oof the best methods of
destroying planets. Have fun!!

An effective method would be to get a spaceship of about 75,000 tonnes
capacity, fill it with water and drive it into the sun, aiming it such
that the resultant flare comes out at the earth. >>>>sizzle<<<<
 
You could do the same thing with an asteroid, or a chunk of ice from
Saturn's rings, but the water is easer to get, and more effective
than the rock.

Hi Mark,
   Yes, we are working on having the 'Z' function always show some
number of previous users.  Maybe the version 5.7 will have it.
   About the 8/L, I personally would have no interest in it since
it is not hardware compatable with all the other Omnibus equipment
I have.  I do know of someone who might be very interested in it if
it is in working condition and has 8K of memory.  Please leave more

Dear Dave;
I know the name of the file the disk was innitted with because
Cubby Crasher (whoever that is), called me and told me to tell
you that the file was called Y just so that you knew the crash
was "in the family" rather than a total stranger...
And you dare to challenge phone phreaks??
I'm surprised your system lasted as long as it did...
 
By the way, remember that RSTS system you had at work??  Well,
you installed a patch in the monitor that will enable you to
log into a privved account without a password from any account.
Want the corresponding syscall????
Maybe it can be discussed; the alternative, of course, is that
any time anyone ut sends to KB0 that the system goes bye-bye...
Something needs to be modified:  I suggest you get off your lying
a-double-s and do it before they "notice"...
 
And STOP being such a JERK to everyone.

friends could get together and maintain a mutual account for
the benifit of all. After all, if you want to take the first
step in the direction of aiding the communication companies,
isn't this the logical choice? Just make sure that your partner
is relyable and you can split the costs. If you are ambitious,
you can get a lot of friends together and you shouldn't have
any trouble in making the minimum for the all-day service for
Sprint.

I believe that the amount of control one
has over ones life is still a very
very open question. There have been
many people who believe we have no
control over our lives and those who
believe we have total control over our
lives. Thefre are those  who cons up
what seem to be fudge-factorz like
"karma"  where if one has unexplainable bad or i presume good
events in this life that one doesn't
deserve, it can be convieniently
dteremined to that they are results
of actions in your past lives.
I do not know if  they  are right
but I  do know that the quesrtions
are still far too open for anyone
to pontificate on as thats they
wasy it is type of stuff..
Have fun Sends Steve

Subject: Personal message neatness

Hi Dan,
   Yes, your suggestion could be implemented.  I think PMS does most of
what you describe.  I doubt if 8BBS will do any of that tho.  Possible
ways to help in cleaning up personal messages would be to do a 'Q'uick
summary of msg's TO you and another 'Q'uick summary of msg's FROM you.
This would give you the msg #'s on the screen.  You could then use the
following multi-msg kill format:
   K;1020;Y;K;2312;Y;K;3309;Y    to kill messages.    Regards,..

Subject: New *SECURE* Message System!!!

There is a new message system that I have created.  I have not
yet implimented all the commands yet, but you may read/write/list
messages on it, enter the regular operating system (Z-8000 ONYX
Unix V7), read various bulletins (which aren't there yet), and
send mail to someone on the arpanet (spooled for auto-dialer
sending).  You can log in for free, but the program itself
requires an account and password.  This system cannot be broken in
any way that I know of, unless someone has the idea that they should
delete all the program file, which I have protected anyway.  The
password will also only be given out to people who I KNOW (or who
can be vouched for) being actual phreaks, or non-FBI/telco/informer
types.  If you would like an account, send mail to TIM@MC
on ARPA, call me at (408) 425-0754/0842 during the evening, or
leave me a RP message here.  Once you have an account, I will
take almost any good advice and impliment it.  So, you get
user-oriented, secure, and powerful (once on the system).  Have
fun!

Subject: Planatary destruction

Now what do you mean by that? Are you suggesting that
my metheods are inefficient?? Anti-matter devices yield
a 100% energy conversion (E=M*[E*E]) as opposed to the
crude 11-14% of atomic energy weopons,besides,do you know
how much it costs to import a small unstable sun?? I'vee looked
over the prices & believe me,they're not worth the price.
Now of course I've contemplated just sending our own sun into
a Supernovae which would also do the job but I'm concerned about
the lack of sufficient visual effects in supernovae explosions
From what I hear from friends with experience in such matters,
supernovae explosions characteristly only contain the yellow
and green areas of the spectrum with insufficcient amounts of
red & green colors that add so much to the display,there's no
effect to just a blinding flash of light & radiation,with an
anti-matter explosion I can tailor it towards a more visual
display & greater effect as planetary breakup occurs.

Subject: Starting With Genisis...

Anton:
I have a legitimate question about the Bible; I have asked the
local Jehova's Witnesses about this when they make their neighbour-
hood intrusions, and none of them have been able to provide an answer:
In Genisis, God created Adam and Eve, right? And they were the ONLY
two people on the Earth, being that they were the FIRST man and woman.
-----With me so far??      Good!-----
NOW, Adam and Eve do their thing and have a couple of kids, namely
Cain and Abel, right?  Okay, here's my question:  If Adam and Eve,
and their sons Cain and Abel are the only four people on the face of
the Earth, how is it that one of them travels off to the land of Nod
and picks himself up a wife??
I have never understood where that wife came from, if God has only
created one couple that had two kids...
Let me know what you come up with...

Subject: 8's and 11's

Hi John,
   I use a PDP8/E for this system.  It runs OS/8 V3D with 8BBS written
in a combination of Commercial BASIC and PAL-8 assembler.  I'm quite
biased in favor of the Omnibus 8's (8A,8E,8F,8M), since I'm convinced
they are the most reliable processors that DEC has ever made.  From my
experience with PDP11's it seems that there is a certain amount of
inherent unreliability built in due to the use of the Unibus.  But...
I'd really have to recommend that you seriously consider some type of
11 since the 8 is really passe' (no more software/hardware funding).
I'd suggest some type of 11/23 config with RL or RX mass storage.  You
could then run RT-11, RSX-11 and lots of other 11 software I don't even
recall the names for.  Regards,..

Subject: When you get asked who called

Sometime in the life of almost every hacker there comes a call
from SOMEONE YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO because they are trying
to get you to LET A FRIEND'S CAT OUT OF THE BAG.
 
You have to make them go away, but without drawing undue suspicion
to yourself.  There are a number of things you can do:
       1. Hang up the phone.  Don't slam it down; just gently replace
          the receiver on the hook.  (Advice from Bell security...)
       2. Say, "I can't hear you very well; we must have a poor
          connection."  Then, while you wait for them to call back,
          forward your calls to a non-working number recording.
       3. Tell them, "I have lots and lots of friends all over the
          country.  I don't remember who called."  But don't get
          drawn into a conversation; they'll get something out of you.
       4. Tell them, "I'm sorry, you'll have to do your own accounting."
 
NOONE is allowed to make annoyance calls to you.  Not SPRINT security,
not even Bell security.
 
But remember, ANYONE can find out who you are, given your phone number.

    Well, for Mike, and amyone else who might stumble opon
this lovly message with about 100 different misspellings, heres
the story of the PDP-10!
     The PDP-10 has many differnt functions that make is a very fast,
reliable, and unsecure system (unless promptly modified).  At the top
of the list is REACT ofcource..this is the program that sets up, kills,
changes, etc. to accounts (PPNs as called by DEC [Project,Programmer Number]).
Then there is DIRECT...This is the program used (called) by the command
DIR..If you just R DIRECT, you will get a standard command prompt (*), and
be able to get multiple, and wildcard directories...eather to a file, printer,
or any other logical/phisical device on the system that is avaible to you to
assign.  I believe that DIRECT has a HELP command (well, it should), if not,
just type HELP DIRECT, and get more then enough info!  Then there is that
good old program that is so oftenly used, PIP!  PIP can be used for a veriety o
f
nast things (Sorry about that last line, went too many chrs. on 14, and got
carry over to 15!!).  PIP is used basicly by saying TTY:=...... (same with
DIRECT).  You can view directories:
TTY:=P,PN/F or /L[1,1]  What your doing is listing out the file in account 1,1
(the MFD) of the account specified by P,PN.....Continued.......

Subject: Unlimited Access to Anything!!

Dear Sam;
I have left two messages for you:  One is public and one is private.
The reason is that you have asked for assistance in an area that just
happens to be my other major hobby, and an actual paying occupation
for several years.  This animal is called ACCESS.
(I assume that you want the press passes to gain entry to places that
one normally wouldn't have access to...If I am wrong, please correct me.)
My Background:  It started with Rock Concerts.  I devised about 15 sure-
fire ways to get backstage(and consequently see the show for free), and
I have hundreds of variations of these 15 major access techniques to
get me in anywhere I want, no matter what.  I have even considered
writing a book on this subject due to my vast experience in this area.
It's really basic:  No door is closed to me if I want in.  Because I
will try and try until I DO get in.  When there is a will, there is a way.
If anybody on this BBS would like information, advice, or help on 
getting in somewhere, let me know!!  I'll be glad to help!!  But BEWARE!

Subject: what??? I think you flunked physics...

...Because "nucleons" is simply another word for "sub-atomic particles"
which includes electrons, protons, etc. So when you said that the
Siberia meteor was "a collection of nucleons", you were right; no
matter *what* it was, it was atoms of some sort. 
 
Now, if you're thinking of cold fusion, where the electron in an atom
is replaced with a muon, which then acts as a catlyst for fusion,
that might work. I say MIGHT, because  a) muons don't last long
enough, and  b) cold fusion will only work with hydrogen anyhow.

Hi Steve,

how to implement PAN.  Perhaps you could give me some idea of what would
be required to duplicate PAN functionality on another CPU type?
   You're the 1st person to ask to RP a msg after entering it.  Seems
like something a person might want to do at times.  But... it would
require a departure from the CBBS standard that we try to emulate.  It
would actually make more sense to ask the "Protect (K/R/N):?" question
just before saving it, but I think it will remain as-is for quite some

Hi Eric,
   Sounds like what you want is a MOSTEK MK5086N integrated tone
dialer chip.  I have a couple of these devices along with the
data sheets. (For sale if you want).  But you should really
consider the newer MK5087N which is a direct replacement for the
old MK5086, but with improved performance.  The MK5087 is available
from Wyle Distribution in Santa Clara.
   If you want a FCC number or "REN", (Ringer Equivalence Number)
all you have to do is visit your local computer store and look
at the bottom side of some of the direct connect modems.  Even
easier is to stop by a store that sells phone answering machines
or auto-dialers and take a look at the #'s.  Regards,.

  As you can see in the welcome, 8BBS doesn't take 600 baud.
However, messages not of enduring interest usually get killed
in a couple weeks, so you really won't have that much to go
through.  Those of us lucky enough to get through every few
days find about 150 messages a week (NOT counting the RP
ones we can't see) to wade through.

Hi Mark,
   Yes, I did kill off a lot of old msg's recently.  I usually do a purge
of old msg's around the first of the week.  I try to keep the total # of
active msg's around 400.  Most users complain that there are TOO MANY
msg's on here.  I don't have time to read each msg before I kill it, so
I go by the 'Subject'.  If it has something like 'Chat', 'Call me',
'Hello there...', etc.. it is more likely to be deleted than a msg
about a specific topic.  Regards,..

Hi Bill,

If it is less than 1 sec. the 8BBS modem will not hang up on you.  If
your modem is the one that is disconecting perhaps there are some
internal jumper or switch settings that can be changed to prevent
immediate disconect on loss of carrier.  Regards,..

 Help.
   Has anyone else had this problem?
     Frequently when I dial-up a BBS (using SPRINT)
and get a busy signal, then hang up, I find that my
phone is DEAD.  Sometimes this lasts for just a few
minutes...but at times it has lasted for HOURS!
(and folks, I'm not even doing anything illegal!
....yet, anyway!)
     It hasn't happened on dialing local numbers,
only using SPRINT.  It isn't the phone (the phone will
work using another line), it's the line.  When I call
the 'dead' line from another line I get a busy signal.
     Would really like to hear any suppositions.  This
(as you can imagine) has got me climbing the walls
sometimes!

Hi Joe,
   Saw you msg about CCS and thought i'd share my experiences
with CCS equipment.  I am presently running an all CCS system
(except for the mainframe and PIO. The 2016 16K RAM is one of
the best ram boards that I know of.  I've had no trouble with
any of them. The 64K dynamic board has a few quirks, but I've
had no trouble with them myself.  The Z80 board is pretty well
thought out, it has jumper options for all of the signals that
were used on older systems, but not on the new S-100 standard.
The disk controller runs pretty good(once you get it up.) The
CP/M that CCS distributes is pre-interfaced for the 2422 disk
controller/Z80 board combination... I haven't figured out if
that's to make it easy to bring up, or to sell more CPU boards.
   The management at CCS has changed (I am told) in the last
little while, and the new group seems to have different ideas
on the direction that the company should go.  They have raised
the prices for bare boards to outrageous levels, perhaps in an
attempt to get out of the bare board market, and who knows what
else is in store.  But overall, I'd have to give them a better
than average rating.          -Chuck-

HELLO ALL,
    I WAS ASKED BY A PHREAKER TO PRODUCE LEGAL INDICTMENTS
(IN AN RP MESSAGE) SO THAT HE WOULD KNOW WHO TO SIDE WITH.
WELL, I FIGURE THAT IF PEOPLE CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT WITH
THE BACK-UP I AM RECEIVING FROM SO MANY USERS OF THIS SYSTEM,
AND EVEN FROM SYS-OPS (READ #6858), THAT IF YOU PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW BY NOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH, JUST BY USING
YOUR COMMON SENSE, YOU ARE PRETTY HOPELESS IN THE LOGIC
DEPARTMENT.
    FOR ALL THOSE OF YOU WHO DID WRITE ME RP MESSAGES
SHOWING YOUR SUPPORT, I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ARE AFRAID OF
SUSAN AND DON'T WANT YOUR NAMES MENTIONED, BUT SOME DAY
YOU WILL HAVE TO LEARN TO STAND UP AND BE A MAN, NOT

HELLO MEGATON,
    I THINK OU ARE EXPERIENCING A PROBLEM SIMILAR TO THE
ONE I HAD A WHILE BACK...BUT FIRST, I NEED TO KNOW THE
AREA CODE AND PREFIX YOU ARE CALLING FROM, AND THE PREFIX
OF THE SPC YOU ARE PLACING YOUR CALLS THROUGH.  THEN,
I WILL BE ABLE TO CALL UP IN THAT AREA AND CHECK TO SEE
WHAT TYPE OF SERVICE YOU ARE ON, AND WHAT TYPE OF TRUNKING
IS INVOLVED TO GET FROM YOUR PHONE TO THE SPC.  IF YOU ARE BOTH
ESS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A BAD 
CONTROL CHANNEL ON THE THREE PORT, IF YOU HAVE THREE WAY,
WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED WITH A SIMPLE CALL TO THE SCC.
    ANYWAY, NO MORE TILL I HAVE FURTHER DETAILS..ROSCOE.

Subject: *Paul Montgomery*

The last time I had talked to Paul, he said that he might become a guest
of the county, for selling some "HOT" computer equipment to someone.
  This is what paul told me about 2 days before he vanished.
I think he is in the Stockton Detention ctr, however I have seen him logged
into both AI and MC a couple of times since he dissappeared.  Also Bill Doger
recieved some mail from him too.   I was also told that Patrick Clemens has
had a couple of phone calls to him from Paul. This information came from
Our dear fiend (theres no R missing)) Bill Doger.  I was  told from Bill
that his FBI scandle was all made up.  This was done to scare off
the crashing attempts and nasty letters that were sent by Sam Junkins.
Bill Doger along with someone in Texas, made up the story, and made several
phone calls to Sam Junkins in order to scare him into not playing with
the MIT computers.  Sam no longer "crashes" or does anything on AI
that would cause a fuss.  He uses it normally like others do. As for Bill,
I hear he is making up another story to sscare the phreaks in Philly.
I dont think this is the reason that they are all dissappearing for. There
is some trouble in Philadelphia, I dont know what.  This BBS is starting
to become a place to bitch and moan, or complain to, I will admit that I
may have just dont that, oh well here comes line 20, gotta go!

Subject: NO MORE T.A.P. ??

I was told by Tom Edison that T.A.P. may fold!  It seems that readers
are not sending in articals for him to publish.  Issue 67 will be out
in a couple of months and he needs articals!! GOOD ARTICALS!!  So search
your minds, and think of something to write about.  But make it good!
All this stuff we know doesn't mean shit unless its published and all can
use it.  Tom Edison has put over $5000 of his own money to keep it going.
He and I are sure that Phreaking would still go one if T.A.P. DID FOLD.
But we don't want T.A.P. to fold do we?  Of course not!!  Where did all
the credit card codes come from, if we didnt know of someone who "got" them
T.A.P. publishes them every year, and has not missed a year yet!
Issue 65 covered Pirate radio/Can Jumping/CC codes 81'
Issue 66 covered: Fortress Phone info/CCITT info/PC Boards/Autovon info  
Issue 67 will be their Special 10th Anniversary Issue Double Edition!!
BUT< it may not come out unless he has articals to publish. Why not a
few, just a few, people write some nice looking articals.  They must be
a 5 inch colume and must be typed on a GOOD typewriter.  Also they must
be in the T.A.P. office by March 28th because printing will be on the 1st
of april and he has to put the issue together!  If you don't subscribe
to T.A.P. yet, here is the address once again......
See next msg for the address.  Ran out of room again.

AND SO CAN ANTON CHERNOFF, A TOP PHREAKER, WHO WAS ARRESTED
BECAUSE OF HER SELFISH HABIT OF TURNING PEOPLE IN.  VAN NUYS,
NOT ANAHEIM. THANKS YOU     ROSCOE.

HEY PAUL,
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD DO A SCAN OF MESSAGES FROM THUNDER,
AND YOU WILL FIND THAT SHE IS A GAL WHO LIKES TO TURN
PHREAKS IN TO THE FEDS, AND TALKS BULL ABOUT THOSE WHO SHE HATES.
SHE HATES ME CAUSE I WON;'T TEACH HER, SO SHE TRIED TO GET
ME WITH THE FEDS.  ALSO, SHE GOT ANTON AND PAUL FOR
NOT TEACHING HER AND NOT GIVING HER ANYTHING SHEE ASKS.
WHEN YOU TALK TO HER, SHE WILL MAKE UP 1000 EXCUSES FOR
ANYTHING BAD SAID ABOUT HER, AND SHE WILL CONVINCE YOU
THAT SHE IS RIGHT WITH HER "CHARM" AND OFFERS OF
SEX.  SHE IS A WHORE, IN SHORT...ROSCOE.

AS BAD AS ROSCOE.  IF YOU WON'T OBEY ME AND DO WHAT I WANT, I WILL PUT YOUR
LOUSY SYSTEM OUT OF EXISTENCE.  YOU SURE ARE DUMB, TAKING SO LONG TO FIGURE

ROSCOE, YOU'RE SUCH A JERK THAT IF I CAN'T GET YOUR AUNT INJURED,
I WILL PERSONALLY GO DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL, ROOM 354, AND STAB HER WHILE SHE
SLEEPS.  YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WILL BE DEAD.  DON'T THINK THAT YOU ARE LUCKY
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET YOU ARRESTED , BECAUSE IF I CAN'T GET THE COPS TO
WORK FOR ME, I'LL DO THINGS MYSELF.  YOU'DE BETTER WATCH YOUR AUNT
VERY CLOSELY.  ALSO YOUR MOTHER, IT'S STRANGE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE
GETTING SHOT ON THE STREETS THESE DAYS.  AND BY THE WAY JERK,

ROSCOE,
YOUR RELATIVES ARE AS GOOD AS DEAD.  YOUR MOTHER WAS LUCKY THAT SHE
WAS NOT STANDING NEXT TO THE WINDOW WHEN THE SHOTGUN BLAST HIT IT. NEXT
TIME, SHE MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY, THOUGH.  ALSO, YOUR GRANDMOTHER IN THE REST
HOME IS LUCKY THAT SHE HAS NOT BEEN PICKED UP BY ONE OF HER RELATIVE,
OR "RELATIVES" (MYSELF), AND THROWN OVER A CLIFF.  I HOPE YOU CAN
BE AT THREE PLACES AT ONCE, BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY IS GONE...
DON'T FORGET ASSHOLE, PROSTITUTES HAVE MANY PROTECTORS AND FRIENDS,
AND I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET YOURS.  IM INTO BONDAGE AND DISCIPLIN FOR A GOOD
REASON, BECUASE I KNOW HOW TO DISCIPLIN AND MAKE ASSHOLES LIKE YOU
OBEY MY EVBERY COMMAND.  JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE JERKS ON HERE WHO
HAVE GIVEN ME ANYTHING I ASKED THEM FOR, IN RETURN FOR NOTHING!!
ROSCOE, GO AWAY, THE WORLD HATES YOU.  I HEARD YOU ORDERED A CASKET.
HAS IT ARRIVED AT YOUR MOTHER'S HOUSE YET?? IT SOON WILL!!  AND GIVE
THE DILDO YOUR MOM GOT IN THE MAIL TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND...MAYBE THEN
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT A COCK IS, COCKSUCKER.
              CHEERS, TO A SHORT LIFE,
                        SUSAN.
 
P.S. IF THE COPS COME, I'LL DENY I WROTE THIS MESSAGE, ASSHOLE.

JERK,
    I HOPE YOUR AUNT DIES DURING HER HEAR OPERATION. NONE OF YOUR
FAMILY DESERVES TO LIVE ANYWAY...
    IF SHE DOESN'T DIE, I HOPE THE "NURSE" WHO COMES IN TO GIVE HER HER
MEDICINE DOESN'T GIVE HER POISON BY "ACCIDENT".
    OR EVEN WORSE, I HOPE THE "NURSE" DOESN'T STAB HER AT NIGHT...
THAT WOULD BE AWFUL, WOULDN'T IT, ROSCOE???
    BUT BEST OF ALL, I JUST HOPE SHE DIES DURING THE OPERATION...
  
       JERK.
