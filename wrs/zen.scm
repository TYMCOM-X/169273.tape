I was going through some old papers and came across a copy of Edsger
W. Dijkstra, "How do we tell truths that might hurt?", published in
June 1975.  Here are a couple choice excerpts which I'm sure you will
appreciate given your interest in languages.  Despite the first
impression, the commentary is quite serious.

It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students
that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers
they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore,
be regarded as a criminal offence.

About the use of language: it is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a
blunt axe.  It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.

Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of
one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer.

The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our
thinking habits, and, therefore , on our thinking abilities.
