I AM ORGANIZING A DIPLOMACY GAME IN THE SOUTH BAY AREA.  THIS IS THE SAME GAME 
THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED BY ANDREW STUART ON THE 
SANTA CLARA CBBS.  SINCE I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM, I'LL TRY MY HAND AT 
ORGANIZING IT.  I WILL CHECK THIS SYSTEM EVERY DAY(IF I CAN GET IN) AND
THE CBBS.  LEAVE ME A MESSAGE IF YOU WANT TO PLAY.  EXPERIENCE WOULD 
BE HELPFUL, BUT A FEW BEGINERS WOULD BE MORE THAN WELCOME.  DIPLOMACY
IS A SEVEN PLAYER/TEAM GAME.  I WILL ANNOUNCE THE PLAYERS HERE AND ON CBBS
IN ONE WEEK(THURSDAY), SOONER IF ENOUGH PEOPLE RESPOND FASTER.
LEAVE MESSAGES RP IF YOU LIKE, SO AS NOT TO BOTHER THE PEOPLE PRACTICING

I think the hate stirred up by a few people on this system
for each other is really terrible.  Instead of saying things
like 'Thunder is stupid!' or 'Kill Roscoe' or 'You are all
liers!" or whatever, why not just simply state opinion/possible
fact, instead of maliciously gossiping to each other to try and
destroy everyone else?
An example of this is the message supposedly left by Susan Thunder
saying she was back.  That is an obvious fake.  Any fool can
see the "'" after the name.  That changes the entire account name,
so that it may LOOK like it was from thunder, but it wasn't.  These
cheap shots and tricks are really making me feel sick.  How about
some civility and humility, instead of jeering, taunting anger?

She is a fake.  Actually, she is a he.
Additionally, Ma Bell security is cowered by a threat to report such
harasment to the California PUC (Public Utilities Commision). Just
mention PUC if anyone threatens you and you'll never hear from those
asshole again!  This is brought to you as a public service from
******ONE WHO KNOWS**********
The only thing you really need to worry about is excessive blue box 
usage .. that is a NO NO.  All "public" networks and the like are
fair game (legally speaking) and they should (my opinion) pay YOU
if you find problems with their systems. Note, though, that you
should not "log" excessive calls to such, but 20 or 30 does not
constitute abuse (or malicies mischief).  Hope this eases your minds.

The usual weekly meeting of TAP, the hobbyists journal for the

Friday, the 13th of March. The meeting will be held at the Inter-
active Telecommunications Program of New York University. The NYU
ITP is located at 725 Broadway, at the corner of Waverly Place,
which is one block south of the 8th St stop on the RR subway. Since
this particular meeting is being held in a "respectable" location,
we are inviting those of you who would not ordinarily seek us out,
to come to the meeting at NYU. Telco security is also invited to
check out what kinds of crazy things we are into, and I for one
would be happy to get into a discussion of phreaking on the networks
with them. T-Shirts and coffee mugs with the Ma Bell Is A Cheap
Mother logo on them will be available for sale at that time. Hope to
see you there. (I'll be the guy in the "urban Gorilla suit". Costume
is part of the effect).

Subject: The Controversy

While Ms Thunder may not be the most respectable of phreaks and
hackers (and I do fault her for not showing the "True Hacker"
ideals), any user can log into this system, if you haven't noticed,
and pull off enough info to start tracking down phreaks. A certain
level of paranoia is healthy in this businexxxx hobby. While it certainly
could be Susan who's turning any one in, see what kind of trail you may
be leaving yourself. Also, the term True Hacker is one that may need
some interpreting. It means someone who is friendly to systems that
are friendly. BBS's in general are friendly, and should be helped by
all. They should not be crashed, phones turned off, power cut, or
other nastyness, because then they won't be there to play with
anymore. The hobbyists attitude should certainly be one of "Sure, 
I can crash it". In certain cases, there may even be reason to crash it,
but to say "I won't crash it" shows more responsibility than than
the child-like hackers can come up with. When you know you have the power
to be nasty, it doesn't mean that you have to use it. Especially when
you can hurt people in the process. Computer hobbyists have shown an
increasing tendency towards anarchy. Being a staffer on TAP, I can't 
claim not to hold some of these ideas. But look through some of the
liturature. Most of the good stuff is fiction. (continued)

I would like to refer you to Ayn Rand (The Fountainhead, Atlas
Shrugged), but more fun to read are the books of Robert A Heinlein
(Stranger in a Strange Land, Space Cadet, Red Planet, >The Moon
Is A Harsh Mistress<). The last, is a great computer story. It shows a
computer "Coming Alive" as more circuits are hooked up, and how it
learns about jokes. What is always-funny, and what is funny-once, ect.
The ability to crash systems, and make life hard for others is not
one that should be used for those purposes. If you can crash a system, 
you can help that system be useful to others who don't know systems
as well as you. Sharing that knowledge can be frustrating, but the more
people start to learn about computers, the more computers there will be
around for us to play with. Have fun, folks, I know that I sure do,
but keep it cool.

Subject: "susan 'thunder"

It is obivious that the person leaving messages as "Susan 'Thunder"
is a fake. Here are the reasons:
1) This person is using an Apple as a terminal. The real Susan
   Thunder uses a regular 80 col terminal.
2) The messages from "Ms. 'Thunder" are all in UPPERCASE.
   More evidence of an apple.
3) This person is signing "her" messages as
               "THUNDR@AI MIT"
   which, for those who aren't aware of it, is the WRONG SYNTAX for
   an Arpanet mailing address at MIT.
4) As Tim Bessie pointed out, this system will not accept a signon
   for "Susan Thunder" without the proper password, so to bypass
   this, this person is signing in as "Susan 'Thunder" to beat this.
 
I'm certain that others could find errors in phrasing, etc that Susan would
not do, as well as claiming knowledge she wouldn't have. 
       So, now let's ask ourselves this: Who hates Susan so much that
this person would totally screw up her hacking existance by making her
totally disreputable?

Subject: Nucleons

You are correct, nucleons are general subatomic particles, and so
were the nucleons that I was talking about in my message. Perhaps
(actually probably) I did not mention this: the 'nucleons' that I was
referring to are any subatomic particle, WITH 'k spin' which is a
complex spin extending through a 7-dimensional hyperspace. Application
of this spin changes the properties of particles in unusual (to say the
least!) ways, and by 'nucleons' I meant 'nucleons under k spin'.
I should have been more clear there. Thanks for catching that. Look up
the article if you really want to know the whole story; it's quite
interesting.
(Application of k spin is the most difficult part, with spin in each
successive dimension much more difficult than the last. Eight-dimensional
spin has been considered and could possibly be achieved with very very
strange techniques, but it would extend the range of the nucleonic
powers to such a degree (several light-years) that creation of one
such nucleon would destroy everything in the universe... Ick.

Hi Richard,
   You are one of the few people that seem to know what DES stands for.
(Not the cattle fattening hormone!).  I'm interested in encryption /
decryption.  I'm trying to build an interface to the Western Digital
DES chip so I can use it with my system.  Do you know of any good

Hi Rick,
   What you were experiencing could be due to a bad line.  It might
also have been caused by someone trying to do a 'emergency verify'
on this line.  The 'emergency verify' was a trick some people used
to try and dump the current user so they could get on.  It opens
the line for a few hundred millisec's.  8BBS doesn't drop the line
unless carrier has been lost for over a second.  So the 'emergency
verify' can cause garbage char's, but at least you stay connected.
  Regards,..

Subject: DES things

Hi John,
   Nice to see someone else interested in 'secure communication'.  From
what I've read, it seems that the NBS DES encryption method is secure
from exhaustive key search attacks for at least the next 8-10 years.
The alledged reason the NSA asked IBM to classify some of their working
papers on the DES algorithm was that IBM accidently (independantly)
duplicated some of the methods that NSA uses to crack foreign gov't
traffic.  There was a back issue of BYTE mag that had a good description
of the DES algorithm.  The NBS will only certify hardware implementations
of the algorithm 'cause they say that a software emulation could be
compromised.  I've got spec sheets for the INTEL, WD, and AMD chips.
I plan to use the WD (Western Digital) chip because it is fast, easy to
interface and simple to program.  It is available locally for about $70.
Any of the DES chips would be compatible with each other at the message
level.  One of the major drawbacks to the use of the DES for BBS msg's
is that it requires some secure way of exchanging the keys.  I'm trying
to get some info on the Hellman and Diffie 'public key' system.  It
sounds like it would be much better suited for BBS use.  Let me know
if you have any ideas for applying DES or other methods to BBS msg's.

Obviously ROSCOE assumes that because his act wasn't as tight as
he would like it to be, and subsequently he was caught, that somebody
must have turned him in.  And it's natural to suspect one's worst
enemies first.  But does it ever occur to these people that maybe they
are just sloppy about their activities?  People do get pissed when
their systems get zeroed, ROSCOE, and they do call the FBI at such times.

HEY CALLERS,

THIRD PARTY BILLING TO HIS SYSTEM, YOU KNOW THAT THAT CAN BE DETRIMENTAL.
    I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT NO-ONE THINKS OF MAKING THIRD PARTY BILLINGS
TO THE CALLED NUMBERS HE LEFT ON THE MESSAGE.  SUCH AN ACTIVITY WOULD BE

Subject: Message Number 5310

In regards to ROSCOE's allegations that all the sysops around the
country would rather not have me around, I offer this quote from message
number 5310, which was left on this system on Jan. 13, 1981 to the
Sysop of this system.  I have taken the liberty of shortening some of
the obscenities with respect to some of the Christian members of our
audience, but this IS an actual quote:
"...I WILL TAKE YOUR SYSTEM DOWN, DISCONNECTING IT INSTEAD OF CHANGING
THE NUMBER, I WILL LEAVE YOUR HOME PHONE ON ALL OTHER SOURCES(BBS, COMMENT
LINES, AND IN PAPERS), I WILL SHUT OFF YOUR PERSONAL LINE, YOUR ELECTRICITY,
ETC. AND I WILL CALL ALL YOUR NEIGHBORS UP AT STRANGE HOURS AND TELL THEM
WHAT AN A--HOLE YOU ARE. DON'T THINK I CAN'T T.D. YOUR LINE BECAUSE I CAN
DO IT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE!!...BY THE WAY, I'LL ALSO F--K WITH YOUR
RELATIVES AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO APPEARED AS LONG-DISTANCE OR MESSAGE-UNIT
DETAIL ON YOUR PHONE BILL..I ALREADY HAVE THE NUMBERS.  I'M PISSED AT YOU..
F--K WITH ME AGAIN AND I'LL PUT YOU OUT.  I DARE YOU TO F--K WITH ME AGAIN.
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT BEING SORRY IS."
 
Now, come on, ROSCOE, is that any way to make friends with sysops?
And I'd love to see **ANY** letter sent by me logged in on MIT!!! I
didn't even know how to use the mail until a week ago, so never sent any!!

Subject: Call Waiting and Modems

The best way to prevent Call Waiting from disturbing your data
connection is to temporarily disable it.  Call Waiting is "off"
under the following circumstances:
 
       1. If you forward you calls somewhere.
       2. From the time you begin to make a three-way
          call until you have connected everyone together
          and the third party has gone off-hook (answered).
 
In a Number 2 ESS there are some additional conditions under
which Call Waiting is disabled, such as while you are waiting
for a long distance call to answer, and for the entire duration
of a three-way call.
 
I strongly recommend using Call Forwarding, since it doesn't tie up
any of Mother's precious resources.  The only problems are figuring
out something reasonable to forward to (preferably something that is
always busy (watch out, some of Bell's busy test #s "answer")) and
remembering to cancel it when you are done.  The other method is to
call some recording and then add-on 8bbs without connecting both.

Hi Phil,
   Thanks for the info on the RSA paper.  I probably will try for a
hardware DES method before getting into the software.  I have spec
sheets for 3 data encrytion chips that use the NBS DES algorithm.
 
INTEL  8294 Data Encryption Unit   (80 bytes/sec)
Western Digital WD2001 Data Encrytion Device  (37.5K bytes/sec)
AMD  9518 Data Ciphering Processor (1M+ bytes/sec)
 
   I think there is at least one other LSI chip (Rockwell?) that is
available, but I plan to use the WD2001 since the INTEL 8294 is too
slow and the AMD 9518 is too complicated to use.  The WD2001 is
available locally for about $70.  All 3 chips have been certified by
NBS as valid implementations of the DES algorithm.  Regards,..

Subject: VOTRAX  SC-01 group buy

A recent issue of BYTE magazine contained an article on VOTRAX
speech synthesizer work.  VOTRAX now sells a single chip phoneme
synthesizer that is capable of generating continous, high quality
speech, of unlimited vocabulary, from low data rate inputs.
  The SC-01 chip contains 64 different phonemes that are addressed
by a 6 bit code.  The inflection (pitch level) of the voiced
phonemes can be varied with a 2 bit code.  The SC-01 is very easy
to interface to a 8 bit parallel I/O port.  All that is needed is
is the 8 data bits (6 +2), an output strobe pulse.  The only
input from the SC-01 is a 'busy' line that indicates when it is
ready to accept a new phoneme.  The output from the SC-01 is the
audio speech signal which is amplified to drive a speaker.
  Now the hard part.  VOTRAX will only sell a minimum quantity of
5 chips at $95. each.  I already know a couple of people that want
one.  What is needed are a few more people who would like to get
this chip.  I'll co-ordinate the buy when we get 5 firm commitments
from people for $95.  Leave a msg if you want to get the chip for
$95.  If you want spec sheets, call VOTRAX at 313 588-0341.  Regards,..

or Wait until Ralph Gorin from Stanford CSD publishes his

No, I didn't see any printouts from Susan's account on sys 3.  Why would
there be a charge for printouts?
 
I am seriously thinking of shortening the  'O'ther  systems list, by
deleting all systems that are not really public access systems.  This
means that systems such as the  HP-2000's, or any system that requires
special or unusual procedures to gain access would not be listed.  I
think most of your STARCOM's would be in this category.  Systems that
require a 'ring-back' or answer only after the 13th ring, etc. would
also be deleted.   Regards,..

HI again, gee, i would proceed very carefully with ordering that
chip set.  All the micro-computer experience i have with Western
Digital indicates they *love* to have their customers debug their
lsi hardware for them.
For example, the wd1771 disc controller worked fine, but the 1791
had a bug that often resulted in the inability to read a disc 
written with the 1771.  Also, the infamous 'micro-engine' which is
their pdp-11 (lsi-11) re-coded to execute p-code had so many bugs
in it they actually are swapping the entire chip set to all users
for free (but so far, one guy I know has been waiting to get his
micro-engine cpu board BACK from WD for 4 months!!!!)
PRoceed with caution, even if the chip is certified, they might
have  hand-picked a good one when they submitted it!!!!

Subject: Timing for carrier tone

Hi! Can you change the parameter which controls the timing on
your carrier tone generation upon initial dail-in? I lost
the connection and had to re-dial several tiimes, which
is oppressive when doing it long distance, because your
machine only gives the tone for 7 seconds (I timed it instead
of trying once). Long carrier detect delay, which is the standard
on many devices, can take from 2.5 up to 6 seconds; if it doesn't
have all that time, it may not repsond and let your line
drop even with a good connection. When you cound the time needed
to react to hearing the tone and putting the receiver in the
acoustic coupler, that subtracted from 7 seconds doesn't leave
enough time. Please double your time to at least 15 seconds.
It shouldn't cost you anything, and would save your callers
trouble. Thanks

Subject: Carrier detect time-out

Hi Ed,
    Yes, I've noticed that some callers are a bit sluggish
about getting things together when calling 8BBS.  The
modem is currently set to disconnect after 6 sec's if no
carrier is present.  The other setting is an 18 sec time-
out.  The problem with the 18 sec timeout is that (for
local callers)  the line is still busy when they re-dial
the number.   I really can't understand why it should take
more than about 2-3 sec's after 8BBS modem answers to 
have your equipment send a carrier.  If you don't get a 
busy signal - you know 8BBS modem will answer.  However,..
I will temporarily change the switch to allow 18 sec time-
out.  If there are any complaints about the 18 sec setting
it will go back to 6 sec.  Regards,..

would be any sales tax since the chips would be shipped from

Jordan,
 The ONYX system was not down for weeks, let alone one week. It was
down for PM only *2* days! I don't know where you got the notion it
was down for more than a week, but, it is up, and the net connection
was only taken down from BERKELEY, not from the Onyx itself. Tim
is working on a program that will call (via 1200 baud autodialer) a
Unix which is on the net, login, and use unix-to-unix copy and put
it on the Onyx's mail system. 
  Anyway, keep me informed on your BBS, it sounds like its really
coming along! Remember, once you get the autodialers, I will help
you anyway I can on AI.. I am hacking the mailer right now anyway!

Subject: LEWIS DE PAYNE

 
Somebody has run an off-prem extension from one of my phone lines and
monitored my computer activities, therefore they were able to obtain
my password to the MIT systems.  They subsequently logged in under my
account and after sending some destructive mail in my name they tried
to crash the system.  A user that was on the system and works for se-
curity on MIT called me and let me know that there was this problem,
and my password has now been changed.  And the OPX on my line has been
removed, so I hope this little problem is over with.
 
It has occured to me that there is only one person who could stand to
benefit from such activities, (and only in a strange egotistical way,
at that...), and that person is Lewis DePayne, otherwise known as
ROSCOE.
 
So I guess it's war.  I've tried to ignore him, I've tried to call and
talk to him about this in a civil fashion, and there is apparently no
dealing with him other than by his own tactics.  It has come to my 
attention that he has hired people on various occasions to sit outside
my place of residence and follow me to work to see where I am employed.

Therefore, after much thought and consideration, I have decided to make
public the following information.  I am fully aware that his retaliation
will probably include the publishing of my telephone numbers, etc., but
the price seems to be worth it in this case.
---LEWIS, I AM TIRED OF YOUR SHIT.  I HAVE RECENTLY PAID *ALOT* OF
MONEY TO FIND OUT WHO, WHERE, AND WHAT JO MARIE IS, DOES AND LIVES, AND
IF YOU KEEP F-CKING WITH ME THIS INFORMATION WILL BE MADE PUBLIC NEXT.---
(AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT THIS THREAT HAS ANY VALIDITY,
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD THUMB THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES AND CALL A FEW DANCE

Another thing I'd like to point out is the abundance of "never-heard-of's"
that have surfaced in the last week or so since ROSCOE crawled back out
of the sewer:  people such as "ELVIN RICHARD","JOHN BILLINGS", etc., all
of whom I've never heard of, yet seem to take a really strong dislike
towards me for no apparant reason.
In fact, for any of you who may be making your decision based on the
bullshit you see being slung back and forth, I invite you to give me a

the following hours:  (All times are Pacific Standard Time)  from 6:30
P.M. to 8:00 P.M., and from 11:00 P.M. to 2:00 A.M.
Feel free to call collect, and for your convenience I am listing here
three of my phone numbers:(213)781-9060,(213)781-9078, and (213)781-9152.
I am looking forward to talking to all of you who may want to ask me any
questions.
 
As for the information regarding ROSCOE'S place of employment, he works
at Ernst and Whinney, apparently a Law/Accounting firm in downtown
L.A., located at 515 Flower St., and the Phone Number is (213)621-1666.
In the unlikely event that you'd want to talk to LEWIS DE PAYNE, just
ask for data-processing.  If you would like to otherwise harrass him, 
perhaps the personnell dept would be of some assistance.  He has made
my life miserable ever since I stopped going out with him, and it's time
for me to retaliate.  So if anybody out there would like a thrill, by
all means, give them a call and let them know what kind of scum they
employ.  (These are the exact plans he had for me in the event he found
out where I was working, so all you moralists can ease off...)THUNDER

Subject: LSI-11 Sys's

I read the sysop's response for your message telling about
how you are looking for a good but inexpensive pdp-11 system.
(*whew*! Long sentence).  If I may, two of my favorite systems
whose performance is equal to pdp-11 and which are reletively
inexpensive (compared to systems with equal capacities) are
1) Onyx System's Corp. Z-8000 Unix Version 7
       The Z-8000 is somewhat like the LSI-11, and the
       UNIX it runs is comparable to the PDP-11's.
       Price: $25,000
       Comes with hard disk drive, tape drive,
       128K (I believe), 8 user ports, 2 printer ports,
       and all the facilities of unix (with all subroutines,
       system calls, and file handling programs)
2) Terak 8150/a Graphics computer
       This system is an LSI-11/03 or 11/23 (I can't remember at
       the moment).  You can get many OS's for it.  Most
       popular is the UCSD Pascal OS, which has some very nice
       graphics features, as well as an extremely good visual
       editor.   The system comes with:

********************     ONYX    **********************
Everyone:  The Onyx is NOT (repeat NOT) down.  The
'ferns' account does not work at the moment, though.  This
is because the present version of the C compiler we have
often messes up when it comes to character-arrays, and thus
messes up file accounting and buffering.  We are presently
polling for a new version of both the operating system AND
the compiler.  When this is done, the 'ferns' account at
(408) 425-8000
will be graciously revived.  Also, I am changing the message
system to work through a system of protections.  Thus, people I
trust more will be able to access various things accordingly.
The only thing that really needs to be guarded is the 'system'
command, by which one may enter the Onyx Unix Version 7 Operating
System itself.  The only problem with this is that people might
decide they want to go and delete the message and accounting
files for ferns.  Everything else is safe.  So, if you want to
use the main OS, and I don't trust you, or 'ferns' is down, then
you may log in as account 'guest' (lower case), no password.

Roscoe (or whoever):
       I don't mind simple dissagreement.  But if all you can do
is make caustic statements, founded on no real hard evidence
(on MIT ANYONE could change your mail file, and we haven't seen
any solid evidence here), etc.  then I feel less inclined
to help you at all.  There is no reason to try to play the part of
a rabble rouser and make everyone hate Susan, nor is there
any reason for her to respond to it with more biting rebuttal.
Up to now (since she returned), she has at least had the tact
not to blow up like you do.  Forced into a corner by your
insinuations and actively disgusting commentary, she began to
once again act like you.  If everyone were like you, this
planet would have been destroyed long ago by wars and other
types of violence.  If you can't tone down any of your arguments,
or even give some leeway for positive debate, I am afraid I will
not be allowed to help you in any way, be it giving you info on
other systems, or giving you a ferns account.

I have written ROSCOE a message detailing what I think about
the current (childish) controversy.  Read it, please (last message).
I suggest that you continue in a calm manner, and ignore anything
that roscoe throws at you.  The reason that I suspect roscoe
more than you on this is primarily BECAUSE you have not
resorted as much to muc-slinging and childish yelling as has
Roscoe.  I also have noticed the marked similarity to many
of those new users' message, how close they are to Roscoe's
and Dave Starr's.  Still, I think if you ignore all this stuff,
and don't try to defend yourself to the hilt, as they do, then the
people on the systems you use won't really care about what Roscoe and
his cohorts say.  You will get a much more positive response if you
simply treat his babblings as nothing important and valid, than
if you get angry and get down to his level to argue.  I have
many times seen arguments like his, and they have all been from
7-12 year-olds who find using a computer where no one knows
who they really are facinating, fun, and secret.  See what
you can do.

One of the best compiler books I have read (as an introduction

An Introduction to Compiler Writing
   By J. S. Rohl (MacDonald and Jane's/American Elsevier
                  Computer Monographs, 1975)
This book describes the construction of a compiler, starting with
a very small, restricted subset of Algol, and expanding it until
it has described a full Algol compiler, with info methods,
optimization, etc.  It doesn't delve too deeply (at all)
into theory, which is what I liked about it.  Once you have
read it, you will be ready to write your own compiler quite
quickly.  Also, it does not discuss much of the rhetorical
questions about compilers over and over, so it is only about
300 fast-reading pages long.  Look into it.

Subject: MK5087

I am TRYING to build a touch-tone generator using the 5086
Tone generator IC(Circuit is in Jan. 1980 issue of BYTE, p
126)but I'm having some difficulties. Mainly tthe 3.58MHz
Xtal won't oscillate! I've tried several different x-tals,
with the same results. Is there a difference between the
5086 and the 5087 in tthe oscilator circuit? The circuit
shown? Or is it the chip itself? I'd rather check into tthe
first possibilities, because the chip is $6.50. Any help
would be GREATLY appreciated...

Why do you keep switching you attitude back and forth?
First you apologize, then you scream, then you threaten,
then you apologize, then you phylosophize.  When will it ever
end?  Make up your mind.  I am officially taking no stand, though
I DO find Ms. Thunder's attitude slightly less offending than
that of Roscoe's, and yours (in your more recent letters).
Why are you angry at me?  I merely suggested (quite calmly,
too) that it is not important to try and 'get back' at anyone.
Why would you want to ruin, kill, deny acces, and otherwise
harm anyone, for any reason?  I am getting so dismayed with
this entire situation I am beginning to think I will call the
FBI and have them do a rundown on everyone involved!  Of course,
I won't do that, but I am getting to feel that way.  Calm down,
think about the things you say before you say them, and replace
thought of revenge, harm, and ruination with those that will most
quickly bring this controversy to and end: disinterest.

Hi Chuck,
   I noticed your comments about 8BBS.  I too would prefer not to see
personal attacks and foul language on 8BBS, but since it is a 'public
access' system, just about anyone can leave just about any kind of
msg.  I travel a lot and don't have time to sit an monitor what people
type into their msg's.  If you see a msg you dislike, attempt to kill
it, even if unsuccessful, it will show in the log file.  If there are
several people that object to a msg, it will probably disappear soon.
   Some users may not wish to be associated with a BBS that allowed
ads from your company, but if you wish to leave recruitment ads on
8BBS, that is fine with me.  You can 'kill protect' them, and of course
there is no charge.
   I did not understand what you meant by "... IF A PERSON HAS A LOT OF
TROUBLE WITH A COMPANY IT SHOULD BE KNOWN TO ALL AS WELL AS THE GOOD ONES."

HMM, it looks like Kerry has taken up bugging your system
with complaints.  Guess the 'heat' was too 'hot' on cbbs sc
Have not been 'troubled' since I left a slew of msgs slinging
it back to the source. (One who dishes it out sure seems like
they cannot take it.)

Subject: 1200 baud

Are you considering the vadic triple modem?  That is the
most versatile and allows virtually any kind of 1200 bauder
to call in. (IT supports Bell 212 and Vadic 3400, which are the two
universal 1200 baud protocols , which , of course, are not compatible
with each other. (Like Telenet has two sets of lines for 1200, one
are vadic and the other are Bell.  A real pain if you forget which
one is which unless you have your own triple modem.)
The price $900 is a little too steep, otherwise cbbs santa clara
would have had one a long time ago.

I have some boxes of brand new 3M (scotch) 8 inch floppy disc

(That is a better price than you can get from inmac or any

If interested leave me any kind of msg with your phone number.

Subject: Susy Thunder

I have been watching this system for awhile, and it has fina~lly occured
to me that Susan Thunder is one and the same as Susy Thunder.  For those
of you who do not follow rock and roll, (i.e. read CREEM, CIRCUS, etc.)
Susy Thunder was probably the MOST FAMOUS groupie of the mid-to-late 70's!!
Apparently this Roscoe thinks he's going to embarras Susy by sending out
copies of one of her magazines, but what he doesn't know is that she's
most likely PROUD of it, and WILLINGLY gave the interview to let everyone
KNOW that she has dated Rod Stewart, Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger, etc.
Somebody like her has to be very pretty and very clever to get backstage
at these concerts, and into the hotels where these bands stay, and party
and travel with them.  I would, by all means, suggest that EVERYONE
request their copy of Roscoe's leaflet TODAY!!  Find out who Susy Thunder
really is in the eyes of the public!  Read one of the over 2000 magazine
items that were printed about her during her illustrious carre~er!  She
has appeared on many, many t.v. shows such as Tom Snyder, Dinah Shore,
Mike Douglas, etc., talking about the upper-echelon rock and roll world,
and I, for one, even joined her fan club!!  She was quite a celebrity
3 or 4 years ago!  (I was beginning to wonder what happened to her, in
fact...I see that she's in computers now...)
Anyway, get Roscoe's leaflet, and happy reading!!

Dear Susy,
Let's get together sometime!!  Where have you been these last 2 years?
I heard that you finally got off the drugs and stuff.  Was it hard?
What do you think about Rod's wife Alana?  I think she looks just like
you did when you had long hair!  Funny, huh?  Too bad you could never
get pregnant by one of those rock stars, you'd have made a fortune!!
Please call me sometime and let's talk about the good old times!
I'm leaving my number in an RP message.
Love, Leslie
P.S.  In case you don't know who I am, I'm the one who used to send you
the letters in the green and white envelopes.  You wrote back to me 3

Subject: Auto-dialer

I found out where an autodialer can be connected to a
phone where it will be blocked from getting ringer and
dialing voltages. Connect it to the same terminals on the
terminal block inside a standard phone as the voice
transmitter in the handpiece. If you have a direct-connect
modem connected to the line, then connect the dialer AFTER
the isolation x-former in the modem; I found out that even
a 2500 ohm load will load down the phone line too much
and prevent the phone or modem from hanging up! Also, put
another isolation/load matching x-former between the modem/phone
and the autodialer to block ringer voltages. The x-former
that I used is a T-31X made by Triad. It is rated for use
above 60Hz, and should block tthe 20Hz ringer voltage. I have
several of these x-formers if you would want one.Regards...

Really, you shouldn't begin to get so barbarric in your tone.  It
conjures up images on this end of a savage warrior with war paint

his prey.  You should calm down.  For instance, no matter what she
has (allegedly) done, you shouldn't go crazy over it on this system.
If you were really as smart and as fair as you claim, you would approach
this calmly, logically, and intelligently.  You don't have to say
"KILL! KILL! KILL!" to get people's attention.  You don't even give
specific enough details to warrant such outlandish behaviour.  I suggest
you make a list of EXACT things that Ms. Thunder has done, list them
here, and be ready to have evidence for them that would stand up
in a court of law against the highest scrutiny.

Hi Kerry,
   The 'Read Protect' msg idea has always been a problem area.  8BBS doesn't
take any chances when working with RP msg's.  The next version of 8BBS will
allow you to Get and Kill RP msg's that are TO / FROM you if, (only if) you
have assigned yourself an access password with the U function.  If you don't
have a pw'd someone else could log in with your name and Get or Kill your
RP msg's, so that is why it now has those restrictions.  Regards,..

Subject: Onyx accounts

In order to get an account, you must supply me with the following
information:
1) Your full, real name
2) The account NAME (NOT number) you want, which may be up to
       36 characters long, and is composed of any combonation
       of letters and/or numbers (no white spaces or odd chars)
3) The password you want, with the same restrictions as the
       account name.
Once I respond that your account has been initiated, call:
(408) 425-8000 for 300 baud and
(408) 425-8004 for 1200 baud (Ven-Tel 212A, I think)
and press return a couple of times.  When it says 'login: '
you type 'ferns' and press return.  If it asks you for
a password, then something has gone wrong.  It means either:
1) The account is missing for some strange reason
2) You are sending upper case and the login program doesn't
       convert to lower case
3) The characters you are sending have some bits set incorrectly
In any case, if something happens, leave me a message,  Try
several times.  Cont.

Once it has accepted the account name, it will (should) type
out the last login time, and, after a few seconds, say
"Account name: " (notice the difference between 'login: '
and 'Account name: ').  Once you have gotten this, type
in the account name I have assigned you, and press return.
If it doesn't know it, it will say so and log off, back to
the 'login: '.  If it does, it will greet you and ask for your
password with 'Enter Password: '.  Then enter the password I
have assigned you.  It should then log you in.  For your
first time, type 'help', 'menu', etc.  Commands cannot be
shortened, so, for instance, you may not use 'r' instead
of 'read'.  I am working on a way to make it possible to have
shortest-possible-alias type commands. In the meantime, ask me
for an account!

Hi Bob,
   No, the msg flagging code works fine.  I seem to recall someone using
your name that was attempting to login with oddball names, so I thought
6766 was appropriate.
   8BBS does not directly support multiple "WHO TO" msg's.  But you can
use the Get msg feature to copy msg's to several people.  I don't see
why you'd need to do that, since a public msg can be seen by everyone
and you can't Get RP msg's anyway.  If this is really important, let me
know, and I'll describe how it can be done.  The RP msg capability is
meant for private msg exchange between just two users, not pseudo-private
mail to a group of users.  Regards,..

Quement is a retail store so there is no minimum order.  They
are at 1000 S. Bascom Ave. in San Jose.  They charge very high
prices on everything, so be prepared.  The maximum load you    
can put on the phone line seems to vary quite a bit with 
where you are, so you just have to try it to find out.  The
xformer you are looking for would be with all of the other
matching xformers at Quement.  So far I haven't found anybody
else that has them, so you just have to pay Quements price

Hi Allan
   Not sure what happened to cause the 'hang' symptom.  If 8BBS stops
echoing the characters you type there are several things you can try
to get it going again.  Try a ^K, ^C, ^Q or S  to tell 8BBS to resume
output.  If a character that you typed got garbled, 8BBS might see it
as a S or ^S which would tell it to suspend output.  Regards,..

  Well, I was 100% long when Joe said boo, and I *stayed* there
and cursed him long & loud for costing me several thousand dollars
in two days with his self-fulfilling prophecy.  I got over it...
this feels like a damn good time to be 100% long.  Your vantage
point can make a lot of difference though...if your horse was
AMD or CBU back in Jan. and you did what he said, you'd call him
a gifted man.  Some stocks love to move against the Dow, which 
makes Joe half right even when he's wrong...
  For diversion I play around in low-priced calls...like MCDCL a

Hello.
 
I have alot of faith and respect for those dinky little game stamps that
fast food dives and supermarkets like to distribute.  Maybe it's just
because I've been extroidinarily lucky in the stupid games:  I don't
know...
The possibilty is very slim indeed that they have different "rare" game
pieces for different parts of the country, after all, it's just to easy
to "reach out, reach out and touch someone" if ya know what I mean.
There is also, however, another very slim possibility, and that is the
possibility that more than 2 or 3 million dollars worth of those prizes
will end up being claimed!  Most people get the thing, see if it's an
instant winner, and if not they trash it...most people figure that they
would never win anything.  Therefore, many of the rare pieces never make
it to collector's books, and it says in the rules that any prizes not
claimed will not be awarded.
Now to the luck I've had:  I found the "rare" piece to the $1,000 winner
in the last contest on the ground in the parking lot!!

I assume you solved your MK5087 problem? what was
wrong? I didn't see your msg sooner, otherwise I 
could've helped you. From what I can tell, the misteak
is that pin 7 should NOT be wired to +12v and the
xtal should be wired from pin 7 to 8. the 5087 has
an internal resistor so the 1meg/10meg resistor should
not be needed. good luck. i might add that pin 7 is
internally wired to the input of an inverter and pin 8
is the output. this means you can use an external clock
wired to pin 7. you have probably solved your prob already.
i aggree, direct is MUCH better than using an xformer.
somewhere you have to isolate the computer from the line
though. i am somewhat perplexed about what the point
of adding the 2.5k resistor to the xformer was.
will talk later... -Dr. SLI, T.I.D.

regarding msg #6842 to bill murray about carrier loss:
call waiting, call forwarding, etc. I am 90% certain these
services are provided in your area. Read the front of 
your phone book. Certainly YOU should know at least what
legit services are avail. I feel your sys should tolerate
a 3 second carrier loss. Many commercial acoustic couplers
(my anderson jacobson for one) have a one second delay from
reception to xmission of carrier. this is so it will not be 
beeping when hearing speech, etc. They do not have this
delay at turn-off, the will stop xmitting within about
.1 sec. after loosing carrier. Let's say your mom lifts
up the downstairs phone and hearing the usual whine,
asks if you are on. Hearing no reply, she hangs up &
yells for you to get off the phone. (familiar, right?)
This incident resulted in a .25 sec hit (tech. name for
carrier loss (almost)) to the user's modem, which 
immediately drops carrier. .25 second later it recieves
carrier and starts its 1 sec countdown. Thus 1.25 secs
after the start of the dropout it turns on again only
to find our friendly 8bbs leaving... TBC...

My second unwritten rule was that we respect each

ever entered. We brought in our own furniture, file

projects. I never tried to hold back the resources of
our account. Those at the other schools each had
fixed accounts with 50 sectors and could only be used
for math, and with an obnoxious teacher leaning over you.
I gave everyone all they needed (most had 5000 sectors)
and all capabilities. We were completely responsible for
our actions. When the teletypes (often) broke down we
(mostly I) had to fix them. I felt our system worked 
awfully well. Alas, the good ole days...

Msg#, # of lines, protection, date entered, who from, who to.  Perhaps you
meant SP?  If so, that indicates a msg is 'System Protected' which means
that only the SYSOP can kill it.  Regards,..

Subject: Your 'privacy'

Hi John,
   Why the sudden concern about the Inquire function showing your last
login time?  It is certainly possible to alter the program to NOT show
your last login, but it seems unreasonable to make the change for just
one user.  The other 748 8BBS users don't seem to mind.  Have you also
let MIT know how you feel about the :WHOIS command?
   I have an interest in data encryption, but am not actively working
on any 8BBS msg encryption capability.  Regards,..

The message you referred to which admonished Mother Nature for what was

serious mucking about in hyper-space that we do in these messages. The "For
Sale", and building problems, and who is screwing who out of what

Hi Steven,
   I checked with PT&T again today, about special services for this prefix.
None of the ones you mentioned are available.  They said perhaps late this
summer when they go to ESS.  I use two different types of AJ acoustic
couplers and have had no problems with delayed carrier detect.  I don't
know of any valid technical reason why the 6 second timeout should be
lengthended.
   I too would prefer not to see 'hate mail' on here, but 8BBS is NOT my
main interest.  I don't have the time or inclination to maintain tight
control over msg content.   Yes, I've had several types of threats from
users, mainly just verbal abuse, but there really was a 'death to the
SYSOP' threat.  Your situation at the PALY HP3000 was different that
being the SYSOP of a public access system.  It is not easy to deny anyone
from using this system and still allow new users to call in.  Your ideas
about rating messages and user identity are certainly possible, but I 
have no interest in doing it.
   About DES software... I know there was a very good article in a BYTE
back issue that gave a very detailed explanation of the DES algorithm.
I think it also included a machine language implementation.  I don't know
what issue.  Regards,..

Hi Dick.
I am in the process of writing a BBS to operate under Apple Pascal. 
Due to the quality of your craftsmanship I am trying to make my 
system as much as possible user compatible with 8bbs.
Out of curiosity I have a few questions to ask of you.
 1). assuming that all of your i/o routines are in Pal 8, how much space 
is required for your basic program.
 2). How much space do you leave in core for the current message?
 3). What type of data structure are you using for storage of msg's.
 4). I thought 20 lines was the maximum but msg #1 is labeled at 28 lines.how  
is this done?
 TO ALL WHO MAY BE INTERESTED....
 I have completed and tested all required i/o routines for my Apple Pascal bbs
I am currently working on the data structures and the menu of procedures
'  S)ummery R)etrive H)elp ' etc.
WHAT NEW PROCEDURES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ON A BBS?
 
Dick will you be going to the faire on friday? I would like to visit with
you either there or by phone ..I'm out of lines and will not TBC
  with Sincere thanks, Bob

Joe,
  You can start in stocks with next-to-nothing.  Cardinal rule:
risk only what you are SURE you can afford to lose.  If you
get forced (by financial emergency) to pull out of the market,
it will **ALWAYS** be at the worst time.
  Merrill Lynch (big brokerage firm) puts out a paperback book
with some pedestrian title like "How to Invest in Stocks" which
is a reasonably good intro to the language and mechanics of
playing the stock market.  You can learn a lot just by talking
to account execs (=salesmen) at different "houses" ... their
advice is free.                           -- Kerry

Hi Larry,
   8BBS is mostly a "do it yourself" system.  If you want a password, just
help yourself by using the  U  function.  Some things you should know...

password you must also make sure the case matches (uppper case is NOT the

Subject: 8BBS secrets...

Hi Robert,
   As you can see from the I function, Dick hasn't been on for about a month.
So I'll try to answer the questions and let him know that you want to talk
to him.  The BASIC portion of 8BBS takes about 19K of 12bit words.  About 4K of
of that is stored ASCII prompt strings.  When a user is entering a msg, all
20 lines of 80 char's are stored in a string array and written to disk only
when the Save command is given.  The file structure is record I/O for all the
data files (User Name, User Data, Messages, Message Index) and sequential
I/O for all the text files (Other Systems, Help Info, Bulletins, Welcome).
Messages longer than 20 lines can be created by using a program to take a
OS/8 text file and insert it into the 8BBS message files.
   I'll be at the Faire on Friday, but I doubt if Dick plans to be there
any of the days.  I'll be passing out free 8BBS reference cards.  [NOTE:
to others... Don't bother to ask to me to mail you a card, get someone to
get it for you at the Faire].  About the clock 'accuracy',  that was a 
totally random coincidence that it was that close to NBS.  I re-enter the
time every evening after I restart the system.  It is often a minute or
two off since I don't enter the seconds.  Regards,..

Hall) at 2:00 PM fri & Sat. I expect to be there
Sunday too. Bernard will (I expect) be there Friday
only. This really is informal, just stop by and say

P.S. If you need/have spare transportation tell me

Note to everyone who has problems with 8BBS dropping carrier
before their modems can send carrier: Try holding down the
'0' on touch-tone systems--the tones generated fake out the
receiving modem into thinking that there is another modem,
so you can just hold down the '0' until your modem locks
onto the carrier, then let go.

From the TELENET users reference guide..."If you have any questions,
the Customer Service Desk (800-336-0437) will be happy to answer them."
 
TELENET signon procedure.  Dial access number.  Type 2 carriage returns.
When TELENET says "TERMINAL=" enter 4 character id for your terminal
or simply press return.  TELENET prompts with an @.  Type a C, skip
a space and typethe network address of the computer you want to talk to
followed by a carriage return.  It appears that the normal address format
is the telephone area code followed by a two digit number (e.g 408 45).
Other commands possible after the @ are D (disconnect from computer but
stay on TELENET), <cr>D<cr> to interrupt your computer session and return
to TELENET.  CONT<cr> to return to your computer session after being in
TELENET command mode.  FULL<cr> full duplex and HALF<cr> for no echo.
STAT<cr> gives id number of TELENET port you are using.  TAPE<cr> to
signify your input will be paper tape or cassette.
 
TELENET has a booklet (I don't know address) of various public Data Bases

Subject: O list download

The Other systems list is just one file.  I can see no valid reason to
break it into several files.   8BBS does recognize the XON - XOF protocol.
This means that if your micro is loading data into a buffer it can send
XOF (^S) to 8BBS.  8BBS will then suspend transmission until your micro
is ready to receive more input.  Your micro then sends a XON (^Q) to 
tell 8BBS to resume transmission.  If you use this protocol, you should
be able to write the buffer to a disk file whenever you need to to avoid
losing info.  Regards,..

THANKS FOR YOUR NUMBERS...YOU'RE RIGHT, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE ABOUT US NOT
HAVING ANYTHING YET.  
I liked your insights about the obtaining procedures for these things:
It does seem to fit the McDonald's mentality that if you ask for a
game stamp you receive several, where-as if you ask for a couple stamps
you receiveONE with the admonition about one-per-person-per-hour-per-
store. I have a way to access the McDonald's inventory control computer,
and I'm trying to figure out a way to order myself an issue of stamps
for my own personal use.  I'll keep ya posted on this.

Rather odd... Why should I believe you are 'Nate Jones' and not just
someone that wants to get his password so he can use that name?  If you
are 'Nate Jones' you should be able to tell me if you use a video terminal

you'll get the password.  Regards,..

  Why the hell do you call all the way up here in the
Bay Area for your childish fights, when you live in the
L.A. area??? Why can't you just find a BBS near you, and
save some money, as well as relieving us all from the chore
of seeing all those messages ... although it does get inter-
esting seeing who's going to do what next to whom ...
  Amazingly enough, some of us really couldn't care less
what Susan has done to you or you have done to Susan.
 
So why not just send a message to ALL telling that you
are moving your fight to a L.A. BBS, and all who want 
ringside seats can just call there, probably at $$$ per
minute!

Are you tired of having your ears continually blasted out with
that familiar blaring busy signal? Well, why not call 2KBBS
at (408) 727-1640? It is an HP2000-based BBS, and it is
multi-user so you don't get busy signals! The system has
recently been improved, and there is now a Chat feature so
you can talk with other users. The procedure for calling is:
  Call (408) 727-1640     [a Santa Clara number]
  Hit <return><return><linefeed>
The system types 'PLEASE LOG IN'
  Type 'HEL-B200,,3'  to get the bulletin board account
From there it's pretty self-explanatory...
 
I am not connected with them; just a concerned user who would
like to see some more people using the system!!
 
Just think:  *NO* busy signals!

Subject: Suspense Fiction

  I keep thinking that if it would be possible to to go through
old 8BBS backups and compile Susan's, Roscoe's, and Dave's

be a masterpiece of prose fiction, jam-packed
with exciting, unusual characters, loads of laughs, hair-raising

Whatever may happen in the denouement, I will know that after
all this stuff, most people who give a shit (however
small) about their tiff will have been so baffled and
disillusioned by their tactics as to discredit all of them~
for life.  Believe NOONE!!!  That kind of stuff seems
more than ever to have come from someone like a 20th-century

Subject: CATV converters

OK, there is a nifty little box called a "V to U" converter that
takes all the cable channels including mid and super band and 
converts them to UHF. Its a broadband device so for example, the
"Z" channel on Theta cable in LA (pix carrier is 109.25 Mhz.) will
translate to UHF channel 45 with this device.  Some of the big
electronic stores in your aera should have them. Try Muntz if you
have one there, or else I can arrange to send you one.
This thing is totally legal, provided that the cable in your house
has the info, without having to tamper with any traps in the service
drop.  Some cable systems put "garbage" near the chroma carrier to 
foul up getting the movie channels, I have had no experience with
these systems.  Best bet for fooling around is over the air systems
(ON TV or Select) or Multipoint dist. systems, if youre into
microwave, or sat. TV if you got a big dish and LOW noise amp.
leave messages for me on PMS LA (213-291-9314), this thing is too
hard to get into, I've been trying on and off for a month, and this
is the first time I've gotten in.

Thermal lances have been around for several years. Putting one together
requires no great skill, just a basket full of money for the components.
Mosler and friends are busily trying to figure a way to block the
use of a lance, but all that heat has to end up somewhere! About the
only thing they've gotten is a safe with a refrigrated metal layer,
but even that's not good enough against the incredible amount of localized
heat.  I haven't seen the movie. I do hope they were wearing gas masks.

The big problem with these is that they are VERY expensive in terms
of computation.  Encoding a message with thexRivest/etc method
involves breaking it up into thepequivalent of 100-digit nubers
and then multiplying them by the key.  Know any fast 10x100
multiply routines?  Care to iterate over a long message with one?
 
It's also expensiveto find a key-pair (encoding/decoding keys).
It's of course not nearly as expensive as finding the second key
from the first, which takes several hunderd years.
 
WhenI get around to doing somesecurity stuff, I'll probably use a DES-like
algorithm, but put it back to 64 bits like it was before the NSA
shortened it so they coud|decode it.  If you truly care I'd suggest
doing txe|same.  It means youhave to do it in software|instead
ofhardware, though.

Subject: Trapdoors, DES and such

Hi John,
   Thanks for the info on the 'public key' encryption methods.  I'd heard
that it had someting to do with finding large primes.  Sounds like it is
not feasable with 8 or 12 bit CPU's.  Maybe a 68000 or iAPX-32 would make
it.  How would you get fast enough throuput with a software implementation?
I've been thinking of useing a hardware DES chip (WD 2001) and useing
double encyrption method.  That is, encrypt the encrypted data, wouldn't
that be faster than software and result in a longer effective key length?
   Regards,..

Subject: Speach and Spiel

I have been playing for a while with a T.I. Speak and Spell, trying to connect
it to my PDP/8 system. A friend has a board, sold by PERCOM, called a
"Speak to me two". This incredibly expensive toy allows you to connect the S+S
to the printer port of a Trash-80 expansion interface. For better than 60
bucks, you get just two chips (a 7414 and a 7474!). Anyway, I tried to copy
the circuit, and modified a S+S. It doesn't work! I get all kinds of gibberish,
of a generally random nature. If you know TRS-80 hardware, can you give
me any information on how the printer interface works? Specifically,
1:     When I do an output instruction, does a one bit in the A register
       become a logic low or a logic high at the printer port?
2:     Is the BUSY line into the interface high for busy, or low for
       busy?
 
       With this information, I should be able to get this kludge working.
       Thanks,
       Dick

Subject: Rivest codes

To solve a Rivest code, the essential problem is to find the two
prime factors of a very large number. (200+ digits). The keys that
you keep seceret are two primes. The encoding involves doing a modulo
multiplication using the product of the primes, and decoding is
the same operation using one of the primes. (It's more involved than
that but I don't have the paper here.) The en/decode function can be
done by a multiply/shift function, which doesn't take as long as
you might think. However, as was pointed out, factoring a large
number is a non-trivial problem (it's called NP incomplete)
and finding the primes to do is not easy. A method was discussed
that in a sense developed numbers that were PROBABLY prime (a very
strange concept).                      ...phil

LATE AT NIGHT AT A PUBLIC MAILBOX, THE SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER DROPS IN A
MYSTERIOUS PARCEL.  IN THIS ACT, HE HAS JOINED THE RANKS OF THOUSANDS

THE STORY BEGINS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES OF THE MID-1980'S WITH THE 'BROWN BOX',
AN INNOCENT-LOOKING PACKAGE EQUIPPED WITH A MECHANISM TO CHANGE THE CARD
IN ITS ADDRESS WINDOW.  BY WAITING UNTIL IT HAS PASSED THE WEIGHING AND
STAMP CANCELLATION STATIONS, IT CAN RIDE ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR THE
PRICE OF TRAVELLING TO THE NEXT TOWN.
 
ANOTHER TOOL OF THE TRADE IS THE 'LETTER DIVERTER', AN ORDINARY MANILA
ENVELOPE WITH A SLOT CUT IN THE SIDE.  WHEN JOSTLED AMONG THE OTHER
LETTERS IN A MAILBAG, ONE INEVITABLY FALLS THROUGH.  A PIECE OF TAPE
INSIDE THE ENVELOPE OR A PAPER TRAPDOOR ATTACHED TO THE SLOT RETAINS
THE LETTER UNTIL ITS NEW DESTINATION IS REACHED.
 
PERHAPS THE MOST FAMOUS EXPLOIT OF A MAIL PHREAK IS THAT OF THE LEGENDARY

Subject: Your concerns

Hi Gary,
   It is nice to know that you have a serious interest in 8BBS.  I don't...
I only run it for my own personal amusement/enjoyment/curiosity/etc..  The
 fact that others may find the system usefull or interesting is incidental.
   The only 'right' a 8BBS user has is the 'right' to choose not to call
the system.  I refuse to let users intimidate me into performing any type
of 'work' for them on this system.  What this means is that users do NOT
have the 'right' to demand that the system conform to their expectations.
    I too, would prefer that ST, RD, DS and such types, would refrain from
using the system as a dumping ground.  Don't expect the SYSOP to clean up
after them.  I understand that they have had their accounts on MIT systems
revoked, so it does seem that they are being denied access to some systems
already.  Since 8BBS is a 'public access' system it is NOT possible to
keep someone off this system.
    Your parting comment of "READ MY MESSAGE OR YOU COULD BE SORRY!!" seems
odd.  What did you hope to gain by that?  Users that make threats give the
impression that they are unable to express themselves coherently and there-
fore must resort to threats.  You are certainly welcome to use 8BBS, feel
free to expand on what you meant by your threat.  Regards,..

Hi Eric,
   For info on 8BBS you could answer the logon question by indicating you
are a 'new' user, then read the files that describe 8BBS software.  You
could also check the first few msg's for info.  8BBS software is NOT easily
transportable to any other systems (not even another PDP8/E).  8BBS uses
non-standard DEC software and some non-standard DEC hardware.
   I talked to the Novation rep at the Faire today, and he claimed that
the Auto-Cat does have auto-dial capability, but since it requires special
CPU generated timing it is not advertised.  He said that it is documented
in the manual and that it involves the use of pin 25.  But... what I'm
waiting for is their 'promised' new modem that will have 300-1200 baud
direct connect, auto-answer and auto-dial using ASCII character sequences.
I tried the 800 number and it doesn't work for me either.  Regards,..
   P.S.  The Novation 1200 baud mode is only compatible with Bell 202 or
another Novation 1200, doesn't work with Bell 212A or Vadic.

To sysop at 11:46:04 on 04-Apr-81.
Subject: DES and the width of the key

If you encrypt the message by feeding it through two chips,
each of which uses an n-bit code, you can take the two codes
and interchange them through separate methods.  This reduces
the possibility that the code will be compromised, allowing
immediate access.  Compromising the code is the most dangerous.
 
However, you have not encrypted the message with a 2 x n key.
There will be some other n bit key which can decode the algor
ithm in one step.  The key has not become harder to guess or
determine by exhaustive search.
 
Two examples:
 
Consider the following chip, which accepts the message and
encodes it using the algorithm "add m to the ascii value of
each character".  This is a key which is likely to be 8 bits
of information.
 
If you pass information through two of these chips, you can
decode it with one eight-bit key (key-1 plus key-2).


Message number 7920 is 19 lines from George Burdell
To sysop at 11:58:51 on 04-Apr-81.
Subject: sysop

The same thing would happen with the DES chip.  (Otherwise, why
do you think the Government successfully prevented the chip man-
ufacturers from producing chip with twice the key width (which
would have produced a key that could not have been forcibly cracked
in a lifetime)?)
 
Second example:
 
If you have an algorithm with an n-bit key, you can split it up
into n information packets, each of which contains the binary
value of the bit it represents and its position.  Depending on
the length of the string, this position information could be
further split up, in a tree structured fashion.
 
There are an infinite number of things you can do to split up
that information and transmit it separately.  Doubling the
length of the key simply doubles the point at which this infinite
tree starts, but doesn't provide any benefits on any reasonable
algorithms.


Message number 7921 is 15 lines from George Burdell
To sysop at 12:24:47 on 04-Apr-81.
Subject: sysop

If you split a key in half, you reduce the amount of time
it takes to perform the algorithm the key describes by
2 to the n/2.
 
With a sixteen bit key, you reduce the amount of time it
takes to decode a message by a factor of 256.  (A lifetime,
maybe?)  This applies to the type of machine on which this
decoding would be done.
 
Now with half of a sixteen bit key known, (if you know its
position, that's only one more bit) you only have to perform
256 guesses instead of 65536.
 
Taking the DES key twice, you do get twice as many bits available
for transmission of the code from point A to point B.

Dear Gary;
 
It's truly amazing how some of us can complain so emphatically about
the arguments and disagreements of others, when in fact their sole goal
is to acquire some attention for themselves.  Well, you got it.  Not
because I want to get into it with you, but because you told an out-
right LIE about ROSCOE and I.  
We have never carried our hassle to any other BBS system, (other than
a very brief exchange on MOM, and a couple of private messages on
Starshit), so I wonder just who all these sysops are all over the
country that allegedly don't want us on their systems because we
dirtied it up with our smut-throwing.
I would be very interested in seeing a list of sysops that these
allegations were made by, for the purposes of verifying your ac-
cusations.  And, in the likely event that you are full of bull about
these allegations, and don't know what the hell you're talking about,

Subject: 8bbs involvement

Personally, I'm against any censorship by the sysop. I'd much rather
have the people involved clean up their act by themselves. And, if I
can believe the messages by Susan and Dave, I think that maybe they
have figured that a clean-up is best for all involved.  
 
If we encourage the sysop to impose restrictions on message content
or callers, then the system stops being an open forum, and just more
of an ego trip. [I'm not accusing you of anything, Bernard!]
 
I hope that the wave of crap is over. This system went way downhill
when all it was was mudslinging. Let's get back to whatever we normally
do, instead of namecalling.

Look Gary,
       They're at a truce status for now, don't go and
start a second war.  Benard will NOT censor anything on
8BBS, so why don't we clean up the system ourseelves.
This means, Gary, not to sling profanities at other users.
No one here needs that, least of all Dave, Sue, and Roscoe.
       Have you forgotten that there are people like me
that said that we'd be happy to have Dave, Sue, and Roscoe
if they would just not fight on the systems?  The whole
reason for getting them to stop the fight was so that there
would be more time available for dialing-in to 8BBS.
 
       How about just waiting, and I think that those three
can carry themselves as responsible 8BBS users.  Now is
not the time for vigilante/militant users to carry on
a dead fight.

Ok Guys,
Now it is your turn to clean up YOUR acts.
       Susan, Dave, and Roscoe have ended the fight.
Now, doesn't it seem wise to you to stop slinging
profanities at everyone?  If you can't hold back 
something as simple as that, than you probably don't
deserve this system.  There is no censorship policy on
8BBS.  This is a free system, now PLEASE, use it, don't
abuse it.
 
       When 8BBS first started out, there was a grandfather
that let his four year old grandaughter use the system.
He hasn't been on since last September.  Why? Because
a few users don't know any words that are longer than
four letters.  Can 8BBS become a respectable BBS and not
be home for the low-life of the earth?  You answer that
question yourself.

Attention all CBBS Santa Clara (408-241-1956)
users.  Due to combined negligence on my part
and that of the West Coast Computer Faire Security
Force, the entire system (motherboard/mainframe) and
two 8 inc discs) was stolen shortly after the faire
closed for the final clean-up day.
We are actively trying to relace the system and WILL BE
UP as soon as we can.   The following phone convention
is in effect:  the phone will not be busied out, if it
does not answer after 3 rings, then we are still down.  If
you get a busy signal, then we are back up and fnctioning
normally.

Sigh it would be nice if we weren't accosted by
so many people indirectly in violent verbal abuse
mode. I have ignored it lately, I mean it is kinda
ridiculous; it's like reading the national inquirer
N times over. It is also sad that the most technically
sophisticated  BBS is given to having such collections
of unsavory messages. One just hopes that stupidity
ignorance and violence are thier own punishments.
However sigh Americans have never learned to be Gentle
and worse yet it seems that we are currently not on such
a path. However this in no way condones obnoxiousness
and idiocy. Sometimes I wish we lived in a fundamentally
different and better world, or at least one that had
large sized better parts,however I don't see how to create
such a thing in a society that rewards aggressiveness and
downright ruthlessness so much.

However this is rather depressing, not only

I dunno it is all of that " I am a wonderful law abiding

a downer too. 
Funny thing is that messaging on the arpanet seems to
be as intense but over-all much more pleasent and I don't
think it is causing someone is watching over them,
there are lots of angry things but they calm down and
the quality of conversation is a bit better.
At least with PCNET them could slug it out amongst
themselves without drawing whole universe into it.
I hope this bad stuff is an isolated local thing and that
elsewhere in public systems, intense but more positive
messages are exchanged and better activities contemplated.

To get off a host on Telenet, but still be on the Telenet system,
(Like for Host-Hopping), just type the atsign on a line by itself,
hit return, and when you get the atsign prompt type the letter D.
It will disconnect you from the host and leave you ready to con-
tinue your scan.

Subject: Telenet Hosts

 
The best way to find out what is on Telenet is by scanning.  Pick a
popular area code and start with 10 and go all the way to 150 or so...
Every time you hit a system, try to hack the login.  Sometimes you
can login as DEMO, or OPERATOR, or GAMES, etc.  I have been very
successful with this type of scanning.  At the @ type C AAA NN where
"C" means Collect, "AAA" is an area code, and "NN" or "NNN" is a
number between 10 and 150+.  If you get a host that you can't login
to, type @ <CR> D and it will return you to system prompt.  Telenet
no longer publishes a user-guide that lists the hosts, but it is rumoured
that there exists such a list on one of the 909 machines...909 95D is
a list of all their dial-ups.  And there is a guy that answers their
voice line (the 800 number) in the middle of the night who can be
persuaded into giving out occasionally useful tidbits of info on the
system.  Have fun.

Apparently some loser, who I don't want to know who it

Susan Thunder because that message is to blatently
obvious.  Whoever it was is a total loser.  If people
can't even respect other individuals rights-of-name
then they shouldn't have been born.  If you were the one,
think a minute, everyone is sick of this damn war.
       Maybe one of the '3' wrote that message, most likely
it was written by some worthless scum that wants the war
to continue, sigh, can't people act like adults and respect
each other?  I believe so, but, I also believe in Peter Pan.
Sigh, come on people!  Let's just make life so unbearable

  I have an unknown system in San Francisco with three

says "ACCOUNT/PASSWORD INVALID" or like that so I can't tell

of system it might be?  (or who might own it?)  If anyone can
furnish any information that can help me explore the

Subject: privacy of user log

I think you did not see one of my msgs.  My interest in user
log privacy was an intellectual/academic one, not a real concern
for myself.  It was sparked by Bernard's interest in DES encryption
my point (to summarize) if you g t all that trouble (des) of encrypting
msgs, don't you think the user log should be private info also?
Remember, lots of 'security'  is by implied access, for example, a
programmer writes a program that processes data.  He does not
have access to the data, that is specified by the user when the
program runs.  But the programmar can compromise the data by
writing a program that say, blinks the lights on the computer or
stops printng a report for a while when a certain type of info is
processed.  like 'if president's salary = salaray then for I=1 to 5000
do...' if the data is read, a noticeable pause in the program
execution (assumming the programmer can watch the program) indicates
effectively, the value of the data.  This is not original, I read tis
in a book on privacy/security whic I started reading after all the
accusations of Ma Bell monitoring this line, using DES, ETC.
p.s.  Did anybody ever recover those stolen floppies??

For those of you who know what CCIS is, here is some information on
testing the trunks via the Stored Program Control Processor Channel
on the DS 40 keyboard.
The output message format is TKM00 TRK:aa-bbb cccc
Explantion--Trunk status update report.
Explanation of variable fields:
     aa-bbb=Trunk identifier, where:  aa=Trunk Register Block Index
                                                            (01-31)

     cccc--Specifies stimulus which caused state change, where:
 
VPCF = VPC Retest Failure

HWOF = Trunk off High + Wet List

TRQM = Trunk Query Mismatch
VPCR = VPC Retest Restore
ATXR = Auto Transmission Test Restore
UQLB = Unequipped Label Signal Received
DSBL = Trunk Automatically Disabled
 
Of course some of you are surely wondering what good it does to know
what the computer-generated trouble messages mean...Well, if somebody
were to be screwing around with various CCIS commands, it is helpful to
know what the return trunking messages mean, so that one knows if one's
commands have been useful.  Note the DSBL message.  Could it be that
one's hacking efforts have been successful if this message is generated?
Pending interest in this subject, I will leave more about the CCIS

Subject: A Free Zork, Sort-of...

 
Dear Mark:
There is a system that a University has up that has a weird version
of ZORK on it called DUNGEON.  I don't know how close to the real
thing you need, but this is a pretty hot version.  They also have
a 350 point version of ADVENTURE, as well as a few other games.
And it's free to use, other than the cost of the telephone call, if
in fact there would be such a charge.
The number to this system is:  (315)423-1313
When it prompts with the / type DEMO and it will explain all you need to
know.  And if you're really into games software and other assorted
types of fantasies, there is a BBS running specifically for this
interest.  It's called MAGNETIC FANTASIES.  They also publish a
magazine...their system number is (213)465-1431.  And I'm sure that
someone on there should know how you can access an original ZORK, too.
 
Have fun.
-----Susan.

Subject: IT'S TOO BAD...

 
It's too bad that every time someone tries to do something positive
for this BBS and the user-morale, (i.e. leaving pertinent info) that
some jack-ass has to come along and negate it.  I don't blame you all
for your selfishness:  in my case it has been a question of spite...
Why would I want to leave my enemies information that they could use?
I'll be happy to explain how to access CCIS.  It is State of the Art.
To those of you who like to MF off tandems, I respect where you're
coming from, but shit!!  There aren't that many tandems left that can
go anywhere!  The formidible CCIS just takes a little bit of understanding
and a lot of hacking right now.  With the appropriate manuals we are
on our way to a new kind of rush.  The system works the same: the
"tones" are just travelling on a seperate data curcuit, that's all.
So ya get into the data circuit, tap around a little bit, and hang up
your telephone.  It rings back in a few seconds with the number you want
to call ringing in your ear for you...The call originates in Ma Bell's
massive trunking, instead of from your own phone.  And the equipment
doesn't know where the hell the call came from.  There is no AMA. And
it's safer than boxing.  What more could we want?  We can even type out
a trunk for our exclusive use on the computer!!              THUNDER

Well, the UCSC Unix B has zork, plus many other very good games.
They have a games account, games managers, and even a games shell.
It is very good.  Unfortunately, they are a little restrictive about
giving accounts out.  You cannot get one for free unless you are
a student or a faculty member.  Of course, you can always pay
for one.  I believe it is $1.00/connect-hour + $0.05 for every
block of disk storage, per month.  Plus about $30.00 to start it
up.  I DO know an account I might let you use, but I must talk
to you about it first.  The dialup for UCSC is:
(408) 425-8023.  unix A is number 1, unix B is number 2, and
unix C is number 3.  My number, if you want that account, is
(408) 425-0754, and (408) 425-0842 if I don't answer or am busy.

I think you should consider your emotional state when you write
messages here.  Responding to violence with violence, or violence
to non-violence, or (in this case) violence to mediocrity just
demotes yourself to the level you are condemning, or lower.  I
am referring to the message you left for Ms. Thunder recently,
condemning her lifestyle, her speech, and her use of this system.
I don't remember her saying anything like that to you.  Why do you
have to be so reckless when writing messages to someone I doubt you
even know?  Almost no one on this system knows any other person
(picked at random) who uses it, so long arguments, criticisms, etc.
are never called for (to quote ZORK) in a high class establishment
like this.  How do YOU know if Ms. Thunder is really that bad?  I
don't care what someone writes about me on this system.  I can only
form an opinion after meeting them.  And if I don't like them, I don't
start fouling computer systems with nonsensical comments, but tell them
myself.  Maybe that's the only way you can relate to people, by telling
them nasty things over computer systems, where you don't have to see
them.  If that is the way it is, I feel sorry for you.

Hmm.  Well, I hope you have fun when you go to UCSC.  Since I'll be

you up there.  In any case, I use the Ames TIP.  Unfortunately,
we are not served by sprint or any other such system I know of,
so I have a rather large phone bill.  They may put in SPC service
here soon, though.  UCSC has 2 PDP-11/70's running UNIX V&,
oops.  that is UNIX V7, and a VAX-11/780 running UNIX V7 too,
as well as a Magnusson M80 (IBM-360/75 simulator).  There
are also many smaller computers scattered around the campus, and
terminals all over the place.

Hi Marc,
   Sorry 'bout being exposed to such language.  It is just another sign of
people's inability to express themselves coherently in a civil manner.  It
is perhaps unfortunate that 8BBS does not have a dedicated SYSOP to monitor
all message entry and immediately remove any info that could cause offense.
I am away a lot, and don't check the system very often so it it rather
difficult to maintain tight control over msg content.  I too, would very
much like to see a rational, reasoned flow of words.  I do try to remove
obvious garbage when I notice it, but perhaps I've missed some.  You didn't

HELLO THERE, PACKARD HERE,
  AND NOW FOR SOME TELEPHONE STUFF!
THE TELEPHONE HAS TWO BASIC STATES:
ON HOOK AND OFF HOOK. WHEN THE PHONE IS
ON HOOK, IT LOOKS LIKE INFINITY OHMS
TO THE INCOMING LINE. WHEN OFF HOOK,
ITS RESISTANCE DROPS TO ABOUT 660
OHMS. IF A 660 OHM, 1 WATT RESISTOR
IS CONNECTED ACROSS THE RED AND GREEN
WIRES, THE LINE LOOKS LIKE AN OFF-HOOK
PHONE IS CONNECTED TO IT.
LINE VOLTAGES:
WHEN ON HOOK, THE PHONE LINE SUPPLIES
APPROX. 48 VOLTS ACROSS THE RED AND
GREEN WIRES. WHEN RINGING STARTS, A
20 HERTZ, 45 VOLT AC SIGNAL IS
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE 48 VOLTS DC,
MAKING THE SIGNAL LOOK LIKE AC
THAT SWINGS FROM 0 TO PLUS 90 VOLTS.

...WHEN THE PHONE IS TAKEN OFF

WHEN YOU TALK ON THE PHONE, YOU

Subject: LANGUAGE

Ho-hum.  Regarding responsibility and other such matters,
do exactly what you want.  If I feel a need or a desire to use smutty language
I intend to.  It's hardly a matter of responsibility.  Seems to me it is more
a matter of freedom of choice.  Dirty words don't hurt anyone, far as
I can tell--and even the spectre of self-censorship rather
bothers me.  Remember EC Comics? The Comics Code, and all of the
restrictions imposed there, came about as the result of self-censorship.
As a result, creativity in comics has been rather arbitrarily restricted.
Similarly, the Hayes Office of Hollywood was the self-censoring unit
for the movies, and went way too far...possibly actually damaged the
freedom of expression in the movies until the last ten years.  If
smut offends you, you, the user, may feel free to use a system that
practices censorship.  But don't expect me or anyone else to choose
my style to meet with your sensitivities.  It doesn't work that way for
me, anyhow.  Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.  The
word of Sin is Restriction.

Subject: Sequential msg read

Hi Lynn,
   For info on sequential msg retrieval see msg # 1161.  You can also get
info from the Help files with  H;SEQ  .  The main reason 8BBS doesn't
support the sequential retrieval mode where you are asked if you want to
read each msg is that that method is VERY slow and time consuming.  Since
this is a single user system it is important to make efficient use of
your connect time.  If you use the  R;NNNN,-  or  R;NNNN;^  format you
can always use the ^C or C to skip a msg you're not interested in.  Typing
a ^K or K get's you back to the Function: prompt.  Of course you can still
use the S or ^S - ^Q to stop and start output so you don't miss anything.
    Regards,..

Glad I got a chance to read your messages before they got killed.
Just one thing I want to add--My voltmeter gave a 6 volt reading
for off-hook voltage.  Also, I think the way Ma Bell prevents 
people from doing what you said is by disconnecting the
line about 20 seconds after the person receiving the call hangs
up.  Before they started that, people could hang up (the person
being called hung up, caller stayed on) and re-answer with
a capacitor in series. Now, it would only be good for 20 seconds
of communication, hardly worth anything...Regards...

Subject: 8BBS backup

Hi Joshua,
   Yes, 8BBS files are backed up.  Not because of fear of user damage
but due to realization of my own carelessness when I do msg purges.
A user does not actually delete a msg when he 'Kills' it.  All that
happens is that that msg is flagged as being 'inactive'.  It is very
easy to re-activate 'killed' messages.  A msg doesn't really get
deleted until I do a msg purge.  Sometimes I've messed up the msg purge
procedure and have lost a few msg's and scrambled the file structure so
that is the reason I make a backup.  Regards,..

There is not a physical change of the battery across the line.
"Change in Battery" is short for change in the measurement of
the battery.
 
The C.O. is providing a constant current source of about

voltage will vary but the current remains fairly constant.

Subject: A bit more on 212 / Vadic dif's

The differences in modulation technique between the Bell 212
and the Vadic 3405 give rise to an important operating difference:
 
With the Vadic operating in "High-Speed" mode, speaking to another
VADIC, data may be transmitted at any speed up to 1200 bps.  The
high-speed frequencies are used even if the data is at 300, so a
normal 300 baud modem can't talk these frequencies.
 
With the 212 operating in high-speed mode, the data better really
be at 1200, otherwise it won't get sent correctly.
 
The Vadic 3451 incorporates ALL THREE modulation techniques.  It
can automatically answer with any one of the three (the "HS" switch
is ignored when answering).  When originating, the "HS" switch will
determine whether to start up with the low-speed frequencies or to
try both the Bell and the Vadic High-Speed frequencies.  (You can
end up with two Vadic 3451s handshaking at the Bell frequencies
rather than the Vadic freqs depending on the timing of when you
throw the originate switch.

Ron, I could give you a MNET account to use (although I
really don't know how long it will last), but I don't
think that a DM account is worth a FREE MicroNET account,
do you??  I thought not.  If you have something VALUABLE
let me know, then I might give it to you.

I DECIDED TO CALL THIS A MONOLOGUE BECAUSE THATS WHAT THIS

THIS AND THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES.  I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE FOR
TWO WHOLE MONTHS (I FEEL SO DEPRIVED) SO NOW I HAVE TO MAKE

FIRST:
SUSAN IS ONTO A GOOD THING.  CCIS IS WHERE ALL TELCOS ARE
AIMING TO GET THEM SELVES.  CCIS IS THE STATE OF THE ART.
THE ONLY PROBLEM - I DON'T UNDERSTAND CCIS.  I AM HOPING
SUSAN CAN HELP ME OUT THERE.  (ONCE AGAIN - SUSAN THUNDER
DID *-NOT-* SNITCH TO MA BELL OR ANYONE ELSE ABOUT ME).  AS
IT WAS STATED AT LAST YEARS PHREAK CONVENTION, BEING ABLE
TO MAKE FREE PHONE CALLS DOES NOT MAKE YOU A PHONE PHREK.
PHONE PHREAKING AND COMPUTER PHREAKING HAVE MERGED.  IF
YOU CAN'T SPEAK 'BASIC' THEN YOU CAN'T BE A PHREAK, OR
SO IT GOES.  MA BELL IS BECOMMING TOTALLY COMPUTERIZED, BOTH
IN RECORD KEEPING, AND IN SWITCHING.  THE CRACK BELL

MANY PHREAKS I COME INTO CONTACT WITH ARE SO DEEPLY INTO

GUESS IT IS BECAUSE PHONES LINK THEM WITH THE COMPUTERS.
I STARTED OUT AS A PHONE HARDWARE NUT, COLLECTING EVERYTHING
I COULD GET MY HANDS ON.  NOW A PHONE IS JUST A PHONE.  
NOW FREE PHONE CALLS ARE JUST A CONVINIENCE.  I LIKE AND AM
AFTER THE INFORMATION.  ONCE I CRACK A SYSTEM OR WHATEVER,
GREAT.  NOW I CAN GET AT THE INFORMATION.  THEN I GO OFF
IN SEARCH OF MORE INFO, AND LEAVE THAT SYSTEM ALONE.
PHONE PHREAKING SHOULD BE AN INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEDIUM.
NOT A WAY TO SEEK REVENGE.  IF WE DON'T SHARE WITH EACH 
OTHER, THEN WHAT IS THE USE OF BBS'S LIKE THIS?
ANYWAY, I'M LOSING MYSELF IN ALL THIS RAMBLING, SO I HAD

Blah! Second time writing this, system dropped me... I'm really curious
about what Page is up to.  One story has it that he was responsible for
"The Secret Rituals of the OTO" being published.  Bad manners, at the
very least.  Rituals are secret not because of anything Big and
Powerful, these days, but mostly because they are of the best and
greatest impact to the initiate if they are discovered in the proper
sequence.  Luckily, I never read them.
       Anyway, what sort of condition is Boleskine in? Is the place open
to tourists (???!???)

Subject: Magick by the Page

Dear Joshua;
     There was once a time in my life when I was asked to assist
somebody with something because of my "vibes".  I was having a drink
at a club called the Rainbow in Hollywood (this was in '77) and this
guy comes up to me and says, "Jimmy Page would like to have the star
you are wearing."  Of course my reaction was something like "What kind
of bullshit is this guy laying on me??"  The star, by the way, was
on a chain around my neck:  I had bought it in a curiosity shop on
Santa Monica Blvd.  It was sterling silver, had 7 points, and I had
engraved the word "THUNDER" on it.  I wore it constantly, never taking
it off because I thought it brought me good luck.  (This was before I
had been initiated into anything)...So I tell this guy that if Jimmy 
Page wants my star, then he's going to have to come over and get it
himself.  He did.
     And we sat and talked for a few minutes.  Avoiding alot of details
that have no pertinence to the topic at hand, I was introduced to
Crowley and his theories/philosophies.  I was invited to participate
in a ritual celebrating the vernal equinox.  And, apparently, my perfor-
mance must not have been up to par because that was the end of that.

Subject: What is it about this system?

Hi Mark, & others,
   There have been several quieries lately by users asking how to do
"keyword" or selective searches.  Is there some sort of psychological
revulsion associated with the word "HELP" or the "H" character?  Or
perhaps users immediately change to 'EXPERT' mode when they know very
little aobut the system and thereby miss many of the prompts that offer
information?
    How is it possible for so many people who seem to have played
ADVENTURE to lose their curiosity when on 8BBS?  Are they afraid to
experiment?  8BBS software is quite robust and is not likely to 'crash'
if a user enters unexpected input.
 
P.S. 8BBS does indeed have selective search and/or retrieve.

(this system) but rather tends to alienate
them.
   Many times, on many other boards around
the country, I see messages from people
like you (who luckily, are in the minority
in the telecomputing world) and read many
replies saying exactly what I am saying.
   If you don't like a particular board,
why not simply exit the board quietly, without
leaving comments as you did, saying one
board or the other is better or worse
than the other. (See next Message)

Hello again....
What the hell are you doing Susan?
First you say that you are at peace with Roscoe and then you send
him dirty remarks and letters and then to say that you have
done nothing really burns me up!
Please keep that garbage of this system!! Thats all I ask.Do you remember
when this system was so popular that you could hardly get on at
any time of day or night?/
That has all changed because you and Roscoe had to bring your fights
on this system! People are getting real tired of this.
So can we all just call a truce and stop the bullshit?
Thats all I ask.Oh....my system is finally up (Sort of )!
If you wouldlike a password please let me know!!
If you would like to get moreinfo just call the computer at 415-965-1184
and login as 'Demo'.This account won't be up for about a week.
If you were to call right now you would get put on the diagnostics
disk.Once on the diagnostics disk press 'return' once and type in 'Config'.
This will allow you to see whats going on and what commands are availbale to
you at that time....Don't worry about hurting anything cause it's all
protected and shit like that.Well have fun and I hope to be hearing from

  Well, Thorson, speaking of misbegotten heritages, what
     genetic damage caused your brain to turn to mashed
     potatoes?  Where did you learn your logic?  From
     Willie Sutton?  Failure of a mechanical device is not
     permission to steal.  The hazard in placing machines
     in public is from thieves like you who can rationalize
     burglary.  I suppose you would be equally guiltless
     in taking money left carelessly lying about by a 
     businessman, a friend, or your grandmother?  Fie on
     you, you cretin.  Theft is always theft.  It is not
     cute and it is not forgiveable and it is not OK.
     There is KARMA and you WILL GET YOURS one day, perhaps
     at the hands of another double-thinker like yourself.

Subject: your comments on other systems

This is a public copy of my msg 8619 which I sent to you as RP.
You can concider this as my "apology". Upon reviewing your msg left
on PMS Santee, as well as the copies brought here by John Revelle,
I stand by the below statement. I await *your* apology.
-------------------
I think that it's funny that you immediately brand PMS Santee as "boring"
without exploring all that it has to offer. Did you check out the ALT
command? Did you look at the nearly 300k of text files available for
reading (including some on security of communications)? Did you
look at the download programs? 
       Or is it that any bbs that doesn't have talk about Adventure
or phreaking "boring"?                 ...phil
------------------
The users of various systems use those systems because they find the
contents of interest. Comments like yours only make people think that
the person is a JERK. (Note: I'm not saying that you are.)
       I would advise that you reconcider your attitude of "advertising"
8BBS for Bernard. I'm sure it doesn't help.

It seems that there are some of you phreaks out there that like to
cause trouble for those of us that are honest(with in the group) phreaks,
instead of using those energies for something better like hackingSPC
or Ma Bell or the like. My account at MIT AI has disappeared, and David Horvath
recieved a call from one RMS@MIT AI about his request for his account to
be terminated, apparently it was sent by someone not logged in. Why must people
bother those of us that don't bother them?? I stay out of little battles
and arguments and am here to get and give information, both of which I have
done quite a good bit of. 
Ask steve pearl, dan johnson, bill doger, and horvath, I haven't done 
anyone anything badto anyone,as a matter of fact I even introduced 
the phila area phreaks to something called Xerox, which is a centrax
that cann be used like a watts extender. If anyone has anything 
against me out there, tell me so, not act like a jerk and a coward and
hid in the databanks as it were. I am willing to conduct a human mature
conv%rsation with anyone that is willing to do so with me.     
One last thing--> I am not David Horvath, I do things fohim but we are
two seperate entities.
     Thank you to all that have read through this far, I would appreciate
 any and all hel in this matter(cont'd).

Well, there is no reason why you couldn't connect the video
output to a TV, but (is I remember correctly) the vt100 is
80 column, so that the characters would be almost totally
garbaged on the TV because a standard TV only has a bandwidth
thru the tuner of about 3 MHz, and for 80 column, you need
at least 10 MHz. About the smallest you can use with a TV
is 40 columns.  There is no reason you can't try it tho, but
I wouldn't go buy a RF mod. for just that purpose, it would
most likely turn out a waste of money...

I am looking for info on 1200 baud data transmission standards.
I am aware (but I know others are not) that data transmission over voice grade 
switched phone lines at 1200 baud is
not standardized (unlike 300 baud <Bell 103>).
 1). What formats are used (fsk, am,dpsk, etc.).
 2). For the systems which use half duplex (no reverce channel) what protocals 
are used for direction shifts?
 3) Who makes what? With what formats and protocals?
 
 If we upgrade our modems to 1200 baud without getting together on standards
the upgrades will be of limited use.
 
 I any one has a favorite system please tell us ( what/why).

Hi Paul,
   You didn't specify what size dynamic RAM's you plan on using.  You could
check out the INTEL refresh controller chip or the AMD refresh controller
IC.  I don't recall the IC numbers, just call them (or a distributor/rep)
and ask them for what you need.  Dynamic RAM's do have some drawbacks
compared to statics, but they are much less costly and if you design it
properly the refresh doesn't get in the way.  Regards,..

Hi Bob,
   I am aware of 4 different 1200 baud transmission 'standards'.  These are:
 
- BELL 202  half duplex only
- BELL 212  half duplex (not sure how it differs from 202)
- VADIC 3400 full duplex
- NOVATION 1200 full duplex
 
   The above 4 types are mutually exclusive.  Meaning that none of the above
can be understood by any of the others.  VADIC makes several models that
automaticly detect either 212 or VADIC mode and use the appropriate mode.
   I believe that the BELL 212 is the most widely used (not the best, tho).
   I expect that when 8BBS eventually gets 1200 baud, it will be the B
BELL 212 'standard'.
   What I'd really like is the new Hayes "Smart Modem" if it could handle
1200 baud...  Maybe next year..  Regards,..

Just wanted to point out that Bell 212 is FULL duplex 1200 baud both
ways.
       Standard voice grade lines can support up to (with luck) 2400
baud, which can be divided any number of ways (2400 baud half duplex,
1200 baud full duplex, or 1800 baud computer->terminal:150 baud
terminal->computer, to name three.)
 
oh, also, I believe that Vadic 3400 is 1200 baud full duplex as well.
The Vadic Triple modem will detect 103, 212, or 3400 and switch into
the proper mode.

Dear Anton;
Several weeks ago you left a message letting everyone know that if
they had a question about the Bible that you would be pleased to be
of assistance.  Subsequently, I left you a message explaining a little
situation that God seems to have gotten us into way back in Genesis,
but I have yet to get any response from you...Therefore, to refresh
your memory, I will cite these circumstances for you once again:
God created man and woman (Adam and Eve), and I think we can all
agree that they were the first man and woman there ever was, right?
So they have a couple of kids, namely Cain and Abel.  Now, here is
where my question comes in:  One of them goes off to the Land of Nod
and takes a wife.  I don't remember which one it was, but one of them did
this thing.  If Adam and Eve are the only two people, and they have
kids, then theorhetically the two of them and their kids should be
the only people here. So where does the wife hail from???
 
This has been baffling me for years...
Thanks,
THUNDER

HI SUSAN...SAW YOUR QUESTION, WHICH STILL DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE GETTING AN ANSWER.  LET ME TELL YOU MY THEORY,
WHICH WAS TOLD TO ME BY A MINISTER BACK IN NEW YORK STATE SOME YEARS AGO.
FIRST OF ALL, LET'S TRANSLATE THE WORDS 'ADAM' & 'EVE'...IN ANCIENT DAYS, THESE
WORDS MEANT 'MANKIND' AND 'MOTHER OF MANKIND' RESPECTIVELY.  
ADAM & EVE WERE NOT INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE, BUT NATIONS WHO HAD FINALLY
SETTLED IN ONE PLACE FOR A WHILE.  (ROVING PEOPLE CANNOT WRITE HISTORY.)
FROM THE 'UNION' OF THESE TWO NATIONS, TWO GROUPS BROKE OFF...(LET'S CALL
THEM CAIN & ABLE FOR LACK OF BETTER NAMES)...AND, NOT BEING ABLE TO GET
ALONG WITH EACH OTHER, FOUGHT, AND, AS OUR HISTORY AGAIN TELLS US,
CAIN WON..(KILLED ABLE ?, NOT NECESSARILY, BUT...).
NOW, IF YOU BEGIN TO EXTRAPOLATE ON THIS THEORY, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND IT THE WAY I DO.
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT...
 
HOW WAS A CHILD BORN OF A VIRGIN ?
I ALSO HAVE A THEORETICAL ANSWER FOR THAT ONE TOO..
I AM NOT RELIGEOUS, MY CURIOSITY FOUND THESE ANSWERS FOR ME, AND I'M

Hi Steve,
   You asked about 600 baud...  That is a 'optional' speed.  The Novation
4103B is not spec'd to run at 600, but does a passable job for local calls
(sometimes).  Sorry if you wasted time & $$ trying to use 600 baud.
   I think all of the questions you asked about 8BBS file structure are
answered in a document that I'm mailing out to you this week.  Regards,..

Subject: RK is OK

Hi Mark,
   My old RK05 has held up very well.  I did replace a temperature
sensitive IC in the data separator about 2 years ago.  Have had no
mechanical problems at all.  The absolute filter has to be changed
about every year (costs about $80).  Head crashes are rare if the
packs are not left on dusty floors.  The servo adjustments need to
be trimmed every year since the values drift as the transducer bulb
light output changes with age.  Head alignment could be a problem
if you want to exchange packs.  You really need a special alignment
pack to do the job right.  Regards,..

Subject: The "Virgin" Mary

Dear Roger;
Thank you for your input on the Genesis issue.  That is, of course, the f
first of many questions I have about the "Good Book"...I have my own per-
sonal theory, but I love hearing what all the self-proclaimed Bible experts
have to say about the subject, too.  It can sometimes be an entertaining
venture.  Now for my Virgin Mary theory:  If you take the seed of a fertile
woman and put it with the seed of a fertile man under the right conditions
conception occurs.  We have proven this with the Test Tube Baby thing
just recently in Medicine...some nut in Germany or somewhere actually got
a VIRGIN impregnated with these methods JUST TO PROVE IT COULD BE DONE!!!
Now, we don't know a whole hell of a lot about what was going on 2000
years ago, but one thing is certain:  If you wish to take the Biblical
version of the Immaculate Conception literally, then it IS POSSIBLE that
something like this occured.  After all, if there was a group of beings on
the Earth 2000 years ago that had the technology to get a virgin pregnant,
then they sure as hell knew how to cure diseases, alliviate pain, even
bring people back from the dead!!  WE DO THIS COMMONLY, EVERY SINGLE DAY!!
My question, therefore, is how in God's Creation did anyone KNOW SO MUCH
THEN, AND YET HAVE FORGOTTEN IT ALL UNTIL JUST RECENTLY??????? Or did some
of us from the future merely travel into the past and leave a little behind??

Well early christianity was a more

more humanistic religon than what
is called christianity today.There
is some  hint that mystery religon stuff
went on  in  the catacombs, I doubt if
they did Tantric stuff or anything of that
flavour however it was a more interesting
flavour than  what we know christianity
today, I mmean   only the  Catholics
an nd the Hebrews have retaaained some
of the true value  and uses of ritual.
What happened is as one specific group
or coalition   gained power it declaared
opposing view points "heresy"...It called
it*'s own  views of things dogmas
and was  proud of it. It was Paul(referred to as Saint  Paul) and Jerome(also r

occasionally I'll call 2kbbs and these clickings will be there,

A 'FEATURE' OF TOPS-20 (DEC OP SYS FOR DEC-20 SERIES) IS THAT
THE COMMAND 'FINGER' USUALLY WORKS WITHOUT LOGGING IN.
IT USUALLY GIVES THE FULL NAME (I.E. MARK R. THORSON) OF EACH

ARE GENERALLY LAST NAMES, YOU CAN GENNERALLY THROW THE FIRST
NAME OR INITIALS AGAINST IT AS A PASSWORD:
  @LOGIN THORSON
  PASSWORD: MARK
    OR
  PASSWORD: MRT
THESE MACHINES ARE VERY COMMON. SRI-KL ON THE ARPANET IS A
GOOD EXAMPLE.  A CERTAIN MACHINE WHOSE DIALUP IS GIVEN ON THE
BERKELEY CONFERENCE TREE (408) 526-7733 IS
AN EVEN BETTER EXAMPLE (SORRY, I WILL ONLY SAY THE COMPUTER IS IN PALO ALTO).).
I RECOMMEND PULLING THE NAMES OFF AT ABOUT 3PM

SET UP IT'S GROUND RULES (LIKE WRITING AN OPERATING SYSTEM.)

WHETHER OR NOT JESUS WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN (& SOME CHRISTIANS DON'T BELIEVE IT

THE MUSEUMS OF EUROPE ARE FULL OF PICTURES OF A BIG, PLUMP, RENAISSANCE-LOOKING

Subject: interstellar phone lines

  Heres a number for all you people interested in calling
those relatives you may have residing in deep space.
Its simple to use, and all it takes is a little call to
your local operator. Just dail '0', and when the
friendly voice of the bBell Tell employee
comes on line, say' long distance call,please. Charge it to
may home phone(look up any phone # belonging to some huge corpor-
ation like G.E. or anyone who makes bombs or agent orange or that shit)
and ask for the interstallar area code to your favorite
star system (try Betelguise, thats my fave.)
and dial away, friends. Theres still a problem of time delays,
it takes about17.2 years  for your message to come
back......calling Alpha
Centuri, for example.But other than this problem of time,your
call will be completed as dialed.
  Never say I ain't never given you nothing,

All the stuff I ever saw says that Genesis is an allogorical tale written
by Moses for the jews on the 20 year trek.
 
As for Jesus, I seriously doubt that Mary was an actual virgin. It seems
more likely that in reality Joseph and Mary concidered themselves husband
and wife, (maybe even married in a secret ceremony, perhaps to save
joseph from the wrath of Mary's parents) and the virgin story got made
up by some fanatics. That would make Jesus "just this guy, you know?"

Hi Eric,
   The 8BBS line does exhibit strange behaviour at times.  Just the other
day, when I went to dial out on the line, I found that the line polarity
had been reversed within the past week.  Odd...  Yesterday a PT&T repair
man came by twice and left a card saying that they wanted to "check my
phone" and to "call 611 to arrange a time".  Seems unusual that PT&T should
be so concerned about my line especially when I hadn't even called in a
complaint.  I suspect part of the problem might be that the line doesn't
work properly after it has been busied out for several hours.  Whenever
I'm using the system, I busy out the line.  Regards,..

Subject: Pin head

How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?  I've been enjoying
this discussion.  Atheists are as ill-informed as monotheists, or
really anyone who claims to "know" the TRUTH about god-existance.
I enjoy teasing questions also...what the hell difference does it
really make whether or not a big guy God exists, anyway? Do what thou
wilt shall be the whole of the Law. The biggest problem facing mankind
is coexistance on a tighter and tighter planet.  The doctrine of
Will, "every Man and every Woman is a Star", however it is couched
in whatever religion or philosophy you care to espouse, is the only
path to freedom for yourself and your fellows.  Genesis could indeed
be true.  The Big Bang could indeed be true.  The world could well
be on the back of a big turtle, for all I care.  I'll not likely 
find out, and if I do achieve Gnosis, the direct personal knowledge of
the nature and existance of God, it will still only be true for me,
not for anyone else.  It doesn't matter at all what you believe.
Just don't tell me I'm wrong, or that I'm full of shit, or that
the answer you have is the only possibility.  You cannot possibly know
my experience of the Universe.  I'll happily share what I've 
experienced if you will listen, and I'll happily even argue with you

What did happen to Jesus in the desert?  A common theme in religion and
mythology (difference? Your religion is my mythology, especially if you
are deader than I am) is the man who disappears and returns enlightened.
It happens to races, also--the Jews under Moses...One theory has it
that JC and the others went into the desert and were enlightened by
a transcendental experience of the sort that happens best when a man
is meditating alone, Moses on the Mountain, the Buddha under the Bo tree,
Jesus in the Desert.  Indeed, the Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel, a way of looking at the revelation of the inner
man, almost requires solitude and introspection.
       Or, for that matter, he may have et some of the wrong berries,
and hallucinated to the point of schizophrenia.  It's hard to tell the
difference...

I don't know what you think,  but I feel that we are 
philosophizing (sp?) about the creation of the universe and
the actions/reactions of man and his "soul" more than we
are talking about religion.  I personally was born and
raised a Catholic,  but I consider myself an agnostic
philosopher.  I study love and creation of love.  The Judeo-
Christian religions say that God created the universe because
he loved man.  Well,  we aren't the only ones in the universe
so why should we believe that we are special?  Isn't it more
important for us to first learn to love our brothers and our
sisters than to worry about how the universe was formed?  My
"belief" in an extra-universal force is only spured by my
belief in the big-bang therory.  What was there before the
first bang?  How did the hydrogen monobolc appear?  I do
have one comment that is one that turned me off to Catholosism
and Christianity <in the 700 club sense>.  They say, all of
these christians in the world that believe this CAN'T be wrong.
I say well,  what about ALL of those Hindu/Budhist?  There are
more of them than us!  It is insignificant!  What really matters
is whether one cares for others.  Not if/how he worships a god or gods. -PST

Well, I am back after a long absence, in which I was doing much work.
I have strong opinions about religion.  I do not actively campaign
'against' religion, but I will criticize a religion that trys to push
its values upon others.  Christianity seems to be formost in this,
which is why I reject it more than any other religion.  If god (notice
the small 'g') is supposedly so wonderful, how can a 'good christian'
explain all the horrible deeds done in the name of Chrisitanity? i.e.
the slaughtering of the Hougonauts, persecution of the jews, torturing
of the various indian tribes and eastern peoples, etc.  These were
actually done for political and greedy reasons, but under the guise of
'Christianity."  That is how the christian religion gained so
much power... it provided an excellent medium for the growth of ignorance,
violence, and greed.  Many of the eastern and tribal religions, although
strict, held the conviction that men and nature, as well as personal
honor, were more important than money and power.  Education was
put formost, and profit was held at a lower value than in Christian nations.
     As for my ideas about the exsistance of some 'supreme being', I
am extremely doubtful.  Even a 'life force' has yet to be proven.  I

     In a historical perspective, religious writings have very little
value that I have seen.  Their mythological value, however, is
high, and describes that philosophy of the people from which it came.
The bible is just as valid as the Book of the Dead, the Elder Edda
(the Norse 'bible'), and the various legends of the European
Teutonic tribes.  Personally, I find the Norse and European myths
much more colorful and interesting than the ones brought back from
the 'holy' lands.
     Worship of a diety provides material to fill a gap in
people's lives.  However, any group of people could be just
as fulfilled if they considered knowledge and facts, rather than
ancient legends, as more important and worthy of study.  This would
fill the void in their lives caused by their ignorance.  All around them
they see things beginning and ending.  So it is natural that they want to
have a beginning and an ending, as well as simple answers to their
qustions, about their own existance.  If a society would search for
facts, instead of accepting stories made up to satisfy their curiosity without
having to do any work, they would find life much more enjoyable,
interesting, and rewarding.            -Tim Bessie

Unfortunately, some cretin either from this system or from
the ARPAnet, has been fooling around on the Onyx, and has
been trying to ruin the system.  Whoever it is has changed
several files, several times deleted the password file (luckily we
do backups every day), used our autodialer to call distant places,
tried to make it so that I could not use the autodialer, and
written sarcastic messages about how nice it was to haveuse of
the system and that he might try other things 'next time.'  Thus,
we have found it necessary to DELETE the ferns account and
the guest account, as well as some complimentary accounts
(sorry, Bernard, but we have to keep TIGHT security now.  You
weren't using your account much anyway).
     I am very dissapointed in this, in that now one person with the
mentality of a 7-year-old, who has cravings for power which apply
only to harming others, has ruined it for everyone.  I would be
glad to allow unlimited access of the system, but one person here

far enough to cause us to tighten security, and so we are no longer
giving out guest accounts, nor will ferns be active.  I am

Hi Tim,
   Sorry to learn of the problems with the ONYX 'ferns account.  I'm
curious as to why you imply that someone from 8BBS was doing the damage?
Was 'ferns' only mentioned on 8BBS?  I haven't been using 'ferns'
lately 'cause no one else seemed to either.  Perhaps you could explain
why you deliberatly included a command to allow the user direct access
to the UNIX operating system/shell?  That seemed rather unusual. Regards,..

Subject: Piracy

I agree completely with Tim Binder.  The profit margin in writing game
software (as opposed to operating software) is remarkably small,
considering the time and energy that goes into it. If I work my ass off
to write a program, expecting to be able to make some money off of it
(and I should be able to, shouldn't I?  I am an artist, and should be
able to reap the rewards of my work!!) it is completely unfair for 
you to deny me my just reward.  The only payoff (after the joy of 
programming is finished) of the work is the royalties.  I think that
freeloading software is reprehensible, and there is no ethical 
justification for it.  IT HURTS THE WRITER, plain and simple.  I also
don't buy pirated albums, or videotapes, if the art is available for
sale.  Folks--if you want to be fair to the one person hurt by your
software theft, you don't have to pay the $30-$40 bucks, maybe, but
at least you might consider sending a dollar or two to the author.  There
is not yet a standard royalty for software authors, but usually that
is about what the author gets--the rest is for distribution, publicity,
and profit for the company.  Dig?

Subject: The BIBLE  (no booing, please)

Continuing the theory that JC was just a guy, you know,
I begin to have my doubts on the validity of the Bible.
Raised a Jew, but I believe myself to be an agnostic,
and I think that if you find my Jesus theory buyable,
you may like this one.
The Bible was little more than actual events (phenomenons)
that were atributed to Jesus or God.  I don't put God in all
caps because I doubt he exists. God is just a name, therefore.
I have said that Jesus was just a psycic/healer in
a land in need of a "savior", the Bible was just, natually,
attributed to him or his "dad".  For example:
The parting of the Red Sea has happened and will happen again,
it is a known fact that sometimes during an extreme low tide
(called perigee) (or is it apogee?)  (whatever)
a sea bed can become visible.  The star of Bethlehem was,
acording to a lot of scientist, a nova.
The flood was a flood and if Noah happened  to have had
a premonition about it, it was attributed to God.

 These are the three basic ingredients to a great story.
But it is just that, a story.
Now these poor, ignorant people saw these things, misunderstood,

were sitting around and decided that the flood was the hand
of God and that he brought us (or them, depending on your faith)
out of Egypt.  Ok, why not, but it is still a story.
Now I know some folks are going to say;
why was there a perigee tide at just that time, 
and why was there a nova at that time?
I say coinsidence, some say God.

Actually, it seems the flood myth is more complicated than just one
flood around the time of Noah.  See, a whole lot of religions have
flood myths, and not all at the same time.  Floods are the lifeblood
of any river civilization, but have the unfortunate tendency to
once in a while flood out of control--like, the whole population
runs for the hills, but this time the flood goes higher than before,
and oh shit, bye bye populace!  Time for new heroes!
       Regarding the parting of the Red Sea--why did it happen when it
did?  Well, think about it for a second--if it hadn't, who would have
survived among the Hebrews to talk about it?  Failed revolutions are

Has any one tried modifing a Hayes modem to run at 600 baud?
Just looking at the schma..makes me believe that it should be simple.
they use a n-programmable divider to drive a motorola 14112 0-600 baud modem
chip. On the MMII it apprears you only need to 
change the traces to the divider to provide divide by 208(300 baud)
and divide by 104(600 baud).
Does anyone have any knowledge showing why this wouldn't work.
 
Instead of changing traces I will mount the divider and jumper around on the 
socket.
  any info would be appreciated.
 last month I ran up over $60 in long dist alone! I must run faster 
 (anyone want to donate a triple modem to a really deserving person. !HA!)

Subject: Why no "marked messages"?

There have been several recent comments left complaining about the lack of
"marked message" retrieval.  There are several reasons why 8BBS does not
have that 'feature'.
  8BBS software is modeled after CBBS software and as such, endeavors to
maintain some semblance of similarity.  The "marked message" retrieval
method is usually associated with ABBS, PMS or Conn-80 type BBS's.
  Perhaps the main reason 8BBS does not support "marked messages" is that
I personally do not think it is particularly well implemented in that it
requires the user to quickly type a 'marking' char at just the right time
in order to later retrive "marked messages".
  I think 8BBS has something better.   This is the selective Retrieval
capability.  It is documented in the HELP files, but it allows a user to
selectively retrieve messages with the same type of command format as used
with a selective summary.  In fact, there is no need to ever use the  S
command, since selective or sequential Retrieval combines the functions of
the Q, S and R functions.  Just use the ^C or C character to skip messages
you are NOT interested in.  The ^K or K character gets you back to the
Function: menu.  Why not check out the HELP file and try it sometime.
  Regards,..

Subject: twoo-cents...

just a note, ( i usually stay out of these arguments)
someone raised the point how can you really put much stock in a
bunch of tales (the bible) that was passed through the eons and
got mangled and changed along the way etc.
well, the FACTUAL point i want to make is this:
Not to long ago (in our current lifetimes) a bunch of clay jars
were discovered in a cave by a small body of water known as the
Red Sea.  The 'RED SEA' scrolls were a collection of manuscripts
(written on fan-fold continuous lamb-gut printout paper
no doubt) of which a majority were copies of the old testament
and other books of the bible.  The amazing thing about this
discovery was the fact that they were the oldest known copy
yet to be found (verified by reliable carbon-14 tracing.)
that is the archeological significance, the religious
enlightenment was the fact that the text of the bible and other
documents matched 'current' versions exactly.  Thus, hard
evidence seems to prove that the bible has remained unchaged
til this day.  So, it gave a strong credence to the non-human
divine inspiration view about the source of the bible

Interesting your plans, i wonder if cbbs santa clara

i am sure you will win in the dsc storage / capacity

such as corvus don't give a damn about donating their
50 cents worth of hardware they sell for $50 to a public
access free system such as ours and 8bbs and any other
system except of course, for computer emporium because
the owner is married to a corvus employee.  (too bad that
store can never 'keep it up' they either sell the hardware
right out from under it or keep run sh--y software 
because they won't spend 100 bucks to get the pms
software from bill blue in santee ca. and give a surpurb
programer his just deserts ($$$$ for a good job done.)
BTW---looks like 8bbs will win the 'first with 1200 baud'

So, you are stating that since the bible has changed so little, it
is evidence for the argument that some devine power was at work.
If you want to put it that way, then it must follow that, since
the Bible says that 'God' created the earth (including trees, animals,
etc.) that the earth hasn't changed since it was created (at least
hasn't been changed by humans).  But then, you see that the earth HAS
been changed, most extremely by humans.  If the REASON that the
bible didn't change was because it was devine, then the Earth shouldn't
have changed, since the bible SAYS that the Earth is devine too, right?
Or are you now going to give some argument like "That's the WORD" or
"The bible is more important than the earth" or some such
irrelivant argument?  Please qualify your statements, and compare
them with the contrary evidence, before stating them.

Subject: Ackermann's Function

Ackermann's function can be stated a couple of ways.  Here they are:
  
       A(0,n,p) = n + p
       A(1,0,p) = 0
       A(m+2,0,p) = 1
 
       and
 
       A(m+1,n+1,p) = A(m,A(m+1,n,p),p)
 
       You might want to do it more specifically (without p) as
               A(0,n) = n+1; A(1,0) = 0; A(m+2,0) = 1;
               A(m+2,n+1) = A(m,A(m+1,n))
 
       Another way of stating the thing is--whoops, not gonna have room, see

Another way of stating Ackermann is:
 
       A(m,n) :=
               if m = 0 then n + 1
               else if n = 0 then (if m = 1 then 0 else 1)
               else A(m-1,A(m,n-1)).
 
       By the way, this function blows up really fast, depending upon
the value you pick for m and n (and p, if you use it).  It is the most
frequently used example of a function which is general recursive but not
primitive recursive (if you dig computation theory jabber). Source for
this is Ralston and Meek's "Encyclopedia of Computer Science", a good
general reference for all sorts of things, like number systems, random
number generators, history and trivia.  F'rinstance: KLUDGE: "an ill-

is a lot of doctrine in direct opposition to the current Christian
philosophy/politics.  (There, and more important, in the Nag 
Hammadi manuscripts, discussed as The Gnostic Gospels.)  The
"biblical" words that have been suppressed are a lot more interesting

see the full depth (and annoyance!) of the recursion in a function
like this, it should be calculated redundantly, I thinks.  By the
way, is there any reason other than academic for the existance of
this function?  I've never been able to figure out what it is good
for, besides writing recursive programs.  (Here's a cute idea--try to
write ACK in some non-structured, non-recursive language.  Beats hell
out of playing zork for an hour or two...)  93 jpg

TIM--
  THANK YOU FOR RISING TO THE BAIT. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S SPELLED "DIVINE".
THE ONLY DEVINE I KNOW OF IS THAT GUY IN THE WESTERN MOVIES THAT TALKED
LIKE A FOGHORN.
  NOW THEN. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, YEARS AND YEARS AGO, I AND MY SMALL
BAND OF BORN-AGAIN ATHEISTS USED TO READ LOTS AND LOTS OF HOLY BOOKS--IT
WAS ALMOST AS IF WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. THE BAGAVAD-GITA WAS A
TOTAL BORE, AS WAS THE KAMA-SUTRA AND ALL OF THOSE HINDU THINGS--OBVIOUSLY
NOT GEARED TO 20TH-CENTURY AMERICANS. THE I-CHING WAS VERY GOOD, I 
THOUGHT & I STILL QUOTE FROM IT OCCASIONALLY WHEN THE OCCASION ARISES.
I DIDN'T LIKE THE KORAN (WE SPELLED IT QU'RAN OR SOME SUCH). FUNDAMENTALIST
ISLAM IS EVEN SILLIER THAN FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIANITY, BUT IT IS
FUNDAMENTALISM ITSELF THAT I'M AFRAID OF, NOT THE UNDERLYING LITERATURE.
  I STILL STAND ON MY STATEMENT THAT THE BIBLE IS THE MOST INTERESTING
AND REALISTIC (FROM THE STANDPOINT OF CHARACTERIZATIONS, INCLUDING GOD) OF
ALL OF THEM. I DIDN'T SAY THE MOST COMPLETE. I DIDN'T SAY THE MOST TRUE.
AND I WAS ONLY DEFENDING THE PENTATEUCH, YOU UNDERSTAND, THE FIVE BOOKS
OF MOSES.

 Hey, I never said the bible (I only mean the old test.,
I haven't even looked at the new test.) was B.S.
In fact, I believe that most of it is true, 
except for the creation story, for that would imply God.
All I said was that it was MISINTERPETED.
It wasn't really God (I'm an agnostic, not a Jew)
that did all those neato things; it was just everyday
schmoes like you or I who were either psycics or visionaries
or lunatics or gullibles or wives covering up for thier infidelity!
But those things really did take place, the majority of them, anyway.
Now I can't comment on the SCROLLS or any of those other things
because I have never read them or have had any teachings on them.

Hi Joshua,
   The 8BBS user name policy is to a large extent based on my own personal,
arbitrary whims.  I prefer callers to use their real names, but of course
there is NO sensible way of verifying names so I just try to discourage 
the use of obviously fake aliases.  There are several exceptions that have
managed to get by, but if a person really wishes to do so they can use an
alias if it sounds 'believable'.  Chuck is welcome to use 8BBS, but a last

Hi Jake,
   Thanks for your comments about 8BBS.  Several other people have also
suggested multi-user operation, but there are currently no plans to expand
beyond a single user system.  The main problem is that multi-user operation
would require a TOTAL re-write of the program into 100% machine code.  This
could be done (I presume) but 8BBS would be down for program development
for a  L O N G  time.
    Perhaps the addition of 1200 baud support will help alleviate some of
the system loading.  Regards,..

As I understand it, the function was partly developed as an exercise in
recursion, and partly to develop some hyper-exponential functions.
I'm writing this on my apple (UCSD pascal) and with the wrong function
the recursion takes out the operating system when it tries to calculate
A(3,4) and A(4,1). I haven't gotten any higher yet, because it takes
nearly 5 minutes on A(4,1) before the machine bombs. My next effort
will be to try it on our IBM running in APL with a 128k workspace.
Should take the computer right out.    Thanks...       ...phil

Subject: The bible

Hello,
 I dont participate much in these discussions, but I have
seen many people downgrade the Bible. I guess that is your
right, but let me tell you how I learned it. 
 As you might recall, the Jews were tortured in the OLD testament, (B.C.)
that is before the new testament, thus before Christianity. That
means the Christians could NEVER have possibly tortured the Jews.
 We all have a choice whether to beleive or not beleive. I guess
the ones who believe have some reason for beliveing, and you
can see that most of the people on here are not very stupid. Most
people who are born with an interest in computers are more than
your average ignorant person. Also, I suspect the main reason
that so many of you dont believe in a god, is because you have
to think with facts. You cant believe aything without seeing
it. 
 I a sorry if I have offended ayone, but thats the way the
people wo write the msgs about the bible act like. I would
like you to tell me yur side too though..

Subject: Huh?

Huh?  Maybe I missed a beat--were you being serious or facetious when
you state that the christians could not have tortued the Jews?
       Belief is irrelevant to facts.  Facts are irrelevant to belief.
That is the fundamental difference between Theism and Gnosis, incidentally.
Those who consider themselves Gnostics believe they can have a direct
knowledge and appreciation of God.  Other believers take it on faith alone.
Many born-again Christians know for a fact that God and Christ exist and
are as powerful as the Bible implies.  For them, that suffices for
truth--no, that IS truth. Their frame of reference, their paradigm,
might not be the same as yours or mine, but for them, God is a Fact,
and what business have we to impose our conception of reality upon
them?  Any more than the other way around?
       Where do we go when we die?  Cleveland, obviously.

Hi Mark,

I suggest that you read msg 8651 after this. Although that msg applies to
people raiding computer systems, I suggest that the same thoughts can be
applied to those who *STEAL* software. There is no other word for what
you do. Some people have invested many thousands of hours into development
of those programs, (don't forget, programmers earn about $10-$20/hour 
these days) and then we have to deal with people like you who go around
ripping them off by copying their stuff and passing it out. Calling
it "piracy" (cute name, huh?) doesn't change what you're doing.
It's people like you who make life misrable for the honest users of
those uncopyable software packages, when we can't make backup copies
without breaking the law.
       I suppose that I could make brownie points by turning you in,
(did you know that unauthorized copying of software is worth a $10,000
fine?) but I'd rather let you reconcider your habits.

Well, I tried your functions, and it degenerates into returning 1 after
about A(3,0). I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but it can't be far
off. The function I was using before was generating numbers in the 
correct range, it's just that (I thought) they weren't right.
Here's the old one:
       Ack(m,n):= if m=0 then ack:=n+1
                         else if n=0 then ack:=ack(m-1,1)
                                     else ack:=ack(m-1,ack(m,n-1))
which as you note, is NOT the same thing. For m=3,n=0..3, this function
gives ack(m,n):=5,13,29,61. Maybe if you got a version running, you
could check these numbers.             ...phil

Hold it,  I thought we were going to stop argueing about
the Bible and other related works (Koran, etc..).
 
       How about talking about the nature of God?
I am a Gnostic/Christian.  That is,  I believe in Christ,  he
was a great person,  and performed many signs and wonders
(some faked by gospel writers) but I question whether he
was really the son of God.  (If there is such a position).
 
God is:
(According to philosophy/beliefs of many religions that
  I have analyzed)
       A very powerful person but:
   He sets rules for himself,  and for the most part doesn't
make waves.  My main cause of belief in 'a god' is that I
support the Big-Bang theory of cosmic evolution.  What was
there before the FIRST hydrogen monobloc?  God is kinda a
random hacker (that can handle timeslicing).  He (in his cute way)
threw a bunch of Hydrogen together and sat back to see what

My attack on God:
       If He is so great and powerful,  why does he always
hide arround the corner when one is looking for him?
Psychologists,  Philosophers and many people have tried to
find him,  why does he refuse to show himself?  Born-agains's
haven't found god,  they have found a 'minister' who happens
to be good at public speaking and likes power and $$$. (Sounds

You know, I thought Roscoe and Susan were alot

to me like I'm sitting in my freshman philosophy all

And it occurs to me that this current fascination

Phil, it could be you're statement of Ack is incorrect; it could

You are plain and simple a thief and a criminal.  Piracy from big and
nasty corporations, with SPRINT or whatever, might be ethically
justifiable in terms of stealing from the rich (though I have distinct
qualms about that myself); stealing the labor of individual programmers
has no such justification, and is little different from stealing from
the corner market.  Do you rip off fruit from blind street vendors,
just cause it's easy?  Shape up or shut up.

I'm not particularly offended by David Lee's offers.  I also don't think
that the courts (if they matter, I'm not concerned with the legalities,
only the manners) would consider trading software to be "not for profit".
At any rate, I don't like being called an asshole.  And I don't consider
myself one, and I would appreciate name-calling be reserved for those
people who have done something to deserve it.
       As a professional software engineer (though not involved in 
any individual enterpreneuring), and as an author, I am keenly aware
of the problems involved in the theft of one's labor.  I would rather see
a dialog on the matter of software piracy, rather than a battle of
nastiness.  I guess I did get a little carried away by calling Mr.
Lee any names at all (what did I say besides "thief"?  I don't even 
remember if I said anything). If so, sorry--but the basis for my
argument remains.  I ask again--would Mr. Lee steal from a blind man?
How is that ethically any different from software piracy?  Does the 
simplicity of the means justify the action? Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the Law.  Were I in the market for selling custom
software, it indeed would be restricted by people giving it away for
free.  If I'm going to set myself in business as a whore, I think I
have the right to complain about free nookie, no? On my corner?

there is an artical in there that says that SPC, MCI &

time someone calls them, a card with YOUR phone #, time, what phone #
called,etc. gets printed out from the Ma Bell computer, and put
in storage so if MCI or SPC has a complaint about billing, Ma Bell
knows WHERE TO GO!      
        So BEWARE!   I don't know when this took effect, or when
it will, or if ever, but I would give this serious thought!

Subject: Modem

The Bell 212 (as has been explained here many times before) is a
0-300 or a 1200 baud modem, depending on the way it handshakes at
the initial call.  The originator throws a switch to indicate
high speed BEFORE going into data mode.  The answer modem can figure
this out and goes into the right mode.  [The VADIC triple takes the
high speed two steps further.  1. It can automatically figure out
when in HS mode whether the other end is a 212 or a VADIC.  2. When
in HS VADIC mode, it is 0-1200.]
 
Note that with the Bell Modem you have to get your computer to
either AUTO-BAUD or sample one of the lines from the modem to
figure out what speed you are... you can't dial in at 300 and
tell the computer to switch to 1200.  You can with the VADIC if
you handshake in VADIC HS mode.  (Note that two VADIC triples
will occasionally handshake in Bell HS Mode, and are then stuck
to 1200, just as if they really were 212s.)
 
I'm not sure, but I suspect that the 212 is PSK.  It actually
runs some sort of synchronous stuff with your async data super-
imposed; which is partly why it runs at exactly 1200 only.

Subject: RED BOX via Tape recorder

A tape of the Coin sounds is about a susceptible to getting caught
as a Red Box itself, and maybe slightly more so.
 
Red Boxers get caught mostly by three methods:
 
       1. If they are foolish enough to repeatedly use the
          same payphone, Bell Security will stake it out because
          of the receipts coming up short.
 
       2. If they are sloppy with feeding the tones into the
          phone, the operators will get suspicious and cause
          the big eyes of all the ex-FBI Bell Security people
          to go to work.  THIS IS MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN WITH
          A TAPE RECORDER BECAUSE YOU ARE SPENDING LESS MONEY...
 
       3. They are usually doing something else, too, which gets
          eyes working on them.
 
Good luck, and don't get caught.

Bell security wants to stop the people who are ripping off
their competitors because they feel that they are getting
ripped off, too.  Since the call was placed from point A to
point B by someone not authorized to use j-random-Bell-com-
petitor's service, Bell should have been getting the money.
 
I know of a case where General Telephone successfully prose-
cuted and got a conviction for someone who was ripping off
some OTHER COMPANY (not another common carrier) without much
help from the ripped-off company, because Gen-Tel, too, was
an injured party for having lost the regular long distance
business.

Hi Mark,
   The idea about being able to change msg header info after entering msg
text is interesting.  I'll have to think about it and check to see if it
is feasable.
   8BBS tries to maintain some semblance of command and usage compatability
with the CBBS software.  If a user wishes to send a msg to more than one
person and have it 'flagged' a separate msg has to be sent to each user.
This does NOT mean you have to type it more than once.  Just use the (G)et
message function when at the msg entry function prompt.  
   Regards,..

Subject: 212A and file size

Hi Marc,
   You've been using the 212A for the past week, so you can see that it
doesn't prevent low speed users from accessing the system.  It only goes
into 1200 baud mode when it hears an originating 212 type modem.
   There are about 13,600 OS/8 blocks (256 12 bit words/block) on-line
as hard disk (RK05's), but the 8BBS message data file only takes 1100
blocks and it is usually about 50% to 80% full.

8BBS #1 now supports the 212A 1200 baud transmission mode.  If you have a
modem that is compatible with the 212A you can now use 8BBS at 1200 baud.
 
NOTE: The 212A is NOT compatible with the 202, VADIC, or NOVATION 1200
      baud transmission modes.
 
If you log on at 1200, don't use the 'A' function to alter the baud rate
because the 212A can't change to low speed.  High or Low speed mode is
determined by the originating modem when the call is connected to the 212A
answer modem.
 
If you have problems while using the 1200 baud mode, please let us know.
We don't have another 212A to check it out, so we are relying on your info.

Subject: 8BBS supports 600 baud?

Going all out this evening...  Did some testing at 600 baud and find that
the 212A seems to do about as well at 600 baud as some acoustic couplers
do at 300 baud.  At least it appears that way when I call from the other
line in the kitchen...  The old Novation 4103B had a MUCH higher error
rate when used at 600 baud.  I tried sending a full 80 char line of each
printing char and found that the error rate (for me) is less than 2%.
I was able to dump the full 'O' list with NO errors, which tends to indicate
that the 212A is sending 600 baud OK.  I suspect that the major cause of
errors is due to the AJ acoustic coupler not being able to originate very
well at 600.
   If you have a PMMI or DC HAYES direct connect modem, and are a local
caller, you may find that 600 baud will work well.  Currently, 8BBS does
NOT support 600 baud at login.  The 'A' function allows you to select 600
baud.  We are very interested in learning if you find 600 baud operation
worthwhile with the 212A.  If you find that 600 baud works OK for you,
please let us know, also let us know if you'd like 8BBS to recognize 600
baud at login.  This would mean that 8BBS would start the 'auto-baud'
"Press RETURN:" loop at 600 baud, wait for a char, if not a CR, then try
at 300, then 150, 110, then back to 600 again.   <cont'd next msg>

     What do you think?  Would this tend to confuse a novice BBS user?
Would he be likely to press 'RETURN' at least once?  Would this overly
annoy and inconvenience 300 baud callers?
 
     While I'm on this topic...  has anyone EVER used 110 or 150 baud?

Subject: re: your comments: stealing software

Rather than let you put words in my mouth, I'll take up the challange.
There IS a fundemental diffrence between reading messages left here for
others, and copying propritary software and passing it around. I'm
suprised that you could logically connect the two. To start with, you
do have the option to keep random people from reading comments directed
to a specific person. If you choose not to exercise that option, you are
specifically allowing anyone to read that msg who wants to. That is the
whole basis of these public msg systems. These are, after all, BULLETIN
BOARDS. This one is more sophisticated than most, precisely because it
allows you to not let me read messages that you have left *IF* *YOU*
*WANT* *TO*.
       As for Mr. Lee, he may or may not be a thief in the eyes of the
law. That would depend on if he was passing out copies of the software
that he had bought. If he was passing on copies of software that somebody
had given to him, then legally he is in a gray area, however, (and this
is the important point) he is still *MORALLY* a thief. If he did not pay for
the copies of the software he is passing around, then he could be convicted
for recieving stolen property, and more importantly, if he passes copies of
the illegal copy around, he is *STILL* ripping of the authors of the
program. As far as I am concerned, (remember, this is me talking)..more..

..if he really needs the software (say visicalc), then he can afford to
go out and buy it. If he can't afford it, then he probably doesn't need
it, and therefore has no reason to go out and rip off the authors.
       The reason that the large IBM installations don't have this problem
(and therefore the reason that we can't talk about them the same way we
can talk about the Apple software) is because you really can't do anything
with just the software; you need to make a multi-million dollar
investment to use it. Being able to back up your software for the IBM
is just a important as for the apple, but the situations are diffrent.
(Not morally though, as you could send a copy of something to your friend
in the next computer room down the street. That's just as bad.)
       It's people like you and Mr. Lee, with the attitude that if you
can get at it, you can do anything you like and everyone else can go

Hi David,
   Just received my latest issue of "Crypologia".  In an article on the
Public Cryptography Study Group I noticed the following quote that might
be of interest to you.
   'Cryptographic researchers and some other academics see in the NSA's efforts
a severe threat to their personal freedom as well as to their professional 
work.  "We're entering a stage of computerization where the use of computers is
threatening whatever privacy we have," said George Davida of the Univ. of
Wisc. and Georgia Inst. of Tech., who is one of the leading opponents of prior
review (by NSA).  "Telephone networks are computer networks in fact," Davida
said.  "There are opportunities for abuse in telephone companies in electronic
mail and EFT. All these introduce new techniques for invading privacy that we
didn't have before.  We have to consider all of these applications along with
NSA's mission to determine whether it's worth giving up a large chunk of free-
dom in return for whatever messages we may be able to intercept worldwide."
  Although the NSA will not say specifically what has raised its eyebrows,
knowledgeable observers in the field say recent papers on so-called public
key crypto-systems, which are important to the US code system, have made the
agency particularly jittery.

Subject: tape recording coins in pay phones

You are correct, Marc Mosco, taping the coins in a pay phone works very
well.  We did it a few years ago, in school.  A direct tap to your home 
phone line works best; use an audio transformer and a 1 microfarad 
capacitor in series with the line (to keep the d.c. out).  Try to use a good
reel-to-reel tape deck, then make dubs to a cassette recorder.  Have a 
friend call you from a pay phone, and deposit the money as you record.
    When he hangs up, all but the original dime will come back.  
If you don't have a direct tap, use a phone pick-up (one of those suction
cup thingies) positioned on the earpiece for minimum hum pick-up.  Your
friend should pause between depositing coins, to make it easier to cue up
the tape later.
 
The coins values are as follows - 5 cents, one beep
                                -10 cents, two beeps
                                -25 cents, five fast beeps
That is, a beep per nickle of money. Quarters are faster, to save time.

Playing a tape of the beep sounds money makes in a pay phone is an effective
alternative to building a red box.  Some thoughts on this follow:
A good order to have money on the tape is one nickel, one dime, then a long
($5-$7 worth) string of quarters.  Have a two or three second pause between
each coin sound.  Then simply start the tape at the correct place to get the
correct change.

Subject: Cautions on playing recordings into pay

There are a few things to avoid when beating a pay phone with a tape recorder.
 
Have the tape properly cued up ahead of time, so you won't start it in the
middle of a beep.  This is most embarrassing.  Use an earphone for privacy.
 
Use an external speaker to hold up to the mouthpeice so the operator won't
hear the noise of starting the cassette recorder.
 
Try not to play too much money in, the operator will want to "return" your
money and have you "redeposit" it.  If you are paying before the call, just
tell her you will talk just that much extra.  If you "pay" too much 
after the call, she will want to mail you the extra.  Watch the name and 
address you give here.  It is really suspicious to tell here to keep the 
change.  I don't think the phone company likes it.
 
ALWAYS use a real dime or nickle first.  There is a coin sensor in the
phone that must detect the first coin or the operator will know you are fishy.
 
Always be super nice to the operator, and helpful.  They will do anything for
you if you are nice to them.

                The most important tip of all:
 
                Practice, Practice, Practice
 
Make a real long distance call from a payphone, and talk longer
than three minutes so you will have to put more in at the end.
Do this with real money.  Now you know the format, practice it by
calling another pay phone and having your friend at that end play
operator, asking you to deposit an amount.  Then he can listen to you
doing it to see how good you are.
 
Spend a dollar now instead of paying a lawyer later.
 
Also a note: There a two differnt kinds of pay phone beeps. 
One uses a pure tone for the beeps, the other uses two mixed tones.
You must be careful to know what kind of pay phone you are calling from,
and use the correct recording for that phone.  Listen real carefully
when you deposit your first dime and you will hear the beep in the
backround.

Subject: Taped redness

You gave an excellent set of instructions, which should cover all
the bases pretty well, except for two:
 
       1. There is a new system going in rapidly where a
          recording, rather than an operator, tells you what
          to deposit.  The system then listens to your tones.
          could that system notice that there is something
          fishy with your input, put the call through, but
          set a "Fraud Flag?"  I'm not sure they are that
          clever...
 
       2. When doing stuff like this, don't call your friends
          at work or home.  When Ma Bell discovers fraud, she
          sends her goons after the people who have RECEIVED
          the calls, in the hopes that they can be intimidated
          to reveal the names of the callers -- often with
          TOTALLY FALSE CLAIMS that if they won't tell them
          who made the calls, they can be prosecuted themselves.
 
Good luck, and don't get caught.

Van Auken called A Severe Mercy, which relvolves around correspondence
this gifted writer maintained with CSL.  It discusses a lot, but one
of the best, I think, is the idea that CSL did NOT want Xtianity to
be true and he fled it with great energy, while Van Auken desparately
wanted it to be true but fought it with his mind anyway. 
Paul, happy hunting.

AS I RECALL, THE BEEP TONE IS 2225 HZ, SAME AS ANSWER MODEM MARK FREQ.
IS THIS CORRECT?  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THE DUAL TONE
BEEPS, WHAT ARE THE FREQ'S?  WHAT DURATION IN EACH CASE?
 
ALSO, I BELIEVE THE TIP SIDE IS GROUNDED ON EACH COIN (OR
IS IT WHILE COINS ARE IN THE HOPPER?).  IS THIS WHY WE ARE SUPPOSED
TO PUT IN ONE REAL COIN FIRST?
 
I KNOW OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RED BOXED BY WHISTLING THE
TONE, WHICH THEY PULSED BY FLASHING THE SWITCH HOOK (OR WAS IT
BY JAMMING FOUR TT KEYS TO MUTE THE MOUTHPIECE?).
ARE THEY ANY TIPS ON USING THIS TECHNIQUE?

FOR YOU OUT-OF-TOWNERS, BART IS THE BAY-AREA-RAPID-TRANSIT SYSTEM.
IT IS AN ULTRA-MODERN AND HIGHLY UNRELIABLE RAILWAY SYSTEM SERVING
THE SAN FRANCISCO AND EAST BAY AREAS.
 
ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM IS PROVIDED BY PAPER CARDS WITH MAGNETIC STRIPES
THAT ARE INSERTED INTO THE TURNSTILES.  VENDING MACHINES SELL YOU CARDS FOR
DENOMINATIONS RANGING FROM $.05 TO SEVERAL DOLLARS.
 
I HEARD THAT PEOPLE WERE COUNTERFEITING CARDS IN AN EXTREMELY ELEGANT
LOW TECHNOLOGY FASHION -- THEY WOULD PLACE A CHEAP NICKEL CARD
ON TOP OF AN EXPENSIVE DOLLARS CARD, AND QUICKLY RUN A HOT IRON
OVER THE TOP CARD.  THIS HEATS THE MAGNETIC STRIPE ON THE TOP CARD
PAST THE CURIE POINT -- THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH IT LOSES ITS MAGNETIC PROPERTI
ES.  ON COOLING BACK DOWN (ALMOST INSTANTLY), IT BECOMES A STORE OF A MAGNETIC
PATTERN AGAIN -- ONE IMPRESSED BY THE CARD ON THE BOTTOM.
A SIMILAR PRINCIPLE IS SOMETIMES USED TO DUPLICATE VIDEOTAPES (SEE THE
BOOK 'INDEPENDENT VIDEO').  HAS ANYBODY OUT THERE EVER TRIED THIS?
IF SO, HAVE I DESCRIBED THE TECHNIQUE RIGHT?  ANY FURTHER TIPS NEEDED?
 
THIS TECHNIQUE MAY BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER CARD SYSTEMS, KEEP IN TOUCH.

The dual tone beeps and the single tone beeps are identical in all
respects (length, count, etc) except for one tone  or two at once.
 
Frequencies, durations, etc are in a TAP back issue, I don't know
which one.
 
Also when practicing (and also when for real), don't have the tones
too loud or too soft.  Have your listener listen to real coins and then
the fake ones, and mark your volume control when they are of an equal
loudness.
 
A quick method I once used to destroy a cassette of beeps was to chuck
it into the microwave oven of the college cafeteria, which was nearby. 

Subject: no 450 baud

Hi Gary,
   The 8BBS serial line interface to the modem does not have a very
sophisticated baud rate generator.  It can only handle 110, 150, 300,
600, 1200, 2400, 4800 & 9600 baud.  Obviously the last 3 rates aren't
useable on a dial-up line.  No doubt 450 baud would be just fine, but
we can't run the interface at that speed.  I've had reports from a 
user in Berkeley running a PMMI at 600, so you should be OK from San
Jose.  Regards,..

Subject: Auto-bauding

Hi Paul,
   A BASIC 'FOR - NEXT' loop is the main part of the low speed baud rate
recognition code.  The 'FOR - NEXT' loop tries different baud rates and
expects a 'RETURN' char to indicate what speed the user is running at.
   The code looks something like this...
FOR I = 2 to 0         ! Try 300, 150, 110 baud
 SND("Press RETURN")
 D = RCV(0)            ! Get a char from comm line
 IF D = 13 THEN exit   ! Test for RETURN char
NEXT I                 ! Not a RETURN, try next rate
The FOR statement would be changed to FOR I = 3 to 0 to support 600 baud
login.  There is actually more code between the FOR and the NEXT to handle
user time-outs, etc.. so it would require a lot more code to handle out-
of-sequence baud rate testing.  Regards,..

What happened to us all?
I was enjoying a nice theological discussion, when suddenly
POOF! Every stopped entering msg.s.
Come on, let's get back on the ball here.
I want to start seeing some more msg.s about views on:
Jesus (man or lord?), the Bible (fact or fiction?),
Jews (chosen or lucky?) [I think the former, myself].
Nothing to be taken as an offense, just a good talk.
Here is a view I think should get the ball rolling again;
I think that if (IF) there is a God, he is subject to physical laws.
It's always that God sent a messenger, this implies the
traversing of physical time and space, which means he is subject to
physical laws.  Now, is it just because he is sticking to 
the ground rules he set up for all us mortals or is it just
that he can't help it, that he isn't all-powerful?   Hmmmm?
Let'S hear some other views on this subject and get

Subject: more on "marked msg's"

Hi Chuck,
   Seems like you missed my msg #8960 where I explained my some of my views
on "marked msg" retrieval.  By nature I'm a generous person, which might be
part of the reason why I dislike "marked msg" retrieval.  To me the "marked
msg" concept indicates stinginess on the part of the software designer in
that the user is required to initiate the request to be able to read a msg
later by typeing a char during a narrow time window.  It smacks of 'batch'
operation in that what the user desires (to read that msg) is not available
until later after some portion of the summary is scanned through. Then the 
sys will dump the "marked msg's" when activated with some other 'special
char', usually the '*'.  The 8BBS selective and/or sequential msg retrieval
methods are 'generous' in that the software wants to give you all the msg's
and will do so immediately unless specifically requested to NOT do so.
Since a selective or sequential msg retrieval combines the functions of the
Q, S and R functions there is really no need to ever use the  S  function.
It is only included for CBBS compatability.
   To summarize... the "marked msg" concept represents the opposite view of
the 8BBS selective/sequential msg retrieval method.  The "marked msg"
implementation will NOT give you a msg unless you request it.  The 8BBS
method WILL give you msg's immediately unless you want to skip them.  Regards

Subject: 212a modem the greatest. ven-tel

I just picked up a VEN-TEL md212 Plus modem, and let me tell you it is
an experience. It is a smart modem and once you plug a terminal into it
and hook it to the line, you just set back and watch it run. It dials the
number for you and displays what happened on your terminal. If the line
is BUSY it says so and tries again. If it finally gets through it rings
the terminals bell and prints "ONLINE". It runs 300 baud or 1200 baud
and can remember 5 stored numbers + the last number dialed. To dial
a number you just type K on your terminal and it will ask for the number.
It can recognize a dial tone, busy signal, and a ring. Needless to say I
think it is great. So just check it out before you spend those hard
earned bucks on one that does less. I am not sure what it cost cause
I have not received the bill yet. 
So far the 1200 baud on 8bbs is running great.

Mr. Bell, for your information, IF you had checked the user log
before sputing off about my not printing a retraction, you would 
have noticed that I HAVE NOT BEEN ON SINCE I PRINTED THAT MESSAGE!
Now that you know why I was not on, I will explain why I will not
print an appology.  I consider the fact that I was fool enough to
trust TAP with my CASH(no guys I didn't send a check since TAP is 
not an organization that can take a LEGITIMATE check!) stupid enough
without retracting something I have already let be printed!  If you
read my message like a good reader and BBS POSTER should, then you
would have noticed that I said that until there was an explaination
as to why I have not received what I paid for, I suggested, and I
believe SUGGEST was the word, that people not send their money into
TAP for a subscription.  I also said that I SUGGESTED that we ought 
to watch who we send our money to IN GENERAL!!! I was making a comment
about the entire magazine and UNDERGROUND information industry.  Lets
face it Mr. Bell, I WAS THE FIRST PHREAK WHO TOOK THE CHANCE AND SENT
MY MONEY FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION!!!  Maybe you don't remember it, BUT 
everyone asked ME, NOT YOU or ANYONE else if I was going to get TAP

was detracting from the HIGH QUALITY of the information contained

you would have seen that I was not talking about TAP's content

worst possible practice to cry POOR MOUTH to the people that the 
newsletter serves and then to give someone the shaft (like I 
would EXPECT from MA BELL HERSELF!!!) by bilking them out of their

is ravings by people who can't take the time to read closely 
and are looking for someone to lash out at!  All I am exercising
is the right to do just what TAP does!  TAP sees a story in ripping
big business back and prints it.  That, friends(or, is it former 
friends?), is what free speech is all about, and for that I applaud
TAP.  But I am doing nothing more than THEY DO!  I am letting you

Subject: phreaking

suprisingly enough, I tend to agree with you. I believe that phreaks *are*
a valuable addition to our sort of society, if for no other reason, then
to find the holes that exist.
       As for breaking into computers, well, the justification needs to
be very carefully defined. While crashing the machine, deleting files, etc
can be concidered serious, under certain circumstances so can the using
of machine resources (time, etc) if these resources are scarce and the
machine usage is important. 
       As for bell, you're right. Presumably bell had a reason to leave
those numbers out without access codes, but it's still dumb. I should poke
around the ess here and see if I can find the bell numbers.
        I still maintain that copying and passing around software is
morally lousy. I have made copies of protected software, (visicalc, etc)
to use as backups. If Personal Software doesn't like that, well they
can just kiss off. However, Mr. Lee's idea of passing around stuff
like candy pisses me off worse than anything.

Dear Bill,
  Good you came out of the woodwork.  It seems logical that the created
should not outstrip its creator.  Our children outstrip us, but 
beget and create are NOT the same.  See CS Lewis again.  Therefore,
the Lord of the Universe and all it includes, though respecting His
physical laws, can bend or break them anytime He choses in order to
make his power and deity manifest.  Then, we are continually, through
our worship of the creation rather than the creator, discovering new
stuff in the physical world.  Our grandmothers were available to see
the age of horses and wagons fade into the age of space.  The smallest
piece used to be the cell, which bowed soon to the nucleus, which
gave way to DNA which is giving way to mesons, quarks, and semi
quarks.  We as organisms are swimming in a sea of information we
cannot receive but we know it is there because our instruments can
receive it.  The smaller gets smaller and the large gets larger
andgod just plumb is whether you agree or not (not you but I mean
persons)  I used to think that anything was true if you just believed
it.  PLEASE COMMENT ON MSG NO> 9144.

Dear Bill,
Uh, what is backing/phreaking?!  Srry to sound dumb.  You used the phr
phrase morals/ideals so I will say that Xtianity is not a set of rules
but people outside it would like to point at the Xtians and holler
"hypocrites" as humans so often do when we can't find any other
name to holler.  There is a bumper sticker on some bumpers that
reads something like "Xtians aren't perfect, just forgiven."  I
always liked CSLewis idea of how absolutely cheeky it was for
someone (Jesus) to forgive ME for running over YOUR dog without
asking you about it.  Implies some basic absolute authority.
What it is, is Jesus promised abundant life now with nothing
concerned about pie in the sky and if all I've had is all there
is, OH MY GOD, IT'S BEEN ENOUGH!  Please forgive my saying the
following but it is just me;  the reality of the relationship with
the living person Jesus is for me now just about more real than
automobiles and concrete and computers.  If you think I'm really
nuts I'll say I function full time as a dentist and have a seventeen
year old son and four year old daughter and have two offices so I do

I have been on several BBS's in the last few days and my impression
is the amount of information in any one message or the information
obtained in a unit of time is dreadfully low.  Of course, the name
Bulletin Board implies this from the start.
 
I would be much happier with messages of several hundred to about 
two thousand words, sort of like a magazine article.  
 
I don't think this will happen until several megabytes of storage
(available at both ends)
and high-speed modems and automatic machine access of BBS's is
common, however.
 
Also this depends on your style of communication.  I have essentially
described exchanges of long-winded messages.  Perhaps this is more
closely approached on actual conferencing systems.  I see a lot of
messages are of the form "Where can I find ....", "You can get it here...".
My message just befor this one is like that.
 
Well, that is all for this long-winded communication.     Shannon

JIM, i am responding because this may help you and the rest of the 
Philly area phreaks.  First off,  if you are coming through the magic
of M  (is that MCI) do you have any codes to trade.  Next here's
the rest of the story of TAP.  TAP NEWSLETTER IS  a publication 
dedicated to the freedom of the common man to live as he chosses
and above all GET BACK AT BIG BUSINESS!  Now TAP has a lot of 
high quality information in it and I do have some of the back
issues in my possesion(somewhere in the famous JOHNSON archives).
Do not get me wrong about my comments!  I do not condemn TAP and
the content of the newletter!  I suggest that you contact them
via someone who knows how to get in touch with them and let them 
know ahead of time thaty you are sending in you order.  Since 
yesterday, I had a talk with one of the other area phreaks and
he reminded me of something I did not think of at the time.
I DID send TAP mail and never got a reply!  I sent them a letter
in the beginning of MARCH and IN the END of  April.  I never 
received a reply.  Maybe I should have sent it via registered mail!
Anyway, I was reminded that I could have called them via one of the
Philly area phreaks.  I did not think of this sinc I felt that 
writing would have been enough!  CONTINUED

I say to you Mr. Bell, you call EDISON or CATALYST and ask them
IF they ever received ONE of my letters !  If they didn't, then
I have only the mail service to blame.  Second It was my mistake
not to send check.  BUT at the time I sent the letter with  my 
subscription request, IT WAS BEFORE THE PHREAK CONVENTION AND BEFORE
I MET THEM! I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THATTAP WAS RUNNING SOMEthing
that could NOT receive a check, an impression that clearly was not
my fault.  At that time I was a relative newcomer to the scene of
phreakdom.  Now , to Mr. Junkins, I was the first phreak in this
area, and I am refering to Jon Edwards, Bill Williams, Steve Pearl,
Dave Horvath , Llib Legiew, and the others in MY area and I think you
know which area I am refering to!  So before we all go flying off the
handle, Why don't you call TAP like you threatened to do and let
them know the situation!  Now back to Jim and his request.
Jim you can find info on SPC(sprint) and Watts extenders and other
fun stff in the earlier messages.  If you need local help, just contact
Sam JUnkins or one of the other area phreaks.  Wecome to $)* 8BBS and

Sam why do you have the idea that  I have two accounts???
I know for a fact that you have had a series of accounts
over the last 8-12 months, most of which got blown away
due to abuse, or how about ROCKET and LOCKing???? I personally
have notheing against you, what have I done to you???
    As far as the cube goes, you asked for a solutiion,
and I offered. The offer still stands.
   I am a computer professional and act in a matter that reflects that,
I am a programmer for a school district(the only one, and I do
system analysis too) at a school district that  is near the one that
you go to, can you fiqure it out??? Good luck,  maybe we
can have contact on the WARTON-10 sometime , and no my account name
is not 1130bw, so you won't find it.
     Just as a warning, not as a threat, I would advise you to
be careful of what you do at your high school, as several
of the students are ready to have you busted....beware of the ides
of LM students...
    Eventually I will grow tired of the ITS op sys and either leave
that system on to greener pastures, or be come a LUSER when
I go there for a degree in compiler design(PhD.), and then I will(cont)

Subject: 8BBS phone line prob's

Some of you may have noticed that the 8BBS dial-up number hasn't been
working for the past couple of days.  Seems that if a phone is left
"off-hook" for a while the CO disconnects service to the line.  I've
always had service restored within a few hours of going back "on-hook"
but this time it didn't work.  So... I logged a trouble call with PT&T
and they said that they needed access to the phone to check it out,
'twas very odd since he didn't do anything but look at the modem and
phone and then said that "the problem" was fixed, sure 'nuf was, too.
Almost gave me the feeling that PT&T just wanted an excuse to see what
was on the other end of the line that went to 296-5799.  Anyway, I've
now learned that the 'proper' way to disable service to a phone is to 
NOT leave the receiver "off-hook", but instead just unplug the phone.

The term "RELIGIONISTS" is used for the "who to" to identify
the messages that we "Religionists" send to each other.
I have not just come out of the woodwork, for I was actively
involved in the religionists discussions before they suddenly
stopped.  Are any of the original religionists still out there?
Besides me, I mean.

Subject: the further adventures of ackermann's fu

Well, after doing some digging, I found Ackermann's function written up
in the Jan 1979 Dr. Dobb's. 1 page article. Turns out my original
algorithm was correct after all; the article lists some results and
mine correspond exactly. The article's values die at A(4,2), as does
my Apple. So, I decided to try the BFBI approach. (BFBI=brute force,
bloody ignorance). I quick-hacked up an APL version for the 370/158
that I have access to at work, and let her rip. After running out of
stack space a couple of times, I allocated a stack of 10,000 (equivilent
of around 40Kbytes) and let her rip again. Still ran out of stack, with
430 active calls of ACK waiting to be resolved. I'll push it to the
limit here when I get the chance (not during the day; machine's too
loaded) and I may add a counter to keep track of total number of calls
to ACK. (oh, yeah, when I tried to calculate ACK(4,2), and ran out of
stack at 10,000, the machine showed something like 4 MINUTES of CPU time
burned, in about 6 minutes of real time. Christ! Do you realize how much
that is???)

hi brother!
i am glad to see that the Lord is spreading His ministry to
the computer world. i became a Christian about 2 years ago
and have been studying the Word ever since. has anybody ever
thought of putting together one of these bulletin boards
for Christians and people interested in the Word? maybe i'm
dreaming but it may be interesting - sort of like family radio!
do you listen to harold camping on family radio? he is really
knowledgeable and makes some very good points. i may send a
message to the "religionists" and give my views, without the
intent of arguing with others. i think it is wise that we
make our views known so that God may inspire the people who
read them and hopefully fill them with the Holy Spirit! keep
up the good work and the prayers. God bless you and keep you,

Subject: Religionists/ Right to Life

OK, but remember, you asked for it....
It seems to me that the whole question of abortion, right
or wrong, centers around one, and only one, point.
That is, at what point is a fetus a human being?  It is
quite obvious that after 6 months you are talking about a
human being. My nephew was born in the 24'th week of my
sister's pregnancy.  You wouldn't claim that he was sub-
human for the first 3 months after his birth, would you?  
I do not necessarily agree that human life begins at 
conception, but I think that a reasonable determination would
be the same criterion by which we determine death- the
presence or absence of heartbeat and/or brain wave activity.
This starts in the fetus in the fourth week (week- not month)
of pregnancy.
Any question of economics, is the child wanted, etc. simply
do not apply, unless you think we should exterminate poor 
people and allow people to kill their children if they become
bothersome, which I am sure horrifies you as much as it
does me.

Dear Brother Ozzie (really Ozzie?)
   In reply to your message to Anton Johnson which I read, I
would like say PTL.  Jack and I (Jack is my husband who logs
in around 3:00 in the morning when we can't get on other times)
have talked about getting one of these bulletin boards together
for thebody but then what happens to the evangelism?  Yes we
listen to family radio but frequently prefer KFIA in Carmichael
710 AM.  The first time we ever called BBBS#1 was about an hour
or two after message 9044 was entered, which was quite neat if you
scan its content and then compare it to all the other messages from 
the other religionists.  It does get boring (see msg 9257) if you
aren't talking about personal experience, doesn't it.  Lets converse.
First question to you and anyone else in the Body*  have you had 
any experience with the the complete oneness of the spiritual and the
physical body yet?  I have been a believer since l975 but was a church
goer all my years before that.  Received the baptism or filling of the
HolySpirit just recently a few months ago.  Being a Christian is the
best of anything, wouldn't you agree?  Do you get many chances to
witness?
                            Do you listen to the Praise tapes by the Maranatha

I had an experience two weeks ago that gave me a different view

for awhile than the physical;  almost as though the bricks and concret etc
were the fantasy and the spiritual was the reality.  And I was in my

TRY TO DIAL 111-1970, AND END UP GETTING 970.  THE A.N.I. THEN
SAYS (IN A MECHANICAL VOICE) WHAT YOUR NUMBER IS -- WHICH IS, OF
COURSE, THE NUMBER SPRINT DIALED OUT ON.  DIALING INTO ONE OF THESE NUMBERS
IS LIKE DIALING INTO ANY SPRINT DIALIN.
 
THE BIG QUESTION IS, ARE THESE NUMBERS UNTRAPPED?  OR, ARE CALLS TO THESE
NUMBERS THE MOST SUSPICIOUS CALLS OF ALL?
 
THE A.N.I. CODE IN YOUR AREA IS LIKELY DIFFERENT.  IN 415, IT MAY
HAVE CHANGED. IN 408 (WHERE I LIVE NOW), IT IS 760 -- BUT IT ONLY
WORKS DURING MON-FRI 8AM-5PM.  HAVE FUN

Subject: Conversion

Dear Paul,
  Great to hear again.  I may slow down when we get our telephoine
bill.  On conversion*  The Lord does this through His own perfect tim
timing and people don't convert anyone.  The Holy Spirit calls
people through episodes which have happenend to you (like those) and
these folks can either recognize it or not (that's free will,
right?)
Personally, I think it's really neat that we called bbbs just when
we did, which was the same evening you put in the first sensible
message to the religionists and just a few minutes or an hour and a half
later.  The other msgs would have not inspired a reaction I don't think.
In what way may one consider you a Christian?  Do I have permission
to introduce you to a neat thought-question that I ran into a few
years ago?  Just sharing, no pressure.
Please tell me what a Daniken freak is.  Are you a Catholic still?
Have you heard of Keith Green's Catholic Chronicles?
I am a believer as you may have assumed and think the Lord is the MOST
Adorable and Fun way of life.

Hello, Y'all... I think some of you may know me from

I am calling on sprint now... the connection fades
in and out... it must be the microwaves trying to cross
the hot desert... I need some more sprint numbers, though
cuz, mine is only one left... all others in my list died.
But, I did find a number (experimenting w/ the Touch Tone)
that is real strange... you enter the number the usual
way, but after you dial the exchange and rest of the number
it just sits there... but, if you type four more numbers
then the connection goes through... real strange occurrence
at least, I think so... has anyone here experienced this
strange "trick" with sprint? It might be a bad thing,
because, somehow something funky might happen...
well, see y'all later!!! 
P.S. all my MicroNET PPN's died, from CompuServe arrest
...bummer, huh?
P.P.S. exactly what I meant with that strange sprint 
number is you have to type this: cccccc (aaa) eee llll xxxx

Hi Kerry,
   The 1200 baud speed recognition is done by the modem.  It can tell if
the originating modem is a 212A type by the tone your modem sends back.
The 8BBS answer modem supplies a 'speed indicator' signal that the 8BBS
program checks to see if 1200 baud is in use and sets the baud rate to
1200.  The A function has no effect for 1200 baud users.  Regards,..

Almost all 0-600 baud formats are bell 103 compatible. The
deaf TTY network uses 45.4545 baud and different frequencies
(1400/1800) vs. 2025/2225 for the 103. The 202 uses
1200/2200Hz. Common baud rates for the 103 are: 50, 75, 110,
134.5, 150, 200, 300, and 600. Digital modems such as the
MC14412 have trouble (I could not get my 14412 to work at 600)
above 300 baud since they can only resolve integer cycles.
Digital modems work by effectively timing the duration
between
zero-crossings and producing a "1" if shorter than a specific
duration. The comparison is 2125Hz for the high group and
1170Hz for the low group. Happy modulating, -SLI

I may as well put my 2 bits ($.125/bit=$1.00/byte) in about

Q. Do I believe in a God(s)?
A. Just as much as I believe in ESP and possibly slightly more
than I believe in UFO's.
Q. Do I believe in life after death?
A. I think there either is or isn't life. What is after life
should therefore be equivalent to what was before life. I
personally do not recall anything before life and thus do not
expect anything after life. I have no reason to believe
otherwise, except for being told by people who (as far as I
can tell) know no more about it than I.
Religionist is a real word, it means "a person devoted to
religion" or "a religious zealot or bigot" I.E. Mr. Falwell is
a religionist. I propose we call ourselves "Religious
philosophers" since philosopher means "lover of wisdom".

ie:  connect data in to data out and vice versa(pin 2 to pin 3

Hello Paul.  Pleas clear up what a hacker is to you.  I call a novice

Such as what you said about the Pope and what you said about Jesus being
a dentist and a garbage collector.  I would like to dialoge about what
you think a Christian is--I mean too about how would one identify one.
Some of the LOL's in our church (little old ladies but that term is not
exclusive or inclusive!) think a Christian is one who exhibits so-
called Christian behavior.  These, for example, really hack up the
witness to the outside of what Jesus really is.  One day a woman
asked me, "Gail, if you died right now would you be sure of going
to heaven?" (We can discuss that term after you have read some CSL)
I fell right into it when I innocently said "Oh, yeah. I'm sure, 
because I know Jesus and He knows me".  Well, I got the old hugs,
because that was the "Right" answer.  I mean, in other words, that I didn't
go into this good person baloney etc.  I have learned lots since then.
I have an equal problem with Schuller but the word of God says we are

I (and I don't mean to compare myself with them!!!) have had the

weld together in the spirit-filled Christian to the extent that even
martrydom would be "easy" for an obedient believer who was prepared
by the Holy Spirit for the experience (You have had lots of "not-

felon is a feather in a security agents cap, because if the felon

also lost the revenue for the long distance call which should have

(That should have been 'Origins').  Anyway, the only reason
Christianity was developed was because a man was either very helpful,
and was acclaimed a savior, or was unstable, and decided that he was
a savior.  Either way, all sorts of ideas have developed from that.
i.e. "I know Jesus" or "I have been good" or "act like a saint" etc.
If EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA about what Christianity is supposed
to be, then THERE IS NO *TRUE* CHRISTIANITY, so, therefore, there should
be no 'truth' in the bible, Christianity, etc.  It is all a matter
of simple interpretation.  Unless people who take the "I know Jesus"
stand can explain themselves in terms other than themselves, how do
they ever expect to make themselves understood?  i.e. If I
say "two plus to means you take two and add two to it", how are you
supposed to know what that means, if you don't know what 'two' nor
'add' mean?  Please, all religious people here should, from now on,
explan themselves in down-to-earth terms that we atheits can
understand.

Subject: Modifications for categories

Hi Bryan,
   Modifying the software to support different catagory message data bases
could be done.  But.. I see absolutely NO purpose in doing so.  What would
be the probability of the appropriate type msg actually being entered into
the proper msg data base?  There are quite a few users that refuse to
supply even name or location info.  Why would they comply with placing
their msg's in the 'right' data base?  Sounds like it would end up being
a full time job for the SYSOP to shuffle msg's from one data base to another.
   There are some systems that do support this concept, have you checked
them out?  A suggestion... if a msg looks like it is going to be 'boring'
why suffer through it?  Just use the C key to skip it and go on to the
next one.  I've also seen comments that indicate some people are bored
with 'phreak' msg's.  Hard to please everyone all the time..  Regards,..

Subject: Exclusion Key

An exclusion key has the function of making sure that no other
equipment can access the line while the exclusion key is activated.
Two examples:
       1. An exclusion key can disconnect all other extensions
          so that privacy is "ensured."
       2. An exclusion key can make sure that a phone and a
          modem/DAA are never both "off-hook" at the same time
          mainly so that the modem doesn't get disturbed.

Subject: WATS restructuring

Effective Monday, 1 June, the way WATS works will change DRASTICALLY.
Currently, there are two types of WATS:  10-hour and Full Business Day.
With 10-hour, you pay for the first 10 hours (whether you use it or
not) and with FBD, you pay for the first 240.  In each case you pay
an overtime charge for each 1/10th of an hour of overtime.  If you
had a GROUP of lines (say 10 FBDs) you got 2400 hours of usage and
only got billed overtime when you went over that (even if your first
line got 500 hours, if your total wasn't over 2400, no overtime).
What this meant was that large companies were able to make their
long distance calling "Fixed-Cost", i.e., an individual call had
no added cost (unless it made the lines busy, and caused a need for
a whole additional line).  THIS MEANT THAT NIGHTTIME USE OF WATS
WAS "FREE."
 
NOW COMES A DRASTIC CHANGE:  A WATS line now costs $27.50.  You
pay a certain amount per hour of usage (billed in 1/10th hour
increments).  The amount you pay is highest for the first several
hours, and drops off as you use more (but never drops off to as
low as the old 240 overtime was...).  There are three separate
periods, the same as the DDD periods.  Your usage an any period (cont'd)

counts only toward the reduced rate during that period.  For the
late-night/weekend period, you pay about $0.12/minute for a "Service
Area 5" line if you are on one of the coasts -- but there is no
reduction for large amounts of usage during the night.
 
At least TWO really important things have happened:
       1. Companies which had only SA 5 lines should start placing
          nearby calls as DDD calls -- it's cheaper.  What they
          really need is the appropriate mix of a few lines for
          each area, and a smart switch to sort out the calls by
          area code.
       2. IF YOU MAKE (I mean PAY FOR) AT LEAST TEN HOURS OF LONG
          DISTANCE CALLS A MONTH YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BUY ONE OF
          THESE FOR YOUR HOME!  (yes, you can get one for only
          $27.50... not a lot more than a plain black phone in
          New York or Chicago with metro service).  The things
          to remember are that you can only call to outside your
          state and that calls within a few hundred miles should
          not be made on SA5 lines.
I'll put the whole rate structure in here in a couple of days.

Only one more thing to remember:
 
       It used to be that when you used some j-random company's
       WATS line, you were PROBABLY only ripping off MA BELL.
 
       Mother has protected herself -- now she'll get the money
       for the time you used on j-random's WATS line.  J-random
       now gets ripped-off, and Ma Bell only loses the difference
       between the WATS rate and the DDD rate.  She might even
       win if you call New Jersey from NYC on somebody's SA5.

It would seem to if there  is anything
that is prima facie(at first sight)
worthwhile  to do,preventing nuclear
war  has got to be one of them.
There has been talk lately of a
winnable nuclear war by some of the
powers that be. This seems to be the
height of folly andI think it can
be proved without direct testing.
The problem is not going to "go away"
if we ignore  it.
This is Weapons Crisis Week at

it would be, in my estimation a good
idea to come to someof thesessions.

Subject: cbbs is alive and well

contrary to an earlier msg which listed all the local
cbbs systems, cbbs santa clara is doing fine and we
have been here for over a year and will continue
to be here. give us a call 408-241-1956
by the way, the most complete board list is maintained
by pms#1 in santee, ca. all other lists are not as 
up to date. Bill blue's list (the sysop) is the most
widely distributed and the one to get your system on
if you are not part of it already. lets stop having
umpteem out-of-date lists and let one syste (pms#1)
be the central focal point for the absolutely
most timely bboard information.
this makes it a lot easier for us sysops to keep
our status current on one list rather seventy-zillion.
especially us poor slobs still feeding the ma bell
long-distance animal.

Subject: good-bye dec for now..

well, the co. i bought the vt-100 from is very
willing to just let me return it. so i have decided
that my venture into dec equipment was premature
and will take the $1600 bucks i paid for one terminal
and buy myself two (or maybe even three) heath/zenith
h-19's which i can get for about $700 each.
this way, i will always have at least one backup
crt . i just can no longer 'hack without a net'
when it comes to a full-curser terminal capability.

Hello I see you have discovered ACCOUNTING CODE'S on the SPC Network
One thing you should know is that you need onley put in 2 #'s not 4 #'s
the format go's like this 5/or6 digit autherisation code /2 digit travel
code if needed area code 7 digit telephone # 2 digit ACCOUNTING CODE !
Just like some code's need travel code's some also need ACT #'s to
BUT WHY ? because some busnises want to know witch employe made that call
SPC will make seperet bill's fore each ACT code on the same 5 or 6 # code
so the subscriber can keep thare billing strate !
 
Also you should use A # buton after dialing you'r call it tell's the system
that you are not going to put in eney more digit's and if it didint like
what you put in it will give you A knew tone so you can start over again !
the 2 digit act number's can be eney thing it dosent matter ecsept when
the bill go's to the subscriber and he saye's "I DIDENT GIV THAT # OUT"
 
 
if you need more info abought SPC leave A message for ME you see " I "
once was A subscriber and had to sampel all of thaer services !

Hi Dave,
   Evidently you didn't understand the message.  I'll try to phrase it more
emphatically.  YOU ARE !NOT! TO DELETE MESSAGES THAT DON'T BELONG TO YOU.
8BBS is NOT a phreakers BBS, it is not a religionists BBS, it is not any
one sort of BBS.  This BBS is probably the most 'open' BBS in the country
in terms of message content policy.  You are to refrain from deleting
msg's that are not TO or FROM you.  Even though some msg's may not interest
you, other users may wish to read them.  You should learn how to use the
^C key to skip msg's or learn how to do selective msg retrieval.  I hope
you understand that you are NOT in charge of deciding which msg's are to
be killed.  The hundred or so msg's you 'killed' have been revived to
allow other users access to them.
   About loging in again with a 'new' name without having to re-dial...
That is most definitely NOT going to be implemented.

Subject: BBS fade out

Hi Mark,
   I read Frank's article in Kilobaud about BBS's fading out.  Most of
his comments about the negative aspects of running your own BBS are
very true.  Amount of time and money spent doing daily, weekly, monthly
file maintenance and hardware upkeep, equipment usage and wear, no income,
abuse and threats from users, etc...  I estimate it costs me about $40
per month in electricity for the system and dedicated air-conditioner.
About another $20 per month for supplies like paper and printer ribbons.
I sorta justify the cost by rationalizing, that since I don't smoke, it's
probably about what I'd pay per month if I did smoke.  So I just consider
it as a fixed expense.  No, I have no immediate plans to shut things down,
but I am thinking about a way to raise some money to cover a small amount
of the expenses some time in the future.  Will let you know if anything
comes of it.  Regards,..

Although your msg lacked a certain "coherence", I'll still say that what
you want to do is illegal and immoral (although not fattening).
If you need things like DB Master or VisiCalc, you should be able to
afford them. If you can't afford them, you probably don't need them.

Hi Bruce,
   Perhaps those comments would have got more response if you'd left
them in a public msg.  I really don't have much temptation to copy
software since there is very little mass merchandised software for
the PDP8.  It would seem that the question is really one of 'morality'
or 'ethics' of the people that have the ability and motivation to
make unauthorized copies of software.  Some will chose to do so, others
will refrain.  Seems like human nature is still what it is, has been,
and probably will continue to be. Regards,..

Hi David,
   Yes, I have a copy of the "Phone Book".  It's been several years
since I read it, but it describes quite a few nasty things that telco's
do to maintain their control over their employees & customers.  
   About the REMOB, I don't know what it is, perhaps a more sophisticated
version of a RDL?  (Remote Data Loopback).  It was rumored that there
was/is? a RDL on this 296-5799 line.  It's function was described as a
device or circuit that allows remote monitoring of a data circuit by
someone who calls a number on the 'other side' of the RDL coupler.  Does
any of this sound useful or interesting?  Regards,..

SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.  WERE THERE EVER ANY SOCIETIES WITH A FEMALE
MAJOR DEITY? I KNOW THE EGYPTIANS AND BABYLONIANS HAD THEM, BUT THEY
WERE NOT ANY MAJOR GODS.  PROBABLY NOT, CONSIDERING THE WAY THAT FEMALES
HAVE BEEN VIEWED THRU SOCIETY, UNLESS THAT GOD WOULD BE A SORT OF
UNIVERSAL MOTHER-FIGURE (DIDN'T THE GREEKS HAVE A GODDESS LIKE THAT?).
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT GODDESS WOULD EVER BE TOO MAJOR, THOUGH.
NOW WHO'S TO SAY THAT "OUR" GOD DOESN'T PERMIT ABORTION/FEMINISM ?? I
MUST ADMIT THAT MANY CHRISTIANS FEEL THAT WAY, BUT JUST HOW ACCURATE
IS FAITH AND SCRABBLING ABOUT FOR CLUES IN SOME ANCIENT BOOK ?! IT
IS PROBABLY JUST THEIR CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT.  YICH -- THAT'S AN
INTERESING IDEA, WHAT IF THE WORLD IS JUST A WARGAME FOR GOD ?? I'D
LIKE TO SEE THE RULE BOOKLET SOMETIME!
I SUPPOSE THE IDEAL GOD WOULD BE BOTH MALE AND FEMALE, OR NEITHER.
PROBABLY BOTH, SINCE SOMEONE/THING SHOWING NONE OF THE PERSONALITY
TRAITS OF EITHER MALES OR FEMALES WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A PERSONALITY!
PS. HAVE YOU BEEN LISTENING TO THE "HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY"?
 THERE IS A NICE QUOTE ABOUT THE BABEL-FISH, A CREATURE SO USEFUL THAT

Subject: Organized Religion -- Boooo!

One of the things I have against most forms of Christianity
is that the "members" are "forced" to hold the same views
about their god that the "administration" has.  Now, don't
get me wrong,  I don't mean to have Moonies in the Baptist
church (I rank them equal in sensibility and sensitivity).
I am just against good old Dr. Gene Scott (chan 38) wasting
good air time and such flaming about not getting enough
money to run his station,  and he promises not to speak
until he gets pledges for $30000 ...  Sigh!  Well,  I hope
he continues his policy of not speaking,  now we just
have to get people to stop paying the luser to talk, and
then he will "supposedly" shut his big mouth.  Anyway,
I guess I'm just in flameing mood right now, so if I
have offended you in any way, you have my appologie.

I concider myself an Agnostic, and so kind of stood back from the
discussion on Philosophy of religion, as well as the details. But now
things are getting more towards where I have an opinion: Those stupid
video preachers. There are few things I find more disgusting on TV
these days than Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Jim Baker (the worst
of the lot). Trying to "save our souls", by screwing around with the
public opinion of America. Not to menton the way they suck $$$$ out
of people who really can't afford it. The most outrageous of these
is Jim and Tammy Baker, who among other things offer a Bible for
$1000. (Tammy says it's too big for her to lift.) It wouldn't be so 
bad if they used the money for what they say they do, but it was
reported that the Bakers bought a $28,000 car and a $50,000+ house-
boat. I wonder what the hell that has to do with religion?

Subject: Not today...

Hi Eric,
   Your comments were noted... No, 8BBS will continue to ask for a user
name and location (the data you supplied is fine).  I suppose the
situation you describe is theoretically possible in Amerika.  However,
there is no requirement that anyone has to use this system if that risk
is of great concern to them.  C-Trees are fine things, but this is 8BBS.
There is no forseable chance of 8BBS ever using C-Tree type software.
C-Trees have some drawbacks also, such as lack of keyword topic search.
   I suspect both types of public access systems will be around for
quite a while.  Regards,..

815 (98.6%) full duplex users           11 ( 1.3%) half duplex users
810 (98.0%) users enable line feeds     16 ( 1.9%) disable line feeds
311 (37.6%) harcopy terminal users     515 (62.3%) video terminal users

 71 ( 8.5%) users have nulls set       768 (92.9%) users with 80 char lines
 
684 (82.8%) novice users               142 (17.1%) expert users
199 (24.0%) users with login passwords
 
This info was based on info stored in the user data file with the

paramaters set to what they want and just use the appropriate

MANY OTHERS DOWNLOAD IT VERY INEXPENSIVELY, MOST SYSOPS
TAKE THE ATTITUDE, IF BILL WANTS TO KEEP A SUPER LIST,

EVERY SYSOP NEED ONLY CALL ONE SYSTEM TO HAVE HIS SYSTEM
STATUS PROPOGATED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. I, AT LEAST,
AGREE WITH THIS PHILOSOPHY. LOCAL LISTS ARE GREAT, BUT

...The funniest thing happened to me the other day...You see, I had
gotten this letter a couple of weeks ago from the City Attorney's
Office informing me that a Mr. Lewis DePayne (alias ROSCOE) had nothing
better to do with his time than waste MY time, so he was therefore 
pressing charges against me for "Telephone Harrassment..."!  Taking it
for the joke it was, I took the morning off work (I needed a hair-cut
anyhow...)and went down to where this hearing was to occur...And right
up there on the 18th floor was Lewis, sitting next to his STARR witness,
none other than the illustriuos pain-in-the-patootie DAVE STARR!!!!
-----------**I JUST ABOUT **DIED** LAUGHING!!!!**-------------
And the funny thing about it is that they both took it so seriously!
Lewis was so nervous that his hands were shaking; his voice was weak...
I thought for sure that he was going to pee his little pants!!  He, (of
course) brought THE TAPE-RECORDER containing THE TAPE, but he never even
got a chance to play it because the hearing officer couldn't have given
a shit.  And neither did Dave get a chance to display the vast amount
of printouts that he dragged along!!  It's just too bad that nobody
gives a flying frig about what either of them have to say!!!  By the

I think I stated this once before, but it's worth repeating:
 
CCIS is GOD!!!!!
 
For those of you who don't know, I suggest you hop on a CAROT terminal:
For those of you who do, as they say, LET'S PHREAK!!!!!
 
By typing in the right commands, you can have a call originate within the
system and go out to 10 or more people, linking them together on one
party line, and then switching a "loop-around" trunk into this to "tie
them together" and set it up so that the calling party "dumps" into the 
"Party-line" and the loop is free for more incoming calls.  So you wind
up with a NATIONAL CONFERENCE that DOESN'T SUPERVISE!!!!!
All donme through the convience of you home terminal.  By the way, the
conference can be either temporary or permanent...when you get bored ya
just type it out, just like you'd type out ROSCOE's custom calling
features on ESS!!
 
Oh well, I can't get too technical due to the Powers that Be, but I'd
love to discuss this with any who are interested.

COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT MNET BENEFITS. ARE YOU
USING CLASICAL 1960 ERA TIME-SHARE FACILITIES SIMPLY
BECAUSE THEY ARE FREE TO YOU AND YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOCAL
MICRO THAT IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL OR ARE YOU TRULY DOING
STUFF THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH YOUR OWN SYSTEM.
DO YOU THINK OTHER USES AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH YOU?
I JUST THINK CIS/MNET WAS HACKED UP IN A WEEK-END
BY A BUNCH OF MONEY HUNGRY JERKS, AT LEAST THE SOFTWARE
SHOWS THAT. BTW--HOW COME A TYMNET GATEWAY ACCESS IS SO
EXPENSIVE?  MAYBE ON PURPOSE SO THE CROSS-OFFER FOR A
DEDICATED LEASED-LINE IS LOWER VOLUME WHICH LETS THEM
INCREASE THEIR NETWORK TOPOLOGY FASTER? AND WHY NO TELEENT
ACCESS. I THINK TELEENT IS TECHNICALLY SUPERIOR TO TMYMENT.

Subject: Right to Life

I *finally* managed to get through to this bbs!
You put your finger on an interesting irony of the whole right
to life controversy- pro-abortion people are ususally anti-
capital punishment, and anti-abortion people are usually pro
capital punishment.  This is true for me too, and I have done
a good bit of soul-searching about why this should be.  If
you abort someone because s/he may (or may not) be unwanted, 
in which case s/he may (or may not) commit murder, you are
punishing someone for something that you speculate that s/he
may be more inclined to do than the "average" person.  This is
open to grotesque abuses- ghetto blacks have a statistically 
higher crime rate, so. . . 
On the other hand, in capital punishment, an individual who
has commited murder is being punished for his/her(argh!)
own act.  It is a question of an individual's responsiblity for
his/her own actions.  
   As for the 'unwanted child' question, with a 10-year waiting
list for adoptions,I question whether there are any unwanted
children at all- SOMEONE wants them...

I am a Christian, but I haven't watched Pat Robertson or 
Jim Bakker in a long time, so I don't know what they are
doing now.  When I saw them before, I didn't notice any
obtrusive amount of solicitations for contributions.
  I think if any minister has to harangue his listeners
for contributions, that he had better take a good close look
at wether he is really doing God's will.  God is perfectly
capable of taking care of any ministry that He supports.
Case in point- Keith Green's group in Texas: he has an inflexible
rule that he will NEVER solicit contributions: when God is through
with the ministry, it will be terminated.
Not that I think that no minister should ever ask for contributions,
as long it is kept within reason.  By the way, what do all
you good people think of KQED and their interminable pledge
drives?  This seems to me to be more of the same (though
KQED of course has no theological purposes).  When is it too
much?

Hi Ted,
   Thank you very much for taking the time and doing the work
of comparing the two lists.   You didn't say what you were
using to send the file, but it sounded like you can 'trigger'
on a specific char.  If so, you should trigger on XON code,
ASCII 021 (same as ^Q).  You should have 'prompt with no bell'
set (P function).  
   To send the file, you should activate your prog when at the 
1st line prompt (1?) and the prog should wait for a XON before
sending the next line.  That method does work.  Looking forward
to updating the 'O' list.

For those of you that are familiar with the HP BBS in Emeryville, Ca.
(Those of you who aren't can call (415) 653-2152 or (415) 653-7202)
There are some future updates that will soon be in effect. For one,
all or most of the phone numbers will be changed (a message will
be posted here and on other Calif. BBS's listing the new numbers
when this change takes place) And two, the format of the BBS may change
a bit, this being because the BBS will soon be on an HP 3000 II instead
on the HP 2000A it is now running on. This will indoubtedly mean an increase
in speed, efficiency, direct user-to-user communication facilitys and
over-all capabilitys. And for any of you out there with experience in PASCAL
programming, any suggestions would be appreciated.

     Well, I've been a CompuServe (MicroNET) user for a long time now,
and the system has really improved.  Although DISPLA isn't the easiest program
in the world to get along with (and very repetative), it does get the job done.
     There is an option someplace in DISPLA to make it so you're DIRECTLY
logged onto MicroNET, not DISPLA...There is another option (same place as
this one where ever that is) to be put directly into EMIAL if you have new
mail waiting.
     If you're a programmer, you'll love MicroNET....They have just about
every language that you can think of...Here is most of there:
FORTRAN IV and EXTENDED, COBOL, APL, BASIC & extended, SAIL, MACRO, ALGOL,
TECO, ROOT, and many other languages...You have a VERY large amount of core
(private and some public) accessible to you...I don't think that you can
get much public core anymore, but before they would allow your job to
call up alot of it before (now there are just too many users).
     If you're a game player with a big bank account, they have
quit a few good games, and two exellent adventures..The first is the Original
Adventure writen by John Wood at Stanford (don't think it's the same John Wood
as we have on this system...), and the next is an extended version of the
original that is VERY DIFFICULT if you haven't mastered the first!

of parts of stored text, mergin of files, etc.  They have RUNF10 (used with
FILGE it is very powerful), they have TECO, SOS, and another that is used for
binary dumps..don't remember the name.
     All there manuals are writen by them or DEC (they mail the original
manual with supplements), and are reasonably priced.
    As far as multi-user games (or interactive games), they have two..CB and
SPCWAR.  BOlth are nice was to pass the time (expensivly).CB is
just that, a CB simulator with 30 indevidual chanals, and private talk modes.
SPCWAR is a startrek type game (you go arround and blast the other people who
are trying to kill you), and is based on a point scoring system not a death
rate!

Subject: MicroNET PPNs

     The MicroNET PPN is a very basic thing (its alos in the standard
format for all PDP-10s useing a TOPs-10 monitor [there's is just modified]).
First PPN= Project, Programmer Number
In this examle I will use that good old PPN 70000,1.
Project =70000   Programmer #= 1
The project # determins what kind of account it will be, and the programmer #
is just to keep track of all the PPNs in that project.  ALL PPNs ARE OCTAL!
Now, ANY PPN that has a project # of 70000, 70003, 70005 or that ends in
a 1, 3, 5 is a FREE account (no one pays for it)!  These are isued to people
that do something for CSI.
Now, MNET uses the Project number to determin what STATE you're calling from.
If i were to give an entire list it would take alot of space (there are multipa
l project numbers for some and most states).  But, such thigs as 70110
is in CA, 70150 is in MI, 70210 is in NY, etc.
Every so often you might see something like a 313,302 on CB or something..
Well, that is a transfer account from the CompuServe computers (a person
with an account on COMPUSERVE not MNET) useing CB or something...You'll notice
that his Account ID is something like: 0003020010..(think I left out a
0 or two but..) that means that his PPN is 302,10 (or 302,0010..0's before the
first digit in the Programmer # don't are insugnificant)..continued

There is also the PPN 1,2.  This is the operator PPN, and can do vertually ANYT
HING!   Of course you'll never see this PPN anywhere, but it's there.  There ar
e the system libraries (1,40- 1,46) the hold the MNET & CSI programs.  There
is the CSI FEEDBK account (12,12 I think), and many others (such as the Tandy
store accounts (the 70005 prject) that are used by the stores).

Hi Shannon,
   Accidently loging in as a 'new' user with your regular name is not a
problem.  8BBS will just tell you that "you have used this system before"
and show your last login date & time.  In fact, that is the only way to
read the "do you want to know about..." files.  I see you've received
several replies on 212A frequencies already.  Regards,..

Subject: you showed your true colors.

Hmmm. your last message which degenerated into a personal
attack showed your true colors. It is a shame that some
people cannot argue or converse normally without
quickly resorting to personal attack of the oppososng
party. It has long been my experience that meaningless
comments and insults are most often heard from the insecure
party of a conversation.  This person is often proved
to be in the wrong most of the time. Too bad we will not
know in this case, for i refuse to talk to anyone who
stoops to such low levels of argument.. Would it really
make any difference if your mother wore army boots or
some such? Well, you statement makes no more sense.
I wish the world were emptied of all the fools such as
yourself, it would be a fine place for the 99% left
such as the SYSOP and most other users of this system.

except for one or two of you, you seem to miss my
point. Of all those 'neat' languages available
i think i have all but two on my micro. the CIS
display program is a joke, and if you change your
log-on to go into mnet you are admitting that.
besides, CIS promotes CIS, did they not change their
name from micronet and now only indicate that mnet is
'available' for the personal computer user?
i can play the FULL BLOWN original adventure on my
own system and my stars wars/star trek programs
are just fine (granted, they are single user.)
FILGE as a word processor? I suppose you still think
of paper tape as the 'ultimate' mass storage media.
('nuff said'). Filge is about as archaic as any
pdp-1 software might appear to a XEROX-STAR or
convergent technologies workstation user.
Besides, i have not even mentioned response time,
which, of course, is very unpredictable.
What about the SOURCE anyone like/dislike that?

No doubt you have probably seen our ads in BYTE and INFOWORLd.  We
are Interactive Business Solutions and we are offering the Telemail
electronic mail system for use to the general public.  This system
allows person to person mail, access to a vast majority of
bulletin boards with many created for major personal computers.
This system allows you global communication for the price of $3.50
non prime time (6pm - 7am in your time zone), and the phone call for
most people is local is you are in a local telenet calling area.
Our charge is by far the lowest of other telemail systems available,
and will be much better.  We feel that overpriced telecommunications
or extreeme membership fees severely limit reaching thousands of
computer enthusiasts who might otherwise be inable to use this revo-
luntionary system.  Our memebership is growning each day, and new
and inovative information is added to bulletin boards also.
If you are interested in our offer, please send name,address,phone
and a $25 deposit to:
Interactive Business Solutions, 333 Cobalt Way, Suite 106, Sunnyvale, CA
94086, or call 408-737-9618 for order or more information.  Check our

Subject: RITES OF PASSAGE

I HAVE READ ENOUGH MESSAGES, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE (SOME ADDRESSED
TO ME, SOME NOT), ASKING HOW TO USE A TIP.  HERE GOES:
 
1.  HIT AN UPPERCASE 'E' WHEN YOU FIRST CONNECT TO THE DIALUP.
2.  AFTER THE TIP BANNER PRINTS, SAY '@ O 123' TO CONNECT TO NODE 123
    (OR SUBSTITUTE YOUR OWN NODE ADDRESS).
3.  SAY '@ C' TO BREAK THE CONNECTION (TO RECONNECT TO ANOTHER NODE).
 
THERE IS MORE STUFF TO IT THAN THIS, OF COURSE, BUT THIS WILL
GET YOU STARTED.  BECAUSE TIP COMMANDS BEGIN WITH '@', YOU MUST SAY
'@@' TO SEND AN '@' TO THE REMOTE HOST.
 
A LITTLE KNOWN FACT -- IF YOU SAY '@ 4 C', YOU WILL BREAK THE
CONNECTION OF THE PARTY ON LINE 4 OF YOUR TIP (WE CALL THAT SOCKET #4).
IN FACT, YOU CAN FORCE ANY COMMANDS ONTO ANY SOCKET ON YOUR TIP.
THIS WAS INTENDED TO ALLOW THINGS LIKE CONTROLLING AN OUTPUT-ONLY
DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE TIP (A LINE PRINTER, FOR EXAMPLE).  
I WONDER WHAT HAVOC WILL BE CAUSED BY TELLING ALL YOU MONSTERS ABOUT THIS.

Subject: more tip stuff

One other thing for all you TIP users: When you first dial up, the TIP
will throw in 2-3 nulls after a CR. You can instruct the TIP to get
rid of these by entering   @D C A   or, if you need more nulls (using
a slow hardcopy terminal?) you enter    @D C E
 
Another thing, the TIP doesn't care if the commands you send it are
in upper or lower case. Also, when you want to send a @ to the host
you're using, you type @ twice, and it will appear on your terminal
*three* times, the first two echoed from the TIP, and the third from
the host.

can sell them back to you.  I don't want them back.  Can anyone figure

Subject: i am getting spoiled..

Well, I finally got my borrowed VADIC TRIPLE modem running.
Wow, how nice.  It seems i was impatient, the modem takes a few
seconds to pick the proper answering protocal, I thought it was
not working.  I have been happily using it here and on the TELEMAIL/IBS
system.  Did you know that TELENET/TELEMAIL rates are all based on
assumming 1200 baud access?  So if you use 300 baud you are really
not getting the most for your and money; and vice versa, no surcharges
(unlike the source and compu-rip-off) if you do have $800 or $900 to
buy a VADIC!
P.S>  A vadic rents for about $50 a month on lease/purchase, I may
be forced to do that when the owner of this modem returns from
his vacation.  Good thing there are no phone lines in backpacking
country....

Subject: Useless subject line.

What character do you use for line cancel? Is there one? If
not, I suggest the standard control-X to cancel input lines.
It would be nice if it was easier to abort from the early
stages of entering a message (Subject?, Protect?, Review).
Control-K should work at this stage. If "E" is accidentally
pressed you are stuck.
 
I have found another bug! There is no control-Q printed
immediately after the ">" prompt when messages are left for
the Sysop at logoff. This locks my keyboard out when I try to
leave comments. The control-Q should be printed by the input
routine, rather than along with the prompt string as you
probably have it.

A while ago I needed to know what the pin 37 frequency was
because I was trying to figure out how their disk interface
works. I asked a friend Apple owner, who said it was 2MHz. I
phoned Apple to ask about how the interface worked. The
engineer I spoke with claimed what I wanted was "proprietary,
confidential, and patented". He mentioned that there is NO
2MHz clock on the Apple bus, and after all, he should know. I
phoned my friend again and he said it was definitly 2MHz. I
was irked by this, so I phoned Apple back and tried to talk
with someone else. I was redirected to the engineer whom I
spoke with earlier. This time he said ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY,
UNQUESTIONABLY, STAKE-HIS-MOTHER'S-LIFE-ON-IT, THERE IS NO
2MHz ON THE APPLE BUS. THE FREQUENCY ON PIN 37 IS 1.023MHz
EXACTLY! Two against one now... -SLI

Hi Steven,
   Sounds like you are operating in 'expert' mode...  Welcome msg clearly
states that a ^U cancels the current line input.  Novice mode clearly
states that a  -  is used to back out of msg entry (same as CBBS).  BTW:
^U is standard line input abort (in DEC OS's) not ^X.
   Can't imagine why lack of XON should lock your keyboard.  I'll check the
code and see if it is fixable without too much effort.  I no longer have
much time or interest in doing 8BBS prog mods.  I'm working on a 16 ch,

less than 2 1/2 hours so that others can take advantage of these 
services. If you are new to this I can understand that it takes
time to understand it all. I just thought I would pass on this 
note in the hope that we can all work together to keep the 
system usable.   Thanks Chuck.

Subject: 600 still OK

Hi Bob,
   Your comment sounded like you thought 8BBS used to run with a PMMI.  Not
so... it was a flakey Novation 4103B that was sometimes useable at 600.
600 baud was (and still is) optional at the callers own choice using the
'A' function to switch to 600 from some lower speed.  The 212A that is
currently in use runs MUCH better at 600.  Give it a try, had reports that
it worked OK at 600 to Berkeley, so it may be OK for you also.  Regards,..

My apologies for using up so much time. I'm new to teleprocessing, having 
had my ATARI 800 for only about 2.5 months, and I was so wrapped up in readi
ing all the news I lost track of the time I was using. I promise I'l be more
careful in the future. Since i work at nite from 17:30 to 03:30 this should
be easy. I feel your system serves areal need in allowing computer hobbyists

Hello people, I'm Dave Flory talking to you on an ATARI 800, using the smart
program called 'DOWNLOADER' by Computer Age Software. All you ATARI folk sho
ld give it a try. $19.95 gets you the terminal emulator program, DOS 2s, Aut
o-SYS, DUP.  Works pretty well, dumping all transactions to memory as you
do it, and saving to disk and tape. You can load from disk and tape and send
upload by saving to 'r' the modem.
I'd like to hear from any ATARIusers out there.  I'm half of the tape librarian
for the Bay Area ATARI user's group.  If you have an ATARI you should come
to a meeting.  We meet on the first Monday of every month at Foothill College
in the Community Center at 7PM and at INTERIM ELECTRONICS on Bascom Ave.
in San Jose, just south of San Carlos 2 blocks, on the 3rd Tuesday of each
month. Hope to meet you here and at meetings.  Would like to talk to anyone
who is interested or knowledgeable about FORTH and PASCAL and PILOT, etc.
etc., etc. may your disk always run at speed.

Subject: use TELEMAIL/IBS INSTEAD!!

If you are considering compuserve, and you are, and you
seem to already have determined that the information utility
features are  more a novelty once you get over the intrique factor
(a 60 cent paper in the morning is a lot cheaper than reading
a paper at 300 baud for $5 an hour) and since you have your own
micro so micro-net timesharing is not really needed, why don't
you check into our TELEMAIL / IBS system which may be exactly
what you are looking for.  It is a global electronic message
system like this board and CBBS Sunnyvale except it reaches much
farther, is accesible via local phone call in most cities, and
features sophisticated person-to-person mail beyond the read-protected
message facitilities common on some boards (and very good here.)
Of course, a major point is that it is multi-user running on
a $500,000 TANDEM NONSTOP(TM) multi-processor main-frame computer
system. So no busy signals and reasonable response time.
If you are interested, check other messages here or on CBBS sunnyvale,
408-737-7543 or leave a msg for MIKE DOVE our system administrator.

i still have problems and/or cannot get that board up will buy

WE WILL REMAIN IN SERVICE even though thinks are pretty shaky
right now.
I appreciate your devotion in staying with us through this
rough period of hardware failures.  The sytsem has been up
24 hours a day for over a year, and we already blew out our crt
three months ago, had the disc board repaired once, replaced the

How much and what can I do with the

Being a multi-user system sounds good.
The best thing about Compu. is that you

TELEMAIL/IBS is on TELENET.  Thus there are no hidden
charges for using the telenet network and it is accessible
from every telenet dial-up.  The system feature a very
good electronic message system, multiple bulletin boards
arranged by subject for easy scaning, and multi-user
capability running on a $300,000 TANDEM nonstop computer
syste for high reliability.
TELEMAIL/IBS is the lowest-priced, non-prime time message
system and is also reasonable (but expensive) in prime
time.  We decided to pick the functons everyone wants,
electronic mail (person-to-person private messages) and
bulletin board or public broadcast messages) and offer
the best syste for that.  We don't offer the electrnic
new york times or stuff like that; nor do we want to.
Did you ever notice that a lot of those 'information
utility' stuff which sounds real neat is often an EXTRA
SURCHARGE for use?  Have you checked the prices on
the stock quotations and other EXTRA services they offer
which their advertising does not clearly state COSTS MORE
above their minimum hourly rates?

Subject: file xfer -telemail/ibs

TELEMAIL/ibs supports file transfers in the following
way:  a 'message' on the system is simply any entity
that a user keys into the system.  If that message
should contain the ascii text of a program or even the
hexadecimal version, that does not matter.
Since TELEMAIL supports the DC1/DC3  (x-on, x-off) flow
control protocol, it is very easy to upload a 'file'
into a message and then have someone else 'download' the
file into their own system.
What makes this easy is the fact that each user is
communicating thru a local phone line, hence much better
transmission and that a message is unlimited in length!
no 16 or 20 line limits.
Also, any message can be saved in an individuals own
private file storage which is currently billed at the
rate of 1 penny per thousand characters per day.
the simple command 'file in archive' will take the current
message and store it away in a file called 'archive'
for example.

Subject: more telemail info

TELEMAIL/IBS is a turn-key mail system.  There is not
a way to exit out and use the Tandem.  The advantage of
the Tandem as its hardware is the fact that it is the
most reliable system so the TELEMAIL system is up almost
all the time.  Also, a big advantage is that the Tandem
hardware is very modlar.  They can go from a 2 or 3 processor
system up to a 16 processor system with no software changes
(They do not even have to re-compile their programs, if
they did it right.)
So, as the system grows, they can quickly keep up the
load, unlike the other sysems which must rubber-band
together many dec-20/dec-10 computers to expand capacity
or several prime systems.
TELEMAIL/IBS costs only $3.50 per hour during non-prime
time.  Non-prime time is currently 6 pm to 7am mon - Fri and
all day Sat Sun, and certain Holidays.
Effective July 1,1981 (unfortunately) TELEMAIL rates are
doubling.  However, TELEMAIL/IBS will still offer the
$3.50 per hour rate, except non-prime time will be from
9 pm to 7am.  Other rates: $16/hr 7am to 6pm, $8/hr 6 to 9pm

cbbs sunnyvale (408-737-7543) is up and running except
we have slowed down the cpu clock.  that seems to
avoid a lot of the heat related glitches we had.
so, be sure to give the phone 5 or 6 rings now before
giving up, as the software timeout is much longer at
the slower clock speed.

I know something about 212 modems, but not much about 202.
Anyway, I have a 202 modem which I haven't figured out what
all of the pins do yet, so I haven't had a chance to try it
on anything.  I don't know of any bbs's with 202 modems, but
you might try looking at any abbs's which have 1200 baud, since
Novation has the Applecat modem with 202 in it for pretty
cheap.  Any other bbs's with 1200 baud probably all use 212A
type modems.  If you find any 202 systems, let me know so I
can test mine when I get it hooked up.
                       Allan  Hessenflow
 
p.s. The only reason that I am working on a 202 modem is
because Eric Moyer has several of them, and I'm trying
to figure out the pinout for him.

To all 202 users?? at 20:46:53 on 24-Jun-81.
Subject: about the bell 202

The BELL 202 was the first 1200 baud modem for use over 2 wire
telco lines.  It is half-duplex, that means only one end of
the line can send at a time, and the other end must wait.
The sending line then 'turns the line around' and each end
reverses their role.  The 'reverse interrupt' pin on the RS-232
is a primitive way for the receiver to tell the sender to shut up
and let it get the line immmediately because it has something important
to send (usually a protocol message saying retransmit last msg, etc.)
HALF-DUPLEX MODEMS (which are different from HALF-DUPLEX terminals)
are really only useful for commputer to computer lines, where typically
a file transfer or several thousand characters go down the line in
one direction.  An interactive terminal (or virtual terminal)
such as a CBBS, where the user may type 1 or 2
characters, then wait for the other end to reply, would be
very SLOW with a 202 because there is a minimum hardware delay
required to 'turn the line around.'  Also, note that most
current SATTELITE based communications lines suffer almost a
5 sec 'end to end' line turn-around delay, so satellites ARE NOT
the answer to INTERACTIVE long distance computing (commuting.)
At least, currently.


Message number 9902 is 8 lines from John Wood
To all 202 users at 20:48:43 on 24-Jun-81.
Subject: more about 202 quirks

I think that if you can get 202's cheap (which they seem to 
be available) an interesting use would be a link using two
dedicated phone lines. Then one line could send and the other
could receive.  This would eliminate the line turn-around delays.
Unfortunately, again, i think this would only work from computer-
to computer because each end needs TWO RS-232 ports and the
software (intelligence) to multiplex them (look at one for
incoming data, send data out on the other.)

        automatically read all the messages from any starting point
        by the use of the "^" or "-" characters during retrieve.)

John, I saw your msg about 202 modems, but Stanford university has
these 150/1200 dialups, and dont have any Vadics or 212s at all! 
I have used 202s at Standford, and they dont really seem to have a
difference in them.. If one like in transmitting on a different 
frequency, whats the turn around? I dont have a different baud
rate selector for i/o on my terminal, so UARTs should take care of
that. Have you ever been to SU? I am interested inn response!! I
dont know very much bout them.. Just the basics..          ..

I saw your previous msg about phone phreaks.. If you are famousm
why dont you use your real name? That seems pretty stupid if you are
already famous. And why dont you call her? Do you find all your phone
numbers in the phone book? Even *I* can find her number, and I am
not really a phone phreak myself. I hope YOU take this in good

I have a telenet number for the Dow Jones stock exchange

with anyone that can get me a manual for the system.
I have made it do the following:
       o Generate Histograms
       o Display latest trading
       o History of trading over past year
       o One line current updated summaries of
               present trading.
 
The system is 15 minutes behind schedual of actual trading
in NYC.  There is probably ways to monitor trading in
Rome, Tokyo, and London too...

Sam, got the modem ok on Friday.  The UPS man almost forgot it!  He
delivered some packages and then left, and then returned about 1/2
hour later with your COD.  Had a little trouble understanding the 
wierd Bell names for DTR, RTS, etc., but Bernard set me straight.
Am using 1200 baud now to enter this message, and everything looks
real good.  Have use the modem in originate to use MicroNET and
Source via 1200 baud, much improvement (but much expensive!).
Hope to have my BBS respond to 1200 in a week or so.  At the present
time I still have to limit access to 300 until I figure out the proper
interface for the speed line.  
     Thanks for sending the modem to me so fast.  See you later.

Subject: 1200 'free' on TELEMAIL/IBS

As some of you who own 1200 baud modems are now finding out,
SOURCE, COMPUSERVE, and DOW JONES CHARGE YOU EXTRA IF YOU use
a high speed modem.  DOW JONES (and i assume the others) claims
that if you use the system '4 times faster' charging you 1.5 times
more is still 'a good deal'.
Well, TELEMAIL/IBS does not surcharge for 1200 baud!!! Actually,
TELENET prices all their service based on the assumption you are
using 1200 baud. So, if you use 300 baud, you are actually not
taking full advantage.  BUT NO 1200 BAUD RIP-OFF!!
Just think how much MORE you can do on TELEMAIL/IBS at 1200 baud
and only $3.50 per hour, non-prime time!!!!

They are all currently 'for sale' at the new computer store

I do right now.
