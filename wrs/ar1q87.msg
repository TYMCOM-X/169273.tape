The Panels

Words and world representations.

   How have these suddenly become more interesting? Do they offer a way through
   from the old "primitive " dispute, and do they offer a way out from having 
   to separate world and linguistic knowledge? How does what we know about 
   words fit into the language understanding and generation process, and is 
   that different for understanding and generation ?

   Don Walker (Bellcore) Chair

   Bran Boguraev (Cambridge)

   Bob Amsler (Bellcore)

   Jerry Hobbs (SRI)

   Judy Kegl (Princeton)

II. Unification and the new grammatism

   How far does this really differ from the CFG position of the sixties? Does 
   it yet have any empirical successes in terms of working systems? To what 
   extent are these grammatical formalisms motivated by processing 
   considerations ?

   To what extent are these processing claims substantiated ? Are we converging
   to some class of formalisms that are relevant for processing and, if so, how

   can this class be characterized in a theoretical manner ?

   What are the prospects of these types formalisms becoming the basis for 
   future natural language processing research ? Has the processing paradigm 
   now really fundamentally influenced linguistics ?  Do processing 
   considerations and results show that such systems when implemented can be 
   neutral between

   analysis and production.

   Has everyone really been doing unification for decades and just found out? 
   Is it a real advance or just a Hollywood term?

   Steve Pulman (Cambridge)

   Aravind Joshi (U.Penn.)

   Mitch Marcus (Bell Labs.)

   Martin Kay (XEROX-PARC)

III. Connectionist and other parallel approaches to natural language processing

   Is NLP inevitably commited to a symbolic form of representation? Can 
   syntactic, semantic or world knowledge be represented in that paradigm if 
   taken seriously? What parts of current CL will fare worst if there turn out 
   to be significant empirical advances with connectionist parsing? Are there 
   any yet (i.e. how far do we trust simulations programmed only on serial 
   machines?)

   What new approaches to syntax, semantics or pragmatics will be needed if 
   this approach turns out to be empirically justified? Will it just bring back
   all the old views associated with associationism, and will they be changed 
   in the journey? Is parallel parsing just a new implementation or a real 
   paradigm shift?

   Gary Cottrell (UCSD)

   Gene Charniak (Brown)

   Jay McClelland (CMU)

   Wendy Lehnert (U.Mass.)

IV. Discourse Theory and Speech Acts.

   Is there yet any serious discourse theory with testable computational and 
   empirical consequences? What phenomena ought a processing theory of 
   discourse understanding/generation to address itself that are not already 
   being attended to currently? What aspects of discourse are language problems
   and which are general AI/KR problems? What makes a theory of discourse a 
   processing theory? Does spoken language affect one's theory of discourse?

   Is there any real hope that we will be able to recognise the plans/goals 
   etc. of a speaker? How much of conversation is carried on through the 
   linguistic window anyway? Do current theories of text and dialogue discourse
   mesh, and should they?

   Barbara Grosz (SRI) Chair

   Julia Hirschberg (Bell Labs.)

   Ray Perrault (SRI)

   Bob Wilensky (Berkeley)

   Franz Guenther (Tuebingen)

V. Why has theoretical NLP made so little progress?

   Has CL advanced in this respect since Tinlap2 in 1978? What can NLP systems 
   do today in the light of what we would have predicted at Tinlap2. Why are we
   no nearer to a common notation for systems since KRL----- would we be helped
   by CL textbooks geared to particular programming languages (one such is now 
   in preparation)? Is it a case of just cycling through ranges of obscure 
   syntactic and semantic formalisms (and then rediscovering them every 10 
   years or so)? Are there serious problems about the overall cognitive 
   paradigm being applied to NLP? Are there any serious alternatives to the 
   current paradigms, and what would they imply to NLP research directions and 
   goals?

   Roger Schank (Yale) Chair

   Norm Sondheimer (USC-ISI)

   Larry Birnbaum (Yale)

   Ivan Sag (Stanford)

   David Israel (SRI)

VI. Formal versus commonsense semantics.

   What does Montague grammar or situation semantics have to say to CL? Can we 
   distinguish the good parts from what is bad and useless? For what NLP 
   applications might these formalisms be particularly appropriate?  What have 
   such theories chosen to ignore, in terms of data or intuitions? How are they
   to be computed: compositionally, randomly? How well can such formalisms mesh
   with the rest of language representation processes, e.g. discourse and 
   pragmatic analysis?

   Yorick Wilks (NMSU) Chair

   David Israel (SRI)

   Geoff Nunberg (Stanford/Xerox-PARC)

   Wendy Lehnert (U.Mass)

   Karen Sparck-Jones (Cambridge)

   Susan Stucky (Stanford-CSLI)

VII. Reference: the interaction of language and the world.

   When is a noun phrase a referring expression? How does the meaning of a noun
   phrase contribute to the success of a referring act? How can a "wrong" 
   description be useful for referring? Is there any role for Russell's 
   analysis of descriptions in a pragmatic theory of referring?

   What does it mean for a hearer to identify a referent?  What is the 
   relationship between knowing  who or  what something  is and referent 
   identification?

   Is referring to events and situations inherently different from referring to
   material objects?  What identification criteria are applicable to events and
   situations?

   Bonnie Webber (U. Penn.)

   Amichai Kronfeld (SRI)

   Brad Goodman (BBN)

VIII. Metaphor

   How relevant are the philosophical, linguistic, and psychological 
   literatures on metaphor? Can any of the recent work in dialogue, planning & 
   speech acts be applied to understanding metaphor. Are existing knowledge 
   formalisms (e.g. conceptual dependency, scripts, semantic networks, KLONE) 
   adequate  for metaphor? If not, why not? Given that the recognition of 
   metaphor involves matching together large-scale knowledge structures, are 
   there any existing procedures that do this adequately? How can this matching
   be done? How might we record the degree of match? Are there additional types
   of processing necessary for recognising metaphor?

   How should metaphor be represented in semantic representations of text? Are 
   there situations when a metaphor should be "resolved", and others when its 
   tension should remain? How can we recognise those situations?

   Andrew Ortony (Illinois)

   Ed Plantinga (Toronto)

   George Lakoff (UCB)

   Geoff Nunberg (Stanford/Xerox-PARC)

IX. Natural Language Generation

   Will the demands of language production bring AI, theoretical linguistics 
   (and of course CL) closer together than the demands of comprehension did in 
   the past? Is there anything special about generation? Does generation 
   constrain problems differently from understanding, in that it would not 
   matter if some high-powered machine could understand things no human could 
   say, but it would matter if the same machine generated them! Are knowledge 
   structures, of the world as much as language, the same or different for 
   understanding and generation?  What is the relation between the message the 
   system wants to convey and its lexical, syntactic etc. abilities to do it.

In order to find who has the problem log into the slot and do a ?stat
Then try turning one the 600 baud device.  Then (in the DDT) do an
ARING <port number in decimal>.  In the input isis async ring you should
an 00 8s xx where s is the isis index of speed (page 47 isis manual) and
xx is the character.  In the output ring there should be 00 Bs and 00 9s
where is the speed again and 00 E0.  By noting where this process failed
it should be fairly easy to find the responsible party and if it is the
consat, the responsible code.

Visible box is probably enough, and far more convincing.  I do have a few
stickers, since my siren is in an attic vent, and not visible.  I also make
a point of testing it every few months for a couple seconds.  A good idea,
and also good advertising.  -Bill

Wayne,

Since you're the man in the middle on this special characters
in username thing, I jus t realized while reading Bill Soley's memo that
my objection is all wrong.  For usernames, his proposal is okay, still
pending Vida's investigation into how many usernames are affected.  I was
thinking his restriction had something to do with the passwords, for
some reason.  Oh well...  I gotta get some help or else my mind's 
going to turn into mush.

Tell Bill and others not to worry.  I've withdrawn my objection.  However,
I would like to see Bill submit a PIR to do this NEW feature in Netval.
Let's not try to slip it in.

Bob

I couldn't remember which one you asked me to keep an eye out for.

Yes, Tower has always had a slot for "Electric Dreams", but they had stock
for only about a month.  Sigh.  I was in Tower Campbell last night and
almost got a Tangram, but it was $19 so I thought I might listen to your's
first.  How do you feel about swaping CD's now and then for a day or two
so we can listen before we buy.  I'll upload my list tonight if I get a
chance, and you can look through to see if there are any you'd be interested
in.  I also understand that the Santa Clara public library is starting a
CD collection, but I don't know how extensive it is at this time.  -Bill

This is pretty much what I had called you about yesterday afternoon.  I
believe I have found another possible route to fix your "message returned
because mail not read in 30 days" problem.  

The data centers use a program (SUPCHK) to monitor all OPER mail, all BATCH
requests, etc., on all hosts in their data center.  The program would not be
difficult to change, to enable it to run RDMAIL.  

This would take care of the problem of TUMS mail not read by OPER.  It would
not take care of other users, though.  Maybe we should leave things as they
are.  What do you think?

Bill,

I am working on the list of usernames with special characters. Actually
the names belong to just a few customers, so far, and should be easier
to take care of. However, I cannot access any usernames that have control
characters in them, so I suggest you go ahead and get rid of them as I
 cannot. I will keep you posted on any progress with the other names on
the list.

Kind regards,

Well with the new RPG, SUPCHK might be able to read TUMS mail since the
MAIL command will now do a RDMAIL if there is no RPG mail.  The only
trick is that if SUPCHK looks for "mail waiting" then it won't know to
give the mail command.  More than likely, however, it probably just always
gives the MAIL command and looks for "no mail".  We should look at SUPCHK
and do a quick test.  Its not junk mail, its important stuff!  -Bill

I think I don't know what to do about names with funny characters in
them either.  I suggest you give a list to Nancy of the ones you can't
access and she can go in with the debugger and blow them away.  If that
course doesn't prove fruitful, let me know and I can try writting a
program to go in through NCUD1, but I don't know if that will work.

How about this: When RPG can't find any mail in XOBLAM, it runs RDMAIL at
its normal starting point, which outputs "no mail" if none.  When RPG does
find mail in XOBLAM, it runs RDMAIL at the CCL entry, which tells RDMAIL to
suppress the "no mail" message.		/Joe

I don't think its worth it.  It only matters when a user has BOTH RPG and
TUMS mail which is unlikely.  What will happen is he'll see it next time
the mailer runs.  Or next time he logs in.  Meanwhile, I've changed the
[no mail] to just plain "no mail" in RDMAIL and have distributed itto most
systems.  Will catch the rest tonight, probably.  -Bill

I'm not sure, I'll defer that one to management.  I suspect that its all

I'm not sure what you mean, but I see some messages in your TUMS.MSG that have
no header (i.e.  # To: ).  They don't usually mean there is anything wrong
other than the usual EOT bug.  Any messages that were really deleted should be
in your AR4Q86 or QR1Q87 file.  You can use
  OPEN AR4Q86
to get at them, then use the usual commands, then CLOSE to go back to your main
file.  Hope this helps.  Sorry about this annoying bug.  -Bill

Subject: Problem with ASP located and fixed. 

Every ASP tape created before 28-Jan-87 is missing data.  For every three
disks saved to tape, two pages were missing.  They are page 5 on disk 3n+1
and page 15 of disk 3n+2.  These were not picked up due to a long standing
bug in MAPIO that handles the CHANIO function to super-map disk pages.

The missing pages on disk 3n+1 caused no trouble, since it is the third
page of BOOTS, which was never used (BOOTS is actually 1.75 pages long), and
was re-written by running BOOTS.KI or BOOTS.KL.

The octal addresses of the other missing pages were page 17 on unit 2, page 17
on unit 5, page 17 on unit 10, page 17 on unit 13, page 17 on unit 16.  For
systems with 3 strings, page 17 on unit 21 and page 17 on unit 24 would also
be missing.  This means that after doing an ASP restore on a 14-pack system,
4 files would lose one page of data each.  If the page wasn't a RIB, there
would be no indication.  Instead of a page of data, the file would have a
page full of zeros that the formatter (PAKCOP) had written and ASP hadn't.

How the problem occurred:

When ASP read from the disk, it would do so by super-mapping a range of 24
pages.  When it got to the end of DSKB0, the request of 24 pages would
encompass the last 16 pages of DSKB0 and the first 6 pages of DSKB1.  Due to
the bug in MAPIO, the first 16 pages in the range would be mapped correctly,
but the 17th would get mapped to the first page on cylinder 808 (which is not
allowed) and the 18th thru 24th would get mapped to pages 0 thru 4 on DSKB1
(instead of 0 thru 5).  The next group of 24 pages would get mapped to pages
6 thru 31 on DSKB1, which means that page 5 of DSKB1 never got read from the
disk.  On restore, the same bug meant that page 5 of DSKB1 never got written
back to the disk.

As mentioned earlier, missing page 5 is no big deal.  However, page 15 (octal
17) was most likely part of someone's file.  No pages were missing from DSKB0,
DSKB3, DSKB6, etc since 3*68680 is evenly divisible by 24.

For 3650 disks formatted in pages (C26, C70, and F58's old disks), the pattern
repeated evry 4 disks.  Disk 4n+0 lost nothing, 4n+1 lost page 17 (octal 21),
4n+2 lost page 11 (octal 13), and 4n+3 lost page 5 (BOOTS again).  Page 13
on DSKB2 was part of [1,4].UFD, losing meant losing 102 files from SYS.

This bug has existed ever since P033 (when TYMCOM-X converted to pages) and
is now fixed.  The DSKCLN bug has also existed for the same period of time.
Since P033 came out in the summer of 1977, these are "ten-year bugs".

It has occured to me that there are at least two kinds of food--one of 
which is strictly a lunch time proposition--that will be next-to-unavailable
at the new site, namely, Dim Sum and Sushi.  Therefore, I propose that we
take the time next week to luncheon at the appropriate, currently convenient
restaurants while we still have the chance.  Any takers?  And what days
sound convenient?  I would like to propose Tuesday and Thursday: Tuesday
because it isn't Monday and Thursday because if they allow us to keep our
chairs and if they move furniture on Friday I don't know what it's going
to really be like...

Referring to ontymes I69768 and I69766 (Mid Dec) about restricting certain
characters, I have the following comments.

I would like to see, in addition to the proposed list, blank and @ should
remain legal, at the very least.  I use those characters myself.  As for
the others, I would like to see how many usernames use them before deciding.

I'm not sure what the status of the proposed change is, but it appears to
be part of the MUD reformat? campaign?  Once Vida completes her research,
I 'd like to have a meeting to discuss.

If we recommend using non-alpha characters, we should have a full complement
to choose from.

You may pass this around to any interested parties.

Bob

Subject: Lunch 

It has occured to me that there are at least two kinds of food--one of 
which is strictly a lunch time proposition--that will be next-to-unavailable
at the new site, namely, Dim Sum and Sushi.  Therefore, I propose that we
take the time next week to luncheon at the appropriate, currently convenient
restaurants while we still have the chance.  Any takers?  And what days
sound convenient?  I would like to propose Tuesday and Thursday: Tuesday
because it isn't Monday and Thursday because if they allow us to keep our
chairs and if they move furniture on Friday I don't know what it's going
to really be like...

I'm interested in the ROM, too, but I'd like to look at what you have first
to make sure before I order one.  $149 seems like alot for a $300 computer,
but it's not worth writting it myself for that.  Oh well.  -Bill

I finally read the manual enough to try Alias's.  Was getting tired of all
those machine!mAcnine!Machine!user strings.  This is just a test.

I've had a lot of inertia to learning specifics about this system until I got
reasonable access to it.

Thanks for your note.  I remember reading Dijkstra's article some years ago.
I've had opportunity to work closely with a dutch programmer.  He and Edsder
both seem to have a knack for getting things said.  He claims it's a national
trait.

This year I've decided to read the Bible thru in roughly chronological order.
I've never done that before and I'm hopeing to get a better sense of the flow
of events, especially from God's perspective.

Our assignment to Thailand is beginning to seem real.  I'm getting excited;
Even though it will probably be more than 18 months before we actually get
there.  In the mean time there is a lot to do.

I've finally got an office (well a desk (with a terminal!) anyway).  What a
relief.  I had been 'floating' with no really adequate place to work for
months.  I read your message several weeks ago but my terminal at home is
too flaky to compose on.

Well more later.   Say hi to Lois for me.  I'll send her a note sometime.

It depends on the mail system being used.  In TUMS, it will ask if you want
to copy the original recipients of the message being replied to.  Some mail
systems assume yes, and some assume no.  I'm not sure what the unix default
mail system does.  -Bill

From: William R. Soley <WRS@B39.Tymnet>

I have not had time to read it in detail, but one thing jumps out at
me having briefly scanned the text and tables: please see table 2.
Notice under interactive circuits that an overloaded (B) 2.4K terrestrial
line is chosen over a normal (A) 56K satellite line.  I believe that
overloaded circuits should be used only when NO other path exists.

I have other questions as well, and would like to have the oppertunity
to examine the document further.  How does everyone else feel about
the case I have stated?

One last question; what about throughput class?  The tables make no
mention of that and we certainly don't want to route ^D class batch
circuits over 2.4 lines under any circumstances.

Thanks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE MESSAGE THAT FOLLOWS THIS ONE...
 
I spoke to Romulo Raffo late last week he passed on the following:
 
1. SWB does not used RAM records to do their accounting. He
   says SWB uses raw accounting records produced by the SUP.
 
2. Romulo and Omar Serang met this week to discuss SUP record changes
   as result of implementation of Numbering Plan. The result of the
   meeting was that additional messages would be produced and Omar is
   updating SUP message documentation to reflect this. 
 
3. No immediate plans are in place to revise RAM records to accomodate
   the Numbering Plan. Romulo feels that eventually this will need to be 
   done. He's not saying how involved that would be, holding off to
   hear from Omar this week on SUP revisions that are definitely part
   of Numbering Plan.
 
I was not able to get in touch with Omar today but will follow-up with
him Monday. I am planning to pass along the information on the new
SUP messages to help you and SWB plan for retrofit with their accounting
programs.
 
Feel free to call me or message me for additional information or 
clarification this issue.

As you will recall, last Thursday we spoke about a few specific questions
I had regarding the Numbering Plan.  You have answered the first two of my
questions, thanks.  I am still waiting to find out if RAM will be affected
by the Numbering Plan and if we have any idea if the impact will be minimal or
extensive.  

This is an important issue right now because of a related project.  Please
let me know as soon as you can.

Yes, I wondered if the root pw was same as one from the demo sun.  No magic.
I had about a 2.5 hour talk with Al the other day, mostly about Sun's and he
feels very strongly that we can't afford to get everyone Suns, but we can
afford NEC-AT's with Xenix and "thin-ethernet".  I was unable to convince him
that Xenix was not satisfactory, but he kept saying "but so-and-so has 900
of them and they really are happy".  He also kept calling me a computer bigot.
Me thinks I'm not the bigot.  I admit that the AT's are probably better for
non-programming managers.  So I think he's the bigot.  -Bill

PS - you guys will just have to demonstrate how high productivity will
go when we have reasonable tools that work.

guess except they decided to use the uP's phase 2 clock as a data
strobe and to keep the dynamic registers in the xcvr alive!  Now I
have to add some glue to get that to work in the V40's hardware 
system.  I don't htink it is a big expensive problem just another
pain in the neck.

I'm going to put the G.I. speech processor in the drawings and I'll
try and get a hold of the exploratorium to find out what kind of
thing thier useing.  Have you talked to Gary about the speech stuff
he knew about?

The "C" compiler is $500 plus $100 for the assembler.  Its very much worth
it.  Of course it comes free with a SUN.  I use Microsoft 4.0 for both.

bill,


i like the "show alias <alias>" command you have in the new version.
too bad there is not a tums on the eunix machines...although
similar stuff exists.

did you get your vme cage fixed yet?  when you do, are you keeping
it at work?  and if so, can other boards be stuck in there
(like a 68020??!!###$%$%@$#%???) or is this a dedicated system?
(never hurts to ask, right? like what they say about cats:

it seems bubbcopy works now to 39 but not to 36?  they put
a new version of unix on to eunix and then steve had
to fix 'tip' or something like that...i tried and 
failed on 36 but it worked on 39.  i can use 39
 and perhaps 36 is even fixed by now...anyway just
thought i would drop you a note in case you are 
involved at all.  if not, disregard this note.

Some of the old programs still existed and caused an incompatibility.  I have

This is too early to be sure, but I think tums is causing the out of
ports problem (actually triggering the problem).  It seems the gateway
doesn't handle all Yellow balls while in login mode.  I have ring
traces of MAIL:1088 trying to login then sending a YB.  unfortunately
I only have the into gateway ISIS ring, I wonder if you have some log
of these logons (tuesday 1/13 from 3pm to 7pm).  The logon failure reason
is of great interest.  That should allow for duplication of this persistent
problem.

The TUMS log shows mostly "host down" responses.  The target 1088 is on
a micro-node (PDP-11) base, so its network protocol may be strange.  In
a couple of cases, the circuit to the gateway was simply zapped with no
message being output.  I hope this helps.  Holler if you need more.  -Bill

  There is no mailer on host D25.  It looks like it never made it, or someone
deliberately removed all current object code files.  There are a total of 29
files in (MAIL), including a set of "<program name>.OLD" files, but (until I
Telecopied in a copy of RDMAIL.SAV) there were NO <program name>.[SAV|HGH|SHR]
files in MAIL.  Since the Job Processor system uses TUMS mail, it is needed on
all the old Tymshare Tymcom-X hosts.  Any questions, please call or TUMS me.

Well, not only is that company still in buisiness, they seem to
be the leading producer of aftermarket M100 software/firmware!

The disk+ rom and disk is $149.  I am trying to decide if I
really want it in ROM bad enough to spring for it.

I probably will, because it will mean that a hard reset will still
leave me with the upload/download software.

I'm interested in the ROM, too, but I'd like to look at what you have first
to make sure before I order one.  $149 seems like alot for a $300 computer,
but it's not worth writting it myself for that.  Oh well.  -Bill

Subject: locks 


the disk manager cannot lock his own lock, right?  won't he have
to for diskclean to run?

we can have a second kind of lock, call it a deadbolt.  it has
2 bits: 1 in the locks address space, and 1 in the global
memory.  if you want the lock, you call a single routine
which gets both.  if you can't get the second one, you
release the first one and try again.  so in the case of the
disk, if we anticipate the disk manager needing to lock
that lock, we need a deadbolt for that process.  of course,
you never try to get the local lock unless you have the global one
first.  they must be done in order or you get a kind of 'deadlock'
(pun). the global lock bit is analogous functionally to
locking the bus.  each place we need a deadbolt for a different
kind of process we need a different bit in the global 
memory.

bill,


as you are aware, we have lost the use of the laser printer link from
the Eunix UNIX system.  this link is also the link that Tums
goes across, between the 10's and the Eunix system.  so,
the problem is this: that we only have 1 link.  not wise if it
includes mail systems.

this is the same problem that we have with the large printer
up front - it only has 1 neighbor.  we sometimes lose the
link, so we lose the use of the printer.

this is the same problem we had in the CMTI unit, when testing
with the Fremont host - we only had 1 line to their front end.

this sounds like a pattern to me.  not good for a networking company.

there ought to be a law of networking that says you can't bring up
a network if there is not at least 2 paths to every resource (joke).
"this is 1987..." we ought to have things more fully connected.

maybe you know all this and bubbnet people know all this...
but at the very least when we make The Move it ought to
be a REQUIREMENT that every resource be doubly connected, at a minimum.
this should be high on the priorities for the The Move.

Never heard of her.  I haven't seen any ads either.  I would tell your friend
to make sure she has licensed physician backup on call at all times.  Most of
the midwives that are C.N.M.s do have physician backup.  Most of the lay
midwives are "underground", which makes it much harder for them to work with
establishment physicians. 

I personally wouldn't go to any midwife that didn't have physician backup.

Another thing for her to consider is that if she contracts with a midwife for
delivery, she will usually have to pay both the midwife, the hospital and
the physicians if things end up in the hospital.  She should check with her
insurance company to see if they are willing to pay for all of that.

I think she should try calling some of the C.N.M.s that advertise in the
area for references on Veronica.  Some names are Robin Liang, Kate Bowland.

The FCC is considering reregulating the packet-switching networks like Telenet,
Tymnet, Compuserve, The Source and PC Pursuit.	This could result in additional
costs to the user.  This is excerpted from Infomat magazine which is available
for downloading.


 ====================================
 COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE NEWS -- PART 1
 ====================================

 by Tim Elmer

 ------------------------------------
 FREE LOCAL ACCESS TO PACKET
 SWITCHING NETWORKS MAY BE ELIMINATED
 ------------------------------------

 (BPS) -- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on a proposal
to reregulate packet switching networks that, if approved, would eliminate
free local telephone access to those networks.

 "If this occurs, it might eventually double or triple the costs to those
using packet switching networks to access commercial on-line databases and
information services and triple or quadruple the costs to those using
Telenet's PC Pursuit," said Philip M. Walker, vice president and regulatory
counsel for Telenet Communications Corp.

 Predictably, the initiative to reregulate packet switching networks comes
primarily from the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) and secondarily from AT&T.
These companies provide local telephone service to vast majority of telephone
customers throughout the U.S. and will benefit the most from FCC reregulation
of the packet switching networks.

 Under current FCC rules formulated in 1980 in the FCC's Second Computer
Inquiry, called Computer II, a distinction is made between "basic services"
and "enhanced services."

 "Basic services" are those that don't offer protocol conversion such as local
and long-distance voice telephone services.  "Enhanced services" are defined
in an open-ended fashion as computer-based services that are more than a
"basic service," in other words, services such as packet switching networks,
database and on-line type services, and remote computing services that offer
protocol conversion, according to Walker.

 Under the 1980 Computer II Inquiry, the FCC ruled that "basic services" would
continue to be regulated as they had always been.  However, the FCC also ruled
that "enhanced services" would be deregulated, which opened up the industry to
competition.  This resulted in numerous companies entering the packet
switching business, including BOCs, AT&T and at least a dozen others.  The
competition resulted in significant price reductions for packet switching
services.

 To prevent monopolization of the packet switching industry by the Big Boys
(the BOCs and AT&T), the FCC ruled that they had to keep separate accounting
figures for their "basic services" and for their "enhanced services," and that
they could not use revenues from their lucrative "basic services" to cross-
subsidize their "enhanced service" packet switching networks.

 The FCC also ruled that if the BOCs and AT&T used their "basic service"
telephone lines for packet switching services, then they must let their
competitors have access to those lines on the same basis, which would preserve
true competition in the industry.

 "Now, under the FCC's Computer Inquiry III, the FCC is asking, should we
redefine protocol conversion services as 'basic services' rather than enhanced
services?  Should we redefine all those companies as common carriers?  This
would, in effect, subject them not only to federal regulations but, even
worse, to state regulations," Walker said.

 The result would eliminate comparable interconnection requirements currently
imposed on BOCs and AT&T, allowing them to charge their packet switching
competitors local dial-in fees to access packet switching long-distance line
networks.

 It would also allow BOCs and AT&T to offer their own packet switching
services on a non-compensatory basis and, finally, allow them to cross-
subsidize those services with revenues from their much more lucrative voice
telephone service revenues.  In short, it would allow BOCs and AT&T to
monopolize the packet switching industry and probably drive out most
competitors.

 "In terms of cost impact," Walker said, "if we had to pay local access
charges, it would cost us about $3.60 an hour at the originating end, for
calls made by users to on-line databases and information services like
CompuServe and The Source.

 "And with PC Pursuit, for which we have out-dial modems, we would have to pay
not only 3.60 per hour access fees at the originating end but also $4.80 at
the terminating end, a total of about $8 or $9.  Obviously, to survive, we
would have to add those additional charges to our current fees and pass them
on to our consumers," Walker said.

 That would almost certainly spell the end of PC Pursuit, and it would likely
put out of business not only many independent packet switching networks but
also many on-line databases and information services.

 FCC approval of changes being considered in Computer III, Walker said, "would
really have a major impact on anyone using a packet switching service to
access online bulletin boards, databases, or information services aimed at the
residential user.  They are just going to get creamed if this happens."

 Walker said that is was not clear exactly when the FCC would vote on the
proposal, but that it would probably be the latter part of January or early
part of February, 1987.  "They are moving very fast on this," he said.

 "Low-Cost packet switching Service Threatened"

 by Alan R. Bechtold

 As described in our lead news story this issue, the FCC is now considering a
major change in the way packet switched phone services are defined.  This
change is likely to lead to the demise of many of these services, and to much
higher prices for the use of the few that will eventually remain in business.

 At the risk of over-simplification, I think I should first describe just what
a packet switched networking service is.  These are the services you use to
access online databases and commercial online services, such as CompuServe and
The Source, with just a local telephone call.  Once you call the local Telenet
or Tymnet number, for example, and a connection is made, you are then
connected with a computer that puts you in communication with the online
services with which you wish to communicate.

 This computer is handling a number of calls into the main system computer at
the same time.	It takes information you send and delivers it in "packets" to
the proper destination, picks up information from the online service computer
you called, and sends it, also in "packets," back to you.  All of this
communicating is done in these so-called "packets" because this allows the
network's computers to offer protocol conversion and handle several ongoing
communications sessions at the same time.

 FCC regulations allow AT&T and Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to engage in
packet switching network operations, but they must also maintain completely
separate accounting of their voice and packet switching operations.  They must
also offer free local-calling access to their lines to any competitors engaged
in the packet switching service industry.

 The above regulations have allowed Telenet and Tymnet, among others, to
operate at a reasonable cost in a competitive atmosphere.  This is a case of
regulation of a business actually RESULTING in increased competition and lower
prices to consumers.

 As things stand now, you can call any local Telenet or Tymnet access number
and use these services to inexpensively access such online services as
CompuServe, The Source, Delphi, and countless others.  In addition, GTE's new
PC PURSUIT service now offers you access, through their Telenet packet
switching service, to literally hundreds of local bulletin boards in cities
all across the country--for a flat charge of $25 per month.

 But, the FCC is now being asked to REREGULATE this segment of the
communications industry, eliminating the FCC requirements that AT&T and BOCs
keep separate accounting records of their voice and packet switching services,
and eliminating the stipulation that the BOCs and AT&T must offer their
competitors in the packet switching business free access to their local
telephone connection lines.

 The idea is patently ridiculous.

 Mark Fowler, Chairman of the FCC, has been hailed by the press as a "fair-
market zealot."  The chances are very good that he views this proposed
reregulation as the magic road to increased competition and fairer pricing for
consumers.

 Unofficially, the word is out that the FCC advisory committee now considering
this matter is indeed leaning in favor of the proposed reregulation of the
packet switching industry.  If the committee recommends these changes, it's
likely that a majority of the five voting members on the Federal
Communications Commission will vote in favor of the changes.

 I have talked to sources within the industry who say it is the BOCs who are
pushing VERY HARD for this reregulation, because they want to get into the
packet switching service business in a big way, and they would like to rid
themselves of needless competition on their way to success.

 What's that?  RID themselves of competition?  But--the proposed reregulation
is supposed to FOSTER competition!  Why would a group of companies (BOCs)
hoping to eliminate their competition PUSH for this reregulation?  I hope the
answer to THAT question is entirely clear.

 Here we have an industry that is currently populated with plenty of
competition.  Prices are already reasonable.  Reregulation of the packet
switching service industry will IMMEDIATELY give giant corporations the upper
hand, and will allow them to cut off free access to their local access phone
lines to their competitors, namely Telenet and Tymnet and other similar
services that now offer you high-quality service, in a competitive
marketplace, at reasonable prices.

 The proposed reregulation, however, would force all packet switching services
to compete with the BOCs and AT&T, companies that would be able to use the
enormous profits they earn with their voice telephone services to cross-
subsidize their packet switching services and offer them on a non-compensatory
basis, at least until their competitors are eliminated.  When that happens,
they are then sure to jack up their fees to any level they want.

 It would also force their packet switching competitors to pay access fees for
connection to local phone lines.  The access fees alone could add as much as
$4.00 per hour to the fees packet switching companies would be forced to pass
on to their customers.	This will be added to your hourly connect-time charges
for accessing ALL online databases through these services.

 The proposed reregulation could very well spell the death of PC PURSUIT.
Because GTE also uses dial-out modems at the other end of their Telenet
connections for PC PURSUIT service, the company would be forced to pay an
hourly charge at BOTH ends of the phone line--totaling up to $8 or $9 per
hour.  These fees would have to be added to the flat $25 per month that GTE
now charges for access to PC-PURSUIT.  It would simply make the final cost to
PC-PURSUIT customers too high for the service to remain practical and
affordable.

 So--this is ONE TIME you MUST use your word processor to produce some letters
opposing this proposed reregulation!  Write to:

 Honorable Mark Fowler
 Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
 Washington D.C. 20554

 Refer to Computer Inquiry III in your letters.  State clearly, in your own
words, that competitive packet switching services should not be reregulated or
subjected to carrier access charges, and then explain why not.	Tell Mr.
Fowler that reregulation of packet switching services will completely destroy
the existing fair market for these services, and eventually increase costs,
not DECREASE them.

 And hurry!  I have heard this matter will be going before the FCC for a vote
in the latter part of January or early part of February.  Time is running out.

If you are reading this message on a computer system (and you probably
are), then the following article is directly and immediately relevant
to you.  Although this happened sometime last fall, I had not seen or
heard anything about it until this article.

The article is from "Information Today", a newspaper for users and
producers of electronic information services.  I find it to be one of
the most frightening things I have read since Nixon's Senate Bill 1
back in the 70's.

I strongly urge all of you to write to your senators, congressmen, and
whomever else you think might be appropriate.  I believe that the subject
covered here strikes at the absolute essence of our freedoms.


-------------- From "Information Today", January, 1987 ---------------

Headline: IIA Opposes Restrictions on Unclassified Databases.

The Board of Directors of the Information Industry Association (IIA)
has issued a statement opposing efforts by the Department of Defense
and the National Security Council to restrict public access to
unclassified information and to establish a monitoring system for
watching citizens who use commercial electronic databases.

At the IIA's annual meeting in November 1986, a senior Department of
Defense official said that the Department is reviewing recommendations
regarding  restrictions on access to such databases that contain
"sensitive but unclassified" information.  In a letter to Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger, the Association has called for withdrawal of
the new security classification for "sensitive but unclassified
information" and asked the Defense Secretary to make public the
concerns that prompted the new classification.

According to an IIA press release in December, the Department of
Commerce recently attempted to obtain from private information
companies the names and addresses of all citizens who use an
unclassified database.  The release also stated the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has "secretly established a
'no-no' list containing the names of private companies - both American
companies and U.S. allies -  who are to be denied subscriptions to
unclassified NASA information merely because they have foreign
customers."

NASA's "no-no" list of organizations not provided with subscriptions to
NASA Tech Briefs, technical support packages, or other documentation is
said to include British Aerospace, Find/SVP, Info/Doc, Information on
Demand, United Book Services, University Microfilms International, and
Washington Bibliographic Service, among others.

In addition, the IIA reported that representatives from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
have been visiting private U.S. information companies to ask questions
about who is using their unclassified information.

IIA Board Chairman Carl Valenti, vice president for information
services at Dow Jones & Company, stated: "These actions appear to be in
response to concerns that the Soviet Bloc is getting information they
shouldn't have.  But we can't be sure.  The defense community has
refused to discuss the reasons for its concerns or provide the public
with specific examples.

"All we have been told," Valenti continued, "is that this issue is
discussed in a secret Air Force report.  Our industry strongly supports
efforts to protect national security.  But these government actions are
not directed at controlling classified national security information.
Instead, they are directed at controlling unclassified information that
has always been available - information you can get by going to any
public library.  It also appears to some of our members that the
government is attempting to achieve its objectives through intimidation
and coercion, apparently hoping that private information companies will
voluntarily restrict access to their information or police who uses
it."

The IIA represents 460 leading information companies and claims, on
their behalf, that restricting the right to create and distribute
unclassified information will severely hinder their ability to do
business and will contribute to "the further decline of the U.S.
balance of trade."  The IIA maintains that any attempt to deny citizens
the right to acquire information will have "a chilling effect upon
those who use information and will retard U.S. technological growth."

Paul Zurkowski, IIA president, noted: "The strength of America's
democracy is its systems of checks and balances.  Through that system
we have spent more than 200 years establishing a balance between the
preservation of individual liberties and protection of national
security."

"There is now a grave danger." Zurkowski asserted, " that certain
elements within the defense community may upset this balance by
carving away the First Amendment in the dark of night.  If these
activities go unchecked, we may have to show our passports at the
library door.  I echo the statement of Secretary of State George
Schultz, who stated earlier this year that 'the information revolution
promises to change the routine of our planet as decisively as did the
industrial revolution of the last century.  Our policies must always be
based on the fundamental process of freedom - freedom of thought,
freedom of research, and the free flow of ideas.'"

The official IIA position paper sent to Secretary of Defense Weinberger
stated in part: "United States policy should continue to foster openness
and the unimpeded flow of information.  Restrictions on the right of
citizens to create, acquire, use, and disseminate information should be
the absolute minimum necessary to protect national security.

"National security is best protected by using the long existing
classification system to ensure that government information vital to
national security is not released to the public.  The concept of
'sensitive but unclassified' information provides an unchecked hunting
license for government officials to deny citizens access to information
and must be rejected.

"The security classification system should not be used to unnecessarily
restrict public access to government information; the decision to
classify information should weigh national security interests against
the right of the public to acquire information.

"Classification of information for national security purposes should
not be based on the media in which the information is available.
Information which is unclassified and available to the general public,
such as in print through a library, must not be restricted or
classified when it enters an electronic database."

--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an earlier article in misc.legal that mentions that there
is a hearing coming *soon* on this subject.

If you are a citizen of the United States and you think that the
Bill of Rights is something more than a piece of scrap paper on
display in Washington, D.C., I urge you to contact your senators
and congressmen and say "ENOUGH!".

bill,


i want to get whatever PC programs you have that are sharable.
i am liberal on that point (sharable...).  would like
an HP terminal emulator, but vt1xx is fine.

do you have any source code for a terminal emulator? i have a couple
of things i want to change and need source code.

do you have an 808x disassembler? do you have 808x assemblers,
linkers,etc?  do you have  a C compiler?

thanks,

Bill,
      I need to communicate with some folks on BITNET.  Apparently I can get
an account on a 4381 in Arlington running VM/CMS which participates in BITNET
but it's certainly not an ideal solution.  Is there any sort of gateway to
BITNET that you know of or is this truely a case of "You can't get there from

Subject: DOUBLE TRANSIT FIELD 

Dave,

The interpretation of two transit field RPOA entries is fairly clear,
however I'm not sure we intended to support it on this first pass.  It
does not seem to be a part of either phase 1 or 2 SWB, yet we should
design with the intent of supporting multiple transit field entries in
the future.

Perhaps we should discuss this among the Sup unit to come to a clearer
understanding.

Subject: Tums and Ontyme 

Bill,

Something occurred to me recently which may help provide more efficient
Tums service.  If Tums is logging into each Ontyme username , retrieving
messages, and logging out, it could be much faster if it used the Ontyme 
'imi' command to 'imitate' a user.  This way there would be a single
logon per Tums retrieval session.  Tums would need access to a username 
with account supervisor status, but I doubt if that's a problem.

If Tums already works this way, just ignore this message.

Always trying to think of better ways...

Elliot

bill,


now i see why you asked your question - there is a sky_save directory
from your home directory, and there is also a sky_save
file on the sky directory.  i don't know what the file
is, it must have been created during my rather bungling attempts
to copy the sky directory.  so i have delteed the sky_save
file.  

do not delete the sky_save directory.

I'm not sure off the top of my head how to get to BITNET, but I know
they have an internet (Arpanet) gateway.  You can go through SUN to
get to ARPANET as follows:
	smu!convex!sun!user%domain

I do remember seeing an article in CACM that mentioned a gateway into BITNET.
I will see if I can find it, meanwhile, you might ask your contact in the
BITNET land if they know how to access from The Arpa Internet and then stick
whatever they say in place of user%domain in the above address.  Don't forget
to change the "@" to an "%" or it'll never get past your mail system.

More later.

That's a symbolic link.  The file really doesn't exist in my directory,
its merely a pointer to the real file.  I'll explain the difference between

No, LS has no comment capability - alas, Unix can't do everything, yet.

I think from your perspective, this would work out as

The only thing I'm not sure about is if sun handles the
two "%" properly.  If not, I can set it up here so you can
send through us.  Might also try just
	...convex!sun!user%address.bitnet
Maybe sun is smart about these things.

the fefs.h file has the Home struct defining a pointer to
the 'bad page list', perhaps this is what they meant.  the
Home structure actually has some kind of list of bad pages
within it.  by the way, what if this list fills up?
do we chain off of the home page? in which case, each chain has the
same header? another way to do this is for the Home page
to point to a file, and the file is the list of bad pages,
and the file can be of any length.  Then the Home page
is kept clean, and easier to manipulate.

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

Bill

After looking at code, I am puzzled why this feature is not present.
I think I need to further research PVC circuits, but for right now it
looks to Paul and myself like an oversight, as you suggested.  I will
let you know more as I do.  I am not sure when it will be available, if
we need to add it but will also try and determine that.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

Wayne, Bill,
  As long as it is in the afternoon, I should be able to make any date that
is convenient for the two of you (prior to 22-Mar, as I will be away for a
second 1-week vacation to Yosemite if funds hold out).

        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
.    
        The PATCH FILE, (SOURCE)TII05.P10, contains the following changes: 
.    
        (1)  Patch to fix HDLC micro-engine SIO line initialization
                problem has been revised.  SIO lines which fail to   
                complete initialization within 20 ms. are flagged    
                for another initialization attempt 2 secs. later.    
                Crypto message 72: SIO PORT UNAVAILABLE - LINE= line#,    
                is issued after the first attempt only.    
.    
             Additionally, this patch no longer treats TSI machines
                as HDLC micros.  Rather, TSI machines are treated as 
                regular engines except that 20 ms. are allowed for   
                initialization to complete. 
.    
             This patch does not affect regular engines. 
.    
        (2)  Patch to display 5-digit neighbors has been cosmetically   
                altered for patch file consistency.  However,   
                functionality remains unchanged. 
.    
        (3)  Patch to fix reset problems on multi-line links has been   
                corrected.   
.    
        (4)  Patch to allow version 5.10 nodes to handle Rebuild from   
                future version 6.00 neighbors has been added.   
        ================================================================   
     
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        It is now available on c36 and c39 and will be available on   
        systems 22, 23, 25, 26, 31, 33, 37, 54, 57, 65, & 70
        within 24 hours of release by Marketing Q.A. to that system.  
     
        Testing  should  be coordinated with  JIM LADEN

Subject: TUMS-10 bug report (v44000017 of 18-DEC-86) 

Bill,
I seem to be having some problems with tums.  I opened an archive file
to try to clean out unwanted messages.  Everyother message was just "To:"
and nothing else.  After issuing several "del noarc ..."  I did an
"expunge" .  The result was it started to expunge many of the messages
then came up with an error message and exited tums.  I had a file of 
over 400 messages of which 200 were blanks.  I had gone through approximately
the first 250 probably deleting about 230 of those.  When I looked at
what the exit left me there was only about 5 messages on the archive file
and the same on the tix.

This is one way of cleaning up my old archive files but not exactly what I
had in mind.

Let me know if I followed a bad procedure or whatever.

Thank you,
Diana

 P.S. I just remembered one other thing - in the middle of issuing the
"del noarc ..." commands I , by mistake issued a "del.. " command then
followed it with a "del noarc..." command with the same message numbers
because I relized my error - could this foul things up?

I called the CHP today on the old number and got a new number for
dispatch.  We really need to get it in the next up date to the
speed call tables.  911 can't deal with getting to a chp dispatcher
on the other side of the bay.  I think if they called it into the 
local dispatcher it would get there but they don't have any 
instructions on how to do that...

Anyway, the new number is 408-436-0572.

bill,


several people ask questions about vme addressing - local
versus off-board accesses, etc (e.g. Kopf asked in the
meeting, so hvae others).  we should have a clear explanation
in the document about this.  could you do that? i haveso much else to type in
and you udnerstand this part better thanb me.  i made
a section header at the start of the
addressing.mm file called "VME Addressing Versus Local Addressing"/.
do you think you could fill it in?  if not, let me know and
i will.




thanks,

bill,


in file init.c routine updateInventory there are 2 instances of
the sequence ||= and i think it should be sequence |= so
i changed them.

in routine  checkAdr don we need to sysfail(TRUE) before
we do vmeEnable(FALSE)? i changed the order and added
something to alert the other cards that an address error
was found.  this had come up during the walkthrough.

Subject: kernal host numbers 




how will they work in skywalker? will we have 1 per node or
1 per isis? we don't have an individual tym file for each
isis any more; we could assign the kernal host number in
the global tym file.  we did not mention it.  what is its
function? i guess we have to have it to be able to log
into the slot debugger on each board.  maybe there is
a better way? i always hated having a node and kernal
host number that were different; they are sometimes the
same but usually different.  maybe we could chuck the
kernal host number completely? node number is
what structures the network.

what do you think?

Regarding Updates to the NSR Database, Bubbnet Support has the following needs: 
     
     
PROCEDURE 1. - Updating an NSR by the release of new code   
---------------------------------------------------------   
   If a particular NSR is addressed by code changes, include the NSR number
   in the newly released X file (which should be released with the new code).   
   Include the NSR number(s) in the section under "Brief Summary of Changes".   
     
   When the X file is released to either Baseline or Betatest, the associated   
   NSR's listed therein, will also be updated.  If the NSR is not listed in
   the X file, then procedure two should be followed.  
     
     
PROCEDURE 2. - Updating an NSR after noting an error in the monthly NSR report  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
   NTD managers receive a monthly NSR status report, listing NSR's by product.  
   Discrepancies may be noted directly on the monthly NSR report.  In order to  
   update an NSR, the following information MUST be provided for each NSR; 
     
   NSR Number. 
   Manager's Name.  
   Developer's Name.
   Correct Status Code.                (or detailed explanation of new status)  
   Indicate "Patch" or "New Release".  (if applicable) 
   Indicate "Beta", "Source" or "QA".  (if applicable) 
   Date of Release.                    (if Beta or Source or QA release)   
   Development Estimate.               (if applicable) 
   Version of code that addresses this NSR.  
   Other versions of code effected.
     
     
     
Your compliance on this policy/procedure is appreciated.    
Thank you, Sheldon Cohen  x6910

shouldn the ipcf chapter be included in the opsys chapter?
it is mentioned inthe 4 bullets that start the opsys chapter.
it is an opsys thing.  it is rodney, more or less.

i am going to move the pseudo code to its own chapter
like the group wanted, and to rearrange the prose in
to the same order as dicks intro.

see you

did not receive a reply regarding the idea to remove the
page page pointers from the home page, and to instead have
a file to store these in, to simplify the home page.  what do you
think?  raswon also mentions this in his 1st review memo, it is
his point on the second page for section 4.3.1.

I think we need to keep kernel host numbers, but there need only be
one for all ISIS's in a cage since the slot number will be enough to
route on after that.  Its not clear, but that's how I envision it.  Its
really an ISIS issue, though, probably no need to mention it in the
document.  The HOSTNAMES project will allow you to log in as
	username:%node
and it will give you the kernel host for that node, based on product ID.

The bad page list is expandable if you link on more pages to the home
page through NEXT.  It should, however, be moved to the volume label since
that's really global to the unit, rather than volume specific.  -Bill

Microsoft "CodeView" comes with Microsoft "C Compiler 4.0".  Both are very
good.  You'll also want the assembler - same version - which comes with
a line oriented debugger that allows patching which for some reason, code
view does not.  -Bill

we considered short, for alignment, but couldn't see that it
needed the length.  dave thought boolean was ok, since we might
only need 1 bit, but a field is more general so we can
in the future say what kind of moron it is; perhaps it will
have some capabilities, and not others, and so forth.

but change it if you like.  its just pseudo code.

get well...

and thanks for the antihistamine reference...i read the whole thing
this morning.  the one i am taking has the lease CNS effects,
or least cardiologically, which is what my cardiologist had said.

that was a lot of information.  where did you get it?  you down loaded
it from some medical information utility through tymnet?  i would
be interested in seeing other information, specifically on
heart medicines (digitalis, quinidine, and inderol {another
name is propanolol, spelling it wrong i think}) or beta-blockers
in general.  beta-blockers are what can change certain kinds
of cardiac arrhythmias, and i was on one for ahwile.  but i
had a rather unpleasant episode while on the drug, and
so i tapered myself off of it and felt much better.
and switched doctors, and he agreed with what i did.
i was on inderol.  supposedly one of the better ones.
i had an atrial fibrillation, for 5 hours.  fibrillation
is not good...anyway, i am still around.  but if you
can get similar information i would be very interested
in learning more about the contraindications for various
heart medicinies for arrhythmia control.

by the way, atrial fibrillation isnot fatal, as long
as it does not degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.
unfortunately, in my case, there is this stupid little
pathway the doc found that could do just that; and 
so i have to avoid the drug digoxin like the plague,
it would trigger that pathway.  this stuff gets
complicated.

so, see you monday.  take care of the cold.

feldman told me that there is another mail facility called mh
that exists; we have no manual entry for it; and that it is
very good if you have a lot of messages to archive.  that
sounds like what you described...but when i try it i get
(on both eunix and minimac) the line

/usr/local/mh: Permission denied.

what does that mean? i told steve, perhaps he will fix me up.
but you know, i bug him a lot.  maybe i should mail him less.

by the way, he has set me up an account on the sun.  i told him
i might come in on the weekend to play around.  so you
can use my logon if you want to.  i haven' tried it yet...
perhaps you already have an account on the sun? have
you ever used one?  tell me if you want passw info.

i have a large subdirectory on my main
directory called 'sky' on tymix...i don't recall
creating it, so i think that now that i am using
my own username, the 'backupfiles' thing you made
created it.  i guess dave will have the same.  can
anyone of use update to your directory on tymix?
or should we create the directories with links?

i guess its mooot since we are splitting up now into
different groups anyway.

skwyalker is off and running.  all major projects should
be software driven, not hardware driven.  what a chauvinist i am.

in isis there was a problem where the mac registers degenerated
over time...a problem with memory retention...so isis had
to explicitly refresh them every few days for something...
might we ever have that problem in skywalker? if we are
keeping GLOB and so forth, over an extended period of time,
perhaps it might degenerate?

i have no idea.

I got the stuff from Dialog (Palo Alto), yes, via Tymnet.  The volume of
stuff that would likely come out of such a general search on heart med
would be more than reasonably readable.  We can get together sometime and
try to narrow it down somewhat.  The service costs $35 an hour, regardless
of how much data you transfer, so I use aux circuits to get the most data
for the dollar.  It usually works out very reasonable.  Remind me when I'm
feeling better.  -Bill

In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 27 Feb 87 14:53:12 EST

Hi, Jim.  I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to access AUXIO on
system 35.  Its protected ALL RD RUN which should allow execution from
any account.  The command should be
	R (SPL)AUXIO
If you are still unable to get it to work, please let me know exactly
what command you issue and what the error message is.

I checked the MUD to make sure the access profile is setup properly to
allow circuits from host 35 to 7045 and 7047.  In fact it is for DIST124A.
If you are trying to build the circuits with another user name, then you
must make sure the desired destinations appear in its profile.  The current
access profile for DIST124A looks like this:

user: DIST124A

It all comes down to which environment is easier to debug in.  If you
do it under Unix, you'll be using a different compiler than the one for
Skywalker, and that's a risk...after all, not even the same instruction
set.  Also all the MMU and I/O devices would be a lot of work to simulate.
Its not clear it would buy us any time.  -Bill

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has had some minor changes made to it in chapter 4, section
4.1.2 (New Message Format Philosophy).  Bit 3 of the SMO type HW will
definitively be used for one's complement representation of the following
SMO data.  The pad byte used to enforce HW alignment of type C SMOs will
be 'FF' by convention and ASCII characters will be represented with the
HO bit of the character set, also in the type C SMOs.  A new copy of the
document may be pulled from (DNDSPEC)LG2GED.DOC.

Thanks...Omar

I'm sure we can work somethsng out.  I'll have to find out where the

Well, KJ is kilo-joules.  A joule is one watt per second, so 720 KJ is
equivalent to 200 watt-hours.  Since she did it in half an hour, thats
an average power disipation of 400 watts.  This is alot of power in the
human sense, but only $0.02 in the PG&E sense.  I suspect that you want
the calories in the food sense (which are actually kilo-calories or
kilo-gram-calories, that is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of 1 kilo-gram of water 1 degree celisus at 1 atmosphere).
Watt-hours convert to kilo-calories by multiplying by 0.8605 leaving
172.10 k-calories burned.  I hope she's not too depressed by this.

Since you mentioned 100 watts, half an hour, and 720 kilo-joules all at
the same time, I am led to wonder what happened.  It would seem somebody
multiplied by two when they should have divided by two.  If the 100 watt
figure is correct, over 30 minutes, that would be 50 watt-hours or 180 KJ
or 43.03 kilo-calories.  Thats even more depressing so I won't mention
it.

You may find the "units" program on eunix very helpful.  Do "man units".

I think that restricting to supervisor references is a bad idea.  That
will mean that things like the dispatcher will have to run in sup mode.
I think its the MMU's responsibility to restrict access.  Only the
supervisor should be able to setup the MMU.  -Bill

Subject: TUMS-10 bug report (v44000017 of 18-DEC-86) 

Bill - There is a problem that is rapidly becomming a common complaint
around here:  extra ^Ds appearing in message files--mostly archive, but
even in some TUMS.MSG files.  And it seems that when people attempt to
delete the index file and then have it recreated, extra ^Ds are added.
The result is, the first time a problem occurs--such as difficulty reading
something and the user is thrown into what appears to be a compiler--he
gets out of TUMS, deletes the offending index file and runs TUMS again.

This time, the index shows an extra message in between each real message.
So, the average user gets fed up and deletes the entire message file and
the more persistent one tries deleting the index file again.  The more
persistent user then finds TWO extra messages per real one.  and on, and on...

I, too, have experienced this (as one of the more persistent users) and not
yet found a cure.  As I understood that someone else in my office was sending
you a note to that effect (asked me how to do so), I didn't do so myself.
However, as the person most familiar with TUMS in this office, I not only
get called upon to acquaint new/unaccomstomed users with this particular
tool, I also get brow-beaten whenever there is a problem--or even delay.
I therefore appeal to you on the grounds of humanity--do you have any 
explanation of what is happening and/or any feel for whether it is reasonably
correctable or too much of a pain to waste the time or what...?

Most sincerely,
Dianne Heins

ln -s real-name virtual-name
This makes a symbolic link which behaves different from a physical link or

Subject: editors and Tymnet? 

I just remembered why tymnet customers had such heart burn
over tymnet's echoing.  What do you do on your consat at
home? Do you echo everything back from Cromix, or selectively
network echo or what?

We just signed up to have our host echo everything.  It seems
to me that that is going to create a big delay between the time
we type something and the time it shows up on the screen.  The
alternative is probably worse though ( haveing all those <esc>
f emacs commands echo back <esc> f to the terminal.

The interface is X.25, and I don't think there is a way to
turn off and on host echo by the host (and I don't know
that I want to invest the time in fixing up all the applications
to do the right thing anyway).  What do you do about ^S and ^Q
for emacs?  I can set up the PAD to use hardware flow control
but if I don't login with ^X ^R will tymnet pass them through?

If you want to log in with ^X^R or not is dependent on what flow control is
required between your terminal and the network.  ^X^R have effect only on the
consat they are issued to.  If you do not do ^R, you can use ^S and ^Q to
send EMACS commands without any funny stuff.  However, if you do use ^R since
you might have a terminal emulator that needs to backpresure, or whatever,
you can still use ^S and ^Q, except that you must follow this rule:
	(assuming neither you or your terminal have sent ^S)
	type ^S^S^Q to send a ^S to the editor
	type ^Q to send a ^Q to the editor
In the first sequence, ^S^S^Q, this is what happens:
The first ^S backpresures the CONSAT, the second ^S is sent to the host, the
^Q releases the backpresure.  To put it another way, ^S is only interpreted
by the CONSAT when backpresure is off - thus turning it on.  Likewise, ^Q is
only interprested by the CONSAT when backpresure is on - thus turning it off.
Otherwise, the character is passed to the host.

Our PEAK knows about all this, and saves the state of the CONSAT ^R option
upon entry and turns it off so there is no need to do ^S^S^Q.  It then
restores it when you exit the editor.  This could cause problems with a
terminal that can't keep up with the cursor commands, but that has never
happened.  Your UNIX system won't know about this, though, so it all is a
matter of how you logged in (with ^R or not).

Sensitive Intelligence Document Published On Magazine Cover

By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

c. 1987 N.Y. Times News Service

    WASHINGTON - A picture on the cover of the current issue of The Foreign 
Service Journal shows a readable copy of one of the government's most sensitive
intelligence documents, according to government officials.  The Foreign Service
Journal, published for members of the Foreign Service, is generally available 
to the public and has a circulation of 10,000.  The document, a copy of the 
National Intelligence Daily, which is produced by the Central Intelligence 
Agency in traceable, numbered copies exclusively for the president and a small 
circle of others with top-secret clearance, was photographed on the desk of 
Ronald I. Spiers, the Under Secretary of State for Management. Spiers was the 
subject of the article referred to on the magazine's cover.  The CIA 
intelligence summary, which reports the latest intelligence evaluations by the 
agency, was open to two pages, apparently about the situation in Lebanan.

    A map of Lebanon was partly blocked by Spiers' left hand. He had some 
hand-written notes partly shielding the print on the facing page, but clearly 
visible at the bottom of the page was the number 121.  Some text as well as 
codes, also at the bottom of the page, were not legible with normal magnifying 
equipment, but a Congressional aide with a background in intelligence said, 
''Based on my time in the business, this is the kind of thing you could blow up
and clarify what the final thing is with not even very sophisticated 
equipment.''  The aide continued, ''This is a major breach of security.''  An 
aide to Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ''Anybody else in the government who 
did this would have been fired if this had happened to them.''  [...]

Subject: central memory 



just to forewarn you guys, kopf is planning to have a piece of
central memory in his dispatcher design.  he wants to have 
every dispatcher contend for every i and o ring in the cage.
in the rodney doc section on dispatcher, bill mentioned
that one drawback of a single dispatcher is that it must
monitor all slots...kopf feels that this is a good
design because the board that is not busy is the one
whose dispatcher has time to go off board and help tohers
out; in other words, he wants to do load-levelling on
the dispatcher level.

we sort of feel that a dispatcher should service all the
rings on the card it is running on, and contend only for
I rings on other cards when it has a message that goes
off card.  but it is not our charter to design the
dispathcer, only its interface to the isis kernel.

anyway, be forewarned.

     SUBJECT: Error in Comments About IOC Addressing
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Earlier today I sent you a note that claimed that base+2000x
     was  not  in  valid  memory  space  on  the  IOC.   This  is
     incorrect.  For some reason I read 2000 as 20000.   I  still
     think  that  the  RODNEY document should specify this offset
     now to permit continued design.

Sorry, I answered the mail as I read it, and hadn't gotten to your
retraction, yet.  I'm glad it is okay.  We will be sure to state it
clearly in the Rodney GED (in progress).

Dear Mr. Soley,

I have been informed by my manager, Harriet Bailey, and by Dianne Heins 
that I could request that you place me on the TUMS/ONTYME polling list.

I understand that to do so, you need the following information:

1.  ONTYME ADDRESS:  pmts.l/wadsworth (that is on emspmts)

2.  ONTYME PASSWORD: "one star"

3.  TUMS ADDRESS:  lwadsworth@d65.tymnet
`
If you need any additional information, please advise me .  Thanking you
for you assistance in this matter, I remain

Sincerely,
Jerri (Louise) Wadsworth

Possibly - 

   Several people have mentioned to me that they have requested to be put
on the TUMS/ONTYME polling list and have either not heard back or have
simply found that it appears to not be implementing properly.

   Among these people are goksela:65 and lwadsworth:65.  Is there a problem
or have they not notified the appropriate person?  

   Thanks muchly - Dianne

Sorry for the delay.  You message got burried for a while.  You can use the
/INDICATOR:string switch in FIND (may be shortened to /I:string) to set any
indicator you like.  It defaults to ~~ if its a non-HP terminal.  Its too
bad about Tymcomm - at least it should ignore that sequence if it isn't
going to do something reasonable with it.  *SIGH*  The problem with selling
software to the masses (IBM-PC and clones) is that you make so much money
on quantity that you have no incentive for quality - this is compounded by
the fact that 98% of all users of PC's outside the Valley wouldn't know the
difference between quality and garbage.  The success of dBase-III is strong
evidence of this.  Another example is the fact that no spread sheet program
for the PC's has yet to implement a dependency graph to cut down on the
recalculation time.  They all recalculate ALL cells whenever a change is
made to ANY cell!  They'd rather you buy a 386 machine and throw away your
8088 so it can recalculate faster.  *ARGH*  Sorry about the soap box, I'm
just frustrated right now because MicroSoft could care less about the fact
that every time I single step, my mouse cursor disappears forever.  Ever try
to use a mouse without a cursor?  -Bill

I'm very sorry for the delay is setting these up.  Things have been rather
hectic since we started Skywalker development.  At any rate, if your name
appears on the Cc:  list of this message, you are now setup to have your
Ontymes delivered to your username on 65.  Let me know if there are any
problems.

Live long and prosper,

Hello Folks,

The LOGII document has been updated on DNDSPEC to remove the AUX/NORMAL
flag from the ICRS header (if an ICRM declares a request to be AUX or NORMAL
the ICRS cannot change it, so the bit is removed to avoid confusion), and
to add two new SMOs to the CCN, NCN body and ISN.  The new SMOs 2E and 2F
indicate whether the circuit request has transparent logon or shut override
attributes.

Thanks...Omar

HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES

                                  (HICSS-21)

Papers are invited for the session(s) on Use of AI Techniques in Software 
Design and Implementation in the software track of the 21st annual Hawaii 
International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS-21), to be held in Kona, 
Hawaii next January 5-8, 1988.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following artificial 
intelligence areas as they apply to software design and implementation, 
particularly for large-scale software systems. Techniques may apply to any or 
all phases of the software development process: project management, 
requirements, functional specification, design specification, modular 
decomposition, coding, integration, testing, maintenance, documentation, 
delivery, etc. Example applications are given in parentheses.

   - Automatic deduction (detecting inconsistencies among programmers' 
   assumptions, automatic programming)

   - Knowledge representation (semantic nets, frames, etc. for representing 
   programming information)

   - Learning (self-tuning of software tools to specific programs, 
   generalization of program fragments to support reusability)

   - Natural language (matching functionality of program parts with the

   corresponding program documentation, explaining program components and their
   interactions to new project member)

   - Planning (detecting interactions among planned changes)

   - Rule-based systems (program transformation, performance tuning)

   - Search (retrieval of reusable program fragments)

Six copies of the full paper (maximum 20 double-spaced pages) should be sent to
the session chairman at the address given below. Papers must arrive by July 1, 
1987.  Authors will be notified of acceptance by September 7, 1987.

Camera-ready copies will be due by October 19, 1987.

SUBJECT:      PRE - EMPLOYMENT DRUG TESTING 
 
=====================================================================
 
Recently you received an AB from Jerry Causley regarding the Pre-
Employment Drug Testing Policy.  I would like to share with you some
of the details of the Policy.
 
Effective April 6, 1987, all hires and rehires within Network Systems 
will be given a drug urinalysis  test as part of the pre-employment
process.  The taking and passing of the drug test is required as a
condition of commencing employment.
 
Exceptions cannot be made by any level of management in order to 
forego or set aside the pre-employment drug testing process.  Per-
mitting candidates to report to work in violation of the Drug Testing 
Policy and Procedure may be cause for disciplinary action.  Applicants
who have been made an offer of employment prior to April 6, 1987 will
not be given a drug test.
 
Applicants will be notified of the Drug Testing Policy by Human 
Resources and or Interviewer when arrangements are made for the 
on-site visit.  Applicants should be told during the interview 
process by interviewing management that if an offer of employment
is extended, such offer is contingent upon passing a drug urinalysis
test.
 
When an offer is extended verbally, and when Human Resources extends
the offer in writing, the offer will include the statement: "Employment
is contingent upon the results of a drug urinalysis test."
 
TEST ANALYSIS AND THE REPORTING OF RESULTS MAY TAKE UP TO THREE DAYS;
THEREFORE, START DATES WILL NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED ACCORDINGLY.
 
Upon notification of the results, Human Resources will notify
management and the candidates.  Either the offer will be confirmed
or the offer will be withdrawn because the candidate did not pass all
phases of the pre-employment process.  Once an offer is withdrawn,
the applicant may reapply for available openings after forty-five
calendar days.  No position will be held during the forty-five days.
The withdrawal of an offer of employment will be followed up with a 
certified letter from Human Resources.
 
If you have questions, please call Human Resources, Gus Allen  
(408)446-6380 or Kay Childs (408)446-7445.

DE-ESCALATION INFORMATION
=========================


DE-ESCALATED BY: Grace Gilliam

DATE OF DE-ESCALATION: 02/17/87

CAUSE OF PROBLEM

Uncertain.  Unable to reproduce problem.  Tested today with first, single
user who experienced severe file transfer problems, then added on second
user and had both transfer files.  Both worked perfectly.

However, saw some BUFFER BACKUP messages pass from host toward PC.
Suspect problem reported was caused by front end backup last week.

User said at time of problem he logged into same application (also using
TEMPUSLINK) via protocol converter without problem.  However, not sure if
protocol converter is connected to the same front end as Tymnet.

Subject: Product distribution proposal 

In the past, there have been various schemes to push files around to
one or more systems in order to keep software versions up to date.  Some
of these schemes involved people time to verify that the system was up
and running, that the proper software was being distributed, that the
proper license and protection were propagated and... and... and...

Most of these systems were too time intensive to work without someone
keeping track of what was happenning.  All of these systems relied on the
distribution of products from the source system to each of the destination
systems.  Most of these systems have fallen into disuse and much of what is
now running on our systems is not properly supportable.

I would like each of you to think about the ramifications of a replacement
distribution system that relies on pulling the software from the source
system automatically whenever it detects a discrepancy between the released
version of the product and the available version.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------

In thinking over the new SETOP database which will be centralized on one
host and how the individual changes would be distributed, some rather new
and obvious solutions came to mind.  If it was the responsibility of each
host to update it's OPER database, all changes could be marked on the
central system whose only responsibility would be to notify the outlying
systems that they needed to pull an update.

This same idea could be utilized in a software product distribution scheme
where product information is kept in one or more centralized places with
proper authorization for license and access to specific directories.  Each
individual system would have a similar "stripped-down" database which has
only the information needed by that system.  This individual database would
be updated by authorized users (or programs) whenever a new release is made.
The master database would have copies of the information for verification
and tracking purposes (including an audit trail).

Periodically, an XEXEC subjob would check to see that the software on the
system matched the database.  Any discrepancies would generate a separate
subjob to re-install the proper software with the correct license, protection
and checksums.  Mail would be sent to the appropriate authorized users for
any action taken (eg. Changing license or protection, restoring the file
from the source, requesting the file from the latest backup, etc).

The hierarchy of authorized users could be product managers, operations,
security people and the like.  I've begun to put together a list of needed
information about products, people and systems and I would appreciate
greatly any comments on the idea.

Since the security aspect is linked into the new SETOP, I will be making
my initial concentration in that area (two stones with one bird).

Bill,
  I am drafting a list of things that I want included in the various
internal records for the new SETOP.  If you could jot down anything
that you think of that you WANT included in the records, feel free...

  We should get together or chat on the phone sometime in the near
future about some of this.

  Please read page 2 of (CARL:62)LICENSE.NFO which contains my first
rough cut of things I want to see that fulfill the needs we have all
spoken of.  One idea that we have not mentioned is putting temporary
licenses into the works...

 Give an opername a license that isonly good for a week, a day, etc.
Likewise an opername that is only good on a particular system for a
period of time.  If the time isn't extended, the license or opername
becomes inactive and OPER will complain.

Possibly OPER can be told to ignore any license word that has the sign
bit set and thus not invalidate the old DRWSPR format yet "soft" cancel
a license for a username on a system?

Anyway, I have more thoiughts on this ad am out of time for the moment.

Yosemite falls is calling me...

That looks good.  Sort and Minit should be documented in (XEXEC)SORT.DOC
and (XEXEC)MINIT.DOC at least on 39.  If not, sorry.  Basically, MINIT
does some stuff to allow you to use special command mode which is necessary
for the SORT program.  SORT does what you might guess.  I suggest letting
Les sort it on Unix as a possibility.  Otherwise, just mimic the command
you have.  

Yes, I'm from Buffalo, and I have a laser in my living room from time to
time.  I'm curious, who it would be that told you this.  Its just a little
0.5 mW He-Ne laser I use for a Laserium type effect, but I haven't hooked
it back up since I moved.

Both programs look for files in either UN1 or BILLING10.  They start
with the oldest .SAT file and progress until they are unable to
find 5 days in a row.  That's why the bogus files caused trouble.
That is it only searches the oldest contiguous block of data files.
The CHKPNT program generates the .SAT (stream accounting) files in
UN1 and operations processes them and moves them to BILLING10 on a
daily basis.  So, there should never be more than one or two files
in UN1, the rest should be in BILLING10, although the programs do
not really care where they are - they always look in both places.
Hope this helps.  -Bill

Bill,

Things seem to be working OK with MINIT and SORT (no doc on MINIT on
systems I can get too).  Still am curious about ##stat's and their
operation.  Maybe if you have something you can give it to Les and
he can run me a copy.  Just so we won't have to bother you
too much.

I guess since you've moved I can't say I've been to your house
but I was at your old one.  I think we had pizza.  I saw the mirror
on the speaker and asked you about the laser.  -  Now, you have to
guess  When and WHY.

Another clue:

Don't worry if you can't remember.  I saw you at a TYMSHARE party
and forgot your name.  And your wife likes KEYS.

I take it you want the editor command to come from a file.  Use redirection.
There is a special form of redirection in csh that lets you redirect from
a portion of the shell file.  It goes...
	jove $1 << xxx
	blah blah blah
	xxx
	other command if any
everything between the two xxx are sent to the standard input of the
jove command.  See the csh man page.  You should also look at sed to
see if it will do what you want being designed for such things it may
be better than using a screen editor for batch edits.  -Bill (also see ex)

Subject: The new version (23) of Ontyme 

I just saw a memo today about the staggered release of version 23 of
ontyme.  I have two questions:  

   o  Is this new version going to give us TUMS/ONTYME compatibility
      problems as new versions have done in the past?

   o  I have been told there is a problem with distribution lists and
      ontyme addresses with ASD prefixes (or whatever they are called).
      They can be sent mail individually, however.  The only person I
      know that mentioned such a problem, did so about the second
      week in March--after two hosts had been updated, it seems.  Could
      this be related?

Subject: TUMS-10 bug report (v45000000 of 26-FEB-87) 

Not really a bug, but an idea for improvement.  If I send something, I can't
prevent it from being sent even if I immediately realized it was wrong.  A
command which lets me delete a message if tums has yet to send it out would
be useful.

I'm not anticipating any problems with Ontyme, but then...
What is the problem with ASD prefixes and distribution lists?  You
should be able to do anything through TUMS in this regard, that
you could do if directly logged in to Ontyme.
There isn't a firm schedule, yet, but we're shooting for 1st quarter
of 88 to have Skywalker ready for inhouse testing.  I think its
optomistic, but its too early to tell.  This may be a secret so treat
it with discretion.

Bill,
Alan is ready to start on the 68020 boards.  Can you contact
him or arrange some time to meetwith him.  His other duties
are complete and he is simply waiting.  His number is

Okay, I need to know where the programs are now and where you'd like
them installed.  Then I'll probably have some questions and will give
you a call.  I'm in meetings all week, but will do this at night if
necessary.  I've sent a copy of this to your Ontyme name in case you
are not familiar with reading TUMS'.  -Bill

there is an allergy newsletter.  i hvae never seen it.  my brother
is ordering a trial subscription.  it is monthly; $24;
trial sub has no obligation, so you get 1st issue
free and
if you don't like it you just return the bill with 'CANCEL'
written on it.  

if you are interested, address is
 
     allregy relief newsletter
     dept 60030
     emmaus PA   18049


if you do subscribe, mention that the ad cam from the mag
'Rodales Organic Gardening' so they can get feedback on
advertising.


question:  do you shower with your wife?  (or anyone, for that matter).
do you have a shower?  if so, i hvae something interesting for you to
try.  i hvae changed my shower head to a double shower head,
so that we each get a stream.  that way, you don't hvae 1 person
getting cold.  which always happens.  it takes more water,
and you hvae to have the right kind of heads so that
the flow rate is high enough. i made one for a couple of friends
to try.  i would like to sell it.  i have not seen it in stores,
although it is easy enough to make it.  let me know if
you hvae seen it.  it could be easily done; and i would do it
out of a nice colored plastic, with some nice pastel colors
not the silver or grey that pipes normally are.  for a bathtub
shower the arrangement is slightly different, i think.  i have
a regualr shower.  but i need some betatesters....

You have been selected to participate in a design team responsible for detailed
design specifications for Rodney.  Some of these specifications include:

     Basic IPCF protocal                        File system protocal
     State design for IPCF              Interrupt interface
     Down-line loading protocal Standalone debugger interface
     

You will identify other interfaces that will require specification.  When
complete you will have produced a document that will describe all necessary
aspects of the interface between components of Rodney, ISIS, and other parts of
skywalker including parameters, states, and message types.  It must be possible
for independent groups to program the components with reference only to the
document you provide.

Concurrent with your group, another group will be developing similar
specifications for ISIS and another will be developing specifications for the
IOC.  You may find it necessary to consult with  another team on areas of
overlap.  In those cases arrange that one of the teams assume responsibility for
developing and documenting the interface.

You are scheduled to deliver your document(s) on March 23.  It will then be
subjected to review.  Each Thursday at 10:30 there will be a progress meeting
that should last no more than one hour.  Your first group meeting will be at
9:00 in the conference room in building G on Tuesday Mar. 3.  This room has been
scheduled for the duration.  It is expected that this effort will be your only
duty during this time.  If you find yourself receiving demands on your time for
other activities please refer them to your manager.

If you find the need to consult with anyone within NTD please feel free to

Concurrent with your group, another group will be developing similar
specifications for Rodney an another will be developing specifications for the
IOC.  You may find it necessary to consult with  another team on areas of
overlap.  In those cases arrange that one of the teams assume responsibility for
developing and documenting the interface.

You are scheduled to deliver your document(s) on March 23.  It will then be
subjected to review.  Each Thursday at 9:00 there will be a progress meeting
that should last no more than one hour.  Your first group meeting will be at
9:00 in the conference room in building H on Tuesday Mar. 3.  This room has been
scheduled for the duration.  It is expected that this effort will be your only
duty during this time.  If you find yourself receiving demands on your time for
other activities please refer them to your manager.

If you find the need to consult with anyone within NTD please feel free to
contact them and request their time.  In the case of people currently assigned
to TSI it may be necessary to limit this somewhat.  If you need assistance in
obtaining these people or anything else you need please contact Ken Holcomb, B.

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PROJECT.  I EXPECT THE LETTER REQUESTING
DELIVERY OF THIS SOFTWARE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  IT SHOULD BE BASICALLY WHAT
WE'VE AGREED TO WITH ONE EXCEPTION --  SWBT IS GOING TO REQUEST SUPPORT
OF THE NUMBERING PLAN FOR THE BSC PROTOCOL.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE'VE 
AGREED TO DO IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, THIS REQUEST DOES PRESENT SOME INTERESTING
ALTERNATIVES:

1.  IF WE DON'T WANT TO PURSUE SUPPORT AT THIS TIME WE MERELY SAY NO AND
STICK WITH THE STATED 12 MONTH ARO AND $120K.

2.  IF WE WANT MORE TIME FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT WE SAY WE'LL STUDY THE 
REQUEST BUT IT WILL DELAY THE MAIN PROJECT.  NO COMMITMENT ON TIME OR 
PRICE MADE OR RECINDED.

3.  IF WE KNOW WE WANT TO GET INTO THIS PORTION BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY
MINOR, WE AGREE TO DO THE WORK AT DIFFERENT ARO TIME AND PRICES.  

4.  IF WE WANT TO BE REALLY GOOD GUYS, WE DO THE WORK FOR THE SAME PRICE
IN THE SAME TIMEFRAME.

5.  IF IT WOULD BENEFIT US IN SOME OTHER WAY TO ACCEPT THIS PROJECT, WE
DO SO AND ADD TIME AND COSTS TO THE QUOTE ON THE TABLE.  OTHER BENEFITS
MIGHT INCLUDE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR MORE NTD PEOPLE, INCREASED 1987 REVENUE
OR INCREASED SUPPORT PERSONNELL.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR POSITION SHOULD BE.  I SUGGEST POSITIONS 1 AND 3 AS
THE MOST LIKELY.  SWBT IS REQUESTING THIS BECAUSE ASYNC, X.25 AND BSC USERS
ARE ON THE NET TODAY.  TO HAVE ONE LOGON PROCEDURE FOR ASYNC AND X.25 AND 
ANOTHER FOR BSC WOULD BE CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO ADMINISTER.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.  AS IS SAID, I EXPECT THE LETTER NO 
LATER THAN JAN 9.

To my knowledge, all the sup stuff is scheduled.  As for the other units:
async, x.25 and they've just brought up BSC which was not originally part
of phase I, I don't know the status.  I'm sure BSC knows nothing of this.
This whole thing really needs a coordinator/manager to get all the units
together and keep them informed.  Allyn can help with scheduling, but I'm
not sure that's enough.

Pat Driscoll, Dennis Ernst and Adele Newman have all been informed about
what needs to be done on the X.25 end and have promised its all under control.

Chris Black did likewise for async, but that may have been lost in the
shuffle.

BSC, as I say, was never planned to be part of phase I.

Subject: Logon parsing, transit and options fields 

Weyyi,

After discussion with Bill Soley last week regarding the new logon parsing
the following was agreed upon:

The equal sign "=" will be used as we discussed, to precede a transit field
entry, and the colon ":" is only used for the start of the destination field.
The transit field entries may be of the forms we discussed, "-DNIC" indicating
the RPOA, "xxxxx" a one to five digit gateway host number, and "hostname", only
the RPOA portion being currently supported.

The options field is delimited by opening and closing parenthese as
"(options)".  Apparently this has been Bill Soley's intention all along
but I missed this point and wanted to make sure it is clarified.  The options
field may contain any arrangement of legal characters, presumably fairly
large, though I'm not sure how many characters maximum.  Their interpretation
will allow the user to specify new logon information and old style options
without the use of control characters, in a manner that is transparent to
old interfaces, passing as normal logon characters.  This will allow old
interfaces to take advantage of new features, by specifying the new
information as logon characters in the options field.  For the first
pass we will probably just gather up the characters and keep them in the
logon list to be sent out with the needle bound for the circuit termination.

Bill will redraw a syntax diagram to illustrate these points and I will copy
everybody when I receive it.

Thanks...Omar

     I need  to talk  to you  about  this  project.    I  expect  the  letter
     requesting delivery  of this software in a couple of days.  It should be
     basically what  we've agreed  to with  one exception -- SWBT is going to
     request support of the Numbering Plan for the BSC protocol.  This is not
     something we've  agreed to  do in  the past.  However, this request does
     present some interesting alternatives:
     
     1.  If we don't want to pursue support at this time we merely say no and
     stick with the stated 12 month aro delivery for $150K.
     
     2.   If we  want more time for the entire project we say we'll study the
     request but  it will  delay the  main project.  No commitment on time or
     price made or recinded.
     
     3.  If we know we want to get into this portion because it is relatively
     minor, we agree to do the work at different aro time and delivery price.
     
     4.  If we want to be really good guys, we do the work for the same price
     in the same timeframe.
     
     5.   If it would benefit us in some other way to accept this project, we
     do so  and add time and costs to the quote on the table.  Other benefits
     might include  the authorization  for more  NTD people,  increased  1987
     revenue or increased support personnel.
     
     I don't  know what  our position should be.  I suggest positions 1 and 3
     as the most likely.  SWBT is requesting this because async, X.25 and BSC
     users are  on the  net today.  To have one logon procedure for async and
     X.25 and another for BSC would be confusing and difficult to administer.
     
     Please let  me know  what you  think.  As I said, I expect the letter no
     later than Jan 9.

The SWBT contract is supposed to be here today and I'll be in late.
If you get a chance, please leave a copy in my mailbox.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: Re: Punctuation Characters in Usernames 
In-reply-to: NSMS.B/FULTZ@Ontyme.Tymnet message of 10 JAN 87 17:20:18

The reason we are restricting the use of punctuation in user names is
because we are expanding the login string syntax.  Other delimiters are
required for other fields such as transit hosts, X.121 addresses, RPOA,
call user data, options and probably more in the future.

In particular, the character `blank' is possibly negotiable as an embedded
character, but not as a leading or trailing character.  The character `@'
is used as an address field delimiter by many other networks -- it is in
the interest of providing compatability in the future (as internetworking
becomes more practical) that we are reserving this character at this time.

I'm sure `@' should not be a problem, since there are currently only 9 user
names in the public network which contain an `@'.  All of these are inhouse
(ih), and most are in the same GAN (50325).

Bob mentioned that "If we recommend using non-alpha characters, we should
have a full complement to choose from."  Do we in fact so recommend?  If so
why?  If the purpose is for security, that function is to be provided by
the password which will continue to be relatively unrestricted.

Comments please.

                         specification  of NTN  is done  in  the interface
                         slot Tymfile and  allows an NTN to  be associated
                         with  a  range  of ports.   The  port  ranges may
                         overlap. An NTN  can be associated  with multiple
                         lines in  the supported X.25/75  interfaces.  For
                         X.25,  specification  of  NTN  is  done   in  the

.hl 1 INTRODUCTION
 In the SNA world, when a half-session sends data to its corresponding
session partner, it has no way of knowing if the session partner has
received the data unless it is acknowledged by a RESPONSE.
 There are 3 types of response protocols in the SNA world :
.ls
.ls
.le;Definite Response
 The sender requests the receiver to return a response
unconditionally, whether positive or negative, to that
request.
.le;Exception Response
 The receiver returns a negative response only if  done  in   AP  configuration.
                         WARNING - The state of the Supervisor  MUD design
                         and APX may  not properly take this  into account

                         satisfied  by our  current normal  call charging.
                         Clarification is requested as to why this item is
                         indicated as not  supported in Phase I,  since it
                         seems that it is currently  implemented.  Perhaps
                         the request is being misinterpreted.

                         default  should be  clarified for  the Supervisor
                         design, and the issue of reject priority  must be
                         clarified.    Also,  this   is   currently  being
                         implemented and it is unclear why the  request is

                         The  X.25  interface currently  inserts  a called
                         address for  PVC calls that  do not  specify one.
                         The  CONSAT and  other interfaces  will  have the
                         same  feature  implemented,  in  a  user friendly

                         The ultimate criterion an address is  presence in
                         the MUD.   The interfaces may  check the  form of
                         addresses and  clear the  call if  necessary, but
                         ultimately, if the address is not present  in the
                         MUD, it is de facto an invalid format.   The X.25
                         interface  will  need  some  adjustment  to  it's
                         present  address  checking  to  handle   the  new

                         The X.25  interfaces perform  end to  end calling

                         interfaces have  the calling  addresses assembled
                         in, providing implicit verification.

        44  N  N  N  Y  Y

                         The  originating  interfaces  always  provide  an
                         origination address if the call request  does not
                         specify one.

Subject: Logon Syntax 

Hello Folks,

I would like to have a meeting with Rich, Weyyi, Bill and myself this
week to review and "finalize" the logon syntax for both SWB and Tymnet.

The objective of the meeting is to work from the current syntax diagram
to provide an accompanying text explanation and to isolate the SWB and
Tymnet specific issues, resulting in two separate syntax diagrams and
text explanations.

I will schedule the meeting for Tuesday, Jan. 20,at 1430 in the front
conference room.  I anticipate the meeting will take up to two hours.

Please respond today (Monday) if you have any schedule conflicts so
that I may re-schedule as soon as possible.  It is imperative that
we resolve these issues, since we must be able to communicate this
information clearly to both the customer and throughout the affected
development units.

Thanks...Omar

To reiterate my memo dated 20 November 1986 (Ontyme #I59848), any
training that requires the use of the video equipment must take
place in Building D and will be scheduled by Joy Sargent (x 7465).
This action is needed to ensure the safe working order of the equip-
ment and to avoid conflicts in scheduling its use.
 
Please be certain to schedule the equipment in advance by contacting
Joy.  She will also be maintaining a log to sign out/sign in train-
ing videos which are currently available.
 
If there are any questions or exceptions, contact me to discuss.

later works that I'm sure you'll want to try.  My data base is not as
well structured as yours, but is still readable.  It is the first item list
on (OSERANG:39)INSURE.DOC.  At some point I will get a PC and a database
etc. and get the stuff structured properly.  This will be fun.

I want to try ZOOLOOK and the T. Dream and Synergy CDs, also the best of
the Vollenweider.  Let me know which one's you want to try of mine.
Some noted high quality CD presentations, all Pink Floyd, Wynton Marsalis,
Pat Metheny, Digital Domain CD and system tester, Zappa uses some interesting
live recording techniques, Doors is also very good quality master.

Thanks...Omar

PROGRESS REPORT AND QUESTION.
PROGRESS:43 NAMES CAN DE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY, BUT WE NEED NANCY'S HELP-
THEY ARE THE ONES WITH CURRENTLY "ILLEGAL"CHARACTERS THAT WE CANNOT
REACH. THAT LEAVES 73, OF WHICH THERE ARE 58 WITH A COMMA. THAT BRINGS
UP THE QUESTION. YOU DID NOT EXCLUDE THE COMMA, BUT BILL DID INCLUDE
THOSE NAMES ON THE "BAD GUY" LIST OF NAMES. DO WE WANT TO EXCLUDE THE
COMMA??? ONE CUSTOMER USES IT EXTENSIVELY (PROBABLY 50+ BELONG TO HIM).
IF COMMA IS OK, THAT ONLY LEAVES 15 NAMES BELONGING TO ~ 10 CUSTOMERS.
WE (VIDA AND I ) AWAIT AN ANSWER BEFORE WE PROCEED TO GO TO THEM.

On comma, I suggest we restrict it to prevent further names from being
validated having a comma, but let the existing names remain.  Are there
any objections to this?  It might make the parsing more difficult since
comma is used in the destination field.  What do you think, Weyyi? Omar?

As Omar suggests (below), eliminating the comma laced user names now will
simplify things and prevent a possible ``crisis'' campaign to eliminate them
at some future time.  Let's see if we can get the customer to cooperate.

Subject: Intra-LATA Legality 

Hello Folks,

After some cursory research and investigation into the matter of
intra-LATA legality, Steven Bell of Squire, Sanders and Dempsey,
a law firm under retainer by Tymnet, has written up a letter
stating the legal position on the matter.

The issue of intra-LATA legality involves a circuit with endpoints
confined within a LATA, but with passthrough nodes that reside outside
the LATA.  As stated by Mr. Bell, there has been no clear guidance
on the issue, and at this point Tymnet has taken a stance of allowing
the afore-mentioned scenario to occur, legally.  However, there may
be a time in which Tymnet would take a different standpoint, if
the line between passthrough and processing is crossed.

The scenario presented above indicates the the packet data is actually
confined on an endpoint basis to within a LATA, but may PASS THROUGH a
piece of hardware that is not within the LATA, as part of the route from
origin to destination.  Now if the data was further processed on the
hardware outside of the LATA, like some value added service was provided
by the extra-LATA hardware, Tymnet's standpoint on the issue could be
completely reversed.

In summary, the indication is that a message which originates and terminates
within the same LATA is an intra-LATA communication, even if it briefly and
incidentally transits another LATA.  The issue of transport and interpration
of this data outside the LATA must be watched carefully.

A copy of Mr. Bell's letter is being sent in the mail.

THIS COMMUNICATION IS OF AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE NATURE AND IS
NOT TO BE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED.

Thanks...Omar

Bill,

I looked over the logon syntax, and it looks great.  In the transit field
why is there optional host#, host#, yet not optional hostname, hostname
or -RPOA, -RPOA, -RPOA?  Currently we are only supporting single -RPOA
entries, yet the syntax should provide for multiple -RPOAs as well as
multiple hostnames, seperated by commas.

I will get the examples generation program going right away, it shouldn't
take too long.

shipping  dBase  III  Plus.   Upgrade kits are now available at a
cost  of  $75  each  from  the  User  Support  Centers (USCs) for
current  dBase  III  users.    This  upgrade is not available for
dBase  II  users.  If you choose to upgrade your dBase III to the
new   Plus   version,   contact   the   USC   to  obtain  upgrade
authorization  forms.  Return the form to the USC along with your
original dBase III system diskettes.

The  major  benefit  of  this  upgrade  is  the  removal  of copy
protection.    Assist menus and documentation have been improved.
Additional   commands,   functions   and   capabilities  are  now
available.    Indexing and sorting performance has been improved.
Applications  written  in  dBase  III  require no file or program

A message from Jerry Causley to all ISG employees. . .

    When I reported to you on ISG's third-quarter 1986 results,
I said that if all of us could give the remaining months of 1986
our best shot we would "prove to the world that ISG is back on
track."  It is clear now that you did indeed give ISG your best
shot.  Thanks in large part to an excellent fourth quarter, we
finished 1986 with a solid profit at the performance earnings
level -- that is, before the write-off of acquisition costs --
and we achieved revenue growth in line with the industry
average.

    In the fourth quarter, we achieved performance earnings of
$29.2 million, as compared with a $2.6 million profit in the
same quarter of 1985.  This quarterly performance -- our best
ever -- capped off a year of steady, quarter-by-quarter earnings
improvement and brought us to a yearend profit of $2.5 million
at the performance earnings level, compared to a 1985 loss of
$42.0 million.

    As you know, performance earnings are the basis upon which
MDC measures our performance.  Our bottom-line results in 1986
will include $67.9 million to cover the cost of acquisition
write-offs, compared with $66.3 million in 1985.  Even so, we
produced an improvement of $44.5 million, and that is something
of which we can be very, very proud.

    As I noted above, we produced this improvement while
maintaining a competitive rate of revenue growth within an
industry that is still suffering a serious recession.   Our
fourth-quarter revenue of $326.8 million brought our 1986
revenue to $1.2 billion.  When we adjust this figure to account
for the divestiture of Dynatax Systems, our revenue grew 8.0
percent over 1985.  We expect that to be consistent with the
average growth of the industry as a whole.  (Both the revenue
and earnings figures I have given here are as we report them to
MDC; they do not reflect certain consolidating adjustments MDC
makes for public segment reporting.)

    Yes, your efforts did pay off in 1986.  What is more, your
good work over the past few months has given us a strong start
on 1987.  From this point on, it is crucial that we continue to
build the momentum we generated in 1986.  We must do that to
make good on our commitment to an ambitious 1987 operating plan,
not to mention the further commitments we will all be making as
part of the Significant Business Issue process.

    I will be sharing more of my thoughts with you in an
upcoming issue of the ISG Spectrum newspaper.  For now, please
accept my congratulations and thanks for a job well-done, and my
best wishes as you go forward to meet the challenges of 1987.

Bill,

I noticed as I'm doing my example generation that there are no loop counts

Is this intentional, since it is not really a syntax limitation or do we
need to indicate the number of items are minimum and maximum.  I will be

To sup unit,

A study on expanding the multi-basing capability was completed by Weyyi
last year.  Because of its possible ramifications, I would like each of
you to serious review this report (get it from Weyyi if you do not have 
a copy) and prepare to criticize it in a meeting on Monday Feb 16 at 2pm
in the front conference room.  Expanding the multi-basing capability from
6 to 25 (or more) may have serious effects on the performance of the
public network, and we MUST identify what they are (if any) and be prepared
to handle them.

Can one of you be available to explain the Logon Syntax Diagram to Jerry 
Talken and me on Monday, February 9 at 1 p.m. CA time?  I expect 
this will be a very short call, we just don't understand your loops.

Please respond this morning if possible.  I need to make an appointment
or cancel one based on your response.

I suggest we discuss a more current copy of the login syntax than the one
you have.  I will get the current syntax drawing plotted out and mailed to
you as soon as it final.  It is currently being reviewed, and there is at
least one change so far that needs to be made.  One of us will get back to
you as to when it can be sent out.  Thanks -Bill

I think we should make sure this next copy of the login syntax is truely
the final one.  How long do we think we need to be certain there are no
more changes to be made?  It will take me about 2 days to make the changes
I have noted so far.  We will have to agree on maximum field sizes for
each of the fields.  What do you think?  -Bill

Hello Folks,

Regarding the SWB logon syntax;  I hope that the syntax explanation will
hold them off for a couple of days to allow us to finalize the diagram.

As far as I know, the syntax is good as it stands, we must simply finalize
loop counts and include a loop for the transit field to allow multiple
entries.  A "Note 3" will indicate that the loop count for the overall
transit field loop is currently only 1, which will also be indicated in
the loop count fields.  I will attempt to come up with meaningful loop counts,
or at least character counts, for each field.

Thanks...Omar

Bill,

I will research the loop counts for the logon syntax.

The IGNORES description has a bug.

We need a description for NODE-NUMBER.

We should indicate a loop to allow multiple Transit Field entries
of the form =RPOA=RPOA=HOSTNAME=HOSTNUMBER.  The loop count will
indicate only one entry is allowed for now.  A NOTE 3 indicating this
fact may be helpful.

I don't think there are any more problems with it that I can see, although
I am canvasing the Sup unit for input.  I will come up with the loop counts
by Tuesday afternoon.  Please let me know when we can discuss the final
diagram before you go to print, to insure agreement.

As always, any time frame that is suitable to you;  I am flexible.

Thanks...Omar

RE:  Comments on Recommended New Cost Tables by Farhangian

=========================================================================

I have reviewed the recommended changes to the supervisor cost tables
by Keyvan Farhangian dated 5FEB87.  My only comment is that if the cost
tables are changes to "allow some batch traffic to travel through high
or medium bandwidth terrestrial links even if alternative satellite
links are available", then I am concerned about building such circuits
during non-prime hours and then impacting interactive circuits being
built later during prime time.  Unless we have a means of dynamically
diverting traffic depending on load, I feel that a closer examination on
this subject may be needed.

It looks like everyone has some questions about the recommendations -
a request was submitted for them to update the cost tables because we
had instances of circuits coming from Japan (batch) which were routed
over 3 satellite hops - instead of a 56kb terrestial line.  Obviously
Bill has spotted yet another undesirable by-product of the table, and
I'm afraid there are more if we check out the table carefully.

Le'ts get together with Farhagian so we can give him our input - what's
a good time for everyone next week?  Wed (2pm?) here on Bubb Road?

Subject: host names 

les and i have come up with a suggestion for host naming standards
when we get all our new systems:

1) servers should be named with a theme.  we suggest star trek
characters (kirk, spock, mccoy, scotty, etc.)  this is in keeping
with the theme of naming products after star wars people, but different
enough not to be confusing.

2) workstations can be named by their owners, to something personally
significant (but preferably not obscene!)

if the mail system is set up correctly, so that user@tymix or
user@any-server gets forwarded to the user's primary login machine,
it shouldn't be too much of a problem remembering host names.

(i also eventually expect to set up outgoing mail so that mail sent out
of tymnet from any of our unix machines appears to be from tymix!user
or user@tymnet.com)

anyway, i'd appreciate comments on this naming scheme, and alternante
suggestions if any.

How about right after the (1500) Cost Table meeting, whenever that breaks up.
Or we could just make it for 1600 if any non-cost-table people are involved.

Subject: LOGII GED Update 

Hello Folks,

I am sending another update to the LOGII GED.  The major addition
is the section on the new Accounting Type 4.7 message for the preamble,
to handle LOGII related Accounting data such as Origination Address and
Collect Call indications.  Some minor changes include clarification of
handling of backlevel destinations, and the specific disallowing of
LOGII and old style logon session messages combined in the same session.

The sections that are changed are the Table of Contents, Major Functional
Blocks, New Message Overview, RCRI, CCN and the new Accounting section.

This is of particular importance to MIS who has not been on the copy list
for this design until this revision.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: Supervisor cost in the needle dump 

Omar,

I just talked to Edsel Budar and Dennis Jonas.  Both are very receptive
of having the supervisor cost in the needle dump data.  According to
Edsel, nobody else is analyzing this data, so that there is no problem
with including the cost in the dump for version 43.  As we have discussed,
please do it when you plan to do the NSR concerning the history log and
needle dump.

Subject: a question 



bill,


in file judiciary.c, the accuse() routine near the top has a line
that sets witness1=0 and the next line tests witness1==0.
i don't see what is happening there.  shouldn't the test be 
witness1|=0?  it is not clear.

also, i have forgotten, what happents if two people rae executing this
code,
for the second accusal, and both do the forceReset at the same time?
the card is getting reset twoce, and it may be trying to recover from the
first reset when the second arrives.  that may be ok, but it
may also cause some erroneous recording of state information, if
the card is recording its crash state on a log, for example,
before it finishes its initialization. eh?

Subject: magic numbers 




as magic numbers proliferate, e.g. used in initialization, debugger,
etc - perhaps we should have 2 of them - 1 for initialization,
and 1 for all other uses?  this separation will help keep
initialization robust.

for example, consider a card that was 4 meg long.  we hvae magic
at the start for initialization stuff ('boot').  right around
the 1 meg boundary, some other use of magic occurs, maybe
for a debugger or whatever; the init stuff, by scanning
on 1 meg boundaries, wil think another card starts there; it
may not be able to 'recognize' a card there after finding 
the magic nubmer, but the system is getting screwed.  people
would say, 'how amazing to fnid another magic number on a 1 meg
boundary!' but instead lets just fix it now.  eh?

do we need to store the address and/or length of the log file in glob?
i guess address is not needed for the disk file, since it follows
a standard naming.  but we need to knows its length.  and the
address of the 1k log buffer.  are these in the local symbol table?

Subject: Lock index questioni 



bill,


the struct Lock stores the 1's complement of the card index.
the card index is the high-order 12 bits of its vme base
address.  If this address starts out FF... then the ones complement
will give you a word with the high bit OFF - eh?
won't this affect the TAS status of the field? or am
i confused?  eh?

[Sorry, previous message truncated - hit ^d by mistake.]


The struct Lock stores 1's comp of index which is high 12 bits of address.

	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
	| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | <--------------- ~(A31-A20) ----------------> |
	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
          ^ - bit set by TAS

That leaves the high 4 bits of the 16 bit field always 1.

	 is scheduled. Michael's staff did an excellant job of
	 presenting to 22 class participants.
 
	 1b. Project schedule updates for firmware and diagnostics
	 will be available next week (diagnostics) and after final
	 Rodney review (firmware).
 
	 1c. Engine/68k debugger proposal will be provided on 27 Feb.
 
	 1e. Mechanical engineering  concept review will be held
	 monday 23 Feb at 9:30.

	 25 Feb. Goal is to complete internal reviw by 4 march.
 
	 2a. Update to draft project plan (first submitted for
	 core team review in early january) is distributed for
	 review. Note that there have been a number of changes to
	 this document. Review comments due Thursday 26 Feb.
 
	 2b.  SCCS class will be prepared by Michael's staff. Michael
	 will send out class description, 1 rep from each of hte
	 development groups should attend class, class will be
	 scheduled for week of 1 march.
 
	 2e. Unix system support. This issue was raised at Al's staff
	 meeting. Decision to defer further action until we get more
	 experience with the environment.
 
	 2f.  Trade shows.  QA needs to be involved.  Mktg has asked
	 us to build 12 machines over and above our own use .  QA has
	 asked for a SKYWALKER machine from pilot as well.  Ken is to
	 request that Rebmann specify what level of functionality is
	 reuqired for the trade shows.
 
 
	 II. NEW ITEMS
 
	 New items include:
 
	 1.  Review of project plan
	 2.  Review of change control form
	 3.  Project schedule issues
	 4.  RODNEY issues
 
 
	 1  Revised project plan distributed for review. Comments
	 due back by 26 February. Note that a number of changes have
	 been made to this document.
 
	 2.  Document change control form was distributed for review.
	 and approval of change to "Proposal".
 
	 3.  Players are reminded that project schedule updates
	 are expected monday 1 march.
 
	 4. Rodney walkthrough on 19 Feb resulted in a number of
	 action items for SKYWALKER core team. These are noted below.
 
	 RODNEY issues	are action items defined in the
	 meeting that need resources allocated to them.
 
	 1.  Long word boundary concerns on IOC We need resource
	 assignment to study this with reference to Gate array,
	 Compiler, and Linker.
 
	 ==> Jim Wollot assigned to evaluate this.
 
	 2.  Console (TTY) port loading We need resource assignment to
	 prepare proposal for integration into RODNEY document.
 
	 ==> Kevin assigned to this
 
	 3.  ASYNC I/O We need resource allocation for ASYNC I/O
	 study.  This study includes evaluation of one or more
	 strategies for handling autobaud, 19.2, and SIO async
	 emulation in SKYWALKER, and evaluation of implications of
	 strategies on CONSAT , SIO Emulation, and Firmware
	 development.
 
	 ==> Ernst, Chu, Kopf, Jonas assigned to this
 
	 4.  DISK Controller We need to expeditiously make a decision
	 on a controller for SKYWALKER because the controller
	 characteristics impact design and hence schedule issues.
 
	 ==> Soley and one of John's guys assigned to this.
 
	 5.  Utilities for File and disk system We need resource
	 allocation to define utilities required to support file and
	 disk system for RODNEY
 
	 Comment: Investigate single board computer with disk
	 controller. Consider build or buy decision before committing
	 internal development of a file system.
 
	 ==> Same as 4 above.
 
	 6.  Down line load protocol We need resource allocation to
	 evaluate and define a DLL protocol for SKYWALKER.
 
	 ==> Dave Comstock and one of Mike Rude's guys assigned to
	 this.
 
	 7.  PORT numbers/accounting We need Mike Rebmann to put
	 together a taskforce to define accounting requirements for
	 SKYWALKER
 
	 ==> Ken and BJ to bring up with Rebmann on wednesday
 
	 8.  Administration of penal codes etc.  We need an
	 administrator for penal codes, for message IDs to RODNEY's
	 log, and for IPCF message types.
 
	 ==> Ken
 
	 9.  We need to address MAXCAGE and Model# use with marketing
 
	  ==> Rebmann (Ken and BJ)
 
	 10.  We decided to eliminate non-RODNEY design issues from
	 RODNEY document.  We need to insure that these are instead
	 expressed as design input to other SKYWALKER development
	 activites.
 
	 III. Other new items
 
	 1. Availability/requirements for test beds need to be defined
	 for engineering.
 
	 Project schedules for each group should identify what test
	 facilities they require and WHEN they are required such that
	 we can share resources.
 
	 It is very important that we minimize the number of test bed
	 facilities we have to support during the development process
 
	 ==> Everyone. Include this issue in project schedule updates.
 
	 2. Other new items.
 
	 1. Dan presented the resource re-allocation issue, making
	 specific recommendations regarding resource re-allocation
	 in his area, and requests for resources from other groups.
 
	 Al reported that the only two projects in the division that
	 were not automatically candidates for resource sharing are
	 TSI and SWBELL numbering plan. He agreed to address resource
	 reallocation issues presented to him.
 
	 We agreed to meet on Wednesday AM (9am conference room in
	 BLDG D) to identify specific requirements and to apply
	 (reallocate) resources to meet these requirements.
 
	 2. Dave B distributed copies of memos regarding IOC HW
	 and firmware concerns to be resolved prior to design approval
	 on the IOC.
 
	 3. Weekly status review meetings will, beginning next week,
	 include Mr. Rebmann.
 
	  4. Next week's meeting is scheduled for Thursday 26 Feb,
	  1:30 pm.

It appears that you are now valid on minimac.  At least you have a
directory and all that.  I suggest you use your name from now on and
that will make talk and stuff easier.  We should start to use SCCS
as soon as the class (although I may change my mind when I see how it
works).  Let me know if you are able to log in.  -Bill

          _________________________________________________________________


          This memo describes the results of our meeting to study disk and
          file system requirements for Skywalker.  Unless otherwise indi-
          cated, the items specified are required.

          The controller board:

            1.  MMU to protect the VME address space from wild writes

            2.  ability to generate and respond to 32 bit (extended) VME
               addresses

            3.  ability to be reset by software on another card

            4.  ability to perform 32 bit transfers as two 16 bit VME cy-
               cles

            5.  sufficient EPROM to implement Rodney kernel and disk
               bootstrap

            6.  on board counter/timer with interrupts to provide Rodney
               heartbeat

            7.  68000 family processor is preferred to eliminate need to
               port Rodney to another processor

            8.  SASI/SCSI interface is required (SCSI is preferred)


          Software:

            1.  source code license required (C preferred)

            2.  small and simple kernel preferred (i.e. no multitasking)

            3.  support of circular files required

            4.  support of either variable length file names or subdirecto-
               ry trees is required, preferrably both

            5.  support of file links is preferred

            6.  support of file tag fields and checksums is required

            7.  high resistance to crash damage is reqquired








                                        - 2 -



          Utilities:

            1.  program to check file structure consistency and repair

            2.  bad block management utility (diagnostic)

            3.  program to format unit with bad block support

            4.  program to initialize file system after disk is formated
               (may be part of format)


          After enumerating these points, we briefly discussed the func-
          tionality of three known file systems to determine whether they
          possessed the required functionality: MTOS, VRTX and pSOS.  None
          of these systems meet the requirements for file tags or circular
          files.  Also, each file system comes bundled with its own multi-
          tasking, multiprocessor, real time operating system at consider-
          able added cost and complexity.

          Since additional time is required to configure both kernel and
          file management modules, and because a second layer would be
          necessary to meet the stated requirements, it is anticipated that
          no development time would be saved by using an off-the-shelf file
          system system.

          pSOS costs for unlimited binary copies of the kernel and file
          system are $24,000 per module, and $12,000 each for source code
          (Total $72,000).

what was decided on the IPCF reply thing? that we would not
define one?  A definition of one would not hurt anything.
but i can't recall the decision.

also, the willingness to go to a 16-bit data xfer across
VME was too much...we have done something that will compromise
performance for quite some time.  its a shame and it bugs me.

Subject: reset of a board 



of a board goes down, then any data in its log buffer is not written
to the log file.  the data that is there may be critical for
debugging purposes...so i added a call in sysInit()
to a routine, just before sleep(3.0), to do this write.
the routine is called writeLog().  i didn document it, it
seems explanatory enough from the comment.  do you
agree, and is the place correct.  

actually, what we need is a routine called cleanUp() that
is called in sysInit() that does the log and the mpRelease
and any other housekeeping functions.  but for pseudo code
this may be more clear to show it all in 1 manilione.

Subject: comments on rawson's memo 

here are comments on dick's fefs comments:

4.1:  i guess we need to come up with a definition of what we intend.
	i suggest:
		"file names may contain any printable ascii character
		 except slash ("/"), which is the directory separator."
	that's not quite UNIX, but good enough for practical purposes,
	and it eliminates some of the problems you can get into with
	control characters in file names, etc.
	Also note that the restrictions can be imposed by the front end,
	rather than the back end implementation if we want.

4.3:	checksums are there.

4.3.1:	if i implement this, i plan to move the bad block list into
	the disk label.  i think that the number there is big enough to
	handle today's drives.  we could expand into another block if we
	wish.  it's useful to have the list so that diskclean knows not
	to put the block back into the free list.

4.3.1:	that should work, though it won't solve the problem for bad reads.

4.7a:	could work, though i'm considering taking the page header away
	altogether and just putting data in there.  that's a detailed
	design issue.

4.7b:	seems ok.

4.8:	"maximum length" is superseded by what's in my proposal.
	we could put timestamps in file headers if we want.
	checksum is recalculated whenever the file changes.

4.8:	there is no "close" in a stateless design.  file name kludge
	could work.  will this realistically be a problem, though?

4.8:	supserseded by my proposal.


In general, some of these things are implementation details that really
shouldn't be in the architectural design.  the file system interface does
belong there, the disk layout does not.

yes, i agree about moving it to the volume label.  and steve
feldman agrees also; he mentioned it in a memo he just sent to
me, that replied to the comments of dick rawson on fefs.
did you read dicks comments on fefs? they were in his
5 page comment from the first review day.

so, you are going to change your diagram for the bad page list?
and the fefs.h file?

Subject: Plessy board information 



I talked with Joel Silverman of Plessy today, and he had several
points to make:

(1) he wanted to verify that the Plessy can only address 32 meg.
    this can be any 32 meg ... they are looking at expanding that
    but that would be months away.  The fix they might do may require
    deletion of the SCSI stuff on the board, also.

(2) he wants to check on the question of whether all VME accesses
    can be forced to be 16 bits instead of 32 bits wide for 
    data refs.

(3) they have no fix for the reset problem other than the one
    previously discussed, a pal change that would be at the
    expense of the mailbox stuff

(4) the plessy board can address its own memory from VME - they
    tried it and it works.  Joel also said that he thought the
    unix system they have uses this kind of addressing to size
    its memory!  if we did that then we would not have to record
    a boards memory size in an EPROM.

(5) they have found a bug in the TAS processing when you TAS
    across VME: if another card arbitrates for the bus while
    the first card is executing a TAS, then there is a chance
    the system could be locked - or other strange behaviour could
    occur.  they have a fix for this, but he has not tested it
    himself yet.


joel will call us beginning of next week regarding the 16 bit 
addressing question.

Subject: skywalker groups 



word has it that the rodney group is you, feldman, driscoll, romolo,
and 1other dave couldnot remember.  that sounds like a good group.

isis is dave, me, bob, mark axelrod, and john burke.  hmm....i don
think i want to get stuck in building G with that group for
4 weeks...bob and dave would be fine...

there will be a full time tech writer, also.  dan did not say when
she/he would start or if whatever.

bob thinks 5 people is too many to do a design and i agree.
will require more splitting up and so forth.

what do you think of the above groups?

last, and not least: dave has proposed to dan, and dan ahs
agreed i principle (but not necessarily yet in staffing...)
that we could consider writing a skywlaker simualtor on
unix.  we could use pipes for IPCF, and after doing a couple
of other things, the rest of the code would be the same! 
certainly, most of isis could be the same code in both
environments...what do you think of this?  i like it.
but it is more work...dave said, 'lets blast out the
whole system'! and then he said, maybe its better
to go home and do a lot of sleeping.  oh well.  opinion?

Subject: last message of the day 



bill,

this is my last message today.  aren you glad! ok, i am going to
do some stuff on the weekend.  i have not moved ipcf to
opsys yet.  i have a list of things to do and will dothem at home.
when going through mynotes i had a few things that you and
dave were going to do so i left dave a note, and watned
to mail you just to be sure we all have it straight.

(1) you were doing the address layouts, and i put headers in the
    appendix for them

(2) you were going to put in feldmans file system stuff somehow -
    either as an appendix or in the fefs chapter?

(3) you can reconsider rawsons fefs comments if you want

(4) the doc problems - you know the bad header page we had before?
    you are the only one who can fix it...also i got a font problem
    at the end, even when submitting the make from your logon

(5) did we need more detail on zeromem? i think that was on my list    
    but i don't recall what the 'more detail' meant...at this
    point it seems to me that only reallyimportant thing is to
    get anything that marketing might key in on to be right; 
    the technical stuff will come out in the internal designs...

(6) vme address comments - we talked on the phone about having
    a prose section in the addressing chapter?  up to you.

(7) given the demise of the software UART, i deleted the 8
    associated DLL commands/responses (the ones that start with DBG)
    from the DLL subsection.  right?


(8) have a nice weekend.  most of the above isnot critical,
    it is sent just for my own peace of mind.  i can sleept
    sounder tonight.  actually i sleep pretty sound every night, unless
    i overeat.

got over the cold? i haven heard from you today.  or are you
and becky off on a wild 3 day weekend somewheres?

Those are all the programs.  I suggest that the best way to use it is
to put /usr/local/mh in your PATH.  To do that, edit your .cshrc file.
From what I was told about mh, these programs are all the seperate

they do, but that's pretty risky.  I have no idea where a manual can
be found.  I'll take a look around.  -Bill

Subject: "we have an exercise bicycle that"... 



we have an exercise bicycle that has charts to figure out the total
watts one is burning up.  based on the rpms and the tension,
a wattage figure is given.  linda is doing about 100 watts according
to the chart.  

another chart allows you to calculate a KJ figure based on
the watt rate of power output, and the total time spent
at that rate.  

what is KJ?  we have misplaced the manual, the bike
belonged to someone else.  is it 'kilojoule'? i can't
remember what a joule is, exactly.  it is a
unit of work, i think.  what we want is a guess at
the average number of calories burned up! not KJ...
the charts show she burned up 720 KJ during her 30
minute session.

any ideas?  i am no physicist...

Subject: my cold had other ideas 

Thursday, Friday and Saturday were a complete loss due to my temporary
lack of health.  I've completed my changes to chapter 2 and have updated
the block diagrams to show the changes we discussed.  I've completed a
memory map drawing for the Heurikon board.  I still have to make several
changes to bootstrap (init), debugger (trash soft UART) and the operating
system section.  I'm sorry to hold things up this way.  It is not likely
that I will have this done until Tuesday.

Dan: I hear rumors about another design team starting on Tuesday for the
detail design of Rodney.  I'll probably be well enough, but I do have a
medical appointment at 12:00 in Santa Cruz that'll make me unavailable
from 11:00 to 2:30.  Please let me know the details of what is being
planned.  Thanks.

willott just 'talked' me to see if it was ok for them to
restrict all non-supervisory accesses to local accesses,
to increase the amount of addressing for the local CPU.
Accesses would be c
decoded by the sup code to see if they were local
or VME accesses.  So only the sup code goes across
the VME.  that should also give more protection-
only the 'trusted' code is doing the VME accesses.
seems ok to me.  maybe isis should be that way, too.

bill,


so where do we stand on the document?

we are basically done here.  it is looking good.  

did you stick in the replacment scheme for the soft uart?
and, i called rawson at home and he said that he had
given you the location of his intro on eunix.  did you
massage it into the stddfs format for insertion? i am
willing to do it, i just don want to do it twice...
so please let me know.  i will do it tomorrow a.m.,
i am getting up at 5.30 efvery day now to try once
again to match my wee wifey.  so mail me what is
going on.

can you believe it, we will have upwards of 30-35
people implementing this when it gets going??!!@#$@#
this should prove interesting.

NAD68D.Oreviewcomments: 

    2 March 1987
 
    To: Pam, Michael
    From: BJ
    Subject: NAD68 D.O review comments
    cc: ** SKYDIST
 
  Here are the comments received on this D.O.
 
  Lasater:
 
  Section 1.2 "method of specifying 68020 instructions does not
  need to be accepted by a future 68020 assembler."
 
  Comment:  Should be reviewable.  I'd rather not give up
  compatible assembly codes unless essential.
 
  Section 2.0 "Function similar to ERRCNT will be available, a
  set of macros will be available for directly specifying 68020
  instruction"
 
  Comment:  Good!  Question:  Can we associate a line of engine
  assembly code with the line(s) of 68k code?
 
  Section 3.0: NAD68 requires use of 68020 test machine and
  method of loading generated object code."
 
  Comment:  Should have means of generating "s" records for
  early testing when ISIS/LOADER/Bootstrap are not yet
  available.
 
  "SKYWALKER ISIS/DDT needs to be available for NAD68
  debugging, Any change from current ISIS/DDT must be
  identified by mid march."
 
  Comment:  fair request.  Expect some change in the
  identification of a slot during logon.  I see no obvious
  reason to change the write/read commends immediately except
  for the addition of a more explicit command terminator i.e.
  "CR".  I doubt we will have much more before the end of
  april.  Hence the initial compatibility burden must fall on
  ISIS.
 
  Driscoll:
 
  Section 1.1.
 
  Comment: please explain what an "e.out" formatted object file
  means and relevance of this to cmf.
 
  Section 1.2.
 
  Comment: I expect greater detail on the modifications
  required in NAD source code in the GED.
 
  Section 3.
 
   Comment: What is the target date for NADA completion (NAD68
  dependency).
 
  Tan:
 
  Section 1.2
 
  Comment: question on the issue of not accepting method of
  specifying 68020 instructions by a future 68020 assembler.
 
  Section 3.0
 
  Comment:  Implementation notes requires coding standards,
  recommended practices.
 
  Coons:
 
  Section 1.1.
 
  Comment: What are the issues requiring that this approach be
  taken. For example, why couldn't a SED or AWK script perform
  the translation? Please be specific.
 
  Kopf:
 
  Comment: A method must be defined to account for engine
  coding standards and conventions. How, for example, should
  the code and NAD identify SVC's which have 2 or more exits
  (`normal' and `skip 4 bytes'). The same is true of
  subroutines which may do skip 4 returns; Changing calling
  sequences is a MAJOR rewrite of an existing product.  Also,
  the 68k has no equivalent to jump trace and VPSW
  instructions. We do not want to maintain code which cannot
  run in the engine.
 
  Rawson:
 
  1. Design objectives does not give the objectives of each
  individual project (1855, 1967, 1968). I don't think that
  will be very valuable in comparing what the designs describe
  with what the design objectives requires. (I have almost no
  success at guessing what items in the D.O are intended for
  the latter two projects. The exception is the vague comment,
  "the 68020 code generated will be optimized to the extent
  possible".
 
  2. I'd propose that the NAD68 listing be able to list the
  generated 68020 code in a usable fashion. Without the
  generated code, the translator listings won't be much more
  help than simple listings of the input file. And a listing
  that is so bulky that its use is already being discouraged is
  probably not a good choice.
 
  How about using multiple columns across the page to show
  generated code?  List the input line, assigned address, line
  number, etc. on one line; then use a multiple column format
  underneath that first line for the generated output.
 
  3. NAD68 is to "generate e.out object code". Under
  dependencies, "NAD68 requires... a method of loading
  generated object code."  Can we have more detail? What
  loading facility is the dependency? If the first opportunity
  for debugging NAD68 output requires loading through a TTY
  port to a standalone debugger, it may want s records; Who has
  the job of translating "out.e" to s records? or does that
  exist now?
 
  4. I propose that NAD68 distinguish between code that is
  questionable because it may be WRONG, and code that may be
  inefficient.

Subject: Forcing data references to be 16 bit wide on the Plessy 




Joel from Plessy called, and said that their engineers feel 
that they can force their board to output only 16 bit data
references, and this needs a PAL change.  We are still
waiting on Heurikon to see if they can force their board
to do only 16 bit references.

Joel said that they have not actually tested this, but
intend to do so in the next few days.

He is also sending some Timing diagrams for CAS and CAS2
instructions across VME.

SUBJECT>   SWB Meeting(s) - Our Preparation


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


There will be a meeting at Orchard Parkway in the afternoon on March 10.
The purpose of the meeting will be to meet with Sue Heisler and Jeff Stern
to discuss a game plan for the meeting with SWB on 3/18 in St. Louis.
 
Gazel and I will be preparing for this meeting with your input. We will
also determine who will be needed on the 10th. I do not expect that all
of you are required to be there. Take note of the date, however, just in
case.
 
In my view, what is needed for the meeting is:
 
1. Set of documents to date.
 
   - Requirements document from SWB and any supplements thereafter.
   - Requirements specification from NTD that addresses SWB's request.
   - Individual design documents - written or planned.
   - Other related documents and correspondence.
 
   These will be the documents we want SWB to focus upon in dealing with us.
   I suspect that some writings may be separate documents that are really 
   addendums or re-statements to parent documents. This needs to be
   cleaned up so as to consolidate and bring up-to-date our requirements
   cleaned up by consolidating these into a cohesive set. We will need to
   identify these as to title and date and let everyone know.
 
   This will be a step towards reaching agreement (or seeing where there
                                                                Page  2

   is disagreement) with SWB on what it is that we are to do and the way we
   intend to implement. This will be a major breakthrough if we can get
   this accomplished.
 
2. Scheduling information is needed from each of you on your separate
   projects. This needs to be broken down into development phases. If your
   project depends upon completion of somebody else's, merely indicate
   which project(s) these are and durations for the phases in your project.
   I have attached a report to mark up your reply on this. I will use your
   input as a worksheet to enable creation of an integrated schedule with
   all project work shown.
 
   After preparing the integrated schedule, it will become apparent which
   dates will mark milestones. We can discuss which are external and thus
   ones we want to make known to SWB. Other milestones will be for our
   use in tracking the overall effort.
 
   NOTE: If there are any missing projects, please initate these with Rosie
         Hull so we can complete the picture of all NTD work.
 
3. Consideration should be given to post-implementation activities, such as
   integration testing and final documentation. These should be reflected
   in the schedule mentioned above. Particular attention should be focused
   on people and testbeds needed to perform final checkout operations.
   These are resources that may not be planned from your specific area.
   If that is the situation, I will need to know this so planning
   can take place to fill the gap when the time occurs.
 
4. Another area is clarification of requirements. If any of you are unsure
   of what is required in your specific area, please draft a set of questions
   and OnTyme the group with these ASAP. By the 'group' I mean the people 
   listed in OnTyme file ** NUMPLAN.
 
Please respond to the above this week and message Gazel and I on any concerns
you may have.

bill,

do you know of any laundry soap that is hypoallergenic?  we just
bought tide that is unscented; linda is devoted to tide.  i think
laundry sopa is 90% peanut shells or something, a real racket.

anyway, i had the idea that i should test that one out.  

when i was a kid i had an allergy to certain soaps.

thanks,

kevin


p.s. are you feeling better? i hear you are still sick.  yuck.
take care of yourself!

bill,

i set up a test link, and playedaround with it.  if i rename
a file from the source directory, things got a little
weird.
if i rename a file from the target directory, updates
still followed the file.  so i am a little confused.

i used a physcial link.  the symbolic link created some files
with the same name, with a '@' suffixed to the file name.  and
those files were empty.  i was confused.  what are symbolic
links other than for reference?

thanks,

how do you feel?

2 questions:

(1) is the TTY port handler in Rodney only? ISIS doesn't need this at all?

(2) we want to have an intrA card IPCF-like facility for 2
processes on the same local memory.  i assume IPCF is not going to be
used for that.  we need some kind of IIPCF (IntrA InterPROCESS
Communications Facility).  any ideas?  we could make it
the same as IPCF format-wise, and just administer it ourselves.
depending on use, we may not need a lock either although it
would be good practice to have one, to allow for future growth.
opinion?

Received your anouncement of the meeting on 3/10 1:00PM. Please be
prepared with documented list of the 'apparent inconsistensies' between 
the development documents. 
 
We are preparing a document set and integrated schedule to go over 
with you. We will be working to identify milestones as well. The first of
these may very well be reaching agreement on the documents. We will be
requiring a SWB signoff as evidence to such agreement.
 
See you Tuesday.

John gave us a presentation on what he planned for the dispatcher the other
day and left us a little concerned (understatement).  Pat called Dan and
expressed a little of our concern.  I think Dan understands and has assured
us that we will have an oppertunity to raise our concerns in a formal way
at a design review of the dispatcher which is likely to be May or Juneish.
I don't think there is need to worry, I believe enough people feel the way
we do (including management) that the problems will be resolved.  -Bill

1. transit network preselect is done in the access profile by a complicated
matrix between the user's access profile and the host's.  I can give a
tutorial some time, but I don't know when.  It does not need any code in
and of itself. 

2. subnet confinement facility is something that is not well designed.
All of my comments are in the Recommendation document.  I will be glad
to participate in the design, but I'm not sure what priorities will be.
Have they ordered it?  Its not part of phase I.

3. I don't know anything about call screening.  I think it is something
done at the X.25 interface, maybe.

4. Everything's turning up peanut butter.  I think we'll have a nice GED
by the 2nd week of April for the ROM based services.  I still haven't
gotten used to getting up at 8:00, but I'm having fun none the less.
I am worried about you sounding a little discouraged about not being
involved right now.  All I can say is that I think there is more than
enough interesting work coming down the road for the supervisor when
we are ready to port it over.  I think the network is going to undergo
alot of change at the architectural level as a result of Skywalker.  I
mean stuff that people don't even think about now - its just opens up
alot of possibilities.  Skywalker is interesting, but only because its
something new.  That will wear off, probably before the work is done.
The supervisor, however, is clearly the most fascinating and challenging
part of the network.  That won't wear off.

Subject: rodney: rom versus ram 



regarding the point brought up of running rodney in rom or ram
for speed purposes, i have 2 points:

(1) you can run just part of rodney in ram, once the initial boot
    is done on a card; just the speed stuff, like ipcf.  clock
    synch, medium-speed locks, and so forth could stay in rom

(2) this is more interesting: rodney is not fixed in nature, but
    can be changed at any time if you have ram capability.   what
    you can do is have the ram resident part of rodney be overlayed
    and so the first time you go to the ram part, whatever that may be,
    you do what you have to do to set up a pure-ram rodney.  so DLL
    could in some form change rodney to fix bugs, migrate to
    newer rodneys in lieu of rom changes, etc.  you would have to change
    some vector tables and stuff perhaps.  that makes rodney more
    dynamic, and this lessens risk - is this correct? if it lessens
    risk, it should be brought up in your GED.  it will make
    managers happy.

Subject: Priority Stop Bit in APE 

Bill,

I have some questions regarding the Priority Stop Bit which you and Omar
devised and which is described in (oserang:39)swbgid.tx1.  What
real-life benefit are we supposed to get from it?  In what circumstances
would it be useful?

A little background...

While reviewing the APE intersection algorithm, it seemed to me the
Priority Stop bit had no meaningful interpretation in the hostname AP
(access profile).  Suppose two APs are being intersected, and that the
pstop bit is set in uAPE4 (username APE 4) and also in hAPE3 (hostname
APE 3).

		username AP		hostname AP
		-----------		-----------
		uAPE1			hAPE1
	      *	uAPE2			hAPE2
		uAPE3		pstop->	hAPE3
	pstop->	uAPE4		      *	hAPE4
		uAPE5			hAPE5

AP intersection would be as follows:

	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE1
	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE2
	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE3
	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE4
	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE5
	Intersect uAPE2 with hAPE1
	Intersect uAPE2 with hAPE2
			 . . .
	Intersect uAPE4 with hAPE5

This assumes, of course, that all APEs had valid origins, that the APE
flags were appropriate, etc.  (otherwise, some intersections would not
even be attempted).  This also assumes that no non-null intersection was
found which could be reached by pathfinding (otherwise, AP intersection
would have been terminated and the needle sent).

However, suppose that uAPE2 and hAPE2 yielded a non-null intersection
(all hosts down, shut, not-reachable, etc).  The Sup would set an
internal flag PSTOPFLAG and continue on until uAPE4 was intersected with
hAPE5.  At this point, before crossing the "pstop boundary", it checks
PSTOPFLAG.  Since it is set, AP intersection is aborted.

The interpretation for the pstop bit in the user AP is clear:  abort AP
intersection if any non-null intersections had been found up to this
point.  In such a case, all APEs following the pstop APE are not processed
at all.  

However, the same interpretation cannot be given to the pstop bit in the
hostname APE (at least with this algorithm).  In the above scenario,
the hostname pstop bit would have this effect:

	Intersect uAPE1 with hAPE1
		. . .
	Intersect uAPE2 with hAPE1
	Intersect uAPE2 with hAPE2 <== non-null intersection, set PSTOPFLAG
	Intersect uAPE2 with hAPE3 <== hAPE3 pstop bit forces next uAPE
	Intersect uAPE3 with hAPE1 
	Intersect uAPE3 with hAPE2
	Intersect uAPE3 with hAPE3 <== hAPE3 pstop bit forces next uAPE
	Intersect uAPE4 with hAPE1
	Intersect uAPE4 with hAPE2
		 . . .
	Intersect uAPE4 with hAPE5 <== uAPE4 pstop bit forces termination

How does one interpret the function of the pstop bit in hAPE3?  It
prohibits processing past hAPE3 once PSTOPFLAG is set.  However, it does
NOT limit processing to APEs preceeding hAPE3.  In the example, all
hostname APEs were scanned at least once before the hAPE3 pstop bit took
effect.  Why would one ever set a hostname pstop bit?

This led me to conclude that either:

	(1) the pstop bit should be ignored in a hostname APE, OR
	(2) the pstop bit should have the same interpretation whether used
	    in a username or hostname APE.  In the above example, the
	    algorithm would have to guarantee that hAPE4 and hAPE5 are not
	    processed at all.

I discussed this issue with David and Omar.  (I also suggested an
algorithm for accomplishing item 2, but they shot it full of holes.)  We
all decided that we must have a better understanding of the purpose of
the pstop bit before we can decide between the above alternatives or any
others.  If the benefits are not clear, it might be best to simply
reserve the bit for the future.

[By the way, David came up with another interpretation for the bit:
Have the pstop bit govern the entire AP.  If set, the Sup will simply
terminate intersection as soon as the first non-null intersection is
found.  If the hosts are up and reachable, send the needle.  Else, give
up.]


Well, there's the "little" background...  Please give us your thoughts on
the subject.

Subject: Priority Stop Bit 

Bill,

A brief addendum to my last memo...

It just occured to me this morning that the current interpretation for
the pstop bit in a username APE simply cannot be given to the pstop bit
in a hostname APE.  Suppose username APE 4 and hostname APE 3 have pstop bits
set.  The username pstop bit requires that

	1. user APEs 1 - 4 are checked against all valid hostname APEs (if
	   necessary)
	2. user APEs 5, 6... are not processed at all if a non-null
	   intersection was found in step 1.

But the hostname pstop bit requires that

	3. hostname APEs 1 - 3 are checked against all valid username APEs 
	   (if necessary)
	4. hostname APEs 4, 5... are not processed at all if a non-null
	   intersection was found in step 3.

But step 1 forces hostname APEs 4, 5... to be scanned before hostname APEs
1 - 3 have been checked against all username APEs.

Consequently, this interpretation of the pstop bit must be changed in order
for username pstop bits and hostname pstop bits to have the same meaning.

I've received your message on priority stop.  I'll take a little while
to digest it and then maybe we can setup a meeting to talk it over.  If
this seems to have fallen into a black hole, please send me an obnoxious
reminder.  Thanks -Bill

additional requirement.
 
Also: LOG II Revised GED regarding SUP design of the implementation
      of the Numbering Plan resides in DNDSPEC:33 as file LOGII.GED.
 
      OnTyme file *** SWB is being redistributed to all internal systems
      to correct an oversight.

Subject: closed user group and ISDN 

Bill and Dennis,

I am trying to get information for the SWB Numbering Plan project
concerning closed user groups and ISDN.  According to the X.25
recommendations (sec. 6.14), closed user groups enable "users to form
groups of DTEs to and/or from which access is restricted".  This sounds
like that we support CUG via the MUD.  However,  the recommendation also
states that "the DTE may explicitly indicate in the call request packet
the CUG selected by using the closed user group selection facility or
the closed user group with outgoing access selection faciltiy".  May we
say that we support these facilities via the destination field of the
login string or are these facilities special X.25 protocol messages?
More to the point, I am asking whether we are providing CUG service to
SWB when the X.121 Numbering Plan project is completed?  Furthermore,
Adele mentioned that single CUG is supported at the interface level.
What does that mean?

I am also inquiring about ISDN.  Will we support:  "The calling address
sent to an interface shall be 9001+NXX+NXX+XXXX if the call originated
on an ISDN".  Originally, we had said "NO" because we had no specs for
ISDN.  However, can we not say that an ISDN interface can insert any
originating address in the login request, including one with the requested
pseudo-DNIC of 9001?

Thanks.

David

In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 27 Mar 87 14:15:33 PST

I understand that CUG's are supported to some degree within the X.25
interface (and possibly X.28).  We have no plan to support them at the
supervisor level.  They are kind of another way of meeting some of the
requirements met by access profiles.  So I think the answer is that
CUGs will be supported only for calls with both endpoints on X.25 .

Re: ISDN.  Since I have no idea how they plan to interface to ISDN, I
can't really comment except to say that if they build an interface that
does what they want, then it will do what they want.  I would guess they
could use an X.25 interface and just program it to think its DNIC is
9001 -- any comment on this, Dennis?

Sorry I'm not more help on these.

The following are the minutes of last Friday's meeting:
 
GENERAL.
 
1. Gazel and Allyn discussed the 3/18 meeting in St. Louis with SWB.
 
2. Allyn had copied all project members with their phase breakdown
   schedules received earlier in the month, and pointed out the Tellaplan
   Schedule and Pert Chart provided at SWB meeting.
 
3. Gazel distributed copies of SWB requirements document for review during
   meeting along with X.28 CCITT standard format specification.
 
REGARDING SCHEDULES.
 
1. Everyone is to develop a Pert Chart using SuperProject for their
   Unit's work on the SWB Numbering Plan - Phase I.
 
2. Diskettes are to be given to Allyn for consolidation. Allyn agreed to
   prepare high-level Pert and Tellaplan Gantt to show how schedules are
   integrated.
 
                                                                Page  2

3. Schedules should be developed by next meeting.
 
REGARDING DOCUMENTS.
 
1. Gazel is to identify all the documents that are to be prepared
   for this Project and give copy to Allyn.
 
2. It was agreed that all documents would be reviewed internally and
   that five (5) days should be planned to complete this before delivery
   to Marketing for customer signoff.
 
3. Documents sent to Marketing for review and approval by customer are
   to be given ten (10) working days for response to complete.
   Allyn is to handle distribution and response.
 
4. The first document to made available to Marketing (Jeff Stern) will
   be the SUP Login Processing GED. It was ready later in afternoon and
   was sent to Jeff this morning.
 
5. Question was raised about requirement to provide ERS updates
   Marketing and customer. Allyn to investigate.
   Point was raised during discussion concerning NETVAL documentation
   of changes to validation procedures. SWB has requirement to know of these
   as soon as available.
 
REGARDING the review of SWB's Requirements Document.
 
1. All 53 items were reviewed with special attention given to those
   marked as YES, indicating SWB's intention for Phase I implementation.
 
2. David and Adele agreed to meet at 2PM this Wednesday to clarify
   X.25 requirements in items 37 & 38.
 
3. Item 41 is marked as YES but implementation depends upon symbolic
   addressing capability. There is at present a PIR for Televerket to
   develop this. SWB apparently overlooked our original response to
   their itemized requirements early this year. Bill Soley and Dave
   to re-examine.
 
4. Item 50 was also found to be in conflict with NTD's original
   assessment of requirements list.
 
5. Item 51 was questionable for next release of XCOM. Adele to re-assess.
 
REGARDING PROJECT MEETINGS.
 
1. Agreed to monthly meetings to review progress and problems.
   Meetings will be more frequent, if required. Frequent meetings
   are anticipated as integration testing nears.
 
2. NEXT MEETING is scheduled for April 24 - 10AM.
 
3. Progress reporting will be monthly and occur after monthly status meeting.
 
Please let me know if I overlooked anything.

at the last review during the discussion of dynamic memory,

you leaned over to dave and made a comment...but neither
dave nor myself can remember what that comment was.

do you?  it seems to me that at the time i thought to
myself, yes that solves the problem being raised.
something about how to give out the dynamic memory
but i can recall if it was a question from mike
rude or what/

any help?

I made two comments that I remember:
1. TYM file should specify MIN memory and MAX memory -- existing slots
would get MIN = MAX since they are not expected to know how to expand.
2. When a slot does expand, it has to specify contiguous memory or it
will get non-contiguous.
3. Future slots will specify a MIN which accounts only for the portion
which must be contiguous, and then a much larger MAX so it can expand
non-contiguously to whatever it needs.
(3?)  Oh well.  Does that sound like what you remember?  -Bill

Subject: transit field in login string 

Dennis, Bill:

I realize that this is rather late in the game for revisions, but I was
wondering if there was any compelling reason (e.g., CCITT compatiblity)
for having a transit field per se in the login string.  It seems to me
that this has several drawbacks.  Consider the login string:

	JSMITH=2000:-3000(408)446-6000

The Sup cares about the syntax in the destination field only when there
is no transit field (i.e., when the Sup actually targets to the
specified destination).  The syntax diagram reflects this.  However,
when there is a transit field, the Sup merely passes the destination
field on to the next network.  The next network might not accept this
syntax (with dashes, parens, etc.)  or our syntax might be too
restrictive.  In short, it does not make sense to impose Tymnet syntax
on a field which is interpreted elsewhere.
	  
You might argue that the destination field syntax should not be checked
whenever there is a transit field.  But this is very confusing and makes
the syntax diagram misleading.  You might also argue that the user
should use the extension field when he wants to pass an arbitrary
string.  But then why have the transit field at all?  Why not always
force data for other networks to be put in the extension field?

Another drawback is that the transit field horribly confuses
terminology.  It has been customary to use the term "destination" to
refer to a host within the Sup's network.  And other terms are naturally
spawned off - destination name (as opposed to a username), destination
host list, etc.  But these can be easily confused with the items in the
destination field of the login string.  In my ADRII GED (New
Addressing), I end up using awkward terms such as "local destination
specification" to refer to the specification relevant to Sup targetting
(i.e., the transit field if present, else the destination field).  I
admit this latter problem seems very minor, but I think we should not
underestimate the confusion that can be caused by poor terminology.

In light of this, I suggest that we drop the transit field entirely
and simply tell our customers to use the extension field.  We may
eventually provide a syntax chart for extensions which are passed to
Tymnet-technology networks.  But we should emphasize that the contents
of the field should be a function of the neighboring network, not the
current one.

Please give me your thoughts on this matter.  If we must conform to
international standards, perhaps we can do so in a better way.

- Rich -

P.S.  Bill... have you thought about the priority stop issue?

Subject: rsiSet() 



ok, when the ipcf facility gets an ipcf message that is not for
rodney, it sends it to the application based on the
interrupt vector RSI_IPCF_IN.  so that sounds to me like it always
goes to a specific address in the application (isis).

on the other hand, each 'event' has an associated processing
routine in the application, and rodney knows the associatino
based on the routine rsiSet(event,processPointer).  right?
so where is rodney using this processPointer? or is it up
to isis to do the routing?  if isis does the routing, then
why do the rsiSet at all?

second question, where do you hvae a summary of the events.
1st question is more important.

i like the ipcf.mm and face.mm docs, they seem quite thorough.
am a little unclear (i guess that means totally unclear) on the
done flag and in processing state flag for the case of multiple
agents and all of that...especially with the 'fast' option...
don't see how you really know who has read what and if the
message storage can be deallocated/reused and so forth...this
does not seem to apply to isis so it is my least important question.

we are burning more oil now than before...this will be a long
weekend!  ok, i will wait for your answer.

Its slipped a week which means I'm busy through the 15th.  I think the
week of the 16th is a possibility, but there will be a number of other
meetings to schedule around, and they are the kind that are likely to
be rescheduled with only 10 minutes notice.

My call for advice was about a phone call my wife got, but it seems to
be a thing of the past, so I'll just tell you about it when I see you
next.  Thanks for getting back, though.

I don't know my schedule, exactly, for the week of the 16th, yet, so I
can't suggest any dates.  *SIGH*  -Bill

Wayne,
  Tuesday 2/24 should be alright for me, although I may have a little bit
of trouble getting there by 11:30.  We have our regularly scheduled monitor
group meeting on tuesdays at 10:00, so to allow for traffic and such, I'd
most probably arrive between 11:30 and 12:00 noon.  Any problems with this,
and we should probably make it a little later...

Friday 3/6 is okay as it stands, but is about 50% likely to be preempted
by YARR (Yet Another Rodney Review).  You can go ahead and schedule it
then, by me, with that provision, or maybe make it for the week of the 9th.

In case you felt better, I wanted to make sure that you knew that I

I got real tired of getting mail returned from people who never read their
new mail.  40 disk pages from OPER:33 to be exact.  So, I made a little
two instruction change to RPG to fix this problem.  Simply, it does a
RUN on (SYS)RDMAIL before doing OUTSTR ["NO MAIL"].  Its very simple, it
won't hurt anything, and it will save me a great deal of grief.  Please,
I beg of you, transmit it as soon as possible, if not sooner.  The source
is in (MPL:62) with backups in RPG.155 and RPGMAI.155.  Thanks -Bill

PS - I know its not the ultimate solution, but I think its an adaquate
migration path until something better comes along.  Please!

Subject: New RPG - Mail waiting, etc. 

Well, it's great that we have at least a *hack* that will let us migrate
to the new mail system... however...

Operations uses this thing called SUPCHK which builds circuits and looks
for mail, batch requests and such.  If it sees Mail Waiitng, it tries to
get the mail.  I suspect [Mail waiting] is a match... so it looks for a
message or "no mail"  and apparently ["no mail]" is upsetting it.

I will attempt to look into who (SUPCHK or SUPSLV or SLVSUP) is at fault
for not doing a better job...  anyway... operations doesn't like all the
garbage they are getting.... it's wasteing their paper... sigh!  Also, they
are getting "returned mail" as well.

I would like a switch, a field, or something that tells the mailer that if
the message is not read (or the user has not read his mail, or not logged
in for some period, even if the period is the 30 or 90 days mailer uses)
then the mailer discards the message instead of this return to sender stuff.
As I said, a field - optional - of course.  How much trouble would this
be?  The job processor is never going to read anyone's mail... so why have
it sent back toit, or to OPER...

You were logged in as OPER when you sent that.  Anyway.  I will add the
field as soon as I can get a chance.  Things are rather tight right now.
If I haven't done it in a couple of weeks, remind me.  -Bill

I propose a field
	Class:
with a value of "volatile" to mean the message should be discarded if
unread for 30 days.  It would be very expensive in terms of CPU usage
to allow the expiration time to be variable (in view of the current
data structure).

Class: volatile

Subject: Found a bug in DSKCLN. 

Just a quick note to let you know what we found:  When a multiply used page is
detected, the retrieval pointer is changed to a 1 to turn it into a hole.  The
routine that does this always punchs a hole in the prime RIB.  If the
multiply used page is detected in a spare RIB, the wrong location in the prime
RIB is punched, the bad retrieval pointer in the spare RIB still exists, and
the page is marked as not being in use in the SAT.  The next file to get a
page allocated on that unit will reuse the page DSKCLN thought it punched,
which guarentees having another multiply used page.  Running another FULL
DSKCLN perpetuates the problem.			/Joe

Re: MAILER not running
Apparently the MAILER jobs were either deleted or stopped on some systems
from the queue.  They are in the process of being put back into the queue
by Dennis Coffey on all systems.

How's the distribution of RDMAIL's nomail fix coming?

New CPY %5 being deployed.  /Supersede is the default if you type it all
on the command line, so is /Default.  Both default to /Nosupersede and
/Nodefault if you simply say CPY<cr> and it prompts you.  /Gateway still
puts the password in the file for now... but the format is now changed.

  old  /Gateway:2866 /Username:destination /Host:39
       built a circuit to 2866, logged in as destination:39 and sent
       the files to useranme destination.

  new  /Gateway:2866;destination /Host:39,36
       builds a circuit to 2866, logs in as destination:39 and sends
       the files to username specified on /Username or GFD'd directory
       then logs in as destination:36 and sends the files to username.

both cases really do GATEWAY 2866;destination:39, but the new format
allows sending to multiple hosts through the gateway.  the ???TEL.COM file
actaully gets a GATEWAY 2866;destination:xx for each host before sending
all the files across.

Because of Telecopy, it's still best to copy to the logged in directory
on the other net, but if access is setup ok, it sort of works to other
directories than the one logged into.  (you know telecopy!)

New switch /LOGINNAME:xxx  overrides the /USERNAME:yyy switch and will
login the child frame to xxx gfd'd to the current connected directory
before running telecopy... somewhat useful if the files being transmitted
are from/to a directory not known to the supervisor and you want to login
to a known name.

Ree: Change to ARGPAR in (SAILIB:62)
It appears not to touch the current datum of an item although it sets the
props to (n) fot the count of arguments (n usually = 1) or to NOVAL if the
switch is specified but no argument is given.  This is still true.

If however you set the datum of a string item to "text", when someone types
PROGRAM ?  they will see /switch:text  instead of /switch:string  as it is
in older version.  This refers to the options set... of course.


Re: DSKCLN
Joe sent you mail, but in case you missed it... we found a long-standing BUG
in DSKCLN.  If it found a problem in a page that was a spare rib such that it
was considered bad (multiply used, could not read rib page, etc) and went to
mark the pointer as a hole, it punched a hole in the same pointer location in
the prime rib instead of the spare rib page.  Sigh!  Large files that get rib
errors are most prone to this disease.  Scarey anyway, it;'s probably been

The new RDMAIL is now on all systems.  I've checked them all by hand and
found a number of them screwed up - just goes to show that if you want it
done right, do it yourself.  Anyway, all systems now have the current
version of everything.

About MAILER being deleted from the queue.  Is there any condition that
would cause it to be deleted automatically?  If so, there clearly needs
to be a way to override that.

At 20 minutes before 10pm, AUXMOX stopped working on system 55.  It died
again, 10 minutes before 10pm.  I was watching with SYSTAT CONT:30.  It
was receiving 5 pages per 30 seconds up until the message "System going
down in 10 minutes" showed up on my screen.  Then it hung for about 5
minutes, not receiving any data.  About that time TELECO on 930 gave up
waiting and aborted.  AUXMOX should have requested that TELECO re-transmit
the last packet.  Bug.

This fixes an OLD off by one bug when doing super-map i/o to any flavor

Subject: "Bill, Operations in bldg C are"... 

Bill,
  Operations in bldg C are rather upset that they keep getting messages for
users that have not logged in for 30 days, to read their mail sent from the
XEXEC job processor.

  I created (OPER:*)MAIL.FWD which contains "!OPER/OPER.MSG" and later went
around to see which systems accumulated similar mail.  System 70 had a 135
page OPER.MSG file, 95 had a 22 page OPER.MSG file and 930 had a 51 page
OPER.MSG file.  The others appear unchanged from the initial telecopy to
each system (although I didn't verify that they didn't just get one or two
messages).

  Until I remove this MAIL.FWD file, no NEW MAIL will be seen by operations
in any building unless they care to wade through the mail ffrom postmaster.
Why is this mail still being returned?  (Only on some systems?)

  The messages on system 70, appear to be for the same two users again and
again, repeating they cycle of days, more than once from their daily jobs
which ran until they hit an error and stopped running.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  I'm thinking of changing the default for the MAIL option to NONE and the
user will have to specify MAIL:ALWAYS or MAIL:ERROR etc if he wants mail.
This is the OPPOSITE of what PERP did, but unless MAILER and friends can be
made more reliable, there isn't much I can do.

Please see (OPER:70)OPER.MSG for an example of the mail.
Ignore the ones from X32, as they were caused by MAILER reading the messages
in the MAIL directory which I restored to X32 from C70 when I was building
X32's 2-pack test system from C70 all-files tapes.

The reason this irritates operatios so much is not that they get the mail,
but MAILER prints "
[you have a message from Postmaster@C70.Tymnet]
"  again and again on their logged in terminals, and when they said "MAIL"
they got an error trying to read it... I suspect a bogus copy of one of the

Re: MAIL problem... no idea what msg.
Now that I've routed their mail into a data file, typing MAIL just returns
"no mail". Sigh.

As per returned mail... they're getting a truckload on one system and none
on the others... that's what I was complaining about, not that they're
getting returned mail.  It just seems inconsistant, as though something is
broken.
  And as per getting returned mail, because MAILER thinks that the user
has not logged in (actually logged out) in 30 days seems to be in error
for most of the messages we've gotton on 930 et al, so I suspect a bug!

If MAILER is not, or was not running on the exact day that a mail file
became 30 days old (based on the creation date, not the latest message)
then the mail will not be returned.  The decision to return is based
on an exact match to cope with the problem of the system being brought
up with bogus dates far in the future and all the mail being returned.
A side effect is that if MAILER does not run at least once per day, it
may not notice that a particular person is not reading their mail.  Once
a person's mail becomes 31 days old, there will never be an oppertunity
to return it again.

Also, its not when a person last logged out that matters, just the fact
that there exists at least one unread message which is 30 days old.
The last logout date is provided only for the edification of the sender
as a clue to weather the recipient has fallen into a black hole (and thus
never logged in) or is just being rude or stupid and not reading their
mail.

The people at TRW are interested in TUMS running on their 2020.
1) Do you want TUMS on a non-TYMNET system?
2) Would it be OK for SENDMA/RDMAIL/TUMS to deliver local mail only?
3) Should MAILER running on TRW's 2020 be expected/allowed to build a circuit
   thru the gateway to deliver mail to 930 and 26?  (That is, leaving the
   public-network password to username MAIL exposed.)
4) Could MAILER on 930 pull messages from TRW instead?

Or should I tell them that TUMS is not a product, cannot be supported, and
cannot be provided.

An immediate answer is not necessary - this may involve policy decisions.

Bill,

Those are mostly all MS.  The link from 2617 to 2043 is a v.35, and maybe
should be set for 56kb instead of MS.  The others really are OCL!  The code
in 2043 was wrong though for the TIILNK to 2674, and 2674 came up as an
XLINK with a window size of 8.  2674 is talking to 2043 with a window size
of 16.  That may cause some problem.  Scott Wedel also complained about not
enough passthroughs on 2617 and he has, or we will, correct that.  I do
agree that the connectivity to 39 leaves MUCH to be desired, but we were
only allowed that many Telco lines!

neither is UNREAD since all messages sent by myself are "unread" and I
must read them.

  There needs to be a way to specify a time-date stamp to see messages
before or after a specified date.  Thus, a range of dates can be specified
or one can look at everything for the past week if they like.

The goal of this project is to publish an analysis and history of
the evolution, implementation and use of Digital's 36 bit systems.
This period began with the PDP-6 in 1964 and continues today with
TOPS 10/20 development, which is scheduled to end in 1988.

We are working aggressively to finish the project, and have it
published, by March/April 1988.  This will require that the
completed manuscript be ready to go into the publication cycle
by August 1987!

The project will attempt to answer the following questions:

	1. In what markets/applications were these systems used?

	2. Who were the users of these systems and what impact did
	   roughly 2,500 TOPS 10/20 systems have on their organizations?

	3. Who were the principle system architects of these systems?
	   What features, and if there had been sufficient time to
	   implement them, would have significantly improved the
	   architecture?

	4. What impact did the decision to continue to examine design
	   extensions to the architecture have on the usefulness and
	   acceptability of these systems.  This is in contrast to a
	   more common practice today to work from a detailed design
	   specification, sometimes dated, building follow-on systems
	   which provide increased performance through the use of new
	   component technologies and packaging techniques.

	5. What part of the overall design (TOPS10/20) was technology
	   dependent and what can still be considered "unequaled" in
	   relation to other computer architectures still undergoing
	   active development?

	6. What type of development environment (both HW and SW)
	   supported and contributed to the evolution of 36 bit
	   systems?

	7. What influence did TOPS 10/20 have on other vendors system
	   development?

This history will undoubtedly be assembled from many sources and
participants.  Some information will be anecdotal; there will be
interviews with the people involved (users and developers) and technical
papers will be solicited.  Of course there will also be the packaging
and assembly of facts as we see them.

The result will hopefully have sufficient depth to serve as:

	1. An introductory or advanced text on system design and
	   hardware/system software implementation.

	2. A analysis of the success and difficulties of marketing
	   complex systems into a very crowded market of competing
	   alternatives.

	3. A catharsis for those of us who have contributed to the
	   development and use these systems and who will now move
	   onto new computing architectures and opportunities.

In addition to interviewing directly 25-50 developers, users and
product managers we will continue to work to identify contributors
and significant events up to when the final draft is submitted to
the publisher.  Two "topics" are already under development:

	1. Rob Gingell from SUN is working on a paper which looks
	   at extensions to TOPS 20 which would have enhanced its
	   capabilities.

	2. Frank da Cruz and Columbia are summarizing 10 years of
	   experience and development of TOPS 20 systems.  Some
	   effort will also be made to detail the process which
	   lead to their selection of a follow-on architecture to
	   TOPS 20.

There is a need to develop additional topics which represent the
use and application of the technology (TOPS 10/20) in other areas.
Specific recommendations are welcome as are proposals to develop
them.  A short abstract should accompany any such proposal.  Every
effort will be made to work with individuals or organizations
interested in making such a contribution.

There will be a standalone (no network connections) DECSYSTEM 2020
(YIPYIP) dedicated to supporting the project.  This system has a 3
line hunt group, with all lines accessible from a single number
(201.874.8612).

Both YIPYIP and MARKET will have "public" directories for remote
login (<log>DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262 <Password>LCGLCG).  MARKET can
be accessed by modem (617.467.7437), however disk quota is limited.
MARKET's primary purpose <DEMPSTER.PROJECT-10262> is ARPAnet TELNET
access.  YIPYIP is a dedicated PROJECT-10262 system.  MAIL can also
be sent to DEMPSTER on either system.

YIPYIP and MARKET will keep a running summary of ideas and comments
up on Columbia's BBOARD software.  KERMIT also runs on each system
for uploads.

SAIL.STANFORD.EDU will support ARPAnet transfers to a "public" area:

	FTP<ret>
	CONNECT SAIL.STANFORD.EDU<ret>
	SEND AFN.EXT<ret>
	DSK: AFN.EXT [PUB,LES]<ret>
	
SAIL runs WAITS, an operating system similiar to TOPS 10.  File
names are limited to 6 characters and extensions limited to 3.


Implementation details:

	1. User input is welcomed and desired from all application
	   and geographic areas.

	2. Input from past and present developers is also desired.

	3. Throughout the project a secondary goal will be to build
	   a list of users/locations (installation date, duration and
	   disposition) of PDP-6 and KA, KI, KL and KS systems.
	   Serial numbers, if available, are requested.

	4. We anticipate that this project will generate a large
	   volume of information (which we hope will arrive
           electronically).  Some information, for any number of
	   reasons, may not be in line with the project's stated
	   goals.  Therefore, all notes, interview material and
	   submissions will be donated to the Computer Museum in Boston
	   at the the completion of the project to be available for
	   future reference and research.

Ideas, contributions, suggestions and criticism are welcome.  As these
36 bit systems were the products of a multitude of people, so too
will be the writing of their history.

I'm mostly concerned about providing a graph as opposed to a tree.
If each license name had several license records, then you could
have two people give seperate license to a third, for example,
John might give Julie WF license, and Bob might give her AC license.
It would keep track of who gave what (even if it overlapped) and
so Bob could take away only what he gave, and so forth.  Likewise,
Julie would have a manager who might not have as much license as
she does, but could still take license away and cancel her name.
Only someone having license greater than or equal to somebody could
change the password - then only if they are her manager.

I agree about a bit saying - no good for now.  Very important.  Its
also useful to have different people control the license for dif-
ferent systems.

Subject: window problem? 

Somewhere between here (2521) and system 39 base there must be a window
size mismatch or something else very gross going on.  I'm getting bursts
of about 256 characters with about 3 second delays in between.  Its
2:41 AM so I'm sure its not just overload!  Please see what you can find.
Thanks -Bill

Reminder: this Sunday morning is the daylight savings switchover.  This
is a non-standard switch, so the monitor will need to be changed if it
hasn't already.  Panic panic!  -Bill

We are in agreement of "Graph" vs. "Tree" for granting of licenses.  I've
taken that into account in my record descriptions.  We do need to talk
since we are duplicating effort by not talking...

When are you available, and where?

System 930 has been down since last thursday & I just returned from vacation
so I am around and about, so please send mail to me on system X62.

Subject: 39! 


Bill,

I'm still not sure why 39 has poor connectivity, other than the obvious lack
of lines.  The telco line from 2030 to 2043 (most often used too) still seems
to be having problems with numerous retransmissions.  WNFE mentioned they
needed to get a Firebird here to check it out.  All the window sizes look
like they match up between neighbors.  

I probably asked before, but, what do you know about BILLING10.  Do we need 
them on 39 or can they be removed.  Being the end of the month, they are making
themselves noticeable by hogging lots of space (not as much a Bubbnet, but 
lots).  Please let me know when you can.

Thanks,

Julie

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dennis Jonas has accepted the position of Scientist, Network Systems
and Architecture.  This position is effective 10 February.  While the
position of manager of CSE is vacant, I will be acting CSE manager.
 
During the past several years, Dennis has been responsible for
managing the Continuing Software Engineering section.  In this role,
he has expanded the activities of this section from the singular
responsibility of supporting the Public Network Supervisors to pro-
viding interface support for SNA/SDLC, measurement tools for ISIS, and
integration support for CPU III and MAC III.  Dennis' vast technical
expertise and dedication will be missed in CSE.
 
Please join me in congratulating Dennis on his new career direction.

"Pentagon Planning to Restrict Access to Public Data Bases"

     The above article by Judith Axler Turner appears in the January 21, 1987 
issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education.   In this article Ms Turner 
indicates that the administration has established a new office in the National 
Security Agency (NSA) which will be responsible for the security of ALL 
COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT MAY CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION-WHETHER OR NOT 
COLLECTED AND STORED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, WHETHER OR NOT CLASSIFIED OR 
DIRECTLY RELATED TO NATIONAL SECURITY.  This would include such commercial data
bases as Dialog, Nexis, Lexis, etc and perhaps even Bionet.   Ms Turner quotes 
Stephen B. Gould, director of the project on access to scientific and technical
information for the AAAS as noting this will be "likely to create red tape for 
American scientists and engineers" and that this would "deter even those with 
legitimate reasons to use information from seeking access to it." Ms Turner 
quotes Diane Fountaine, director of information systems in the office of 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for communications, command, control, and 
intelligence "The question of the 1980s is not, 'will there be restrictions or 
controls on the use of commercially available on-line data bases?', the 
question is, 'How will such restrictions or controls be applied'".  Ms Turner 
further notes that the White House has defined a new category of "sensitive but
unclassified information" that could affect national security or other federal 
government interests if it were revealed, lost, misused, altered, or destroyed 
(personal comment L. Yarbrough: that should cover about anything!!). Robert L. 
Park, executive director of the American Physical Society, has called this new 
directive "a loaded weapon".  He notes "Agencies that want to use it will use 
it for anything they want to bottle up", including research reports.  Park also
indicates that "if any fraction of the money to produce the information comes 
from the government, the agency can label the

report 'sensitive' and control it."

   Ms Turner indicates NSA's announcement has provoked anger on Capitol Hill 
and led to proposed legislation to put control of electronic data-base security
in the hands of the National Bureau of Standards.  The House Govern Operations 
Committee will hold hearings on this legislation very shortly.

   I urge you to get a copy of this article and read it for yourself.  If you 
find the idea of such control of information by the government repugnant and 
scary, as I do, I urge you to express your concerns to members of Congress.

Lyn Yarbrough

PS: for some very interesting reading try "The Puzzle Palace" by James Bamford 
which describes the origins and functions of the National Security Agency.

This level 15 thing is coming back to haunt us again...  although Bill
Bartlett informally said it was ok for me to remain level 15 on emsntd,
the other powers that be have blamed me for some unauthorized *** filing
(incorrectly) and nuked the auth.  They also demoted your level again.
I talked to Steve and he said he would try to smooth this out for you.
Hopefully they will restore your previous status.

Mr. Soley,
 
My name is Tom Hackwood, and I am with OnTyme support.  Steve Schramm
called on me yesterday, and stated that you were in contact with him
regarding the reduction of authorization of an ID you have (B*SOLEY)
from a 15 to a 4.
 
If you would let me know when I can talk to you, I would like to tell
you why the authorization level was lowered.  If there is a valid
reason why you need a higher level of authorization, it will be
granted.
 
My phone number is 446-6819 (or use the VG extension 6819).  I'll be
at my desk most of today, and pulling my OnTymes about every hour.
 
Thank you,
 
Tom Hackwood

Thank you, Tom.  I use the authorization to deal with development and
support of TUMS and the ONTVAL program.  I will certainly never use it
to create names outside my own account, or names with authorization
greater than 8, or to create or modify files or messages without the
appropriate permission.  I will not read files or messages which are
not public, except as necessary to investigate specific problems that
have been reported to me by a TUMS user.  If there ever appears to be
any security problem related to TUMS or any TUMS username, or B*SOLEY,
please contact me, at home if necessary, and I will be more than happy
to see that it is promptly resolved (as possible).  My home number is
408-866-0443, and my office number is 408-446-6210.  I only read
Ontymes sent to NTD.B/SOLEY (or NTD.WRS) and TUMS.SUP.  Thanks for
fixing the problem and your pleasant message!  -Bill

PS - I got a strange message from Ron Murphy ... does he have anything

It worked, except that it died because of the file
(UN1)121453.SAT - which shouldn't exist unless the
system was actually up on 12/14/1953 and we haven't billed
anyone for it yet.  I guess you should do a directory
of (UN1)*.SAT and delete any files which are obviously
bogus dates.  Do the same for directory (BILLING10).
Do this with extreem care.  If you are unsure about
deleting one of these files, call Kovak or somebody in
MIS and let them do it.  Deleting a legitimate file
could lose a whole day's accounting data.  -Bill

PS - ignore the message about too many nodes, anything that

THE THREAT OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLS ON ELECTRONIC DATABASES

that contain "sensitive but unclassified information" has receded, at least 
temporarily (WN 27 Feb 87).  In a stunning reversal of policy, Frank Carlucci, 
the new National Security Advisor to the President, announced in a conciliatory
letter to Rep. Jack Brooks (D-TX), Chairman of the Government Operations 
Committee, that NTISSP-2, the notorious "Poindexter Memorandum," was being 
rescinded.  It was this directive that defined "sensitive but unclassified 
information" as information affecting "national security or other Federal 
Government interests," a definition that could fit a giraffe.  Carlucci also 
said that NSDD 145, National Policy on Telecommunications and Automated 
Information Systems Security, which in Brook's words created a "shadow 
government," was being reviewed.   The reversal is attributable to the solid 
opposition of groups such as the library associations and scientific societies.

        Although Carlucci declined to testify on grounds of executive 
privilege, he refused to extend that protection to Poindexter. showed up before
the Committee on Tuesday, but confined himself to puffing on his pipe taking 
the Fifth. Secretary of Commerce Baldrige and Deputy Secretary of Defense Taft 
testified that responsibility for computer security should be moved to a 
civilian agency.

        Perhaps the most significant testimony on Tuesday came at the end, 
after most of the press had left to file their stories. Harold Relyea of the 
Library of Congress discussed the whole phenomenon of National Security 
Decision Directives (NSDD's). Out of some 200 NSDD's, all but five are secret, 
and are not generally available even to Congress.  They have apparently been 
used to authorize such things as the disinformation campaign against Libya and 
$50M for Argentina to train Contras.  He said they bring us very close to the 
most dangerous practice of totalitarian government -- rule by secret law.

Bill,

Can you tell me if this looks OK?  Les said you also do a sort.
I saw:  r(xexec)minit  usstat  sort usstat.dat=usstat.dat/rev
Since I don't know what the output is and don't know what minit does
I am curious as to what I have and where to go from here.

Do you have anything online that describes what this program
does (a document?)?  If we are going to run it we probably should know
what it does (I don't know why but somehow it just seems logical to me).

Anything you have would be a help.

I called Kovak and he has cleaned up the UN1 directories on all the systems.

One last thing, are you the guy from Buffalo with a laser in your living room?

Thanks,
Doug.

Bill,

I figured out (I think) what MINIT does and the sort is
straight foward.  The output from the 2 programs, usstat and trstat,
is understandable.  I guess all I need is a brief explaination of
what the program does and how it does it.  That way if we do run
it monthly or so, we know how to correct errors (UN1 directory) and
if it has to be run by X day of the month.  Stuff like that.

Thanks.

          The following  is my understanding of the signalling requirements
          for Phase 1 Skywalker.  While the other signals specified  in the
          IOC HFS  are nice,  none of the software currently available uses
          these signals.  Also,  in your  design, we  probably should allow
          that some  time in  the future,  those additional  signals may be
          supported.

SUBJ:  RODNEY Review, Your OnTyme #I12869 (Appended)


Thanks for your OnTyme.  I appreciate the need for thorough, 
timely review input on key development documents by all relevant 
organizations.  That's why I got verbal approval from Jeff last 
week and sent a followup OnTyme requesting he make it formal by 
sending you a message.  Inasmuch as you have not yet received the 
message, NTD should consider the document approved - both because 
that's our agreed "default," and also because of the verbal 
approval Jeff conveyed.

I am, however, aware of comments on the document by Mary Arnett 
and her team.  These were expressed in #M76775, sent March 19.  
In case you did not receive the comments, I am resending them 
separately.  I am unaware of any other comments from anyone, and 
it is Jeff's job to get any such comments to you.

To avoid any future problems in the review/approval area, I 
intend to get the reviewers/approvers clearly defined by document 
as a result of the program planning meeting April 1, and 
following.  As input to that, will you please prepare a list of 
documents for which external approval is required, plus their 
associated planned release dates, and bring 20 copies to the 
meeting.  Thanks, Ken!

As of  this morning,  I have still not received any comments from
your  organization  regarding  Rodney.     I   can  only  assume,
therefore,  that  none  are  forth  coming.  At this point, if we
receive   any   substantive   request   to   change   the  Rodney
specification, it is likely that it could be accommodated only by
slipping the schedule.

                                         from
                              QSATS Skywalker Test Team


    The following is a list of the Skywalker Test Team's concerns, 
    questions and recommendations for your consideration.  Alterna-
    tives and/or implementation ideas presented here are given to 
    share with you some of our thoughts.


    FILE SYSTEM

    File system protection

    If the client has write access to the handle it seems that he can 
    access any disk file, thus presenting a security risk, as well as 
    being able to modify or corrupt files.

    Questions:  How much information is in the file handle?  In which 
    address space is the file handle resident?  What protection does 
    the handle have?  Can access be gained to something else by manip-
    ulating the file handle?  Are there any file system attributes?  
    Where?  What could modify it?

    Recovery of disk space on client crash:  How is this accomplished?


    BUS-DRIVER FAILURES

    Failed drivers asserting (disabling/negating) VMEbus signals.

    Question:  Is there protection from this possibility?


    DISTRIBUTED DISPATCHER

    Buffering limitations

    Existing MP dispatcher may NOT be the best model for a Skywalker 
    dispatcher due to buffering limitations.  MP dispatcher implements 
    in S/W the Engine bufferlet scheme and is limited to only 32K.  
    Both are thought to be inadequate due to processor/throughput 
    demands.

    A possible alternative might be Ring-lets (circular buffers with 
    chaining capabilities), and buffer space whose size is dependent 
    upon the system configuration, i.e. max. port no., max. users, 
    etc.

    A second alternative might be to take advantage of the 68000 
    processor series "loop mode" for messaPotential


    IPCF

    Potential for a late processor reading the wrong message.

    Once the recipient has modified it's translation descriptor tree, 
    the sender has no control over the receiver's access and should 
    not free memory until ALL recipients have read the message.  A 
    possible alternative to a timeout to free memory might be to count 
    the number of rings in which we place a pointer to a message.  The 
    recipient can be allowed to lock and decrement the count field.  
    (CAS can be used for decrementing.)

    Message solicitation

    IPCF comments imply that some process (OS?) must "poll" to see if 
    messages are present.  Why not include this in periodic operating 
    system processing, such as the scheduler?  Mail-box interrupts 
    would be an even better solution.  We are assuming that an opera-
    ting system "relays" messages to certain tasks.

    If a write process times out before successfully sending a message 
    and the recipient has no knowledge of who the sender was, can the 
    message get lost?  Does the sender have any way of knowing he was 
    unsuccessful in sending the message?  A sender should know enough 
    to retry.

    Overhead

    When messages are sent, enough address information must be sent to 
    allow the receiver to add the message pointer to his logical 
    address space; therefore we have to add or modify and later remove 
    part of the translation descriptor tree for each message.

    A possible alternative would be to pass the physical address of 
    the message and VME base.  We could pass the physical address of 
    the page descriptor for the buffer and add this to the receiver's 
    descriptor tree (68851 INDIRECTION), allowing the sender some 
    later access control.

    Another possibility might be to use small pages and define the 
    message as a set of contiguous pages resulting in the need to only 
    pass the page descriptor address.  This would allow the recipient 
    processor to "allocate" a local buffer with correct mapping.  No 
    second IPCF mapping would be necessary.

    Questions:  Can multiple processes on a single processor use IPCF, 
    or do we have a "single handler"?  Is there any way to trace the 
    sender of a message?  (This could be very important for debugging 
    purposes.)


    MMU

    Concurrence Problems

    It is unclear if both RODNEY and the Operating System maintain the 
    translation tables.  If both do, what protection do we have that 
    concurrence problems do not result in mapping to an incorrect 
    address.


    I/O COMMUNICATION

    Definition of access to another CP's memory

    Questions:  Is this a DMA?  Do we have a VMEbus DMA protocol 
    controller?  Do we have to pass MMU access information and manip-
    ulate MMU's?  Can one CP access another CP's buffers?


    VMEbus

    Lack of 32 bit operations across the VMEbus requires 32 bit trans-
    fers to be executed as two 16 bit operations.  A later 32 bit 
    upgrade may involve software changes to take advantage of 32 bit 
    atomic R/W operations.  Dual ported RAM for the VMEbus seems to 
    imply no need to limit ourselves to only 16 bit displacements on 
    the bus, since the bus interface could handle the difference.


    SYSTEM LOGS

    Page 34 offers a choice of initials or username.  Username should 
    be used to avoid ambiguity, and to aid in debugging.

    Logger information will be written to the disk when the log buffer 
    fills up.  There should be a timer added to update the disk 
    periodically, even if no events are written into the log buffer.

    The boot code should ALWAYS write out the last current log buffer 
    to the disk in the event of a card failure.

    Record the initial relative time stamp at system bring up, as well 
    as the last relative time stamp before UTC is recorded.


    SECURE UID

    Non-socketed EEPROM

    It should be impossible to erase certain information on the 
    EEPROM, namely the Manufacturers serial number, the H/W model 
    number, and the PC board art work version.

    Nonerasable information can be stored into the high address field 
    of the EEPROM prior to installation on the individual cards.  The 
    PC board can then provide only traces to the lower order address 
    lines, allowing future upgrades to be input.  If it is desirable 
    to install the EEPROM prior to wave soldering the populated board, 
    then a fixture can simply be provided at the point of assembly 
    and/or the depot for repairs to allow writes to the entire address 
    field initially.  When removed again only the lower addresses will 
    be able to be rewritten.


    DEBUG

    Page tables

    The debug facility should have access to the page table areas.  
    This would be very useful for tracking and identifying bus errors.

    Debugger Output to TTY problem

    Output to the TTY port appears to be the same as in the original 
    XRAY design.  Past experience has shown this can create a problem 
    due to the slow baud rate,i.e. 300 baud, and the need for very 
    careful buffering.


    BACKUP

    We would like to emphasize that failure information MUST be logged 
    before reinitialization.

    We are concerned about the Single Point of Failure with the 
    arbiter and possibly the IOCP, depending upon the design.


    BOOTSTRAPPING

    3 second window

    We feel that the 3 second window may not be enough time to allow a 
    DLL BOOT command in to change the load file name, if the system 
    used is very busy.

Subject: 600 baud autobaud 

Hmmm.  It appears, Deborah, that 600 baud autobaud does not work for any
of the TID's <CR>, A, I, or G.  I had thought I had tried it, but I may
have tried another speed (like 1200) by mistake.  At any rate, the AID
feature on PVC's works quite fine, and that's what I wanted.  I am not
sure where the problem lies, perhaps in ISIS or the micro-code.  It may
also be that I forgot to put it in some table, somewhere, but I don't
think that's the case.

Does this create a problem with release?  After all, nobody expects it to
work at 600 baud!  Let me know what you think.  I'll let you know what I
find when I look into it further, but that will probably be a few weeks
away as I've gotten rather busy.

Channel 54 (KTEH, San Jose) has a 3-part series on SILICON VALLEY which will be
aired Wednesdays, 14, 21 and 28 Jan at 9:00 p.m.

The first one, this Wednesday, Jan 14, is entitled BOOMTOWN, and apparently 
covers historical background.

One of the historical backs grounded in this program is one DCE.  They came to 
VG2 last summer and interviewed me while shooting a bunch of footage, borrowed 
photographs, etc. -- and went off, telling me that they are a low-budget 
operation so not to expect much.  But one of that crew called me up a couple of
weeks ago and said I'd probably like it enough to want to make a recording of 
the program.  When they saw a picture of our support crew for the '68 movie, 
and I pointed out that Stewart Brand was a buddy of ours and was one of our 
volunteer cameramen -- they went to Sausalito and interviewed him, too.  And, I
saw a quick preview the other day that featured some footage of Steve Wozniak.

Could be of general interest to you all?

If any of you has a VCR and wants to record the hour, and then doesn't have any
great plans for the recording, I'd like to barter with you for it.

Subject: FILE (WRS)MUX04.P00 

In the assembly of the command files (BUBBNET)bb2166.c02 and
(BUBBNET)bb2067.c02, I encountered a problem with the file
(WRS)mux04.p00.  To remedy this problem, I copied this file to the
BUBBNET directory and changed the single colon(:) preceding the comment,
to a double semi-colon(;;), which enabled the NAD to run correctly.

I have since changed the command files to refer back to your directory.
If we need to be referencing this file similarly in the future, could
you please make the same adjustment to (WRS)mux04.p00.  Or,if you have
an alternate suggestion to remedy this problem, please let me know.

Thank You.

Subject: Re: FILE (WRS)MUX04.P00 
In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 15 Jan 87 12:29:47 PST

I have no explanation for why these files point at (WRS)MUX04.I00 unless
somebody used my MUX command file as an example at some point.  At any
rate, the file MUX04.I00 does not exist in my directory, but does exist in
the (SOURCE) directory.  However, it is not a command file, rather it is
an assembler source file.  Therefore, the lines
	;X(WRS)MUX04.P00
should be replaced with
	;@(SOURCE)MUX04.P00
and the slots reassembled.  Since they are now running without said patch
installed, they may be unreliable.

When investigating this, I also noticed that the following files include
	;@(BUBBNET)MUX04.I00
which should be changed to
	;@(SOURCE)MUX04.I00
The files are:
	BB2362.C02
	BB2166.C02
	BB2357.C04
	BB2360.C02
	BK2641.C04
	BB2647.C02
	BS2357.C02
	BB2646.C02
	BB2067.C02
After these files are changed, the file (BUBBNET)MUX04.I00 should be
deleted.  In these cases, it is not necessary to reassemble the slot
since the contents of (BUBBNET)MUX04.I00 is identical to (SOURCE)MUX04.I00.
The problem is only that sources should not be kept in BUBBNET directory
when the product is released.  Its not too important, though, but it
might be nice to clean it up and avoid possible future confusion.

By the way, I also searched through all the command files and these are
the only instances of these two references.

Let me know if I can be of any further help.

TO: NTD Managers

Subject:  McDonnell Douglas system analysis/design materials.

1)  I currently have an evaluation copy of ProKit*ANALYST.  This is a
    system analysis tool that consists of a graphic Data Flow Diagram
    editor linked to a Data Dictionary built on a relational database.

    I have run this package to evaluate it and have found it to be a well
    designed and useful system designer's sketch-pad.  It is possible to
    quickly put together a description of a current or proposed system
    which can be easily understood and discussed.  

    ProKit*ANALYST is a product of McDonnell Douglas ISG, Improved
    System Technologies Dept.  It requires an IBM PC with a graphics
    adapter (color is helpful).  A hard disk is essential (the program
    takes 3.5mBytes), a math chip is necessary for good performance
    but not for evaluation, and a mouse is nice, but unnecessary.

    The current terms under which I have the evaluation system
    require that I have it in the mail by Feb. 6,
    although it is likely that an extension would be granted if other
    units are interested in evaluating it.  The list price of PKA
    is approx. %2500.  It is being offered in-house at $200.

    Please contact me (Jonathan Doskow) at 446-6325, since I rarely
    log in to ONTYME.

2)  Improved System Technologies offers public seminars in topics
    related to system analysis and design.  One is scheduled for
    San Francisco Feb. 9-13 titled "Structured System Analysis and
    Design".  Topics covered include structured analysis and design,
    top-down development, and structured walkthroughs.  This seminar
    is being offered an in-house rate of $648/person. (I don't
    know the list price.)  

    A seminar entitled "Derived Design (tm) Strategic Activities" is
    being offered in S. F. April 21-24.  It is described as
    follows:  "... sets forth the context of strategic design, describing
    the tools and techniques useful for strategic design, and provides
    design sessions so participants can develop and improve design skills."

    A seminar entitled "Advanced Structured Analysis and Design" is
    offered in S. F. on June 8-12.  It's description: "... concentrates

    on the bridge that connects one structured technique to another.  It
    introduces static and dynamic models of data, describing how these models
    are derived from the data flow diagram."

    For information on any of these seminars call (800) 325-1087.

Sail program GRAB on TIIDEV requires (JLACOMBE)mylib.sai.  Unfortunately,
that directory has been deleted.  I wonder if you might have a libraray
that would be substantially the same.  I don't really know sail, but it

make a minor change so it assumes the editor I want to use.

I was able to figure out most of it but now I am stuck.  There is a
procedure 'exists' which seems to return true if the file exists.

Here are a couple of examples of how it is used:

	until exists(source&"["&cvusername(sourceppn)&"]");

do delay!bar _ 0 until not exists(list!semaphore);


These are from (swedel)gr.sai if you want to see more.
Be seeing you.

We have some questions about addressing that affect the VMEbus
gate array.  We need to talk to somebody NOW!

Call Rick Golobic  (x6089) or me (x6023)


If the SCCs are on the physical address bus so that they can
be accessed from the VMEbus then how does a DMA controller
use a single MMU base-limit register to generate both the physical
address of the SCC and the physical address of the global memory
involved in the transfer?

THE ETHICS OF COMPUTER CONFERENCING

                               By John R. Cook

                                   ABSTRACT

The objectives of the present study were twofold. First, an attempt was made to
assess the extent to which some traditional moral principles governing 
face-to-face communication have gained acceptance by the users of computer 
conferences. This was done by assessing the prevailing community standards for 
computer conferencing on Compuserve's CB and on BITNET's Relay. The assessment 
was carried out using email and other message facilities on both of these 
networks to distribute a 24-item questionnaire entitled Questionnaire for Users
of "CB's" and Other Computer "Chats". The second objective of the study was to 
explore some approaches that might be taken towards distributing questionnaires
and collecting data over computer networks.

The 25 CB and 112 Relay users participating in the study tended to be male, 
undergraduate students in their mid-twenties and their average level of 
education was that of a college sophomore. Six of the CB users also turned out 
to be Relay users. In terms of their use of electronic journal and mail 
services, the largest portion of Relay users (21%) were Psychnet subscribers, 
followed by NetNorth (17%) and COMSERVE (16%).

CB users were found to be much more reluctant to participate in the study than 
Relay users, as evidenced by their lower response rate.  Also, Relay users were
found to be more accepting of a proposed rule requiring users to register their
true names and identities before signing onto the system.  Otherwise, there was
a high degree of similarity in the responses of CB and Relay users on this 
survey.

The moral or ethical standards for computer conferencing revealed by the survey
were found to be largely consistent with the moral principles governing 
face-to-face communication. One difference between computer-mediated and 
face-to-face communication was suggested by the conference users' greater 
acceptance of practices such as adopting nicknames that are considered sexually
provocative or sharing details of one's intimate personal relationships on a 
public channel.

However, when CB and Relay users were asked to evaluate the potential benefits 
of computer conferencing, they appeared to discount the importance of some of 
these practices, in a way that brought them back in line with traditional moral
principles governing face-to-face communication.

In conclusion, it seems we do tend to attach importance to the same sorts of 
activities both on- and off-line.  In this respect, several  traditional  moral
 principles  governing  face-to-face communication have been found to be 
accepted by the users of computer conferences. One area where discrepancies 
between our on-and off-line ethical standards do tend to occur, is in the 
larger range of behaviors we are willing to consider as morally acceptable in 
other conference users.

This is an abstract of the full paper, which is still in preparation. For a 
copy of the full paper you may send your electronic mail address to John R. 
Cook, UD118169@NDSUVM1.Bitnet, and a copy paper will be sent to you when 
available.

Subject: SASI-VME host adaprot limitations 


For your information

The current CMF SASI-VME host adaptor does not appear to be able to generate
more than a 24 bit VMEbus address.  I do not know if there are any SCSI or
SASI host adaptors capable of generating a 32 bit VMEbus address.
This limitation may affect the way board VMEbus base addresses are assigned
or the design of the algorithm used to load system software from the
local system disk into the memory of the various processor boards.

Subject: VMdebug 

	Recommendation for Rodney
		John Kopf

	RODNEY provides distributed management of a Skywalker system's
resources, and each instance of RODNEY (i.e., each card) provides some
(limited) set of capabilities.

	One such capability is the determination of the card's resources,
such as memory available;  another is the provision of a software USART.

	A function provided by RODNEY is loading the initial code to be
executed into the card ("bootstrapping").  For want of a better name, I
will refer to this initial code as a "Monitor" -- it may be ISIS-kernel,
IOC-kernel, or Diagnostic-kernel.  Thus RODNEY is -- to some extent --
providing a "virtual machine" to the monitor being loaded.  In the future,
RODNEY must be expanded to provide multiple virtual machines within a
single card (e.g., the "ATC" configuration, where the single processor
must be capable of support of both ISIS and IOC).

	In other instances, RODNEY may be controlled by additional
mechanisms, for activity such as DLL or Debugging.

	One area where debugging is particularly painful is that of
debugging "system" code -- kernels and RODNEY itself.  The pain would
be greatly eased if the tools available for debugging applications
cound be brought to bear, permitting high-level debugging in real-time
code.

	Such a capability could be provided relatively simply by the
development of a VM debugger -- a special Monitor which would control
the MMU and emulate privledged capabilities while executing the code in
slave-mode.  Except for the interception of privledged operations and
MMU violations, such a debugger would otherwise be transparant to normal
debugging.  Hopefully, the MAXsbug code is sufficiently modular that
a small amount of development would permit recasting it into the role
of such a Monitor, perhaps with the addition of some Emulator capability
(assuming that Emulator source-code is available so we can "steal"
appropriate sections of code), and with the (hopefully) standard system
modules (such as MMU support).

	The effort expended in developing VMdebug would be more than
paid back in the effort saved for ongoing development and mantanance
of system code, especially in those cases where the code being developed
must interface with other processors running existing code.

	I strongly recommend that the concept of VMdebug be given further
consideration, because I feel that immediate diversion of effort toward
it's development will reduce the effort required for subsequent development,
and thus reduce the risks associated with RODNEY and Monitor(s) development
and enhancements.

Subject: 'sensitive' information 

The current issue of InformationWEEK (Feb. 16, 1987, pg. 17) has a short 
article on the effects of the recent definition of "sensitive, but not 
unclassified information" issued by John Poindexter, former NSC adviser to 
Reagan.

He said that any information which the "disclosure, loss, misuse, or 
destruction of could adversely affect national security" would be subject to 
careful monitoring.

The article then mentions some of the types of information that might fall in 
this category...then there is a very eye-openning paragraph:

   "Under these guidelines, the US Air Force, the CIA, and the National 
   Security Council have asked the keepers of some fo the country's largest 
   PUBLIC [my emphasis] databases, including Mead Corp.'s Nexus, to supply 
   names of subscribers and install software that will allow the company to 
   more accurately track who asks for what information and when."

Under the broad definition of vital information, an agency of the government 
may decide that any other private information is valuable, and it can monitor 
or hinder, that flow of information.  

I was just imagining the next step...tie the government systems into the city 
and university libraries, then start checking into what we buy at book stores, 
followed eventually by monitoring what we read in the papers.  I feel like some
of my freedom is eroding again.  Thoughts?

Well, now I will have someone watching what I read and what I pee.  Isn't it 
nice to have all this attention?

--Bi//

P.S. Sorry to complain...guess I am just having a bad day!

Office sees the .Tymnet and sends it to me.  It doesn't realize its in
two domains.  There is nothing wrong with the address, just that there
must be a bug in the mail handler on Office-1 that doesn't realize that

You have been selected to define the requirements for a disk
system to be used by skywalker.  Your requirements will be used
in a vendor selection process for the purchase of the necessary
disk controller and if appropriate the necessary software to
support a file system on that controller.

The Rodney documentation suggests the creation of a file system
for skywalker.  If that approach is taken then the requirements
of a controller must be defined.  An alternative approach is to
purchase a complete product "off the shelf".  If that approach is
taken then the requirements for the "off the shelf" product must
be specified.  You may entertain alternate proposals.  The use of
the file system remains as a loading source for skywalker. 

Time is critical both in the definition of the requirements and
in the implementation of skywalker.  Please have a draft report
by Feb. 26.  If there is any resource you need please let me
know.

Skywalker is the Engine replacement project.  68020 based on VME bus.
Its secret so don't say anything outside the company.  Due next year.
Thanks for the address.  I'll give it a try.  -Bill

Subject: Rodney comments 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

RODNEYWALKTHROUGHMEETINGNOTES: 

 
	 20 February 1987
 
	 To:Distribution
	 From: BJ
	 Subject: RODNEY WALKTHROUGH MEETING NOTES
 
	 Here are the notes from yesterday's meeting.
 
	 CONTENTS
 
	 1.Procedural issues from meeting:  Agenda, players, etc.
 
	 2.Problem areas/issues for which action items were defined.
 
	 3.Detailed notes from walkthrough on section by section basis.
 
 
	 SECTION 1 - PROCEDURAL
 
 
	 PLAYERS:
 
	 Dan Lasater, Bill Soley, Dick Rawson, Steve Feldman, Dave
	 Smith, Kevin Sinclair, Bill Euske, Michael Stimac, Pat
	 Driscoll, John Kopf, John Coons, Mike Rude, Dave Bliss, John
	 Burke, Jim Willott, Dennis Ernst, BJ
 
	 AGENDA ITEMS:
 
	 I. Rules:
	 - Purpose of meeting is walkthrough for clarification
	 - Lasater is responsible for keeping us on track
	 - Design must be confined to meeting market window
	 - We should identify areas where further completeness in spec
	   is required to initiate other design work.
	 - We will contract an editor to deal with editorial
	   changes in document required prior to marketing
	   distribution.
	 - We will not defer distribution of agreed design document
	   to necessary NTD personnel to wait for this editing.
 
	 II. Scope of work:
 
	 This discussion resulted in 1 action item - to review and
	 rework introduction to document describing who Rodney is and
	 what the intention of the document is.  Basic concept here is
	 that the level of completeness expected of the document is
	 that sufficient for Design Objectives to be defined for all
	 SKYWALKER system components, and for project plans to be
	 developed for each of these system components.  Any
	 shortcomings in the design which preclude these two results
	 are to be identified as action items and assigned.  The
	 concept is further refined to state that this architectural
	 specification need not be detailed enough to permit detailed
	 design of each system component, nor is it necessary for it
	 to include internal design detail for specific RODNEY
	 components.
 
	 Since RODNEY appears to becoming some form of entity in and
	 of itself, we anticipate that detailed design issues for
	 RODNEY will have to be addressed in follow-on RODNEY design
	 documents. Definition of who Rodney is has been assigned
	 to Dick for presentation on Tuesday.
 
	 III. Action items
 
	 (Note, some of these references are rather cryptic.
	 They are listed in the order they were raised, so for
	 further clarification	you might want to reference the
	 detailed discussions notes (in the next section) where you
	 might find explication, or at least, other, related
	 cryptic references.)

	 Section IV.- Detailed notes from discussion and walkthrough
	 RODNEY
 
	 (Note - this contains comments and discussion. Issues that
	 appeared to be problems or concerns are flagged with "==>".
	 Some, but not all of these appeared on the lists above.
 
	 Section 1.
 
	 IOC 68010s.  Concerns:  16 bit automacy (bus width of 68010 -
	 16bit).  Test and set instructions reuqired.  local use of
	 Test and set not sufficient with dual porting.  Requires
	 simulation of compare and swap.  Concensus appears to be that
	 the 68010 is a pain to have to deal with in design.
	 Discussion of options for elminiating it by a) redesign of
	 IOC using 68020, or b) purchase of 68020 IOC.	Conclusion
	 appears to be that these are really not options if we are to
	 meet either cost or time targets.
 
	 Distributed processes proposed to minimize single point of
	 failure.
 
	 Serial numbers set in PROM, not set by SW. SW will prohibit
	 write.
 
     ==> ALFRED is new debugger for engine to be used as model for
	 SKYWALKER. ALFRED needs better definition/description in
	 document.
 
     ==> No hot swap of cards in phase 1. We need to insure that
	 we can add hot swap in phase 2. Issue here regarding futures.
	 How much backward compatibility between phase 1 and 2 does
	 marketing want/need?
 
     ==> What about case of adding new boards with different
	 capabilities? (like swapping out an 8 mg board for a 4 meg
	 board). Can the software handle this case?
 
	 Section 2
 
	 Different vendors use difference VME addressing schemes.
	 Types of addresses affect difference address modifiers.
 
	 Motorola and Heuricon boards have some overlap in addressing,
	 Tadpole and Heuricon have no overlap.
 
      ==> The use of the term GLOBAL MEMORY in the document is
	 unclear. All memory is accessible globally but it wont be
	 used in that fashion. Memory is owned by specific processors.
	 Memory on board is used only to describe things on that
	 board. All memory is readable and writeable by processors
	 other than the owner processor.
 
	 Issue of local and VME addressing is still unclear.  Mapping
	 from VME into local RAM is handled by switches on boards.
	 Not all boards permit SW to read switches.  If an oeprator
	 miss-sets vME address we need to be able to figure that out.
 
	 If different cards can't talk to each other because of
	 incompatiblities in space addressing do we have a problem? We
	 can`t mix card types that are incompatible.
 
	 <Here there were two diagrams>
 
	  In this section there is no description of the utility
	 required to put VME addresses into EROM. IOCs. get their
	 address from port number.
 
     ==>  Section 2.2 needs more detail on local addressing.
	  Section 2.6 Extended memory - design documents. Scope of
	  architectural spec is components where interface is needed.
	 ISIS design issues need to be addressed in isis design.
	 Extended memory is not a proboem except for PASCAL and SNA.
 
      ==>  RODNEY  needs definition. RODNEY is a multiprocess
	 definition. IThis document defines an architecture that
	 underlys ISIS. RODNEY is the interface between ISIS and
	 system components. RODNEY manages global resources, ISIS
	 manages each machine.
 
	 Section 2.5 Serial#, Model#, HW SW FW Vrs#.  Only Model # and
	 Serial # actually make up UID.  Some capabilities
	 identification derivable from model #, however this doesn't
	 necesarily include clock and memory size.  Kopf thinks it
	 might be handy to know and tell software about memory, clock
	 or other characteristics.  If HW vers# is stored in EPROM, is
	 that affected by ECOs?  Not on CPs for phase 1 but yes for
	 our own built boards.	IOC has EEPROM.  Can change version #
	 when ECO is applied.
 
     ==> Make the utility that updates EEPROM for ECO revision a part
	 of the board diagnostics so when MFG does the revision, they
	 then run the diagnostics and change the rev.
 
      ==> Marketing has new model numbering scheme.The question is
	  whether or not this has any relevance to our use of model
	 numbers here, and whether they might have some preferences on
	 how these numbers are used to conform to their own schemes.
 
     ==>  2.7 IOC gatearray. Long word boundary issue needs to be
	 addressed.
 
	  Bootstrap - all cards: CP, IOC, Disk Controller.
 
	  GLOB is a data structure held by each processor in its own
	 local memory. All processors have Read access to everyone
	 else GLOB, but can't write into anyone elses glob.
 
    ==>   We need additional description of I/O initialization.
	  "INIT IPCF" also needs process description. Pseudo code
	 probably not necessary.
 
	  How is memory to be managed in cards. Boot allocates what
	 memory it needs, GLOB table and defined structures are all
	 that need to exist after boot phase.
 
    ==>   Global memory management within a card to be addressed as an
	 ISIS design issue.
 
    ==>   Defibrillation code or process description should be added.
	 Code especially desireable.
 
 
    ==>    System configuration test needs to be clarified - for
	 system as a whole and for specific components.
 
    ==>   Add statement that initialization continues even if system
	 fails. component Sysfail turns off lights on all boards.
 
     ==>   Zeroing memory after a dump. On crash, if magic # is bad?,
	  What if disk goes down on power fail?. Do we choose a
	  failure mode when memory might still be good or keeping it
	  desireable.?
 
	  Page 7 GDS - reference to GLOB on arbiter should be
	 deleted.
 
	   Pointers - Device has address, idelly the same address in
	 local as well as VME addressing but vendor cards don't
	 implement it this way. So, pointers become ambiguous, hence
	 clear definition of kind of pointer is needed to know whether
	 it's local or VME address. Implementation must be careful.
	 All VME addresses may be/should by/probably will be via VME
	 subroutine call.
 
    ==>    Add notes about issues of pariticular sensitivity such as
	 global indirections. Paranoia on Data strucutres, Paranoia on
	 bus error handline, paranoia on addressing pointers.
 
     ==>   MAXCAGE - should this be 4 or 8 or 1. ISsue for further
	 study/clarification.
 
	 Section 3 is  part of system initialization. Not really
	 bootstrapping.
 
	 Discuss issue of board death and recovery during expansion of
	 PATHOLOGY section and constrints.
 
    ==> Potential design improvement by including  state
	 tables/diagrams and cases for addressing pathology - in
	 addition to pseudo code.
 
    ==>   Possibly error issues may be "to be adddressed" in detail
	 design.
 
	  Section 4 - Front end file system
 
	 Partition disk into logical volumes.  1 partition for FEFS, 1
	 for ISIS, 1 for ????.	What ISIS thinks is the whole disk is
	 1 logical volume.
 
	  FEFS is for loading, dumping, error log.
 
     ==>  Specify in document that the discussion of the file system
	 is based on a byte stream model.
 
	  ISIS sees a logical volume differenly from this file system.
 
     ==>  Completion issue - Determination of disk and file system
	 distribution ?
	 - Selection of controller?
	 - legal characters in file system?
	 - diagnostic and utility programs - where do they reside?
	 - System convention - what is meaning of character strings?
	 - Define file names and file strings.
	 - How far into file system should redundancy go - disk and
	 file sytem back up?
	 - what is checking for volume integrity taking place?
 
     ==>  Write without pointer advance option may be requried for
	 log. (for periodic writes of event log information)
	 "Frontal truncate " means "circular wrap"?
 
     ==>  Problem area - file system structure, data content,
	 concurent access to logs, etc.
 
	 Comment:   We need a better description of the physical
	 Response: We make no assumptions in the file system about
	 physical media.
 
	  4.2 Loading files onto disk. DL load facility has primative
	 but complete set of file manipulation capability.
 
 
      ==>  Additional discussion required regarding FORCE BOARD. It
	  could meet requirements but tradefoffs required are not
	  desireable, even though alternatives are more expensive.
	  We need further refinement of requriements (HW especially)
 
	  Section 5 - loading.
 
	  Section 4 para2 issue to be addressed in IOC development.
 
	  DL loading algorithm is in ROM
 
	   5:1 Device name - some characteristics in common with UID -
	 e.g. Model #. IOC is associated with physical port number it
	 is connected to. (lowest port # in group of 8)
 
	  Device name used to determine filenmae to look for on disk
	 includes: Filetype, load (for boot), dump, log.
	 Version number has meaning for load files ()=current file, 1
	 and 2 = backup version of code.
 
	  Device name requred (rather than using UID) isnce device
	 name doesn't depend on physlical serial # and can be put into
	 ISIS tymfile.
 
	 Page 22 end - "version " indicates "instance" not to be
	 confused with "version # as in Version, revision.
 
      ==> Loading - need to be able to load from console ports. Define
	 requirements. When ISIS is up it can do loads to update disk
	 while processors are up.
 
      ==> Why is only 1 downline load to be allowed at one time?
	  1 DL load is permitted per IOC not per system?
	  Needs clarification.
 
      ==> Issue of TYMTUNNELS.
 
	  Conclusion seems to be that for first run, ability to load
	  from local disk or from console might permit tymtunnels
	  to work ok even without ability to load across an X.25 link?
 
	  1 copy of ISIS on all CPS instead of multiple copies of
	 ISIS. This is a host sw issue (SKYWALKER UNIX load facility,
	 and CMF).
 
	  Engineering notes that hardware won't support off protection
	  for off card read only references.
 
	  Clarify differences between current boot DLL and this
	 proposal. I.e., add scenarios of load options. E.g., ISIS
	 can be up without node code being up.
 
      ==> Revisit DL loading protocol. Do we need a link level
	 protocol.
 
	 Define command/response sequence (5.5, 5.6 - state machine of
	 possible responses.  State descriptions are important here.
 
	 Access through DDT OR through DDL mechanism are intended to
	 be as symmetrical as possible.
 
	 Section 6 - Configuration
 
     ==>  Configuration detail to be moved to APPENDIX.
 
	  ISIS needs to talk to RODNEY to find out physlica unit (i.e.
	 device names).
 
      ==>  Note in GLOB section that GLOB will be used for
	 configuration.
 
	 Slot - licenses, LU-PU messages, CPH primary, [CPH backup].
	 Configuration changes on the fly allowed through load of new
	 glob configuration file.
 
	 Section 7 - Interprocessor communication
 
	 Device level communication, not slot communication.  Solves
	 concurrency and reace conidtion issues.  Ring structure
	 allowing more than 1 writer into a single ring.  Each
	 processor has only an input ring into which processors write
	 pointers to their rings.  Each entry in ring is 4 bytes long
	 (1 pointer).
 
	 OWNER ID = high order 12 bits of base VME address.
 
	 Must have some polling by reader at least often enough to
	 time out lock.
 
	 When reader checks he needs to know that lock hasn`t been
	 locked and unlocked and locked again since the last check.
	 Does he need to look at a pointer to see if its been update?
 
	 It's important that writer not be interrupted. Can this be
	 done?
 
	  This is an area where we made tradeoffs for performance
	 instead of fault tolerance.
 
	   What about using CAS . Limitation of 68010 need not
	 necessarily be adhered to for operations involving only
	 68020s.
 
	  VME limitations impact us as well. TYMNET IOC design option
	 in gate array, locking bus and local master ' buys you
	 compare and swap but locks local proccessor from access to
	 bus. Simulating CAS by locking bus is trading 1 limitation
	 for another. All boards (ours and others) will hold bus
	 through RMW cycle.
 
	  7.3 correct.
	  7.5 delete.
 
	  Pointer is full VME address (see pseudle code IOC send page
	 35.)
 
      ==>  Define IPCF reply message protocol.
 
      ==>  Message types for IPCF must be administrered.
 
	   Mailbox facility will be used if available.
 
	   Section 8 - I/O communication
 
	   8.1 SIO emulation. IOC would emulate both SIO and some of
	 the functionality in ISIS driver.
 
     ==> Async I/O section needs work.
     ==> Interrpts and ISIS SIO driver require further design work
	 (FIRWARE).
 
	 Sync emulation REQURIED for phase 1.
 
	 8.2 IOCs need to know VME address and physical port number.
	 RODNEY proposes that the backpanel include a way of sending
	 which port group it is back to the IO*c.
 
     ==> Port naming conventions are a problem area.
 
	 <Diagram here>
 
	 Thumb wheel switch on backpanel to set.  Physical port
	 relationships will be defined, this then is used for device
	 name.	Is there a problem with this?
 
	 If breakout panel thumb wheel switches are set wrong, is
	 there any way to tell?
 
	 RODNEY requires the physical port ID for device ID
	 derivation.  Needs help from breakout panel, paddleboard and
	 IOC.
 
     ==> Need more elaboration/alternatives on port numbers including
	 mechanical limits inherent to the IOC/Breakout design (if
	 any). Mapping of IOC names to group of 4 when IOC supports
	 more than 4 might cause a problem if FE's reconnect other
	 4 to another IOC by error.`
 
	  page 37 last paragraph unclear. 4 reads to poll 4 ports (2
	 bits each).
 
	  Section 9 - back-up
 
    ==>  12.2 Clocking relationship of system clock to SUP clock, real
	 time interrups at least once very 16 sec is required for
	 every RODNEY component.  Some of the stuff in this section
	 12.2 should be moved back up to section 9.
 
   ==>	 Should longer locks have crash count?
 
	  9.2 paragraph 1. Conviction is cleared on reset.
 
    ==>   Need more detail of conviction re-setting. I.e., need
	  pardon defintion.
 
    ==>   What about Conviction on 1 accusation in case of only 2
	 processors (no bk-up, only CP and IOC case)
 
	 What of case where there is only 1 witness, for example, CP
	 sees IOC is bad, but no other CP notices or cares or
	 witnesses against it?
 
	  All boards except Plessy can be reset across the VME bus so
	 this is probably what conviction results in - the convict
	 goes back to initialization.
 
	 What to do at initialization? This is decided for prcoessors
	 by ISIS.
 
	 Does convict know why he was reset? Other processors know
	 he's been convicted.
 
     ==>  Need to establish penal codes (reason codes for conviction).
 
	  9.2 ISIS topic for slots to be moved individually - similar
	 mechanisms for slot and card back up.
 
	  On conviction convict code picked up by various back up
	 processors who will load rele4vant slot code.
 
    ==>  Slot backup.  needs forther explication here, as well as more
	 detail in ISIS design.
 
	 Section 10 - Debuggers
 
	 2 debuggers - standalone (like MACSBUG, resident in ROM.
 
	 No separate console board. TTY port on each CP. Any TTY port
	 used to access any standalone or ISIS debugger on any system.
 
	 Implementation through SW uarts.
 
	 Local TTY port woudl have in ROM a soft abort button
	 permitting abort-like functions to occur on another
	 processor.
 
	 Has to scan for data from TTY port
 
	 Assumption here is that standalone debuggers can't work while
	 somthing else is going on.
	 Not a necesary assumption- MACs bug was modified for TTY to
	 permit concurrent functioning of MACSBUG and other things.
	 Can we run standalone debug with other processes? We should
	 evaluate this, it might be nice to have.
 
     ==> <Aside...  at end of day we decided that we should not go
	 looking for trouble, and that we would not pursue this.  We
	 did decide that one could access the standalone debugger on
	 one processor card through the TTY port on another card
	 without disabling the current functioning of the accessed
	 card.>
 
	 10.1 Note: TTY emulation (like engine) is not required
	 because ISIS and diagnositcs are new.
 
 
     ==>  How to handle SW UART lock-out option for notification of
	 lock owner (on TTY port into standalone debugger) that you
	 are taking lock away.
 
	  ISIS debugger is the second debug facility available. Most
	 design of this is planned for the ISIS design activity.
 
	  Source level debugger input/output. Issues of definition
	  regarding slot debugging. Interpreter and Translator issues.
 
	  John would like a future ability to debug a virtual machine.
 
	  Section 11.
 
    ==>   How to handle rewirte of last block in logger requires
	 clarification.
 
	 Log entry:
 
	 time/ UID / code (prod type) / code (event type)/severity
	 code / text .
 
	 Option for part of the message field to be reserved for and
	 used by ISIS for some further identification.
 
	 Section 11.1 Log file handling.
 
	 All log messages are ID'd by UID (paragraph 2).
 
	 Concept here is that the primary purpose of the log is HW.
	 It is NOT a replication of msgs to SUPS etc.
 
     ==> Issue of real time access to HW log - display of last page,
	 last "n" messages etc.
 
	 WHO is RODNEY? Is he a series of PROM routines? (ROMNEY).
     ==> Need RODNEY defintion.
 
	 Message types for logger need administration.
 
	 Section 12 Operating considerations
 
	  Medium performance lock.
 
     ==>  Lock use identification and evaluation needed.
	  Suggestion is made that when programming locks
	  state diagrams be included in design (another paranoia
	  issue). Locks are RODNEY System functions that live in ROM
	 and can be called by ISIS's and node codes.
 
	  (Locks, clocks, heartbeats, interprocess communication are
	  ISIS tools.
 
     ==> Future. For inhouse 68030 - desirable to be able to lock up
	 dual ported memory access to VME bus to allow safe use of
	 CAS.
 
	  Section 13 - Mis. Considerations
 
	  13.2 Dispatcher - single vrs multiple dispatcher. Does
	 affect/impact BACK-UP sceme, but should be addresed from
	 detail design perspective by ISIS design.
 
	   13.4 ISIS library upgrade.
 
	 If we don't rewrite isis libs then we lose abiliyt for
	 hierarchical recovery.  (i.e.	we can`t have option to back
	 up by going to back up code (reload) instead of switch to
	 backup processor.  But..  This is a new and better feature
	 not a replication of existing back up capability, so,...  New
	 library packages are nice but not essential and might be
	 considered to be optional development.  (There is some issue
	 of compatiblity with all interfaces if we do do new
	 libraries).
 
	 13.6 Potential problem with 2 card systems as we can have
	 cofessions but not accusations.
 
	 Interchassis communciation.
 
    ==>  Issue here is what form of backward compatiblity to support
	 interchassis communication developed in phase 2 is required?
	 Is it ok, for example, to require that new phase 2 CPU cards
	 be installed to permit interchassis comm? It is prob'ly NOT
	 ok to require that the chassis be replaced, or that all cards
	 become obsolete when interchassis comm is required.
 
	 We need to take this up with marketing during spec review.

			Async Study for Skywalker


			    February 23, 1987
				  by:
				Paul Chu,
				Dennis Jonas,
				John Kopf,
				Kevin Sinclair

Objective:  To determine the most expedient method to provide conventional
	(non-SIO) ASYNC support to slots running in the Skywalker Environment,
	without requiring modifications to those slots regarding I/O driver
	protocols supported.

Constraints imposed:  The facility MUST be available by Feb '88;  it MUST
	use the IOC and the SCC-chip (i.e., no new card development).

Acceptible options:  Requiring new code be developed, for both IOC and ISIS,
	is expected.

Results:

	ISIS will provide the necessary capabilities to translate between
"normal" and new I/O driver protocols.

	A desirable goal of any new Async-I/O Driver protocol is to provide
a complete set of functionality (both normal and SIO) in such a way that, in
the future, products could migrate toward using the new protocol without a need
for retaining driver-dependent protocols -- THIS IS NOT, HOWEVER, A FORMAL
SKYWALKER GOAL;  it is merely highly desirable from the view of application
support.

	The SCC's inability to support independent input- and output-clock
rates means that split baud-rates can NOT be supported (e.g., 75/1200).


Assumptions and Reasoning leading to these Results:

	It is assumed that the the IOC will be based upon the existing
TSI code;  in particular, drivers for SIO/ASYNC emulation already are
defined and exist.  However, these do not provide either the auto-baud
detect or the output-delay capabilities required of "normal" Async.  It
is not clear if they support Break-generation either.  These are all
capabilities which are required of normal Async, and thus necessitat
that an alternative set of drivers be developed for IOC.  However, TSI
-- and thus hopefully IOC -- support alternative drivers.  The particular
problems associated with auto-baud detection in association with a USART
have been successfully addressed in the ATC product, and thus many of those
algorithms can be readily incorporated into new normal-Async drivers.

	A more complex problem is associated with the IOC's communication
with ISIS and the slot.  Neither the current normal nor SIO Async
implementation is general enough for the capabilities required;  each
provides some of the requirements, but these do not overlap enough.

	Normal Async is based upon input and output rings, but incorporate
both bit-arrays, and incrementable counters -- these are not safe in a
multi-processor environment, since they require "atomic" (read-modify-write)
operations.

	SIO/Async suffers from CCW-oriented output, and a strange form
of input (where characters are input to half-words in an 8-hw buffer, but
the buffer is timeout-driven).  It also lacks the special features required.

	The most reasonable implementation for a new Async is for each
port to communicate to IOC via a ring of 16-bit "characters" for each
direction of communications;  each ring would have a 16-bit fill and
empty cursor, and a data-area whose length is defined by the ISIS-end.
Eack 16-bit data-field would contain two bytes of information; the first,
if non-zero, would specify a control-function, the second the control-value,
or the data if the first was zero (this is similar to SIO-input, where
<0,0> is data-zero, but <1,0> indicates Break).  This communication mechanism
is "safe", in that only one processor writes each field, and the other only
reads that field;  it does suffer in that bit-wise polling is not available,
and instead each such ring must be polled by the receiver in turn, to determine
if there is anything to do.

	It does have the advantage that such polling could be performed by
the ISIS Foreground (in place of the normal Async polling), and then data
could be transfered between the ISIS/IOC rings and the conventional Async
rings of the slot for normal Async Emulation (such activity between ISIS
Foreground and the Slot IS safe, as long as only a single processor is
involved).

	It also has the advantage that a slot could use the mechanism
directly, in future implementations (retrofitting this functionality to
Engine-ISIS would permit full portability of the capability, without the
need for seperate driver-protocols for Async and SIO within products such
as CONSAT and TYMCOM).

	With respect to split baud-rate support, the committee concluded
that while such support is necessary, it is precluded using the SCC chip.
Alternatives require a new card:  one possibility is the use of the "cirrus"
chip proposal;  a second is to use SCC, with one channel for each direction
of I/O;  a third is to develop a card with an Engine, executing the existing
microcode, and performing strictly as a USART!


Async Control Information:

	The existing implementation of ISIS Async currently supports the
following functions:

    o	Generate delay (units of 1/30th second)...leave output in marking-
	state for that long).
    o	Set input baud-rate;
    o	Set output baud-rate:
	(these both present a code which currently selects:
	75 Baud Ascii (i.e., 8-bit);
	10 CPS Ascii;
	15 CPS Ascii;
	30 CPS Ascii;
	40 CPS Ascii;
	60 CPS Ascii;
	120 CPS Ascii;
	240 CPS Ascii;
	480 CPS Ascii;
	960 CPS Ascii;
	10 CPS Ascii (at 300 baud...generate delay between characters);
	10 CPS Ascii (at 1200 baud...generate delay between characters);
	14.7 CPS (2741..7-bit);
	30 CPS (3767..7-bit);
	50 Baud (Baudot..5-bit);
	75 Baud (Baudot..5-bit).
    o	Enter TID mode.
    o	enter data-mtde.
    o	enable.
    o	RS up.
    o	RS down.
    o	Generate 0.083 seconds of output Break-state.
    o	TID mode detected char at assumed baud-rate specified (char observed
	at that baud-rate follows).
    o	Break-begin detected.
    o	Break-end detected.

	Desirable enhancements:
    o	Generate N units of output Break.
    o	Detected N units of input Break.
    o	Echo-control.
    o	Parity-control.

	In addition, it will be desirable to define the Async environment
such that the full set of RS232 signals can be individually manipulated.
The individual pin can be accessible without sharing the pin among different
applications like the existing implementation.  This is especially useful
in the applications where software flow-control is not possible and hardware
handshaking is required to secure the traffic without losing data.

	It would also be desirable if the new Driver-protocol imposed no
hardware-dependent constraints, such as a need to explicitly write control-
registers;  such constraints already are proving awkward in the migration
from SIO to SCC-chips.

Subject: Potentail problem with current IOC implementation 


I have encountered a problem-areain the design of the IOC.  It is something
that, for now, we can live with, but it reduces robustness, and should thus
be taken into account reasonably soon.

The IOC firmware currently has a number of different "drivers" (e.g.,
Sync-emulation, SIO/Async-emulation, etc.).  The selection of driver is
predicated upon the "protocol" value specified in an Engine-originated
CCW.  The problem is that the dirver is selected at the time that the
CCW is interpreted...it is possible, for example, that an error in a
HDLC-intended CCW might instead specify "bisync", and thus cause the
Sync-emulation driver to be installed -- if ISIS does not have Sync-
support, none of the expected data-structures will be in the Engine's
memory, with probable catastropic results.

The solution would be to specify protocol(s) as part of the initial
"connect" operation (perhaps by ISIS passing the SVC-number), and not
allowing certain protocol-changes.

Since TSI is not expected to be a debugging environment (instead running
only released code) this is unlikely to be a problem there initially.
However, the possibility of an alternate Async (or other) protocols would
certainly necessitate this capability.

Bill,
Yes, another design team (3 actually) has been commissioned.  You are 
assigned to the one to detail out Rodney.  I will send to wrs@c39 copies
of the memo's commissioning the work groups.  There will be four others
assigned to yours.

Hope you cold is better.

(1) did you ever get my plessy memo a few days ago? it had about 6
    points, including a new bug in their TAS processing.  Dave said
    he did not get it.  i used the skywalker dist list name on eunix,
    perhaps incorrectly.

(2) dave fixed the bad cover page onthe document.  it was the
    VM macro to set margins (top and bottom), perhaps incompatible
    with standard defs.

  Here are the minutes from the status review meeting
  of 26 February.
 
  Agenda:
 
  I.  Old items
  II. New items
  III.Other new items
 
 
  I. OLD ITEMS
 
  Old items were reviewed, including action items from previous
  meeting.
 
  1b. Project schedule updates for firmware and diagnostics
  will be available next week (diagnostics) and after final
  Rodney review (firmware).
 
  1c. Engine/68k debugger proposal will be provided on 5 March,
  incorporated into the Translator GED.
 
  1e. Mechanical engineering  concept review was held. Marketing
  has expressed renewed interest in Pegasus, and concern regarding
  cabling plan. Dave requested that if there is a serious problem
  with the ME concept, Marketing should notify Engineering at once.
  Mike Rebmann took action item to get Marketing input back to
  NTD.
 
  <On Friday 27 Feb, a conference call with Marketing/Engineering
  took place.  Marketing agreed to deliver to NTD by Tuesday,
  February 3rd, a written statement of marketing interests regarding
  packaging and cabling>
 
  1f.  IOC/HW functional specification review took place
  Agreement on principle achieved.  Document will be updated
  for new distribution 3 march. Goal to approve for Marketing
  distribution 5 March.
 
  2a. Update to draft project plan (first submitted for
  core team review in early January) is distributed for
  review. Note that there have been a number of changes to
  this document. Last chance review comments due 2 March.
 
  2b.  SCCS class will be prepared by Michael's staff. Michael
  will send out class description, 1 rep from each of the
  development groups should attend class. Description of class
  to be distributed 2 March, class has been scheduled for
  Friday, 13 March, Bldg. F conference room.
 
  2f.  Trade shows.  QA needs to be involved.  Marketing has asked
  us to build 12 machines over and above our own use .  QA has
  asked for a SKYWALKER machine from pilot as well.  Ken is to
  request that Rebmann specify what level of functionality is
  required for the trade shows.
  Action to Mike Rebmann to explore this issue with Marketing.
 
  RODNEY issues are action items defined in the
  meeting that need resources allocated to them.
 
  3.  ASYNC I/O We need resource allocation for ASYNC I/O
  study.  This study includes evaluation of one or more
  strategies for handling autobaud, 19.2, and SIO async
  emulation in SKYWALKER, and evaluation of implications of
  strategies on CONSAT, SIO Emulation, and Firmware
  development.
  ASYNC I/O study report distributed.
 
  4.  DISK Controller We need to expeditiously make a decision
  on a controller for SKYWALKER because the controller
  characteristics impact design and hence schedule issues.
 
  Controller/disk/file system study report distributed.
 
  5.  Utilities for File and disk system We need resource
  allocation to define utilities required to support file and
  disk system for RODNEY.
 
  ==> Same as 4 above.
 
  6.  Down line load protocol We need resource allocation to
  evaluate and define a DLL protocol for SKYWALKER.
 
  This was incorporated into the Rodney design effort.
 
  7.  PORT numbers/accounting We need Mike Rebmann to put
  together a taskforce to define accounting requirements for
  SKYWALKER.
 
  This requires further definition of what we need from Mike.
 
  9.  We need to address MAXCAGE and Model# use with Marketing
  During review process we can discuss model number use with
  Marketing.
 
  10. Availability/requirements for test beds need to be defined
  for Engineering.
 
  Project schedules for each group should identify what test
  facilities they require and WHEN they are required such that
  we can share resources.
 
  ==> Everyone. Include this issue in project schedule updates.
 
  11. Resources have been allocated to SKYWALKER design teams.
 
  Remember, project schedules due monday 2 march.
 
  Next week's meeting is scheduled for Thursday, 5 March, 1:30 pm.

	Unaddressed Problem within Skywalker
		  John Kopf
		March 10, 1987

A potential problem area within Skywalker has to do with a processor
(and its memory) "disappearing" from the VME.  While attention has been
paid to detecting this condition (and eventually removing that processor
from access), no corresponding attention has been paid to the recovery
required from the process which made the (legal, but unsuccessful)
access in the first place.

Consider the following simple scenario:  processor A passes a message-
pointer to processor B (using IPCF), but fails before processor B can
make use of this pointer.  When B eventually gets around to processing
that pointer (remember, it might have a queue of such pointers to process
before it gets to the critical one, so that some delay is inevitable),
it encounters the buss-error.  However, it has likely climbed deep into
its stack before making te attempt.

How does processor B recover from this situation?  There are likely to
be a number of objects that need "clean-up" in addition to the stack
(e.g., locks).  Processor B probably should avoid crashing the process
which made the reference, if possible, but this is only possible if there
exists some sort of "audit-trail" to permit recovery.  Is it the processes'
responsibility to perform this recovery?  Will there be some way to even
inform the process that the condition has occured?

This is a significant issue, since there will be a number of arbitrary
processes which will reference VME (e.g., All IOC drivers, Dispatcher,
other I/O such as disk, and even products such as split Node-code and
Supervisor).

I believe that this is a significant issue, which should be discussed.

     SUBJECT: Observation on IOC Addressing
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     This is the formalization and retransmition  of  an  earlier
     note which seems to have become lost.  In section 2.2 of the
     current RODNEY document (there  does  not  seem  to  be  any
     revision  assigned  to  this  document) there is a statement
     about "an area suitable for a common offset for all  boards,
     e.g.  (base)+2000x".  I read this as an example.  In section
     3 of the same document the references to offset 2000 seem to
     be   stating  this  as  not  an  example  but  as  a  design
     requirement.  However, Table 1 --  IOC  Memory  Map  clearly
     shows  that  there  is no usable memory (RAM or ROM) at this
     address.  I recommend that RODNEY specify clearly the offset
     for  this pointer / table and that it be consistent with the
     current IOC design and as many of the current set of CPUs as
     possible.

The point John brings out about processes needing to be able to recover
from the failures of other processors, particularly from bus errors is
indeed very important.  It was discussed in detail in by the architectural
design team, but it appears to have escaped being clearly documented.  Here
is a summary of what we feel the policy should be on handling bus errors:

Bus errors must be expected to occur from time to time due to heavy bus
utilization resulting in a local bus timeout while waiting for arbitration
of the VME bus.  This is not necessarily an error condition.  The transfer
should be retried some number of times, possibly with some delay in
between.  If after several attempts (about 3 I should think) without
success, the event should be logged and an accusation should be issued for
the processor being accessed.  If the transfer succeeds after some number
of tries, the event should also be logged as a statistic indicating
excessive, possibly pathalogic, bus utilitzaion.

When Rodney makes VME transfers, it will take over the bus error trap
before the transfer and restore it following the transfer so it can
implement the above logic.  It will be up to ISIS (or whatever) to
implement a similar strategy that is compatible with its management of the
MMU and user mode processes.  In particular, the method for ISIS (or
whatever) to notify the user mode process that a non-recoverable bus error
has occured is not obvious - perhaps a software interrupt.  The user code
could make use of the setjmp() and longjmp() routines to recover from
errors which occur deep inside nested code.

I am confused by your statement about "no usable memory ( RAM or ROM )" at
base + 2000x.  The table 4. IOC memory map of the March 6 IOC Hardware
Functional Specification shows ROM (presumably EPROM) at base + 0000x
extending through base + 1FFFFx.  Rodney addresses the possibility of the
location being in ROM as opposed to RAM by allowing one level of
indirection.

All other processors being considered have RAM at base + 0 for at least
one magabyte.  We chose the 2000x offset to allow room for interrupt
vectors and such.

Please let us know if we need to change the offset, it was not included
as an example.  Thanks -Bill

For the AIlist.

Remember the Viet Cong?  Well, I'll get back to them in a minute.

This memo announces the formation of a new project, the Humor Interface 
Project, sometimes known in revolutionary circles as the Interface-esE 
liberation Army, or, IEA, (pronounced at the top of your lungs, as  
EYEEE-EEEEE-AHHHHH... while drumming your chest). The members seek no official 
status whatsoever and will accept none when they succeed.

I am not a member of this group but have been retained by them as their 
publicist for an indecent sum of money.  They have requested that I set before 
the public their noble raisin d'etre [sic], their altruistic intentions, their 
anti-establishment methods, and of course, their consulting fee scale and 
answering service number.

This project formed at a recent conference during the "HCI and All Possible 
Universes" session. Or was it the "HCI and All Possible Universes Containing 
Alcohol" session?  Anyway, the group intends to implement, study, reflect and 
publish about humorous interface techniques.

The idea started with the question, "Suppose we tried to make a computer act 
like Robin Williams or Jonathan Winters?  Not staged humor, not joke telling, 
not static cartoons but interactive... contextual humor, adlibbing on material 
provided by the combination of user and system programmer?"  From there things 
went straight down or straight up depending upon your perspective.

The group shared their favorites.  Windows that crack or melt into a slag heap.
 The MacIntosh  IBM DOS emulator that, when fired up, begins to put up a zippy 
MacIntosh screen, stops halfway down the screen to declare, "Oops?  Sorry.  You
wanted 195Os technology."  It then goes into command line mode.  The supposed 
unused ROM hook in the Mac that would have caused a monkey to dance across the 
screen ONCE upon the 7698th (or whatever) boot of the machine.  Insects 
crawling around the screen.

As you read this, project programmers in ski-masks are already coding up:

ELUSIVE MENU:  When the mouse cursor enters such menus, the menus dodge away 
while insulting the user with appropriate language and gestures.  Somebody 
informed us, this is just like the Mac Bomb program.

CRASHING WINDOWS:  You begin to move a window.  Suddenly it accelerates out of 
your control up toward the corner of the screen. When it reaches the corner, it
smashes to pieces, falling to the bottom of the screen.  Appropriate sounds 
effects are heard.  Email is sent to the site manager blaming you for the 
broken window.

AEROBIC WINDOWS:  You begin to move a window and suddenly it accelerates out of
your control bouncing around the screen faster and faster.  It finally slows 
down an sits on your screen off in the direction you were moving it, but 
huffing and puffing, sort of expanding in and out.  You begin working again, 
it's breathing slows and stops after a few moments.

FONTS: that scream, melt, sigh or beg as you delete them.  Giggle as you 
transpose characters.   Yawn when you come back to them in the morning.  Burp 
when you edit them after lunch.

PEOPLE INSIDE THE MONITOR:  You get an error.  A large face leans in from the 
left, gives you a "Lettermanesque look", like he's got a horrible flavor on his
tongue, and then leans back out of the monitor.

ENCRYPTION WAVES undulate through your current text buffer occasionally 
stopping at your cursor to make stupid demands.  They go away for a while when 
you give in.

GIGANTIC SCREEN-FILLING BODY PART MOUSE CURSOR ICONS:  You can move them no 
more than a half inch in each direction.  Need the Interface-esE liberation 
Army say more?

The group suspects that a lot could learned about the un-obvious communication 
possibilities of computational media by analyzing successful and failed humor 
attempts.  At least unspoken expectations of interface experience should stand 
out in bold relief as humor violates them.  Misunderstandings of those same 
expectations and experiences should stand out as humor fails.

Back to the Viet Cong.  Remember that a large percentage of the South 
Vietnamese Government was V.C.?  Its the same way with the Humorous Interface 
Project.  You're part of it.  We're collecting examples of humorous interface 
techniques.  They might be implemented or not  If you know of some, please send
them along to will@mcc.com .  We'd much appreciate it.  At sometime, somehow, 
we'll publish the best of what you send in back out into the community.  Send 
code if you like.

I'll end with a quote from the HIP group.

"The project is putting together a macro, With-Humorous-Interface. Dare you run
inside it?   Who knows what you'll see and hear next time you cycle through 
text called back from the kill ring.  Text YOU killed."

   Subject: One of the NEXT Logical Steps in Weaponry (possible humor)

   <Weapons Systems>

      Cooperative Weapons

         First it was vanilla weapons, followed by smart bombs and then bright 
         weapons.  Now, or is it tomorrow, Cooperative Weapons (CW) are to be 
         here.  It is the logical next step.  Can't you imagine firing a CW 
         that consists of multiple warheads and multiple other weapons.  They 
         all communicate with each other.  They pick out a target or are given 
         one from the field.  They will then analyze the target's moves, 
         working cooperatively they force the target to manuver itself into a 
         corner and then one or more CWs destroy it.

         The CW development project might also be called the Sheppard Defense

            I wonder what the cost of building a actual concrete or 
            "high-impact" plastic dome over the entire US, with two additional 
            domes for Hawaii and Alaska.  Gee, maybe it would be cost 
            competitive with the SDI dome.

   Subject: Computer-lighting board nearly causes WWIII

       With the recent discussion of computer-controlled lighting boards, I ask
   "How resistant to Electron Magnetic Interference should these boards be?"  
   Not such as academic point as one would think.  An audio engineer friend of 
   mine related this incident:

       He was running sound for the Broadway production of "A Chorus Line" a 
   few years back.  Then-president Ford came to a performance. Secret Service 
   men everywhere.  One by the sound board, one by lighting, etc.  All is quiet
   until about the mid-point of the play.  Then the Secret Service man standing
   by the lighting board (an early Nicholson model I believe) got a call on his
   walkie-talkie.  To reply, he depressed the push-to-talk switch, sending out 
   a couple of watts of RF, and Presto! the entire theatre was plunged into 
   inky darkness.  Chaos ensues, PERT guns are drawn, etc., etc.  It completely
   wiped out the CMOS memory of the lighting board.

       Questions: should mil-spec EMI resistance be built into only military 
   equipment?  Who would have thought that a lowly theater lighting board would
   be of critical national importance if for only a few moments?  Could a 
   high-tech John Wilkes Booth use some knowledge such as this for the next 
   asassination attempt?

   Subject: Computerized telephone sales pitch meets emergency broadcast number

       About 18 months ago here in Atlanta, a string of phone-related accidents
   caused much confusion and consternation in the lives of at least one family.

       To begin with: one of these "computerized" telephone sales pitches was 
   calling through a mid-town exchange offering "you have won a free Bahamas 
   vacation.  Just call xxx-xxxx!" As it was walking through the exchange, it 
   hit an unlisted number.  This phone was an emergency override number into 
   the metro Atlanta cable television system.  In the case of extreme 
   emergency, the Mayor or head of the CD would call this number.  The incoming
   phone line would override the audio portion of ALL cable channels currently 
   in use.  It was about 10:30 a.m., so there wasn't as big an audience as if 
   it had been prime-time, but yes, all of Atlanta's cable subscribers were 
   informed they had just won a free trip.  Chaos ensued.  Especially for the 
   poor family whose telephone number was one digit different from the 
   call-back number.  Through no fault of their own they got one call every 20 
   seconds all that day.

       Reducing the RISK of this repeating itself could take place at any step:
   Legislation limiting "computerized" sales pitches (this hasn't been done), a
   security code on the emergency phone number (this has been done) and for the
   poor lady getting the wrong numbers, not much.  If any RISKS readers are 
   unfamiliar with the design process that went into the design of the 
   Touch-Tone (TM) keypad, it makes interesting reading. The designs were a 
   speed vs. accuracy trade-off.  The lady could only wish that The Labs had 
   put a higher priority on accuracy.

   This was sort of an information-age Orson Welles "War of the Worlds".

   Subject: Risk in ``High'' Financing

   Comment: I thought you might enjoy this excerpt from the RISKS digest! 
   --Bi// Originally-From: Michael Wester <wester@aleph0.unm> Originally-To: 
   risks@csl.sri.com

   Excerpt from ``Risky moments in the money markets'' in U.S. News & World 
   Report

   of March 2, 1987

      According to the New York Fed, Wall Street's average daily volume of bank
   wire transactions totals at least $1.2 trillion---an amount equal to one 
   quarter of the U.S.'s total annual economic activity---and could be as much 
   as $500 billion a day higher, though no one really knows.  Even at the lower
   figure, that's five times the daily flow since the start of the decade.  
   Each year, transaction volume leaps by nearly 25%, or double the annual 
   growth rate in the 1970s.  [...]

      The obvious fear is a financial accident that could bring the system 
   down. Banks must settle accounts daily, and a failure to pay up by one could
   cause a chain reaction of problems for others.  Close calls in settling are 
   more common than is generally known.  A Federal Reserve Board official 
   acknowledges the number of ``breathless moments'' averages 10 a year.

      One of those scary scenarios developed in 1985, when the government- 
   securities market was severely disrupted by a computer software ``bug'' at 
   the bank of New York, preventing settlement for a day and a half.  Only a 
   $23.6 BILLION [my emphasis] emergency loan by the Fed got the wheels 
   unstuck.  [...]

      Each day, billions of transactions move from country to country over a 
   pair of wire systems: The Clearing House Interbank Payments System, called 
   CHIPS, operated by 140 banks specializing in international finance, and the 
   Federal Reserve Systems's Fedwire, which links 7000 domestic banks and does 
   the bookkeeping for Treasury securities transfers among banks.

      The electronic linkages make it possible for money to whiz from computer 
   to computer so quickly that the same dollars can be used to finance up to 
   seven deals a day, compared to two in times past when paper checks were the 
   principal method of payment.  [...]

      One danger signal: Last year's daily transaction value was 24 times 
   greater than the amount of reserves banks had on deposit with the Federal 
   Reserve System, up from a 9.4 multiple in 1980.

      It has become common practice for banks to go deeply into hock each day, 
   often exceeding total assets in anticipation of payments they will receive 
   before it is time to balance their books at closing.  Such ``daylight 
   overdrafts'' account for as much as $110 billion to $120 billion on the 
   Fedwire and Chips.  [...]

      What makes the climbing debt even more unsettling is that payments move 
   over CHIPS and Fedwire systems that [Gerald] Corrigan [, head of the New 
   York Federal Reserve Bank,] describes as a ``hodgepodge of facilities, 
   equipment, software and controls that have little in common with each 
   other.''  Even if the hodgepodge is capable of handling the flow now, 
   Corrigan and others worry about it remaining adequate if the transaction 
   volumes continues to grow as astronomically as it has in recent years.  
   ``The money spent on computer systems has not kept pace with the tremendous 
   explosion in electronic payments,'' says a Fed official.

Bill,
When I received your call, I had not as yet heard anything about the
authorization change.  Upon a brief investigation, it turns out that
marketing had decided that there were too many people mucking about
with the system whom they could not keep track of, so they reduced
authorizations.  I asked whether either of the two folks involved
knew who you were, and they did not.  An unfortunate case of the company
becoming part of a monolithic bureaucracy.  Anyway, they should
have contacted you and reinstated your level of access.

Contact me if the problem is not resolved.

SUBJECT>   Username Restrictions for all Validations Programs


-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Certain additional characters are being reserved for Supervisor use in up
coming enhancements. Consequently, we are restricting the use of these
special characters in usernames (not passwords).

The Tymnet Validations department is currently in the process of locating
customers using the restricted  characters and requesting they remove
them from existing usernames.

In view of this, we are requesting that TYMVALIDATE be changed to disallow
these characters in future username validations. Since there are fewer
allowable characters than restricted characters, only the allowable chara-
cters are listed below. They are:

                       # $ * & . - /


All others are to be restricted.
                                                                Page  2


We would also like TYMVALIDATE to disallow a period (.) as the first character
of a username.

Since we do not wish to continue to allow these characters in usernames, 
we are requesting this change be included in the next version of Tymvalidate,
if not sooner.

These same restrictions should be written into USRVAL also. Since these res-
trictions are due to Supervisor enhancements, all programs that place usernames
in the Master User Directory should have these restrictions.

There is a reason that you may not want to implement the control x immediately.
PVC currently stuffs all of the bits for the options and the TID (if AID)
into one word.  There are 24 bits for options and currently all but a couple
are used and I believe that the used bits were once used but are no longer
used.  Thus, you may want to modify the macros and the code and give yourself
another word of bits.

Also, if the control X is wanted for an ALO PVC then the control X couild
be put into the UTEXT macro as part of the username.  UTEXT("17swedel:39;haha).
