     group       =  phrase ":" [#mailbox] ";"

     mailbox     =  addr-spec                    ; simple address
                 /  phrase route-addr            ; name & addr-spec

     route-addr  =  "<" [route] addr-spec ">"

     addr-spec   =  local-part "@" domain        ; global address

     local-part  =  word *("." word)             ; uninterpreted
                                                 ; case-preserved

     domain      =  sub-domain *("." sub-domain)

     sub-domain  =  domain-ref / domain-literal

     domain-ref  =  atom                         ; symbolic reference

     6.2.  SEMANTICS

          A mailbox receives mail.  It is a  conceptual  entity  which
     does  not necessarily pertain to file storage.  For example, some
     sites may choose to print mail on their line printer and  deliver
     the output to the addressee's desk.

          A mailbox specification comprises a person, system  or  pro-
     cess name reference, a domain-dependent string, and a name-domain
     reference.  The name reference is optional and is usually used to
     indicate  the  human name of a recipient.  The name-domain refer-
     ence specifies a sequence of sub-domains.   The  domain-dependent
     string is uninterpreted, except by the final sub-domain; the rest
     of the mail service merely transmits it as a literal string.

     6.2.1.  DOMAINS

        A name-domain is a set of registered (mail)  names.   A  name-
        domain  specification  resolves  to  a subordinate name-domain
        specification  or  to  a  terminal  domain-dependent   string.
        Hence,  domain  specification  is  extensible,  permitting any
        number of registration levels.


     August 13, 1982              - 27 -                      RFC #822


 
     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        Name-domains model a global, logical, hierarchical  addressing
        scheme.   The  model is logical, in that an address specifica-
        tion is related to name registration and  is  not  necessarily
        tied  to  transmission  path.   The  model's  hierarchy  is  a
        directed graph, called an in-tree, such that there is a single
        path  from  the root of the tree to any node in the hierarchy.
        If more than one path actually exists, they are considered  to
        be different addresses.

        The root node is common to all addresses; consequently, it  is
        not  referenced.   Its  children  constitute "top-level" name-
        domains.  Usually, a service has access to its own full domain
        specification and to the names of all top-level name-domains.

        The "top" of the domain addressing hierarchy -- a child of the
        root  --  is  indicated  by  the right-most field, in a domain
        specification.  Its child is specified to the left, its  child
        to the left, and so on.

        Some groups provide formal registration services;  these  con-
        stitute   name-domains   that  are  independent  logically  of
        specific machines.  In addition, networks and machines  impli-
        citly  compose name-domains, since their membership usually is
        registered in name tables.

        In the case of formal registration, an organization implements
        a  (distributed)  data base which provides an address-to-route
        mapping service for addresses of the form:

                         person@registry.organization

        Note that "organization" is a logical  entity,  separate  from
        any particular communication network.

        A mechanism for accessing "organization" is universally avail-
        able.   That mechanism, in turn, seeks an instantiation of the
        registry; its location is not indicated in the address specif-
        ication.   It  is assumed that the system which operates under
        the name "organization" knows how to find a subordinate regis-
        try.  The registry will then use the "person" string to deter-
        mine where to send the mail specification.

        The latter,  network-oriented  case  permits  simple,  direct,
        attachment-related address specification, such as:

                              user@host.network

        Once the network is accessed, it is expected  that  a  message
        will  go  directly  to the host and that the host will resolve

     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        the user name, placing the message in the user's mailbox.

     6.2.2.  ABBREVIATED DOMAIN SPECIFICATION

        Since any number of  levels  is  possible  within  the  domain
        hierarchy,  specification  of  a  fully  qualified address can
        become inconvenient.  This standard permits abbreviated domain
        specification, in a special case:

            For the address of  the  sender,  call  the  left-most
            sub-domain  Level  N.   In a header address, if all of
            the sub-domains above (i.e., to the right of) Level  N
            are  the same as those of the sender, then they do not
            have to appear in the specification.   Otherwise,  the
            address must be fully qualified.

            This feature is subject  to  approval  by  local  sub-
            domains.   Individual  sub-domains  may  require their
            member systems, which originate mail, to provide  full
            domain  specification only.  When permitted, abbrevia-
            tions may be present  only  while  the  message  stays
            within the sub-domain of the sender.

            Use of this mechanism requires the sender's sub-domain
            to reserve the names of all top-level domains, so that
            full specifications can be distinguished from abbrevi-
            ated specifications.

        For example, if a sender's address is:

                 sender@registry-A.registry-1.organization-X

        and one recipient's address is:

                recipient@registry-B.registry-1.organization-X

        and another's is:

                recipient@registry-C.registry-2.organization-X

        then ".registry-1.organization-X" need not be specified in the
        the  message,  but  "registry-C.registry-2"  DOES  have  to be
        specified.  That is, the first two addresses may  be  abbrevi-
        ated, but the third address must be fully specified.

        When a message crosses a domain boundary, all  addresses  must
        be  specified  in  the  full format, ending with the top-level
        name-domain in the right-most field.  It is the responsibility
        of  mail  forwarding services to ensure that addresses conform

     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        with this requirement.  In the case of abbreviated  addresses,
        the  relaying  service must make the necessary expansions.  It
        should be noted that it often is difficult for such a  service
        to locate all occurrences of address abbreviations.  For exam-
        ple, it will not be possible to find such abbreviations within
        the  body  of  the  message.   The "Return-Path" field can aid
        recipients in recovering from these errors.

        Note:  When passing any portion of an addr-spec onto a process
               which  does  not interpret data according to this stan-
               dard (e.g., mail protocol servers).  There must  be  NO
               LWSP-chars  preceding  or  following the at-sign or any
               delimiting period ("."), such as  shown  in  the  above
               examples,   and   only  ONE  SPACE  between  contiguous
               <word>s.

     6.2.3.  DOMAIN TERMS

        A domain-ref must be THE official name of a registry, network,
        or  host.   It  is  a  symbolic  reference, within a name sub-
        domain.  At times, it is necessary to bypass standard  mechan-
        isms  for  resolving  such  references,  using  more primitive
        information, such as a network host address  rather  than  its
        associated host name.

        To permit such references, this standard provides the  domain-
        literal  construct.   Its contents must conform with the needs
        of the sub-domain in which it is interpreted.

        Domain-literals which refer to domains within the ARPA  Inter-
        net  specify  32-bit  Internet addresses, in four 8-bit fields
        noted in decimal, as described in Request for  Comments  #820,
        "Assigned Numbers."  For example:

                                 [10.0.3.19]

        Note:  THE USE OF DOMAIN-LITERALS IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.  It
               is  permitted  only  as  a means of bypassing temporary
               system limitations, such as name tables which  are  not
               complete.

        The names of "top-level" domains, and  the  names  of  domains
        under  in  the  ARPA Internet, are registered with the Network
        Information Center, SRI International, Menlo Park, California.

     6.2.4.  DOMAIN-DEPENDENT LOCAL STRING

        The local-part of an  addr-spec  in  a  mailbox  specification
        (i.e.,  the  host's  name for the mailbox) is understood to be


     August 13, 1982              - 30 -                      RFC #822


 
     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        whatever the receiving mail protocol server allows.  For exam-
        ple,  some systems do not understand mailbox references of the
        form "P. D. Q. Bach", but others do.

        This specification treats periods (".") as lexical separators.
        Hence,  their  presence  in  local-parts which are not quoted-
        strings, is detected.   However,  such  occurrences  carry  NO
        semantics.  That is, if a local-part has periods within it, an
        address parser will divide the local-part into several tokens,
        but  the  sequence  of  tokens will be treated as one uninter-
        preted unit.  The sequence  will  be  re-assembled,  when  the
        address is passed outside of the system such as to a mail pro-
        tocol service.

        For example, the address:

                           First.Last@Registry.Org

        is legal and does not require the local-part to be  surrounded
        with  quotation-marks.   (However,  "First  Last" DOES require
        quoting.)  The local-part of the address, when passed  outside
        of  the  mail  system,  within  the  Registry.Org  domain,  is
        "First.Last", again without quotation marks.

     6.2.5.  BALANCING LOCAL-PART AND DOMAIN

        In some cases, the boundary between local-part and domain  can
        be  flexible.  The local-part may be a simple string, which is
        used for the final determination of the  recipient's  mailbox.
        All  other  levels  of  reference  are, therefore, part of the
        domain.

        For some systems, in the case of abbreviated reference to  the
        local  and  subordinate  sub-domains,  it  may  be possible to
        specify only one reference within the domain  part  and  place
        the  other,  subordinate  name-domain  references  within  the
        local-part.  This would appear as:

                        mailbox.sub1.sub2@this-domain

        Such a specification would be acceptable  to  address  parsers
        which  conform  to  RFC  #733,  but  do not support this newer
        Internet standard.  While contrary to the intent of this stan-
        dard, the form is legal.

        Also, some sub-domains have a specification syntax which  does
        not conform to this standard.  For example:

                      sub-net.mailbox@sub-domain.domain


     August 13, 1982              - 31 -                      RFC #822


 
     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        uses a different parsing  sequence  for  local-part  than  for
        domain.

        Note:  As a rule,  the  domain  specification  should  contain
               fields  which  are  encoded  according to the syntax of
               this standard and which contain  generally-standardized
               information.   The local-part specification should con-
               tain only that portion of the  address  which  deviates
               from the form or intention of the domain field.

     6.2.6.  MULTIPLE MAILBOXES

        An individual may have several mailboxes and wish  to  receive
        mail  at  whatever  mailbox  is  convenient  for the sender to
        access.  This standard does not provide a means of  specifying
        "any member of" a list of mailboxes.

        A set of individuals may wish to receive mail as a single unit
        (i.e.,  a  distribution  list).  The <group> construct permits
        specification of such a list.  Recipient mailboxes are  speci-
        fied  within  the  bracketed  part (":" - ";").  A copy of the
        transmitted message is to be  sent  to  each  mailbox  listed.
        This  standard  does  not  permit  recursive  specification of
        groups within groups.

        While a list must be named, it is not required that  the  con-
        tents  of  the  list be included.  In this case, the <address>
        serves only as an indication of group distribution  and  would
        appear in the form:

                                    name:;

        Some mail  services  may  provide  a  group-list  distribution
        facility,  accepting  a single mailbox reference, expanding it
        to the full distribution list, and relaying the  mail  to  the
        list's  members.   This standard provides no additional syntax
        for indicating such a  service.   Using  the  <group>  address
        alternative,  while listing one mailbox in it, can mean either
        that the mailbox reference will be expanded to a list or  that
        there is a group with one member.

     6.2.7.  EXPLICIT PATH SPECIFICATION

        At times, a  message  originator  may  wish  to  indicate  the
        transmission  path  that  a  message  should  follow.  This is
        called source routing.  The normal addressing scheme, used  in
        an  addr-spec,  is  carefully separated from such information;
        the <route> portion of a route-addr is provided for such occa-
        sions.  It specifies the sequence of hosts and/or transmission


     August 13, 1982              - 32 -                      RFC #822


 
     Standard for ARPA Internet Text Messages


        services that are  to  be  traversed.   Both  domain-refs  and
        domain-literals may be used.

        Note:  The use of source routing is discouraged.   Unless  the
               sender has special need of path restriction, the choice
               of transmission route should be left to the mail  tran-
               sport service.

     6.3.  RESERVED ADDRESS

          It often is necessary to send mail to a site, without  know-
     ing  any  of its valid addresses.  For example, there may be mail
     system dysfunctions, or a user may wish to find  out  a  person's
     correct address, at that site.

          This standard specifies a single, reserved  mailbox  address
     (local-part)  which  is  to  be valid at each site.  Mail sent to
     that address is to be routed to  a  person  responsible  for  the
     site's mail system or to a person with responsibility for general
     site operation.  The name of the reserved local-part address is:

                                Postmaster

     so that "Postmaster@domain" is required to be valid.

     Note:  This reserved local-part must be  matched  without  sensi-
            tivity to alphabetic case, so that "POSTMASTER", "postmas-
            ter", and even "poStmASteR" is to be accepted.
