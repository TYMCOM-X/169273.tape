                               Purpose
                               -------





     It  is   the  purpose  of   this  document  to   define  the
     distribution  of   network  code  and  the   preparation  of
     supporting documentation necessary to effect release of new,
     revised, modified, or test code to the SOURCE, BASELINE, and
     BETATEST code distribution directories.

                                Scope
                                -----





     This procedure  applies to  all software  products developed
     and/or  supported by  Network  Technology  Division for  use
     with,  or  in  conjunction with,  private  and  public  data
     networks.

                        Directory Organization
                        ----------------------





     Control  of  all  NTD code  is  accomplished  through  three
     primary PDP-10 system directories:

          1. BASELINE Directory - The BASELINE directory contains
          supporting documentation necessary to determine current
          and past  baseline codes,  levels,  and  reference data
          required to access the SOURCE directory code files.

          2.  SOURCE Directory  - The  SOURCE directory  contains
          source code files necessary to generate an object file.
          These  include  source   files,  initialization  files,
          sample  command and  TYM files,  patch  files, and  any
          additional files necessary to generate an object file.

          3. BETATEST Directory - The BETATEST directory contains
          a   combination   of  source   codes   and   supporting
          documentation files.  The use of the BETATEST directory
          is limited to  initial field test (beta  testing) under
          control of Network Technology Division.






























                                                           Page 3




     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




                  Product Identification and Control
                  ----------------------------------





     Product  identification  and  control   is  managed  through
     establishment of a baseline product identification mnemonic,
     product  name,  internal  product  (network)  identification
     code, and appropriate  version and revision level  codes.  A
     standard file naming convention has also been established.

          1. Product  I.D. Mnemonic  - A  3 or  4 character  code
          assigned to each product (e.g. TII or LDII).

          2.  Product  Name -  The  formal  name of  the  network
          software product (e.g. Tymnet-II Node Code).

          3. Internal Product Identification Code - A 4 character
          code assigned to  each product (e.g. 0038,  003F) which
          is  internal  to  each  set of  code  and  is  used  in
          conjunction with PROBE.

          4. Version -  The initial (new product)  version number
          is  always  "01".   A  "new   product"  is  either  new
          application code  or code  sufficiently different  from
          existing code  in function, form or  fit as to  be "not
          compatable" with previous code.   The version number is
          incremented on  the occurance  of major  changes to  an
          existing  product (that  which does  not  apply to  the
          category  of  "new  product").  Adding  a  function  to
          existing code would be considered  reason for a version
          number change,  as would a  major rewrite of  code with
          previously established functions intact.

          5. Revision - The initial (new product) revision number
          is always "00".  The revision  number is incremented on
          occurances   of   minor    changes,   corrections,   or
          enhancements  to  an  existing  product  which  do  not
          introduce    functional    changes     or    functional
          incompatabilities.

          6.  File  Naming  Conventions -  Release  document  and
          source  code  files  are   named  using  the  following
          conventions:

          Release Document Files
          ----------------------

               PPPPVV.#RR

          PPPP =  the 3 or 4 position Product I.D.
               NOTE: if  the Product  I.D. is  only 3  positions,


                                                           Page 4




     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




               then position 4 is not used.

          VV   =  the 2 position octal version number (01-77)

          #    =  the 1 position document type
               W = Software Bulletin
               X = Software Release Form
               Y = Software Release Description
               Z = Document Change Description

          RR   =  the 2 position octal revision number (00-77),
               or decimal sequence number (01-99) if #=W

          Source Code Files
          -----------------

               PPPPVV.#RR

          PPPP = the 3 or 4 position Product I.D.
               NOTE: if  the Product  I.D. is  only 3  positions,
               then position 4 is not used.  If 2 or more flavors
               of  the  same  version  and  revision  number  are
               required, position 4 should be set to 'A' and 'B',
               etc.  (in  this case,  a 4  position Product  I.D.
               must be truncated to 3 positions).

          VV   = the 2 position octal version number (01-77)

          #    = the 1 position file type
               I = Initialize file
               B = Intermediate Nib file (e.g. Pascal Nib)
               R = Release file
               C = Sample Command file
               T = Sample TYM file
               S = Sample Supervisor Parameter file
               D = Sample Disc/Tape Parameter file
               N = Nib Object file
               P = Patch file
               F = Final Assembly file

          RR   = the 2 position octal revision number (00-77)

          Exceptions
          ----------

          Custom patch  files (those  which will  be placed  in a
          Private Network customer's directory)  are named within
          the SOURCE directory using the following convention:

               PPPPCP.PSS

          PPPP = the 3 or 4 position Product I.D.
               NOTE: if  the Product  I.D. is  only 3  positions,
               then position 4 is not used.  If 2 or more flavors
               of  the  same  version  and  revision  number  are
               required, position 4  will be set to  'A' and 'B',
               etc. (in this case, a 4 position Product I.D. will
               be truncated to 3 positions).

          CP   = Custom Patch file designation

          P    = Patch file

          SS   = Sequence number (01-99)

          NOTE: Custom  patch files are  named within  the SOURCE
          directory by  the Baseline  Manager.  The  custom patch
          filename submitted  by the  programmer must  conform to
          the  standard file  naming convention  for source  code
          files.


          PDP 10 source  code program files (e.g.  for LOADII and
          MERLIN) are named within the SOURCE directory using the
          following convention:

               PPPVRR.XXX

          PPP = the 3 position Product I.D.

          V   = the 1 position version number (1-9)

          RR  = the 2 position revision number (00-99)

          XXX = the program extension

     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




                        Code Release Procedure
                        ----------------------





     A.   Release  Types -  There  are  four categories  of  code
     release procedures in use.  These are:

          1. Baseline  Announcement - A baseline  announcement is
          scheduled to occur four times per year (on the 15th day
          of  each  new quarter)  and  is  used to  announce  the
          availability and support committments for that software
          for 18  months following.  Baseline  announcements must
          be submitted to the Baseline  Manager no later than the
          1st day  of each quarter  year.  Software  contained in
          the  baseline announcement  is released  to the  SOURCE
          directory for general internal distribution.

          2. Intermediate  Baseline Release  - Intermediate  code
          releases   (between    Baseline   announcements)    are
          unscheduled and  should be  avoided whenever  possible.
          An  intermediate  release  is  used  when  an  existing
          baseline release is found  to be sufficiently deficient
          to warrant another release to  the SOURCE directory for
          general distribution.   Intermediate release  code will
          be  supported  for  a  maximum  of  six  months  unless
          absorbed into  the following Baseline  announcement, in
          which case  support will  continue for  18 months  from
          date of quarterly Baseline announcement.

          3. Betatest Release - The  Betatest release is used for
          initial user field testing only.   This type of release
          is  controlled by  NTD management  in cooperation  with
          affected  test site  and  support personnel.   Betatest
          release  code   must  not   be  supplied   for  general
          distribution.

          4. Patch File  Release - A patch file  contains a small
          piece of code used to modify  a program in an expedient
          way  to correct  a program  error.   Advantages of  the
          patch file  release (over another source  code release)
          are that it does not incur  the cost, in time or money,
          involved in submitting the entire source form.

     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




     B.   Release  Notification  (Internal)   -  The  responsible
     programmer and/or his/her manager is  required to supply the
     necessary release  documentation to allow  implementation of
     programmer generated  code, code updates, patch  files, etc.
     The  Baseline Manager  is responsible  for transferring  all
     files to the BASELINE, SOURCE, and BETATEST directories.

     Document requirements are:

          1. Baseline Announcement and Intermediate Baseline
             Release
               1.1. Software Release form 'X'
               1.2. Software Release Description form 'Y'
               1.3. Document Change Description form 'Z' (if
                    applicable)
               1.4. Release notification via ONTYME
                    (TYM.BASELINE)

          2. Betatest Release

     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




     C. Software Release form 'X' Instructions:

          The Software Release form 'X' is required for each code
          release to SOURCE and  BETATEST directories.  This form
          must  contain  information   identifying  the  product,
          product  revision status,  responsible programmer,  all
          source files,  and documentation  references.  The  'X'
          file  format exists  as a  blank form  in the  BASELINE
          directory.  The  developer should  copy this  form into
          his/her directory for editing,  and send mail informing
          the Baseline Manager of the directory name location and
          filename  of  the  completed 'X'  form.   The  Baseline
          Manager  will   move  all  appropriate  files   to  the
          BASELINE,  SOURCE,  and/or BETATEST  directories.   The
          developer   is   responsible   for   entering   correct
          information into the 'X' form.

          NOTE:  Under no  circumstances should  files be  moved,
          modified,  or copied  to  the  BASELINE, SOURCE  and/or
          BETATEST  directories  without prior  approval  of  the
          Baseline Manager.

          The blank  'X' form filename  for page 1  is XFILE.FRM.
          The blank  'X' form filename for  page 2 and  beyond is
          XFILE2.FRM.

          Each page of the 'X' file must not contain more than 60
          lines.  If  the 'X' file  extends beyond one  page, the
          XFILE2.FRM  file should  be appended  to the  XFILE.FRM
          file after  line 60 so the  entire file will  print out
          with appropriate page breaks.

          NOTE: The top  of each blank form file  contains a page

     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




     D. Software Release Description form 'Y' Instructions:

          The Software  Release Description form 'Y'  is required
          for  each  code  release to  the  SOURCE  and  BETATEST
          directories.    This   form  must   contain   technical
          information   describing   the    program   corrections
          (referencing SAR and SCR  numbers), changes to external
          and internal  functions, changes  to system  generation
          parameters, and a discussion of  the reliability of the
          release.  Although  sections of the  'Y' and  'Z' forms
          are  similar, it  should  be noted  that  the 'Y'  form
          contains technical information pertaining  to a version
          of  code, while  the 'Z'  form  contains non  technical
          information pertaining to a specific document.  The 'Y'
     file  format exists  as a  blank form  in the  BASELINE
          directory.  The  developer should  copy this  form into
          his/her directory for editing,  and send mail informing
          the Baseline Manager of the directory name location and
          filename  of  the  completed 'Y'  form.   The  Baseline
          Manager will move the file  to the BASELINE or BETATEST
          directory.

          NOTE:  Under no  circumstances should  files be  moved,
          modified,  or copied  to the  BASELINE and/or  BETATEST
          directory  without  prior  approval   of  the  Baseline
          Manager.

          The blank  'Y' form filename  for page 1  is YFILE.FRM.
          The blank  'Y' form filename for  page 2 and  beyond is
          YFILE2.FRM.

          Each page of the 'Y' file must not contain more than 60
          lines.  If  the 'Y' file  extends beyond one  page, the
          YFILE2.FRM  file should  be appended  to the  YFILE.FRM
          file after line  60 so that the entire  file will print
          out with appropriate page breaks.

          NOTE: The top  of each blank form file  contains a page
          feed control character which should not be removed.

          Sample blank and completed Software Release Description
          forms may  be found in  Appendix A, pages  A-10 through
          A-12.

     Baseline Release Procedure                  October 13, 1983




     E. Document Change Description form 'Z' Instructions:

          The Document  Change Description  form 'Z'  is used  to
          describe, in non technical  terms, the changes required
          in an  existing document  (or documents)  pertaining to
          the particular version and revision level of a product.
          This   form   is   only   required   when   outstanding
          documentation changes are encountered as  a result of a
          code  release  to  SOURCE   and  BETATEST  directories.
          Although sections of the 'Z' and 'Y' forms are similar,
          it  should be  noted  that the  'Z'  form contains  non
          technical   information   pertaining  to   a   specific
          document,  while   the  'Y'  form   contains  technical
          information pertaining to  a version of code.   The 'Z'
          file  format exists  as a  blank form  in the  BASELINE
          directory.  The  developer should  copy this  form into
          his/her directory for editing,  and send mail informing
          the Baseline Manager of the directory name location and
          filename  of  the  completed 'Z'  form.   The  Baseline
          Manager will move the file  to the BASELINE or BETATEST
          directory.

          NOTE:  Under no  circumstances should  files be  moved,
          modified,  or copied  to the  BASELINE and/or  BETATEST
          directories  without  prior approval  of  the  Baseline
          Manager.

          The blank  'Z' form filename  for page 1  is ZFILE.FRM.
          The blank  'Z' form filename for  page 2 and  beyond is
          ZFILE2.FRM.

          Each page of the 'Z' file must not contain more than 60
          lines.  If  the 'Z' file  extends beyond one  page, the
          ZFILE2.FRM  file should  be appended  to the  ZFILE.FRM
          file after  line 60 so the  entire file will  print out
          with appropriate page breaks.

          NOTE: The top  of each blank form file  contains a page
          feed control character which should not be removed.

          Sample blank and  completed Document Change Description
          forms may  be found in  Appendix A, pages  A-13 through
          A-15.

     F. Software Bulletin Instructions:

          The Software Bulletin form 'W' contains product notices
          (helpful information  regarding the  product) or  patch
          file update information.  Software Bulletins pertain to
          a version of code rather than a particular revision, so
          there may  be more than one  bulletin per version  of a
          product.   All 'W'  files  for  a product  version  are
          therefore  assigned a  number  in  the file  extension,
          designating each bulletin by the chronological order in
          which it  was written.   'W' files  are the  only files
          which deviate from the  standard file naming convention
          that dictates that the last  two characters of the file
          extension be the revision number.

          The  'W' file  format exists  as  a blank  form in  the
          BASELINE  directory.  The  developer  should copy  this
          form into his/her directory for  editing, and send mail
          informing the  Baseline Manager  of the  directory name
          location and filename  of the completed 'W'  form.  The
          Baseline Manager  will move  the file  to the  BASELINE
          directory  and  send  the   Software  Bulletin  to  the
          appropriate personnel via ONTYME.

          The blank  'W' form filename  for page 1  is WFILE.FRM.
          The blank  'W' form filename for  page 2 and  beyond is
          WFILE2.FRM.

          Each page of the 'W' file must not contain more than 60
          lines.  If  the 'W' file  extends beyond one  page, the
          WFILE2.FRM  file should  be appended  to the  WFILE.FRM
          file after  line 60 so the  entire file will  print out
          with appropriate page breaks.

          NOTE: The top  of each blank form file  contains a page
          feed control character which should not be removed.

          Sample  blank  and  completed  Software  Bulletins  for
          product notices and patch file  updates may be found in
          Appendix A, pages A-2 through A-5.

     G. Release Notification via ONTYME Instructions:

          1.  For BASELINE  or BETATEST  releases, the  following
          sample  ONTYME message  format  contains the  necessary
          information    to   notify    the   Baseline    Manager
          (TYM.BASELINE):

          DATE:
            TO: Baseline Manager
          FROM: Programmer or Manager's Name
          SUBJ: Baseline Announcement
                        or
                Intermediate Baseline Release
                        or
                Betatest Release

          PRODUCT ID:
          PRODUCT NAME:
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)'X'FILENAME       'X'FILE CHECKSUM
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)'Y'FILENAME
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)'Z'FILENAME

               NOTE:   'X'   document  must   be   complete   and
               checksummed as  this is the  document used  by the
               Baseline Manager to access source files.

          2. For patch file releases, the following sample ONTYME
          message format  contains the  necessary information  to
          notify the Baseline Manager (TYM.BASELINE):

          DATE:
            TO: Baseline Manager
          FROM: Programmer or Manager's Name
          SUBJ: SOURCE Directory Program Patch

          PRODUCT ID:
          PRODUCT NAME:
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)PATCH FILENAME      PATCH FILE CHECKSUM
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)'W'FILENAME

               NOTE:  The current  patch file  within the  SOURCE
               directory must always be referenced when adding or
               deleting patch  files.  The Baseline  Manager will
               rename the current  patch file to create  a backup
               file  before placing  the new  patch  file in  the
               SOURCE  directory.   Changes to  patch  files  are
               never done directly in the SOURCE directory.

          message format  contains the  necessary information  to
          notify the Baseline Manager (TYM.BASELINE):

          DATE:
            TO: Baseline Manager
          FROM: Programmer or Manager's Name
          SUBJ: Software Bulletin

          PRODUCT ID:
          PRODUCT NAME:
          (DIRECTORY:SYSNO)'W'FILENAME
                      or
          A  clear description  of the  desired  contents of  the
          Software Bulletin so  that the 'W' file  may be created
          by the Baseline Manager.

     Baseline  general letters  are used  to communicate  special
     information regarding  the baseline release and  to announce
     the  occurance of  an intermediate  baseline release.   Each
     letter file for  a baseline release is assigned  a number in
     the  file   extension,  designating   each  letter   by  the
     chronological order in which it was  written.  A list of the
     general  letters for  a  specific  baseline release  may  be
     printed by entering the following command:

          FI (BASELINE)LETTER.n##

     where 'n' is the desired baseline revision.



     Beta Test File Access
     ---------------------


     Beta test memo files are used to announce the occurance of a
     beta test release.  Memo files are  assigned a number as the
     file extension,  designating each memo by  the chronological

             A PROBLEM HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN VERSION 4 NODE CODE (4.05 AND
             PREVIOUS) WHICH CAUSES A LINK THAT IS SPECIFIED IN THE TYMFILE
             AS A SATELLITE LINK (VIA THE TIILNK MACRO), WITH NO SPEED SPECIFIED
             IN THE SAME MACRO, TO COME BACK UP AFTER IT IS FROZEN
             AND THAWED WITHOUT THE SATELLITE SPECIFICATION PRESENT.  THIS WILL
             BE IMPORTANT ONLY IN THE EVENT THAT THE NODE IS SUBSEQUENTLY
             RETAKEN BY A SUPERVISOR.  IN THIS CASE, THE LINK NOT BEING REPORTED
             AS A SATELLITE LINK WILL CAUSE THE SUPERVISOR TO
             ASSIGN IT A LOWER COST THAN A SATTELITE LINK SHOULD HAVE.
             THIS IS THE ONLY FUNCTIONAL EFFECT OF THE BUG.  OF COURSE,
             XRAY REPORTS WILL REFLECT THE MISINFORMATION.

             SAT AND SPEED SPECIFICATIONS ARE USED ONLY BY THE SUPERVISOR
             IN ASSIGNING COST TO A LINK.

             IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT ANY LINK WHICH IS SPECIFIED AS A
             SATELLITE LINK IN THE TYMFILE HAVE A LINK SPEED SPECIFIED.

             THIS WILL BE FIXED IN A SUBSEQUENT RELEASE OF NODE CODE.

             A) NEW FUNCTIONS VISIBLE TO THE USER:

             A.1  Event 59 displays the link speed in bps or MS or FROZEN.
             node# LINK {SPEED MS|FROZEN|SPEED speed BPS} TO
                   {NEIGHBOR neighbor node#|AN UNKNOWN NEIGHBOR}
                  Event number:  59  (1d8)
                  Report criteria: Link test
                         speed = speed in bps.
                         neighbor node# = neighbor node number.
                  This was the response to the  "CSTREQ node# node#"  command in
                  PROBE.  The message lists the link  speed in "bps" or specifies
                  MS (optically  coupled link)  or Frozen.  The latter  indicates
                  that the last line  in the link has been detached  but the link
                  has not yet been declared down.
             _________________________________________________________________
             B) NEW FUNCTIONS NOT VISIBLE TO THE USER:

             B.1  The profile  password  stored  for  each  user  in the  profile
             access record  is now stored  in a ciphered manner.  Prior  releases
             stored  this password in  its "clear" form  leaving it vulnerable to
             corruption.   The  change has  no affect on users,  and will contain
             a date of the last change for user reference.
             B.2  The initialization process has been changed to continue  print-
             ing startup-errors as long as the error exists.   This  will  insure
             that the message is viewed by a TMCS support person rather than only
             being sent to the first user logging in following the error.

             ________________________________________________________________
             C) FUNCTIONS NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO THE USER:

             C.1  None.
             ________________________________________________________________
             D) CHANGES TO EXISTING FUNCTIONS (INCLUDE CHAPTER NUMBERS):

             D.1  Incorporate change in section A.1 above into the existing
             TMCS documentation.
             ________________________________________________________________
             E) CHANGES TO SYSTEM GENERATION PARAMETERS:

             E.1  Core size requirements changed as follows:
                     Public  Network:  825K    to    ???K
                     Private Network:  560K    to    ???K
             E.2  Maximum number of users reduced from 40 to 36.
