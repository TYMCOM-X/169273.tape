Subject: Large file fransfers throught the network 

Bill,

I recently had to move approximately 10,000,000 bits of data (4 360K
flopies full) from eunix to the PC.  This process required four hours to
complete.  I think it should be possible to to it in under one hour.
I started asking questions about how to make the transfer and was told
about the control-C, etc. buffer size selection schema.  I tried it but
realized no improvement.  I then set up a batch file to time the transfer.
The results of several test are listed below.  Next I talked to Bill Eusky
who felt that the problem was that kermit required an acknowledgement
before the next packet was sent.  He first suggested TYMCOMM as an
alternative and then withdrew that recommendation because copypc also
requires the acknowledgement (window size = 1).

My need is not current but I am looking for some suggestions as to how
to transfer large amounts of data in a timely manner.  I think the need
may arise in the future and I would like to be ready.

Jim




File being transferred is an ASCII text file.
All transfers use kermit between a PC/XT and "eunix".
On the PC it is 113,975 bytes long.
-rwxrwxrwx 1  113975 Oct 30 08:03 macw.out

On "eunix" it is 112,800 bytes long.
-rw-r--r--  1 jwillott   112800 Oct 13 17:07 mac.wout

The effective data rate is based on 112,800 bytes (902,400 bits).

Bill,
    Sorry I took so long to respond.  Anyhow, the parser is no longer on line
and would have to be recovered from listings (unless it is in archives from

		PROCESSING STRINGS IN THE ACCESS PROFILES

			(by David Chang 31OCT86)



A.  INTRODUCTION

	Access profiles in the Master User Directory (MUD) define the
allowable origination and destination combinations for each user or hostname.
Currently, originations can be classes, hosts, or nodes and destinations
can be groups or hosts.  More flexibility may be incorporated if both
originations and destinations can be defined as strings.  The
origination string may specify the calling address of a call request,
and the destination string may specify a hostname as the desired
destination.

B.  ORIGINATION STRING

	A string in the origination of an access profile entry (APE) may
used for validation of the calling symbolic address in a call request.
This origination string must successfully match the ORIGINAL calling
address in the incoming call in order to use the corresponding destinations
in the circuit building process.  If the match is unsuccessful, then the
next access profile, or origination/destination pair, is analyzed.  For
convenience, wild cards may be allowed to represent a "general address".

	Original calling address means the actual address of the user at
the original network.  Somehow this address must be passed through all
the transit networks for analysis by the current network.  It may not be
feasible to specify all possible transit networks in the origination
string nor is it clear whether such specification is useful.  In any
case, only the originating address is being considered here.

	One of the uses of origination string is "DNIC blocking", where
a call from a particular DNIC is prohibited access.  Suppose we have
networks A, B, C, D with DNIC's 4321, 4567, 3146, and 3106 respectively.
Suppose we are network C and we wish to block all calls from network A
to network D, regardless of any number of transit network B.  An entry
in the access profile for hostname "-31069876543210" in network C may
contain origination [~"-4321*"] with destination [g3106] where
	~ denotes exception, or negative, string (in this case)
	" denotes the string in the entry
	* denotes wild cards, ie. anything that follows is permitted
	g3106 denotes a group of gateway hosts to network D
This entry indicates that access to network D is permitted if the
calling address does not have 4321 as the originating DNIC.  If there
were no other entries for this hostname, then calls from A would effectively
be blocked from going to D via C.  However, different entries may be
desired to specify certain destinations for various origins.  If this 
hostname had many entries, then each of them must contain the exception
string in the origination.  This would be too costly in terms of
processing and to cumbersome in terms of maintenance of the profiles.

	A more aethestic solution is to define a new item, called a
"null" destination, which is acts as an "answered" host in the MUD
processing, but results in the call being cleared.  The access profile
entry would have the origination as ["4321*"] to match all calls from A
and the destination as [null].  For extra insurance, this should be the
first entry and perhaps with the "priority stop" bit set (ie. do not
search further for other priority targets).  This method provides for a
cleaner solution to the problem of DNIC blocking.

	In order to support DNIC blocking, several modifications are
necessary:
1. TYMNET must support calling address whereby the ultimate "caller"
address must be identifiable.  This means that the user (or the
interface) must be able to specify the calling address, that the
original calling address must be able to be passed through all transit
networks, and that the nodes must be able to accomodate large needle
messages that contain the source, transit (?) and destination addresses.
2. TYMNET must support strings in the MUD entries.  NETVAL must be able
to allow the user to enter strings into access profile entries and the
Supervisor must be able to perform string comparisons.  This support
must also include exception strings and null destinations.

C. DESTINATION STRING

	A string in the destination of the access profile may be used to
designate the specific destination in the targeted network.  In other
words, this destination string is actually a hostname.  The main benefit
of this feature is the possibility of using a user-friendly, symbolic
address to specify a port of the destination host in the local network
or to specify the desired "host" in a foreign network.

	In general, whenever a username is used with a hostname in a
login string, intersection processing must be done to find the desired
destination.  If the hostname is declared as a valid destination in the
access profile for the username, then the intersection processing is
eliminated.  Of course, string comparisons must be done, but this is less
CPU intensive.  Furthermore, the homed destination string can be used as
the called address sent to the destination.  For the homed or non-homed
destination, the entire login string is still sent to the destination in
a Tymnet network.  In either case, some information is available which
may or may not be used to further select a port or host.

	Port selection in the local network may be accomplished by the
usage of the homed destination string.  Suppose the user wishes to login
with the following string:  "USER:P2" by which he wishes to get to host
333 port 2.  The access profiles may be configured as:

	USER			P2			H333P2
    origin  dest	   origin  dest		     origin  dest
    class0  "P2"	   class0  !"H333P2"	     class0  !host333

where	class0	means all originations are valid
	prefix !  means a home destination

Here the string "P2" in the login string matches the destination string,
so no intersection processing is required.  Checking hostname P2, the search
is for some valid home destination, (in this case, the string "H333P2").
Checking the homed hostname H333P2, the valid home destination is host 333.
Hence the call routed to host 333 with the called address of "H333P2".
At this host, the called address may be parsed to get the information that
port 2 is desired.  Assume that all the originations were verified and
that other entries did not relate to this login.

	Host selection in a foreign network is accomplished
similarly.  Suppose a user wishes to access his second bank with the
login string "USER:BANK2" and that this bank is in some foreign network.
The following access profiles may be setup:

	USER			BANK2			    -3111
   origin  dest		   origin  dest			origin  dest
   class0  "BANK2"	   class0  !"-31114151234567"	class0  !host45

As before, the string "BANK2" matches the destination string in the
username profile.  In the search for the destination of hostname BANK2,
the homed destination X.121 address "-31114151234567" is found to be
valid.  Since the DNIC 3111 is foreign (assuming the local DNIC is
3106), then the hostname -3111 is searched.  In the case, the final
destination is homed host 45, which should be the X.75 gateway host to
the foreign network with DNIC 3111.  The called address "31114151234567"
is passed to the foreign network, which targets the call to the desired
address 4151234567.  Note that a single gateway may serve several
networks and this method allows targets to different networks via the
same gateway, providing further control of traffic to foreign networks.
However, this search of hostnames may go on forever, so some limit must
be imposed.

	In addition to the modifications for origination string, other
modifications are needed to support port/host selection via the
destination string:
1. TYMNET must pass the login string as specified by the user in the
needle, as well as the called address.  This called address should be the
homed destination string of the second to the last APE lookup and should
correspond to the address for the ultimate destination.  Furthermore,
some limitation should be imposed on the number of hostname lookups,
probably via a Tymfile parameter.  Destination interfaces must be able
to interpret the hostname field in the login string of the needle.

D. CONCLUSION

String definition in the access profile is a logical extension to the
resolution of the MUD entries.  Currently, the access profile can only
describe hosts and nodes.  With the string capabililty, the access
profile will be able to additionally describe possibly ports (in Tymnet
network), foreign networks (for DNIC blocking), and addresses.  This is
a powerful feature that allows for the control of traffic to and from
foreign networks, which is requested by Televerket (STA).

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 6 Nov 86 14:00:27 PST

Dave,

Thank you for the oppertunity to review your document.  Below are some
comments.  If you want to get together to talk, I should be available
in the afternoon.  In my comments below, I've quoted the first line of
each paragraph to make it easier to match my comments up with your text.
My comments are just that - comments - and do not necessarily represent
anything that needs to be changed.

Some of my comments here may contradict previous discussions or notes.
There is nothing like trying to write things down to bring out all the
inconsistencies.  I appologize if its been a little disorganized.  Now
that the SWBT Recommendation is done, I look forward to being able to
spend more time thinking about this.

I suggest the use of "symbolic address" in place of "strings" in the title
and most places where you aren't actually talking about the specific data
structure.  Although "strings" is correct, the reader may lose track of
what they really mean.  Note that a host name is not always a symbolic
address, but may only be part of one (e.g. just the DNIC), so the two
terms are not interchangable.

"A.  INTRODUCTION"
"A1	Access profiles in the Master User Directory (MUD) define the..."

I think it is more correct to say "the destination symbolic address may
specify a host name or X.121 address".

You might want to add, here, that this uses a new needle field, and to
say a little about the semantics of that field.

"B.  ORIGINATION STRING"
"B1	A string in the origination of an access profile entry (APE) may..."
"B2	Original calling address means the actual address of the user at..."

I don't believe we want any transit specifications in the origination-address
field.  [It isn't even clear they really belong in the destination-address
field.  When needle format time comes, we may want to consider having seperate
fields for the RPOA and destination-address.]

"B3	One of the uses of origination string is "DNIC blocking", where..."

If we are looking at the world through the eyes of network C (3146), we
should never see a hostname of "-31069876543210".  Since 3106 is another
network, the hostname would consist of only the DNIC: "-3106".

	For example, if the administration of network C (3146) wanted to
	block all calls from network A (4321) to network D (3106) from
	transiting their network, they could validate the host name "-3106"
	with the following access profile:

		Name: -3106 (host)
		origins	   |     destinations
		-----------|-----------------
		~"-4321*"  |  (home)Group3106

	When a call comes from network A, DNIC=4321.  The calling DTE
	address from the X.75 call request packet is placed in the
	origination address field of the needle by the X.75 gateway:
	-43219999999.  Likewise, the called DTE address is placed in the
	destination address field: -31068888888.  The user name is
	provided either from the NUI, if present, or is defaulted by the
	supervisor, based on the origination symbolic address.  Assuming
	there is no NUI, the user name would automatically be -4321.

	As far as this example is concerned, the contents of the access
	profile for -4321 is not important.  It can not be used to achieve
	the kind of blocking desired here since it can be overriden by a
	NUI.

"B4	A more aethestic solution is to define a new item, called a..."
"B5	In order to support DNIC blocking, several modifications are..."
"C. DESTINATION STRING"
"C1	A string in the destination of the access profile may be used to..."
"C2	In general, whenever a username is used with a hostname in a..."

Actually, the supervisor must still do an intersection even when strings are
found in the destination field.  In the case where both strings and hosts
or groups appear in the profile, the hosts and groups must still undergo
intersection.

"C3	Port selection in the local network may be accomplished by the..."

Actually, there is no need to put the string !"H333P2" in the profile of
"P2", here.  Port selection is a function performed in the interface and it
does not require the use of a symbolic address in an access profile.  The
example here is just an alias.

"C4	Host selection in a foreign network is accomplished..."

This is just an alias, as well, but there is considerably more justification
for it since it allows a user-friendly name such as BANK2 as opposed to
-31114151234567.  The extra overhead (disk) can possibly be justified on
the part of the network administration by reducing the "misdialed" call rate.
Misdialed calls create more overhead, and no revenue, possibly even requiring
a manual credit of the customer's bill.

These two examples are really identical.  It makes no difference if the
ultimate destination is in the home network or not.  You might just show
the case where the call is to the foreign network, and note that it can
just as easily handle domestic destinations.

"C5	In addition to the modifications for origination string, other..."

I've tried (but probably slipped a few times) to not use the words
"called (or calling) [DTE] address" unless I'm talking about the field
of an X.25 or X.75 call request.  In place, I've been using "origination
(or destination) [symbolic] address" which may be a DTE address or a
host name.  Without the word "symbolic" it may also be a host number.

"D. CONCLUSION"
"D1	String definition in the access profile is a logical extension to..."

----------------

May want to mention the types of wild cards:
	=	matches either "-" or "-####-"
	*	matches any number of characters (maybe none)
	?	matches any single character

We probably won't support embedded "*".

In general, I think its a very good summary.  You have said alot in a
little space - something the readers will appreciate.

the data from sups 2-5 in the public net.  The files will be in (WRS) on
57 with the names MSG.122, MSG.123, etc.  I will use the FCAT, SORT and
UNIQ utilities to make sure all the messages are caught and then it can
be loaded into sup 1 in the morning.  I'll be in the office in the

Well, I've paid the bills I spoke of.  Reality strikes again.  Its sure to
be tax refund time before I can come up with the cash.  At that point I
will probably get a Sun 3/50.  The advantage of being able to run 4.2 on

system.

    Earlier this week, I resigned to pursue opportunities at a local startup
    company.  My last day with the company will be Friday, November 21, 1986.
    Dan Lasater will be acting async unit manager until further notice.

    I have greatly enjoyed working for Tymnet over the last few years.  I
    take with me many fond memories of the stimulating people and projects
    that make this a good company.

    I wish to thank the many people who helped wholeheartedly in the ATC and
    Consat/PAD area.  Without the involvment and talents of special people
    like Deborah Graham, Richard Ho, Liza Hu, Paul Krumviede, Jim Laden,
    Ed Mooring, Sandra Nilluka, Peter O'Harrow, Jim Stein, Dan Upthegrove,
    Scott Wedel, Bryan Wing, and Ron Vivier, the async products would not
    be in the good shape that they are today.

    I am very pleased that the ATC has been accepted for limited release
    and that the Consat/PAD version 6 betatest is going smoothly with an
    expected 1Q87 limited release datReceived: from EMSNTD.Ontyme.Tymnet by B39.Tymnet; Tue, 18 Nov 86 16:07:51 UT

Su,

I'll plan to be in my office between 11:00 and 11:30 on Thursday.  If it
looks like it might be later than that, give me a call and I can adjust
lunch.  Dave will probably be there as well.  Please call even if it turns
out that you don't need us to answer the questions so we will know not to
wait any longer for the call.

Subject: Hertz blacklist/file overflow 

Per Brian Dickerson of Hertz, he would like the following procedure
followed for the Hertz blacklist file, until they and we can work out a
long-term solution to the file overflow problem:

If records (up to 30) overflow from the file, go ahead and put it
on-line anyway, and send Brian Dickerson a Xerox of the fileload
hardcopy so that he will know which records are not on-line.

Please start with the tape we received last Friday.  Should you have any
questions, please contact me.  Thank you.

Subject: 168 live test/Irvine capacity & other info 

After node 2525 was loaded this morning, I loaded 168 from
(luskerj:65)nw2525.n01 for Irvine capacity project.  Barring major
difficulties, we will run on this code through the weekend.

If you should have occasion to load the node or that slot, please inform
me via Irvine opertions (714)851-9660 first, as the DG host and front
ends are running the capacity software, which is incompatible with the
postech version of 168.

322, 1195 & 1826 are running their normal code.  During next week,
we will at various times bring up the capacity versions of 1826 and/or
1195.  I will check my ontyme & tums several times a day, and will
announce the loads as far in advance as possible.

FTS 168 was reloaded at 22:33 by someone with a version of the code not

Subject: 168 reload tonight 

Sometime tonight, probably on 3rd shift, Ken Anderson will be reloading
several switches for Telecredit routing, including 1195, 1826 and 168.

1195 & 1826 are currently running code that supports the non-capacity OP
& CPA.  When they are reloaded, they should still be compatible.

168 is currently running code that supports opx/cpx.  Then it is
reloaded, they should still be compatible (you might want to switch to
the hot backup whie 168 is being loaded).

If there are any problems with this, please page me.  Thanks, SET

Subject: CONFIGURATION FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND 

BECAUSE OF HARDWARE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE PERSISTED SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY
(I.E., CP2A WILL NOT TALK TO EII AND HIFTPC2 LINE E CANNOT BE PATCHED
ACROSS TO ANY OTHER FRONT END THAN CP3A), PLEASE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING:

1.  PUT EI/EI (GREEN PACK) ON-LINE ON ECLIPSE II, WHICH WILL NORMALLY BE
RUNNING WITH CP1A AND CP1C.  THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO START CCBS AND DO
MANUAL EII ACTIVITY ON ECLIPSE II WHILE CONTINUING TO RUN ON THE 3
ECLIPSE CONFIGURATION.  I HAVE MADE DIAGRAMS OF NORMAL RUNNING
CONFIGURATION, SWAPPING PACKS ON EACH OF THE ECLIPSES AND SENDING AMEX
CANS FROM ECLIPSE I (VIA CP2A).

2.  THE DIAGRAM FOR THE "NORMAL" CONFIGURATION IS THE CONFIGURATION IN
WHICH I WILL LEAVE THINGS WHEN I LEAVE TONIGHT.  IT IS FAIRLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR CHANGING TO THE VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS FOR SWAPPING
PACKS AND SENDING AMEX CANS (PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SEND THEM IN THE
CONFIGURATION SHOWN).

3.  IF YOU HAVE ON-LINE PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONFIGURATIONS
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND, PLEASE PAGE ME.  THANK YOU.

Bill,

Weyyi and I are meeting on Sunday to finalize the Supervisor
Login parsing for the SWB and Host Names projects.  If possible
I could really use a finalized Syntax diagram to work from.

Just leave it in my mailbox, or send mail regarding it's disposition.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: Locating the sources to system programs using FINDIT.TEC 

If you are looking for the sources to a particular program, you can often save
yourself some trouble by checking if the information is already on-line, on
system 930 in the files (JMS)*.WHR.  These WHR files are created when I try
to find where the sources are.          /Joe Smith, 26-Nov-86

How to use FINDIT.TEC

A) Make sure that you have (SYS) in your DO list after (XEXEC).
   See (JMS)RPGINI.CTL for an example on how to do this.

B) Copy (JMS)FINDIT.TEC to your directory.

The above two steps need to be done only once.

C) Have MHX run FINDIT on all systems, creating a .WHR file.

D) Mung the WHR file using FINDIT.TEC to clean up the file and add host numbers.

E) Optionally sort the WHR file if you want to.

Example of step C - running FINDIT via MHX

01	.MHX
02	hosts: 10S
03	commands (end with ctrl-D):
04	O$
05	FINDIT
06	TELEC#.*,AUXMO#.*
07	
08	SYSNO
09	record? Y
10	output file: TELECO.WHR
11	detach? Y

01 Start (MPL)MHX.
02 Tell MHX to go to all PDP-10 systems (as defined in JOBS.DAT).
03 Prompt from MHX.
04 Type "O", ESCape, and your OPER password.  Note that MHX turns off echo
   while it is reading the password.
05 Run (SPL)FINDIT on each system
06 Tell FINDIT to look for TELECO.SAV, TELECF.223, and AUXMOX.SAV.
   TELECF.223 is the FDM file for version 22.3, therefore when searching for
   sources and FDM files, it is a good idea to have # as 6th char of filename.
07 Blank line is required to get out of FINDIT.
08 Dummy line, I put it in out of habit
09 Control-D to end commands, MHX asks if you want to record output in a file.
10 My convention is to use *.WHR to keep lists of where files are.
11 Detach.  You can monitor MHX's progress from another terminal.  MHX changes
   its name (as reported by SYSTAT) to be "MHX:nn" when going to host nn.

Example of step D - MUNGing the file
In this example I use a different WHR file and show only the significant lines.

12	.DIR KLKS.WHR
13	KLKS    WHR      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
14	.MUNG FINDIT,KLKS.WHR
15	FINDIT V2 - Fix output from FINDIT by putting username after file name
16	29:
17	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:29)          15  07-Dec-78  14:49  ALL  RD  NO
18	62:
19	ACCESS.MSG  (KS2020:62)         2  24-Feb-81  14:45  ALL  RD  NO
20	CONVRT.SAV  (KL10:62)          12  09-Jul-80  20:25  ALL  RD  NO
21	"Done

12-13 The log file does not show up until MHX is done.
14 The MUNG command runs (SYS)MUNG.SAV which runs (JMS)TECO.SHR.  The first
   argument is the name of the commands file (FINDIT.TEC), the argument after
   the comma is the name of the file that FINDIT.TEC is to work on.
15 FINDIT.TEC identifies itself.
16+18  Each host number is typed as it is found.
17,19-20 Note that username and host have been moved to the middle of the
   record.  The filename is now in column 1 where it can be sorted.  Every
   line of the file is typed out, you can use Control-O to suppress it.
21 FINDIT.TEC is done.

Example of step E - SORTing the file

22	.DIR KLKS.*
23	KLKS    WHR      25  26-NOV-86 1552    ALL RD  NO     12044
24	KLKS    BAK      26  26-NOV-86  400    ALL RD  NO     12402
25	.SORT KLKS.WHR=KLKS.WHR
26	SORTED 774 RECORDS

22-24 The BAK file can be deleted.  It is created in case you run FINDIT.TEC
  on a WHR file that has already been MUNGed once.
25 (XEXEC)SORT takes OUTPUT.FIL=INPUT.FIL, sorts in ascending order, using
   the entire line as a key.
26 SORT is done.
27 I sometimes massage the sorted WHR file by replacing "(SYS:22)" with
   "(SYS:*)" and deleting the redundant lines that say that XXX.SAV was
   installed on all systems on the same day.

Subject: XEXEC and MAILER 

The FILAMO crashes seem to be on the rise... systems 70 and 55 each
caught one today sometime after my newest XEXEC %1(200) was installed.

Since it's apparent that the problem is aggravated by XEXEC doing the
frmop to look at the halt-status-block of the MAILER job as the mailer
is logging out, and this reliably crashes system 34 when MAILER runs,
I have removed MAILER from the queue on ALL, repeat ** ALL ** systems.

(Well, most.  It is still running on X62, X95 and X930!)

I will see if I can put a work-around into XEXEC early next week, and
put MAILER back into the queue.

--------------
Note:  MAILER is still being run, each time someone wants to send mail
about the batch job being run, so (bill?) if this is enough to take care
of the queued mail files (MAIL)*.Q let me know, and I'll leave mailer
out of the queue (since it's being run every so often anyway).

To see the internal log of all CTY output on 930 or 62, set license and
RUN (MPL)FILDDT.  Answer "/M" for "File:".  Then type "17046$0T" (using
ESCape for $).  That will show the last 2560 characters that have been
typed on the CTY, plus parts of the Control Block for APA0, since $0T
stops all the first null (ASCIZ).  By the way, the "CB"+Linefeed that

Bill,
  The problem with XEXEC dying, IS caused by a probelm with $RECGC in SAIL.
The missing page is not caused by the garbage-collect, but is there by
normal program operation.  I plan on turing off record garbage collect and
will manage my own linked list of "dormant" records instead of letting
SAIL do it.  Sigh!

When I get around to fixing the recgc problem I will let you know. /Carl

Subject: No NUI issue 

Bill,

If the NUI is not present, then we use the calling address as the NUI.
Does that mean that we need to set up a MUD entry for every possible
calling address including those from foreign nets?  Or are we saying
that we use the calling address as the NUI only in the needle and such,
but that we do not do any MUD lookup on the pseudo NUI (nor any passwork
check)?

Subject: Re: No NUI issue 
In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 3 Dec 86 16:58:33 PST

If there is no user-name (NUI), then the calling-address is used to construct
a name to be looked up.  The constructed name is not passed in the user-name
field, it is only used locally by the supervisor.

As with any user-name, if it begins with a "-" (X.121) then it is subject
to truncation before lookup in the MUD based on the DNIC.  In this way, if
we get a call from an X.75 gateway as follows...

calling-address		-31117654321
NUI			none

Then we will construct a user-name of -31117654321.  The user-name will then
be truncated to -3111 (assuming that 3111 is a non-sharred DNIC) and looked
up in the MUD.  No password validation will be performed.

Because of the truncation, it will only be necessary to provide one user-name
per foreign network, as opposed to one per foreign address.

Setting one's baud rate from the auxcal 15 or 16 doesn't work anymore.
It might be a CONSAT problm or a monitor problem.  I've eliminated the
BASE as a suspect since it happens with the microbase as well.  Please
try it with your consat (the Goltz-net box) and see if it works.  The

Hi Su,

I did promise to update the document when all the terminology was finlized

Its too late to call him now, but I will go over the RPOA table, and give

to hold up the contract, so I'm giving them slightly lower priority than

	3: QUIT
The garbled 2nd command was "OUT 1200".

From TYMSAT 3143 to C22-P034/P37 worked.
From TYMSAT 3143 to B36-P034/P37 via BUBB gateway worked.
From TYMSAT 3143 to C22 and TAUX to C26-P034/P37 does not change
  baud rate on AUX circuit.  That is, line "2:" was readable.
From micronet 2770 to X930-P035/A04 did not work until I set
  the XMT and RCV baud rates both to 110.  That is, the PDP-11 will not let
  me change the INPUT rate, and the command to change the OUTPUT rate changes
  both INPUT and OUTPUT (no split speed on the DZ-11).

Subject: files 

Please look at the files in (TXSSUP) and see if you want any of them.
They seem to be old SUP stuff from back in 1985.  TXSSUP does not belong
to us, and also we are very short on disk space.  Let me know if I can
delete all the files.  Thanks -Bill

Date: Fri, 5 Dec 86 18:16:42 PST 
To: Bill Soley <WRS@B39.Tymnet> 
Subject: Misc SWB and addressing questions 

Bill,

I have several questions for you...

1. I would like to include your acronyms in my glossary.  May I copy it
from your file?

2. More additions to the glossary...what do you think?

NATIVE - pertaining to the local network or the network under
consideration.

NATIVE DNIC - the DNIC of the native network; there may be several for
a network.

DOMINANT DNIC - the default DNIC of a network that is used in the absence
of a specfied DNIC in a X.121 address; only one per network.  [Ex: 3106
for Tymnet]

RECESSIVE DNIC - the non-dominant DNIC of a network with several DNIC's.
[Ex: the DNIC for RCA which is within Tymnet public net]

SHARED DNIC - a DNIC that is used by more than one network.

FOREIGN DNIC - a DNIC of a non-native network.

3. We had talked about an APE with "host 5, ~host 6" which on the
surface seems meaningless.  I think that we resolve to say that it means
host 5.  But in the Sup, currently if we encounter something like this,
whatever is found first will be used.  In this case, host 5 is used, but
if the order was reversed "~host 6, host 5", then I think that the Sup
will match with any host not 6 before it sees host 5 as an item.  Any
comments?

4. By the same token, the old processing allowed the host numbers and
the groups to be in any order, and thus a customer may or may not take
this fact into consideration when defining his APE.  With the new MUD,
it is required that the host list is ordered and comes before the list
of groups.  This is subtle change which the customer may not notice.  Do
you think it is okay?

5. Your answer concerning no NUI prompted more questions.  If the
origination address is not X.121 and there is no username, then we
cannot do any truncation.  Do we clear the call at this point? 
Or are we saying that all origination address must be X.121?

6. Suppose that we have no NUI and we have a X.121 origination address,
then it seems that we must lookup the DNIC table to see if it is native
and/or shared and then decide what to do?!

NATIVE	SHARED	PERFORM
 Yes	 Yes	Lookup the entire username or DNIC with m digits?
 Yes	 No	Lookup the entire username or DNIC with m digits?
 No	 Yes	Lookup the entire username or DNIC with m digits?
 No	 No	Lookup the truncated address.

7. Did you know that Tymnet has a pseudo-numbering plan?  According to a
X.25 document, we have after the 3106 DNIC:
	0 + hhhhh + ssss  => host number with optional subhost
	9 + nnnnnnnnn	  => Network User Number (NUN) as username;
			     NTN as called address
	7 + hhhhh	  => host number as calling address
	77+ nnnn + pppp	  => node # and port # as calling address

8. Did you talk to Jerry?  Are you waiting for the completion of
glossary that I am working on?  I am considering the glossary as a
working document for the specs on orig/des addressing and symbolic
addressing.

Thanks,

David

Subject: Deleting usernames 

Bill,

You previously showed me a list of possible usernames to be deleted.  Are
you handling this, or do you want us to pursue this.  I believe that
@, [, and : must be excluded from the username syntax, but are there others?
I have forgotten.

Omar indicated that you are preparing yet another version of the syntax
diagram to include all permitted punctation...true or false? and when?

I will try to corner Ernst early part of next week.

Have a nice weekend!

Subject: more on swb 

Bill,

I just thought of more questions...

1. If the transit address is begin with a ":", then we cannot tell whether
we have a transit address or a SWB NTN destination address or a host number
until we find the second ":" or more digits.  Perhaps, a different indication
would be more appropriate??

2. In you figure 2 diagram, you have a question "NTN ours".  How is this
checked?

and all the associated info that goes along with that.  I am out the rest of the week
but would like to set something up soon.  Perhaps tuesday so Susie
could attend (ontyme is her project).  What is your schedule like?  I'll 
be checking my mail, so go ahead & send a TUMS.  Thanks for all your help
so far, and in advance for your help to come!!!!

I'm open most of the week, but I have a slight preference for Tuesday
afternoon, 1:30 or later.  If that's not good for your or Susie, I think
any afternoon thereafter is okay.  You are very welcome, indeed, I always

Bill,

I finally talked to Ernst and I have some answers, as well as some HUH's.
Would like us go over them, or perhaps I could just send a brief reply with
our comments to SWB?

I just thought of something...if hostnames are defined to start with a lettera
and usernames may start with punctuations and digits, then during migration
how do we reconcile with the current usernames to be both usernames and
hostnames in the new MUD?

I suppose we should talk first.  If you're still there, give me a call at
home, otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow or call.  I'll send you the original
message if you just want to "edit" in our answers.  -Bill

Oh on the hostname/ username punctuation thing.  It just means that people
with usernames that are not legal hostnames because they begin with some
bogus character, they won't be able to use them as hostnames.  That's what
they get for being "creative".  -Bill

Subject: New program: (SPL)CPY %1 


Currently in distribution is CPY version %1 which replaces most of the
functionality of the (SPL)COPY program in a slightly modernized form.
This new program uses the ARGS/ARGPAR command-line scanning package and
may be run via special command mode as a pseudo monitor command.  Type
"CPY ?" for a list of switches and normal command usage.

This program may also be run from the job processor by passing the command
line in the PARAMETERS option in SUBMIT.   This was the main reason for
the release of this program.  A user may now run a periodic job which will
run (SPL)CPY.SAV as an automatic distribution mechanism.  Using the new
/UPDATE switch file data which hasn't changed will not be re-transferred.
However, there is one drawback that TELECO-AUXMOX has and that is the
protection on the destination file will be reset to ALL RD NO each time
a copy is attempted even though no data is transferred.

An example run:
    !CPY ACCESS.MSG,SUBMIT.SAV/HOSTLIST:38/SUPERSEDE
    username [SUBMIT]: <cr>
    [logging in as SUBMIT]
    Hosts: 38
    [Telecopy in frame 8]

    !TYPE 008TEL.COM
    REPLACE
    NO UPDATE

Jenny,

Thanks for letting me know about the problems in (SPL)SFTP.  I have made a
number of changes which should correct the problems you were seeing as well
as clean up a number of other error conditions that were not being handled
properly.  In summary the changes are:

	1. changed the way block IO is terminated so base won't send data
	    twice.  Appearently, the old base code didn't care that I was
	    doing this wrong.

	2. added a number of error messages (see document)

	3. any error which occurs in a WRIT command will now prevent the
	    creation of a directory entry for the file allowing an older
	    version of a file with the same name to remain intact.

	4. added completion code to READ command (may break some existing
	    programs)

It is important to check for error codes as some of them are quite likely
to occur from time to time.  A good way to test the error recovery portion
of your code is to send the READ or WRIT command specifying one of the
following special file names which will simulate the indicated errors:

     filename	simulated error
     --------	---------------
	.0	file not found
	.1	user not found
	.2	file protected
	.3	file being modified
	.8	illegal file name
	.12	disk full or quota exceeded
	.17	unknown file selection error
	.18	unknown IO error
	.19	device IO error
	.20	data IO error
	.21	disk full or quota exceeded
	.31	black ball

I've also updated the document (SPL)SFTP.DOC which I've enclosed below.
It contains the details on the error messages that were added.  Please
let me know if there are any problems with the new version.  I've put
it on systems 36 and 39 for now and will release it further after it
has been tested some more.

   (SPL)SFTP                       Tymcom-X                        (SPL)SFTP


   SYNOPSIS

           Simple file transfer protocol slave program.

   SYNTAX

           R (SPL)SFTP

   DESCRIPTION

           Invokes  a  slave  process  to  handle  simple   file  transfers.
           Transfers are restricted to text files.  There is no  checksum or
           retransmission protocol to detect  or recover from errors,  it is
           assumed this function is provided by the network.

           Commands  consist  of a  four  character command  followed  by an
           optional  argument  followed  by  end-of-line.   The  end-of-line
           convention used to terminate commands determines  the end-of-line
           used in data transfer.

           The slave will answer with the welcome message:
                   220 SFTP server v?? ready.

           The following commands may then be sent to the slave:

           HELO master-system-name

                   This command is optional and merely  provides information
                   for  file  creation and  any  logs that  may  be  kept in
                   future.  Possible responses are:
                           250 okay

           READ filename

                   This command reads a file from the slave system.   If the
                   file is successfully opened, a response
                           252 File data follows
                   is sent followed by
                           <cr><lf><file><^d><cr><lf>
                   In the body, <file>, the character <^d> is sent twice for
                   each real occurance  to eliminate confusion with  the end
                   of file sequence.  The possible failure responses are:
                           450 File being modified: file-name
                           501 Illegal file name: file-name
                           550 File not found: file-name
                           550 No such user: file-name
                           550 File protected: file-name
                           554 File selection error code 'octal-integer
                   Also, the non-fatal error message:
                           211-Block mode not available
                   may precede the 252 message in cases where the network is
                   temporarily out of block  IO buffers.  After the  file is
                   transfered, the final status is reported if successful:

                           250 file-name decimal-integer chars
                   Or if unsuccessful:
                           451 Black ball received - data lost
                           451 IO.DER Device error for DSK:file-name

                           552 IO.BKT Disk full or quota exceeded
                   If  the  READ  command  is  terminated  by  <CR><LF>,  no
                   translation occurs.  If the command is terminated by only
                   <LF>, all  occurances of <CR><LF>  in the  file (Tymcom-X
                   end-of-line) are translated to <LF> when sent  (Unix end-
                   of-line).   The end  of file  mark,  <^d><CR><LF>, always
                   contains  <CR>.  In  all cases,  SFTP will  remove PDP-10
                   style  line  numbers  (as left  by  the  SOS  editor) and
                   embedded and trailing nulls.

           WRIT filename

                   This commands accepts a  file to be written on  the slave
                   system.  If the file is successfully opened, a response
                           354 Start file input; end with <eot><crlf>
                   is sent.  The master should then send the contents of the
                   file  using the  same escape  mechanism  described above.
                   After  the end  of file,  <^d><cr><lf>, is  received, the
                   following message will be  sent if the file  transfer was
                   successful:
                           250 file-name decimal-integer chars
                   Or if unsuccessful, one of the error messages:
                           451 Black ball received - data lost

                           552 IO.BKT Disk full or quota exceeded
                   The following errors are possible in response to the WRIT
                   command:
                           450 File being modified: file-name

                   In addition, the  following advisory message  may precede
                   the 354 message  in response to  the WRIT command  in the
                   event  the  network  is unable  to  provide  a  block I/O
                   buffer, resulting in a less efficient transfer:

                   A <CR> preceding a  <LF> is optional, and if  absent will
                   be provided by the program to meet  Tymcom-X conventions.
                   In block mode input (if available), there will be a 15-20
                   second delay  after sending the  end of file  mark before
                   the system responds.

                   followed by LOGOFF.

           STOP

                   This command is typically used for debugging.   It causes
                   the  server  program  to  immediately  terminate  without
                   logging out.

           All  messages  from  the  SFTP  slave  will  be  terminated  with
           <cr><lf>.  Commands and data are not echoed.

           It is very important that the master program properly process any
           error messages that may  be created.  In most cases,  this simply
           means reporting them  to the user  and terminating.  In  order to
           test error processing, the following otherwise illegal file names
           may be specified with the  READ or WRIT commands to  simulate the
           error conditions indicated:
                   .0      file not found
                   .1      user not found
                   .2      file protected
                   .3      file being modified
                   .8      illegal file name
                   .12     disk full or quota exceeded
                   .17     unknown file selection error
                   .18     unknown IO error
                   .19     device IO error
                   .20     data IO error
                   .21     disk full or quota exceeded
                   .31     black ball
           Each of these conditions should be tested to make sure the master
           program  responds properly.   Errors 0-17  are detected  when the

           Errors 18-35 are detected in the process of transfering data.  In

           outputting the error message.

from: kevin j sinclair

bill,

the problem seems to be a program (spl)sftp that is not on 36;
steve feldman suggested making a file netcopy.log which logs the
messages during a file copy to a remote system, and it had
that in it -
-R (SPL)SFTP

?SFTP not found

so that sems to be the problem.  file is netcopy.log on
my nada directory sinclair/nada.

thanks,

\023 is control-S
\030 is control-X
Since the supervisor interprets these as control messages, they are
clearly mistakes, and can be deleted without any concern for a
current user.  The actual task of deleting them, however, may need
help from a NETVAL wizard.  I will attempt to get a full dump of the
MUD this weekend so we can be sure about the extent of usernames
which violate the policy.  There are probably about 5000 names that
were missing from the file I used to generate that list, so there
may be one or two other bogus names.

The purpose of the exercise is to reserve special characters to be used
for other options that are being added to the login sequence.  While
we are at it, we are also reserving some characters which we feel we
might need in the future for special options.

	This is a glossary of Tymnet network terminology.  The first
section refers to CCITT terms, the second refers to Tymnet terms, and
the third refers to acronyms.  This is intended as a working document,
and thus subject to changes and additions.


CCITT Terminology

CALL REQUEST - an X.25 packet requesting to setup a call and containing
the calling DTE address and the called DTE address (in addition to other
various X.25 fields).

CALLING (DTE) ADDRESS - an address (usually X.121) in packed binary
coded decimal digits (max 15) specifying the original requestor of a call.  

CALLED (DTE) ADDRESS - an address (usually X.121) in packed binary coded
decimal digits (max 15) specifying the requested destination of a call.

X.121 ADDRESS - an address containing a 4-digit (decimal) DNIC followed
by 0 to 10 digits of NTN.
 

TYMNET Terminology

ACCESS PROFILE ENTRY (APE) - an entry in an access profile represented
by a pair of origination and destination lists.

ADDRESS - a symbolic representation of the origination or destination of
a circuit.  [Currently, X.21 address or hostname, but not host number]

CIRCUIT REQUEST - a node-to-sup message (0C) indicating a request to
setup a circuit and containing the login string and origination
information, eg. address, host, node, physical port.

CLASS - a set of hosts or nodes, either all inclusions or all
exclusions, in the origination list.

DESTINATION ADDRESS - the address indicating the destination of a
circuit; the prefixed (with a "-") X.121 address that is derived from
the called DTE address of an incoming call (call request) at a X.25/X.75
interface; the resultant destination address.

DESTINATION LIST - a list of possible destination items (targets),
eg. host, name, group.

DESTINATION NAME - a name of an access profile in the MUD that describes
a destination, either hostname or X.121 name.  [Formerly, destination
name was called "hostname".]

DNIC TABLE - a data base in the Supervisor that defines the
characteristics of all DNIC's relevant to the network.
 
EXCLUSION - an item or a representation of a set of items in the
destination list that will result in a circuit request failure if
specified in the destination field of the login string.  [Previously,
called "exception" or "negative".]

EXTENSION - the supplementary information in the extension field of the
login string that is sent in the needle to the destination for possible
further refinement of the ultimate destination (eg. telephone number for
out-dial, port number for port selection, or call user data for X.25 call
request packet).  [Currently, no specs for its implementation].

FOREIGN - pertaining to a network outside the native network.

FOREIGN DNIC - a DNIC of a non-native (ie. foreign) network.

FULL ADDRESS - an address that contains a network identifier (eg. DNIC).
[Currently, only X.121 address is a full address; in the future, perhaps
"39@FOO" or "TYMNET~SYS57" may be used.]

GROUP - a set of hosts, either all inclusions or exclusions, in the
destination list.

HOME ADDRESS - an address in the destination list of an access profile
that is designated "home" and is used in MUD lookups to determine the
resultant destination address.

HOSTNAME - a destination name for an access profile in the MUD that
may be specified by a string of characters beginning with a letter;
a non-X.121 address.

INCLUSION - an item or a representation of a set of items in the
destination list that may result in a circuit request success if
specified in the destination field of the login string.  [Previously,
called "positive".]

IN-PLACE - hosts or nodes specifically listed in the origination or
destination lists of an APE, ie. not part of a class or group.

LOGIN STRING - a string of characters containing the option, user(name),
transit, destination, and extension fields for the purpose of requesting
a circuit (terminated by a CR or ";").

MUD ENTRY (or ACCESS PROFILE) - the access profile containing set of
origination/destination lists for a name (username or destination
name) in the MUD.

NAME - a designation validated via NETVAL that defines and specifies
a particular MUD entry, ie. a username and/or destination name.
				NAME

	    USERNAME			     DESTINATION NAME
	     /    \				/	  \
	NON-X.121  X.121		  HOSTNAME	X.121 NAME

NATIVE - pertaining to the local network, ie. the network under
consideration.

NATIVE DNIC - a DNIC of the native network.

NEEDLE - the Sup-to-node message (09) which is used to thread a circuit
and which contains the appropriate origination and destination
information (eg. host, node, address) of the circuit; the ISIS message
with similar function and information.

ORIGINATION ADDRESS - the address indicating the origination of a circuit;
the prefixed (with a "-") X.121 address that is derived from the calling
DTE address of an incoming call (call request) at a X.25/X.75 interface.

ORIGINATION LIST - a list of allowable origination items (origins),
eg. node, host, name, class.

PRIMARY DNIC - the default DNIC of a network that is used in the absence
of specified DNIC in a X.121 address; only one per network.  [Ex: 3106
is the primary DNIC for Tymnet.]

RESULTANT - after all login processing.

RESULTANT DESTINATION - the final address or hosts resulting from all
MUD processing to determine the termination point of the requested
circuit.

SECONDARY DNIC - the non-primary DNIC of a netowrk with more than one
DNIC defined.  [Ex: the DNIC for RCA is a secondary DNIC within the
Tymnet public network.]

SHARED DNIC - a DNIC that is used by more than one network.

SPECIFIED - present in the login string.

SPECIFIED DESTINATION - the information (address or hosts with possibly a
subhost number) in the destination field of the login
string describing the desired destination of the circuit being
requested.

SPECIFIED TRANSIT - the information [currently, RPOA] in the transit
field of the login string describing the desired transit network of
the circuit to be built toward the specified destination.

SUBNET - a set of nodes which are controlled by and interconnected to,
but logically isolated from, a hierarchically superior network.

USERNAME - a name in the username field of a login string that
represents the user, ie. the person who is making a circuit request;
the NUI in a X.25 packet that is used in the username field; MUD lookup
is dependent of type (non-X.121, X.121).

X.121 ADDRESS - a CCITT X.121 address whose presence in TYMNET is
indicated by a prefix dash "-".

X.121 NAME - a destination name for an access profile in the MUD that
may be specified by a string of digits preceded by a "-" and that may be
derived from an X.121 address (derivation is specific to the network).

X.121 USERNAME - a username that begins with a "-" and followed by
decimal digits; MUD lookup depends on specifications in the DNIC table.
[Non-X.121 username utilizes the entire name for the lookup.]

RE:  Punctuation Characters in Usernames

DA:  December 11, 1986

==========================================================================

I am proposing that NETVAL restrict usage of certain punctuation
characters in usernames so that we can reserve them for special
purposes in the future.  In particular, I suggest that legal
non-alphanumerics in the usernames should be:
		# $ * & , . - /
in order to be flexible and compatible with current usage.  At present,
there are a few characters:
		blank " % ' + ; @ [ cntl-chars
that are possibly in use and are being investigated by Wayne for
deletion.  I would like to "illegalize" the following characters:
		blank " % ' + ; @ [ ] ( ) < > ! ^ = ~ { } | \ ? :
as well as all control characters.

Furthermore, the destination names (formerly called "hostnames") will be
of two types: hostnames that begin with a letter, and X.121 names that
begin with a "-".  The same restriction should be applied for these
names.

I am putting this suggestion forth for discussion to see whether we
agree, whether it can be implemented, what are the ramifications, and
when should we impose these restrictions.

Subject: baud rate fix 

The Consat had a weird idea of not letting ports with certain baud rates
change their baud rates.  2400, 4800, 50 (baudot), 75 (baudot) and 75(ascii)
were deemed above a mere B1 message.  That has been changed and no baud rate
is considerred above the B1 message.  Is turnabout fair play?  The TIO input
command (INPUT 1200) was accepted but did not send the CONSAT the B1 message
corresponding to set input baud rate, but did send other B1 messages (below).
Also, TIO did not accept valid speeds such as 2400 and 4800 (output command).
Also, TIO sends B1 03 xx B1 04 xx and B1 08 xx on accepting either the INPUT
or OUTPUT command.  It doesn't do any harm but I don't see what good it does
either.

The new consat R file is on (asynctest)iscs06.r02 and should be reloaded
into 2166 in a couple of days (tomorrow?).

Thanks for your help.

If I want to try the newes't version, should I use ASYNCTEST or ASYNCDEV?  I notice that ASYNCDEV seems to have a newer version that changes some calling conventions (register linkage).  Thanks -Bill

asyncdev has the correct version.  Scott and I hadn't finished testing,
so I didn't copy it to asynctest yet.  They both should end up the same.
I am just using asynctest for a frozen test copy to deploy within BUBBNET.
Hopefully tomarrow....

Subject: EBUS interface and INPUT BAUD RATE 

John,
Do you understand why the EBUS interface goes to extreem lengths to
prevent the PDP-10 from actually setting the input baud rate while
makeing it look like it really did?  I noticed today that I can set
the output baud rate, but not the input baud rate.

Subject: "Do you have any ideas on this"... 

Do you have any ideas on this dilema...
   I have a printer on an addressable port configured with "RCV".  When
   the host builds a circuit to the printer, it can't tell if it has got
   through since the printer isn't about to say hello.
It would be nice if a string could be defined for an addressable port so
it would be output to the caller on an incomming call - like a welcome
message.  Likewise, the WRU/ABACK feature might be a solution if it worked
for non-Telex ports.

Subject: Punctuations 

Wayne,

It was my understanding from our conference call with you and Vida that
you will be looking into the usernames currently using the punctuations
that we would like to reserve for special meanings in the future.
Hopefully, we could delete or convert these usernames in order to
conform with our new restrictions.  If this is possible, then we could
request Romolo to incorporate the restrictions into NETVAL so that
future usernames will also conform with the restrictions.

I hope that our understandings coincide.  Not only are we looking at the
blanks, but also all the other punctuations indicated by the * in my
note to you.  If our understandings differ,  please let me know so that
we could sort this out.

Thanks,

David

Subject: TELECOPY post processor at the source end. 

I have modified TELCHK so that it can be run as an alternate logout program.
To use it, run (SPL)TELALP in the child frame.  It will set (SPL)TELCHK as the
ALP and then run SYS:TELECO with the appropriate run offset.  The results
are appended to TELCHK.LOG in the GFD'd directory.  The next step is to have
TELCHK send mail to the author of the ###TEL.COM file.

Let me know when the post processor for AUXMOX gets done.

Subject: SETMAI bug 

I was just thinking.  The bug I fixed last night in SETMAI could have
resulted in the JP.MAI bit being set in any word following
the origin of JBTPRV.  The code used to do
	CAML T1,JOBN
so it would allow the bit to be set in any index relative to JBTPRV if
the location JOBN actually contained something big.  When I looked,
	JOBN/ 0
but different monitors may have been configured for different JOBN.

Of course, this would also require somebody calling SETMAI with the wrong
argument to do damage.  If some program (like MAILER) was using the old
convention where the AC contained the address of the username when calling
SETMAI, then it could have cause sadness.  To my knowledge, all of the
mail programs have long been updated to use the new calling convention
which was put in place about a year ago.  You might check any crashes
where you see bits turned on to see if the bit happens to be JP.MAI.

Subject: Why nothing ever appeared in the BAT pages. 

I found out why the monitor never wrote anything in the BAT pages when
it found a page with an I/O error.  The routine UPERBT in CORE1 read in the
BAT pages, but would not update them if they failed the consistancy check.
Since ONCDSK/REFSTR never set the self pointers, the consistency check always
failed.  I fixed this by changine POPJ P, to PJRST WTBOTH at CHKBAT+5.
"BAMPHF!" BAT pages now work!.  I ran CKSUM on the 11 bad files in BADFILES,
and we now have 11 known bad spots marked in the BAT pages.

Now if DSKCLN honors the BAT pages, and sets the F bit for them even if they
are not part of a file, then we won't need to keep the RIBs around anymore.

The "F" Gateway described above has been consistently zapping circuits
built from Bubbnet without any message (or appearent reason).  Since it
was answered, it was causing multi-targeting problems so I logged in to
DDT and halted it.  -Bill

Bill,

We have succesfully interfaced the HP ploter to the 3com file server.
We are able to take an ascii file of plotter commands and send it to
the file server with a COPY command.  The server then sends it to the
plotter at 9600 bps without dificulty.  The first line of a file for a
B size plot (11 x 17) is as follows.

^[.@1024;1:DF;SC100,8700,100,5400,LT;PA

Wonderful!  Now all I need is a way to get at the server through Tymnet and
I won't have to mess around with diskettes anymore.  I'll come by some time
and we can talk about it.  Thanks for letting me know.  -bill

The NEWS command will tell you everything backwards, just stop when it
gets to 43.  As for reserved characters, I guess you understand.  I think
you've been talking to Dave, so I'm not really sure what you've agreed
upon.  I'm working (now) on trying to get a dump of the MUD so I can give
you a complete list, if the gateway's would only cooperate.  -Bill

Subject: ebus 

The EBUS interface returns an aux circuit error code of "access barred" when
there is no current supervisor.  Programs expect this error to mean that the
supervisor has rejected the call due to the user's access profile.  This is
assumed to be a permanent condition, so retries are generally not attempted.

A new error code should be assigned for supervisor not available.

BILL, 

GOT A CALL EARLIER TO DAY FROM MIKE IN OPERATIONS (SHIFT SUP) COMPLAINING
ABOUT GETTING UNUSUAL ERROR MESSAGES WHEN SENDING MAIL ON 39.

WHEN TRYING TO SEND MAIL HE GOT:

?TUMS:ERROR LOGBSY IN MODULE SMTPX, MESSAGE IS LOG BUSY FOR 5 MIN.

HE ALSO GOT THE SAME ERROR MESSAGE REFERING TO MODULES TMS AND MCAUTO.
I TESTING SENDING MAIL TO A USER ON 39 WITHOUT A PROBLEM, BUT I WAS SURPRISED
TO SEE MY MAIL INCLUDED IN MY TUMS MESSAGES.  IS THIS A NEW OPTION OF TUMS???
IS TUMS PERHAPS OVER EXTENDING ITSELF????  

JUST THOUGHT I WOULD PASS THIS ON TO YOU.  OH, MIKE IN OPERATIONS DOESN't USE
TUMS.  (JUST THOUGHT I'D THROW THAT IN THERE.)

THANKS - AND AS FOR THE NAMES - WE ONLY NEED THOSE WITH THE "ILLEGAL"

Subject: illegal user name report 

The following report shows all 116 illegal user names found in the public
network MUD.  The list uses the following conventions to display names which
may otherwise be unprintable:
    ^x   = control x
    _    = blank
All other characters are exactly as they appear.

The policy for validation programs should be to ALLOW any of the following:
	#$&*-./0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
with the exception that the characters
	-.
may not be used at the beginning of a user name.

The following files exist on Bubbnet system 39:
	(WRS)MUDANL.MSG		this message
	(WRS)MUDANL.RPT		the report (included below)
	(WRS)MUDANL.LIS		just the list of invalid usernames
They should be listed on 132 column paper, as should this message.

Thank you.

Cliff,
At least for now, you can use the username
    MAIL
for tickling the TUMS<->PROFS program.  The password is
    I SPELL RELIEF TUMS
(embedded blanks are literal).
The program is set up right now so it will take your protocol as
we discussed on the phone:

	220 C57.Tymnet service ready
	POLL SLVMCL1
	250 okay
	QUIT
	221 C57.Tymnet closing transmission channel

The numbered lines are responses sent to you.
There may be several lines of garbage (message of the day, etc.) that
precedes the 220 message.
Remember, please send both CR and LF.
The QUIT is optional, you may just zap the circuit if you wish.
Consider any response other than "250 okay" an error.
The interface will not echo.

I have not setup the program to actually respond to the tickle, yet,
so it will still maintain a constant circuit to TUMSGATE.  I will
probably change that after I hear from you that you think your program
is working, since after I change it at my end, it could impact message
reliability if all the bugs aren't out.

There is no harm in sending as many "tickles" as you want while you are
testing.  They're just logged and ignored for now.

Let me know how it goes.
Thanks for your help.
-Bill

We do not have a signed agreement for the Numbering Plan from swbt yet.  I
expect it before 12/31/86.  SWBT is requesting a delivery date of 1/1/88.  
We will be receiving a letter of agreement which I will forward to all
of you for approval.  In the meantime, I suggest we do everything we can
to get ready for this project so we can meet the requested date.

Su,

I had heard a rumor that the SWB Numbering Plan contract was to be signed
on December 15, 1986.  However, I did not hear any followup.  I am requesting
status on this project.  Who is waiting for what??

Thank you.

bill, i did not mean to ignore your mesage about meeting w/ susie. I was
out sick all last week.  Anyway, not it seems as if ACS or whoever they call 
themselves this week don't want us coming up on interontyme as we are

Subject: SMI interface macros 

Here is some documentation on the macros needed to make use of the consolidated
monitor (as well as a copy of pscsmi.id, where many of these macros are used).

The intent here is to make it as easy as possible to maintain and add new
log messages, without much programming required.  Note the the bulk of the
macro's are used to describe the log message.  This should be much better
than having to define a proceedure to display every new type of log message.

The reason for including the pscsmi.id file here is simply because not everyone
has access to 65 and because is serves as a real example...that relates
directly to the PMTSMONITOR displays.

One thought is that, with frequent updates to the number of possible log
messages, MMI might send the table of log message descriptions directly to
the various monitoring systems.











                  Slot/Monitor Interface (SMI) Macros

     The purpose of this document is to define the parameters of the macros
used to interface with the SMI.  The macros needed are as follows:

     SMI.ID - Describes a log message and assigns a unique number to identify
	      the log message
     SMI.XS - Defines a hex string subfield
     SMI.GT - Defines a GMT subfield
     SMIGEN - Generates the SMI header for a given module
     SMIRPT - Generates the code to report a series of values to the
              monitor (via the SMI)
     SMILOG - Generates the code to log a unique event (e.g. restart)
              to the monitor.

     The SMI.ID macro will be used in the file, PSCSMI.ID, that is included in
the compilation of all FTSs that employ the SMI. This macro generates no code
in a switch, but only serves to generate a series of equates.  In the MMI, this
macro generates a description of the log message which drives the terminal
display logic.  The macro calls are of the form:

     SMI.ID(idname,value,desc,(type1,type2,type3,...))
          where  "idname"  is a unique name used within the slot to
                           generate messages with the assigned id value.
                 "value"   must be a unique variable/log identifier across
                           the entire network.  If value is not specified, it
                           will default to one more than the value assigned
                           to the previous idname (in the last call to
                           SMI.ID).
		 "desc"    is a brief description of the variable or log
			   message.  This description is displayed by the
			   diagnostic monitor when a data message with the
			   given identifier is received.
		 "type1", "type2", etc. define the type of subfields that
			   comprise the log message.

     Macros SMI.XS and SMI.GT are used to define the type descriptors that
are referenced in the parameter lists of SMI.ID.  MMI uses these subfield
type descriptors for the terminal display of the data sent from the switches
being monitored.  The macro calls are of the form:

     SMI.XS(type,length,desc)
	and
     SMI.GT(type,desc)
	where	 "type"    is the type name used by SMI.ID.
		 "length"  is the number of bytes in the subfield to be
			   displayed.  (SMI.GT always takes a subfield 4 bytes
			   long.)
		 "desc"    is a brief description of the subfield.


     The remaining macros (SMIGEN, SMIRPT and SMILOG) are used in the
body of the module that is making use of SMI.  It is these macros that generate
the code needed to interface with SMI.

     SMIGEN must be the first of the three remaining macros to be called.  The
parameter is just a 10-character module name (e.g. SMIGEN(PSCAUT.A00)).  This
macro call will serve to identify the module for subsequent calls to SMIRPT and
SMILOG.  (Each module in a given slot is assigned a number that is used for all
messages to and from the monitor.)

     SMILOG is used to generate the code to send to the monitor a data
message that contains no data.  The format is simply SMILOG(idname).  Only
the value assigned to idname (by SMI.ID) is passed in the data message
(with, of course, the module number and report number).  SMILOG has limited
use in signaling the occurance of unique events. 

     SMIRPT is used to send data messages that contain data.  The format of
the call is:

     SMIRPT(idname,(a1,l1),(a2,l2),(a3,l3),...)

Each pair of parameters is an address and length, which together define
a data area to be included in the message.

Double lines are a real problem.  The best solution is to set
	TTY WIDTH 80
	TTY CRLF
and then tell your terminal to mind its own business (if its an HP-2621,
that's done by setting Strap "c" to off (miniscule)).  If only just one
terminal manufacturer would get it right, it would truely be refreshing.
Every terminal I've ever seen goes to newline after receiving the 80th
character on a line.  It should in stead do so before receiving the 81st.
The major difference, of course, being that there may not be an 81st.

I have to hand it to those who designed the protocol for TELECO... a good
portion of all the things we've been talking about ARE already IN there.

I haven't found file attributes or where the programs open the output files
but just looking at the message types shows that TELECOpy can do more than
it does.  There's mention that if it's 940 to 940, circumvent all the file
system security.  Telecopy keeps AC license when it lowers license... I do
not know why since it only builds normal circuits... but!  License password
records are already defined (for 940s) to send 9 bytes (3 words of 24 bits)
of hash and license info.  This could be changed for pdp-10 transfers to
send 9 bytes of hash (4.5 opername, 4.5 password).

2.  IF WE WANT MORE TIME FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT WE SAY WE'LL STUDY THE

I was going through some old papers and came across a copy of Edsger W.
Dijkstra, "How do we tell truths that might hurt?", published in June 1975.
Here are a couple choice excerpts which I'm sure you will appreciate given
your interest in languages.

I'm studying the Bible quite seriously right now (for over a year,
actually) and am continually amazed at the richness and completeness of the
practical wisdom that is contained therein.  It takes only an open mind and
a tiny effort to see past what an ignorant glance might see as mythology.
I want to thank you for your part in helping me to develop the heart
condition that has allowed me to learn God's Word.  I pray that I, too, can
have the privelege of being helpful to others in the same way.

It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students
that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers
they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.

The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore,
be regarded as a criminal offence.

About the use of language: it is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a
blunt axe.  It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.

Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of
one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer.

The tools we use have a profound (and devious!) influence on our
thinking habits, and, therefore , on our thinking abilities.

did you get your vme cage fixed yet?  when you do, are you keeping

Second International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming 
Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS-II)

Rickey's Hyatt House

Palo Alto, California, October 5-8, 1987

Sponsored by ACM and IEEE Computer Society

This is a reprise of the highly successful symposium held in 1982. Many of the 
ideas discussed at that time are now reaching the marketplace.  This time, we 
intend to focus on experimental analyses of architectures and performance 
evaluations of prototype systems, including application- specific designs. The 
time is ripe to review progress and identify future directions.

Full papers (approximately 5000 words) are solicited in:

   * Language and OS-Influenced Processor Designs

   * Architecture-Influenced Compiler and OS Design

   * Experimental Analysis of Instruction Set and Other Architectural Design 
   Choices

   * Performance Evaluation of Prototype and Newly Available Commercial Systems

We also solicit short (1000 word) high quality technical abstracts on 
innovative commercial and prototype systems that address topics of relevance to
this conference. Full presentations will be expected.

Five copies of submitted papers should be sent to the program chairman at the 
address below, and will be accepted for evaluation until February 1, 1987. 
Submissions will be read by members and designated reviewers of the program 
committee:

   Randy Katz, U.C. Berkeley (chairman)

   Forest Baskett, Silicon Graphics

   David Ditzel, AT&T Bell Laboratories

   James Goodman, University of Wisconsin

   John Hennessy, Stanford University

   Edward McCreight, Xerox PARC

   Steven Muchnick, Sun Microsystems

   Richard Sites, DEC Hudson

   Alan Smith, U.C. Berkeley

   Chuck Thacker, DEC Systems Res. Center

   Philip Treleaven, University College London

   Mario Tokoro, Keio University

Bill,

It has come to my attention that among your other skills you also are
able to juggle phone numbers in this building.  I have moved into the
office next to yours, room 36 with phone number 7166 and would like to
have it swapped with my old number 7667.  Please send me instructions
or let me know when the switch occurs.

Thanks...Omar

I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS PROJECT.  I EXPECT THE LETTER REQUESTING
DELIVERY OF THIS SOFTWARE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.  IT SHOULD BE BASICALLY WHAT
WE'VE AGREED TO WITH ONE EXCEPTION --  SWBT IS GOING TO REQUEST SUPPORT
OF THE NUMBERING PLAN FOR THE BSC PROTOCOL.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE'VE 
AGREED TO DO IN THE PAST.  HOWEVER, THIS REQUEST DOES PRESENT SOME INTERESTING
ALTERNATIVES:

1.  IF WE DON'T WANT TO PURSUE SUPPORT AT THIS TIME WE MERELY SAY NO AND
STICK WITH THE STATED 12 MONTH ARO AND $120K.

2.  IF WE WANT MORE TIME FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT WE SAY WE'LL STUDY THE 
REQUEST BUT IT WILL DELAY THE MAIN PROJECT.  NO COMMITMENT ON TIME OR 
PRICE MADE OR RECINDED.

3.  IF WE KNOW WE WANT TO GET INTO THIS PORTION BECAUSE IT IS RELATIVELY
MINOR, WE AGREE TO DO THE WORK AT DIFFERENT ARO TIME AND PRICES.  

4.  IF WE WANT TO BE REALLY GOOD GUYS, WE DO THE WORK FOR THE SAME PRICE
IN THE SAME TIMEFRAME.

5.  IF IT WOULD BENEFIT US IN SOME OTHER WAY TO ACCEPT THIS PROJECT, WE
DO SO AND ADD TIME AND COSTS TO THE QUOTE ON THE TABLE.  OTHER BENEFITS
MIGHT INCLUDE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR MORE NTD PEOPLE, INCREASED 1987 REVENUE
OR INCREASED SUPPORT PERSONNELL.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR POSITION SHOULD BE.  I SUGGEST POSITIONS 1 AND 3 AS
THE MOST LIKELY.  SWBT IS REQUESTING THIS BECAUSE ASYNC, X.25 AND BSC USERS
ARE ON THE NET TODAY.  TO HAVE ONE LOGON PROCEDURE FOR ASYNC AND X.25 AND 
ANOTHER FOR BSC WOULD BE CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO ADMINISTER.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.  AS IS SAID, I EXPECT THE LETTER NO 
LATER THAN JAN 9.

To my knowledge, all the sup stuff is scheduled.  As for the other units:
async, x.25 and they've just brought up BSC which was not originally part
of phase I, I don't know the status.  I'm sure BSC knows nothing of this.
This whole thing really needs a coordinator/manager to get all the units
together and keep them informed.  Allyn can help with scheduling, but I'm
not sure that's enough.

Pat Driscoll, Dennis Ernst and Adele Newman have all been informed about
what needs to be done on the X.25 end and have promised its all under control.

Chris Black did likewise for async, but that may have been lost in the
shuffle.

BSC, as I say, was never planned to be part of phase I.

it seems bubbcopy works now to 39 but not to 36?  they put
a new version of unix on to eunix and then steve had
to fix 'tip' or something like that...i tried and 
failed on 36 but it worked on 39.  i can use 39
 and perhaps 36 is even fixed by now...anyway just
thought i would drop you a note in case you are 
involved at all.  if not, disregard this note.

Subject: 600 baud autobaud 

Hmmm.  It appears, Deborah, that 600 baud autobaud does not work for any
of the TID's <CR>, A, I, or G.  I had thought I had tried it, but I may
have tried another speed (like 1200) by mistake.  At any rate, the AID
feature on PVC's works quite fine, and that's what I wanted.  I am not
sure where the problem lies, perhaps in ISIS or the micro-code.  It may
also be that I forgot to put it in some table, somewhere, but I don't
think that's the case.

Does this create a problem with release?  After all, nobody expects it to
work at 600 baud!  Let me know what you think.  I'll let you know what I
find when I look into it further, but that will probably be a few weeks
away as I've gotten rather busy.

Subject: Logon parsing, transit and options fields 

Weyyi,

After discussion with Bill Soley last week regarding the new logon parsing
the following was agreed upon:

The equal sign "=" will be used as we discussed, to precede a transit field
entry, and the colon ":" is only used for the start of the destination field.
The transit field entries may be of the forms we discussed, "-DNIC" indicating
the RPOA, "xxxxx" a one to five digit gateway host number, and "hostname", only
the RPOA portion being currently supported.

The options field is delimited by opening and closing parenthese as
"(options)".  Apparently this has been Bill Soley's intention all along
but I missed this point and wanted to make sure it is clarified.  The options
field may contain any arrangement of legal characters, presumably fairly
large, though I'm not sure how many characters maximum.  Their interpretation
will allow the user to specify new logon information and old style options
without the use of control characters, in a manner that is transparent to
old interfaces, passing as normal logon characters.  This will allow old
interfaces to take advantage of new features, by specifying the new
information as logon characters in the options field.  For the first
pass we will probably just gather up the characters and keep them in the
logon list to be sent out with the needle bound for the circuit termination.

Bill will redraw a syntax diagram to illustrate these points and I will copy
everybody when I receive it.

Thanks...Omar

I called the CHP today on the old number and got a new number for
dispatch.  We really need to get it in the next up date to the
speed call tables.  911 can't deal with getting to a chp dispatcher
on the other side of the bay.  I think if they called it into the 
local dispatcher it would get there but they don't have any 
instructions on how to do that...

Anyway, the new number is 408-436-0572.

Channel 54 (KTEH, San Jose) has a 3-part series on SILICON VALLEY which will be
aired Wednesdays, 14, 21 and 28 Jan at 9:00 p.m.

The first one, this Wednesday, Jan 14, is entitled BOOMTOWN, and apparently 
covers historical background.

One of the historical backs grounded in this program is one DCE.  They came to 
VG2 last summer and interviewed me while shooting a bunch of footage, borrowed 
photographs, etc. -- and went off, telling me that they are a low-budget 
operation so not to expect much.  But one of that crew called me up a couple of
weeks ago and said I'd probably like it enough to want to make a recording of 
the program.  When they saw a picture of our support crew for the '68 movie, 
and I pointed out that Stewart Brand was a buddy of ours and was one of our 
volunteer cameramen -- they went to Sausalito and interviewed him, too.  And, I
saw a quick preview the other day that featured some footage of Steve Wozniak.

Could be of general interest to you all?

If any of you has a VCR and wants to record the hour, and then doesn't have any
great plans for the recording, I'd like to barter with you for it.

     I need  to talk  to you  about  this  project.    I  expect  the  letter
     requesting delivery  of this software in a couple of days.  It should be
     basically what  we've agreed  to with  one exception -- SWBT is going to
     request support of the Numbering Plan for the BSC protocol.  This is not
     something we've  agreed to  do in  the past.  However, this request does
     present some interesting alternatives:
     
     1.  If we don't want to pursue support at this time we merely say no and
     stick with the stated 12 month aro delivery for $150K.
     
     2.   If we  want more time for the entire project we say we'll study the
     request but  it will  delay the  main project.  No commitment on time or
     price made or recinded.
     
     3.  If we know we want to get into this portion because it is relatively
     minor, we agree to do the work at different aro time and delivery price.
     
     4.  If we want to be really good guys, we do the work for the same price
     in the same timeframe.
     
     5.   If it would benefit us in some other way to accept this project, we
     do so  and add time and costs to the quote on the table.  Other benefits
     might include  the authorization  for more  NTD people,  increased  1987
     revenue or increased support personnel.
     
     I don't  know what  our position should be.  I suggest positions 1 and 3
     as the most likely.  SWBT is requesting this because async, X.25 and BSC
     users are  on the  net today.  To have one logon procedure for async and
     X.25 and another for BSC would be confusing and difficult to administer.
     
     Please let  me know  what you  think.  As I said, I expect the letter no
     later than Jan 9.

Bill,

We should get together and go over the SWB document that Gazel gave me to
review.  There are many specific scenarios that I am not clear on.

I will be available tomorrow afternoon and all day Thursday; just TUMS me
when a good time for you is.

Thanks...Omar

Carl and I discovered that if you read a record that is more than 15 pages
long on an F3, then some poor user's UPT gets wiped out.  The unfortunate
job either can't run anything at all, or every command typed will do a
CONTINUE on the current core image.  Anyway, he tried to read 24 pages with
ASP, and that mangled my context pages to the point that everything I typed
threw me back into SED.

I'm sorry for the problems you've been having with TUMS.  Appearently, not
all the files from the new release were properly installed on 62 and 930.
Some of the old programs still existed and caused an incompatibility.  I have
corrected the problem, so let me know if there are any further difficulties.

Subject: gateway 

This is too early to be sure, but I think tums is causing the out of
ports problem (actually triggering the problem).  It seems the gateway
doesn't handle all Yellow balls while in login mode.  I have ring
traces of MAIL:1088 trying to login then sending a YB.  unfortunately
I only have the into gateway ISIS ring, I wonder if you have some log
of these logons (tuesday 1/13 from 3pm to 7pm).  The logon failure reason
is of great interest.  That should allow for duplication of this persistent
problem.

In-reply-to: your message of Tue, 13 Jan 87 19:26:19 PST

The TUMS log shows mostly "host down" responses.  The target 1088 is on
a micro-node (PDP-11) base, so its network protocol may be strange.  In
a couple of cases, the circuit to the gateway was simply zapped with no
message being output.  I hope this helps.  Holler if you need more.  -Bill

Subject: Re: Punctuation Characters in Usernames 
In-reply-to: NSMS.B/FULTZ@Ontyme.Tymnet message of 10 JAN 87 17:20:18

The reason we are restricting the use of punctuation in user names is
because we are expanding the login string syntax.  Other delimiters are
required for other fields such as transit hosts, X.121 addresses, RPOA,
call user data, options and probably more in the future.

In particular, the character `blank' is possibly negotiable as an embedded
character, but not as a leading or trailing character.  The character `@'
is used as an address field delimiter by many other networks -- it is in
the interest of providing compatability in the future (as internetworking
becomes more practical) that we are reserving this character at this time.

I'm sure `@' should not be a problem, since there are currently only 9 user
names in the public network which contain an `@'.  All of these are inhouse
(ih), and most are in the same GAN (50325).

Bob mentioned that "If we recommend using non-alpha characters, we should
have a full complement to choose from."  Do we in fact so recommend?  If so
why?  If the purpose is for security, that function is to be provided by
the password which will continue to be relatively unrestricted.

Comments please.

Subject: FILE (WRS)MUX04.P00 

In the assembly of the command files (BUBBNET)bb2166.c02 and
(BUBBNET)bb2067.c02, I encountered a problem with the file
(WRS)mux04.p00.  To remedy this problem, I copied this file to the
BUBBNET directory and changed the single colon(:) preceding the comment,
to a double semi-colon(;;), which enabled the NAD to run correctly.

I have since changed the command files to refer back to your directory.
If we need to be referencing this file similarly in the future, could
you please make the same adjustment to (WRS)mux04.p00.  Or,if you have
an alternate suggestion to remedy this problem, please let me know.

Thank You.

Subject: Re: FILE (WRS)MUX04.P00 
In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 15 Jan 87 12:29:47 PST

I have no explanation for why these files point at (WRS)MUX04.I00 unless
somebody used my MUX command file as an example at some point.  At any
rate, the file MUX04.I00 does not exist in my directory, but does exist in
the (SOURCE) directory.  However, it is not a command file, rather it is
an assembler source file.  Therefore, the lines
	;X(WRS)MUX04.P00
should be replaced with
	;@(SOURCE)MUX04.P00
and the slots reassembled.  Since they are now running without said patch
installed, they may be unreliable.

When investigating this, I also noticed that the following files include
	;@(BUBBNET)MUX04.I00
which should be changed to
	;@(SOURCE)MUX04.I00
The files are:
	BB2362.C02
	BB2166.C02
	BB2357.C04
	BB2360.C02
	BK2641.C04
	BB2647.C02
	BS2357.C02
	BB2646.C02
	BB2067.C02
After these files are changed, the file (BUBBNET)MUX04.I00 should be
deleted.  In these cases, it is not necessary to reassemble the slot
since the contents of (BUBBNET)MUX04.I00 is identical to (SOURCE)MUX04.I00.
The problem is only that sources should not be kept in BUBBNET directory
when the product is released.  Its not too important, though, but it
might be nice to clean it up and avoid possible future confusion.

By the way, I also searched through all the command files and these are
the only instances of these two references.

Let me know if I can be of any further help.

I got real tired of getting mail returned from people who never read their
new mail.  40 disk pages from OPER:33 to be exact.  So, I made a little
two instruction change to RPG to fix this problem.  Simply, it does a
RUN on (SYS)RDMAIL before doing OUTSTR ["NO MAIL"].  Its very simple, it
won't hurt anything, and it will save me a great deal of grief.  Please,
I beg of you, transmit it as soon as possible, if not sooner.  The source
is in (MPL:62) with backups in RPG.155 and RPGMAI.155.  Thanks -Bill

PS - I know its not the ultimate solution, but I think its an adaquate
migration path until something better comes along.  Please!

                         overlap. An NTN  can be associated  with multiple

                         satisfied  by our  current normal  call charging.
                         Clarification is requested as to why this item is
                         indicated as not  supported in Phase I,  since it
                         seems that it is currently  implemented.  Perhaps

                         default  should be  clarified for  the Supervisor
                         design, and the issue of reject priority  must be
                         clarified.    Also,  this   is   currently  being
                         implemented and it is unclear why the  request is

                         The  assignment  of  NTNs  can  be  done  in  any
                         arbitrary fashion since the are  simply character
                         strings representing MUD entries.   HOWEVER, each
                         NTN  assignment requires  a MUD  entry,  so large

                         The  X.25  interface currently  inserts  a called
                         address for  PVC calls that  do not  specify one.
                         The  CONSAT and  other interfaces  will  have the
                         same  feature  implemented,  in  a  user friendly

                         The ultimate criterion an address is  presence in
                         the MUD.   The interfaces may  check the  form of
                         addresses and  clear the  call if  necessary, but
                         ultimately, if the address is not present  in the
                         MUD, it is de facto an invalid format.   The X.25
                         interface  will  need  some  adjustment  to  it's
                         present  address  checking  to  handle   the  new
                         addressing requirements.

        43  N  N  N  Y  Y

                         The X.25  interfaces perform  end to  end calling

                         interfaces have  the calling  addresses assembled
                         in, providing implicit verification.

        44  N  N  N  Y  Y

                         The  originating  interfaces  always  provide  an
                         origination address if the call request  does not
                         specify one.

Our users no longer need to make the distinction between "mail waiting" and
"[mail waiting]".  The MAIL command can be used to read either.  RPG now
reads TUMS mail if there is no RPG mail.  Thanks to Bill for this interrim
solution - Carl and I hope to eliminate RPG mail someday.   /Joe

Subject: Logon Syntax 

Hello Folks,

I would like to have a meeting with Rich, Weyyi, Bill and myself this
week to review and "finalize" the logon syntax for both SWB and Tymnet.

The objective of the meeting is to work from the current syntax diagram
to provide an accompanying text explanation and to isolate the SWB and
Tymnet specific issues, resulting in two separate syntax diagrams and
text explanations.

I will schedule the meeting for Tuesday, Jan. 20,at 1430 in the front
conference room.  I anticipate the meeting will take up to two hours.

Please respond today (Monday) if you have any schedule conflicts so
that I may re-schedule as soon as possible.  It is imperative that
we resolve these issues, since we must be able to communicate this
information clearly to both the customer and throughout the affected
development units.

Thanks...Omar

To reiterate my memo dated 20 November 1986 (Ontyme #I59848), any
training that requires the use of the video equipment must take
place in Building D and will be scheduled by Joy Sargent (x 7465).
This action is needed to ensure the safe working order of the equip-
ment and to avoid conflicts in scheduling its use.
 
Please be certain to schedule the equipment in advance by contacting
Joy.  She will also be maintaining a log to sign out/sign in train-
ing videos which are currently available.
 
If there are any questions or exceptions, contact me to discuss.

Subject: CDs 

Bill,

After looking through your CD list, I see several artists that I have wanted
to listen to before buying.  I have a fairly comprehensive set of T. D.'s
later works that I'm sure you'll want to try.  My data base is not as
well structured as yours, but is still readable.  It is the first item list
on (OSERANG:39)INSURE.DOC.  At some point I will get a PC and a database
etc. and get the stuff structured properly.  This will be fun.

I want to try ZOOLOOK and the T. Dream and Synergy CDs, also the best of
the Vollenweider.  Let me know which one's you want to try of mine.
Some noted high quality CD presentations, all Pink Floyd, Wynton Marsalis,
Pat Metheny, Digital Domain CD and system tester, Zappa uses some interesting
live recording techniques, Doors is also very good quality master.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: skywalker: backup meeting 



bill,

as i understand it, you and i and bob sorensen are the 'comittee'
to do the first stab at the backup design for skywalker.  when can
we meet? i couldn't find you yesterday.  how about today at
4pm?  we can meet in my office if you want or a conference room.
bob sorensen said he is free.  we can go over the issues.  i am
not totally familiar with what this will entail, but then
who is?  anyway, let me know if 4 is ok.

Have you seen it?  Gallaudet was in the credits, but I don't know for what.
It was a good movie, at any rate, I recommend it.  -Bill

Bill,

  There is no mailer on host D25.  It looks like it never made it, or someone
deliberately removed all current object code files.  There are a total of 29
files in (MAIL), including a set of "<program name>.OLD" files, but (until I
Telecopied in a copy of RDMAIL.SAV) there were NO <program name>.[SAV|HGH|SHR]
files in MAIL.  Since the Job Processor system uses TUMS mail, it is needed on
all the old Tymshare Tymcom-X hosts.  Any questions, please call or TUMS me.
	-Dennis-   (116, X2588)

Subject: New RPG - Mail waiting, etc. 

Well, it's great that we have at least a *hack* that will let us migrate
to the new mail system... however...

Operations uses this thing called SUPCHK which builds circuits and looks
for mail, batch requests and such.  If it sees Mail Waiitng, it tries to
get the mail.  I suspect [Mail waiting] is a match... so it looks for a
message or "no mail"  and apparently ["no mail]" is upsetting it.

I will attempt to look into who (SUPCHK or SUPSLV or SLVSUP) is at fault
for not doing a better job...  anyway... operations doesn't like all the
garbage they are getting.... it's wasteing their paper... sigh!  Also, they
are getting "returned mail" as well.

I would like a switch, a field, or something that tells the mailer that if
the message is not read (or the user has not read his mail, or not logged
in for some period, even if the period is the 30 or 90 days mailer uses)
then the mailer discards the message instead of this return to sender stuff.
As I said, a field - optional - of course.  How much trouble would this
be?  The job processor is never going to read anyone's mail... so why have
it sent back toit, or to OPER...

You were logged in as OPER when you sent that.  Anyway.  I will add the
field as soon as I can get a chance.  Things are rather tight right now.
If I haven't done it in a couple of weeks, remind me.  -Bill

I propose a field
	Class:
with a value of "volatile" to mean the message should be discarded if
unread for 30 days.  It would be very expensive in terms of CPU usage
to allow the expiration time to be variable (in view of the current
data structure).

Class: volatile

There has been a request that RDMAIL output "no mail" without square brackets.
Some programs that run around to many systems to clear mail are not expecting
any characters between the linefeed and "no mail".  Carl is fixing SUPCHK, there
may be others we don't know about.  /Joe

Subject: Found a bug in DSKCLN. 

Just a quick note to let you know what we found:  When a multiply used page is
detected, the retrieval pointer is changed to a 1 to turn it into a hole.  The
routine that does this always punchs a hole in the prime RIB.  If the
multiply used page is detected in a spare RIB, the wrong location in the prime
RIB is punched, the bad retrieval pointer in the spare RIB still exists, and
the page is marked as not being in use in the SAT.  The next file to get a
page allocated on that unit will reuse the page DSKCLN thought it punched,
which guarentees having another multiply used page.  Running another FULL
DSKCLN perpetuates the problem.			/Joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Dennis Jonas has accepted the position of Scientist, Network Systems
and Architecture.  This position is effective 10 February.  While the
position of manager of CSE is vacant, I will be acting CSE manager.
 
During the past several years, Dennis has been responsible for
managing the Continuing Software Engineering section.  In this role,
he has expanded the activities of this section from the singular
responsibility of supporting the Public Network Supervisors to pro-
viding interface support for SNA/SDLC, measurement tools for ISIS, and
integration support for CPU III and MAC III.  Dennis' vast technical
expertise and dedication will be missed in CSE.
 
Please join me in congratulating Dennis on his new career direction.

Re: MAILER not running
Apparently the MAILER jobs were either deleted or stopped on some systems
from the queue.  They are in the process of being put back into the queue
by Dennis Coffey on all systems.

How's the distribution of RDMAIL's nomail fix coming?

New CPY %5 being deployed.  /Supersede is the default if you type it all
on the command line, so is /Default.  Both default to /Nosupersede and
/Nodefault if you simply say CPY<cr> and it prompts you.  /Gateway still
puts the password in the file for now... but the format is now changed.

  old  /Gateway:2866 /Username:destination /Host:39
       built a circuit to 2866, logged in as destination:39 and sent
       the files to useranme destination.

  new  /Gateway:2866;destination /Host:39,36
       builds a circuit to 2866, logs in as destination:39 and sends
       the files to username specified on /Username or GFD'd directory
       then logs in as destination:36 and sends the files to username.

both cases really do GATEWAY 2866;destination:39, but the new format
allows sending to multiple hosts through the gateway.  the ???TEL.COM file
actaully gets a GATEWAY 2866;destination:xx for each host before sending
all the files across.

Because of Telecopy, it's still best to copy to the logged in directory
on the other net, but if access is setup ok, it sort of works to other
directories than the one logged into.  (you know telecopy!)

New switch /LOGINNAME:xxx  overrides the /USERNAME:yyy switch and will
login the child frame to xxx gfd'd to the current connected directory
before running telecopy... somewhat useful if the files being transmitted
are from/to a directory not known to the supervisor and you want to login
to a known name.

Ree: Change to ARGPAR in (SAILIB:62)
It appears not to touch the current datum of an item although it sets the
props to (n) fot the count of arguments (n usually = 1) or to NOVAL if the
switch is specified but no argument is given.  This is still true.

If however you set the datum of a string item to "text", when someone types
PROGRAM ?  they will see /switch:text  instead of /switch:string  as it is
in older version.  This refers to the options set... of course.


Re: DSKCLN
Joe sent you mail, but in case you missed it... we found a long-standing BUG
in DSKCLN.  If it found a problem in a page that was a spare rib such that it
was considered bad (multiply used, could not read rib page, etc) and went to
mark the pointer as a hole, it punched a hole in the same pointer location in
the prime rib instead of the spare rib page.  Sigh!  Large files that get rib
errors are most prone to this disease.  Scarey anyway, it;'s probably been
around since P033/A when we went to paging.  The bad part was that DSKCLN
*NEVER* told anyone that it was punching a hole, ever!  We found it by accident
while trying to locate who was punching hols in files.

PROGRESS REPORT AND QUESTION.
PROGRESS:43 NAMES CAN DE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY, BUT WE NEED NANCY'S HELP-
THEY ARE THE ONES WITH CURRENTLY "ILLEGAL"CHARACTERS THAT WE CANNOT
REACH. THAT LEAVES 73, OF WHICH THERE ARE 58 WITH A COMMA. THAT BRINGS
UP THE QUESTION. YOU DID NOT EXCLUDE THE COMMA, BUT BILL DID INCLUDE
THOSE NAMES ON THE "BAD GUY" LIST OF NAMES. DO WE WANT TO EXCLUDE THE
COMMA??? ONE CUSTOMER USES IT EXTENSIVELY (PROBABLY 50+ BELONG TO HIM).
IF COMMA IS OK, THAT ONLY LEAVES 15 NAMES BELONGING TO ~ 10 CUSTOMERS.
WE (VIDA AND I ) AWAIT AN ANSWER BEFORE WE PROCEED TO GO TO THEM.

On comma, I suggest we restrict it to prevent further names from being
validated having a comma, but let the existing names remain.  Are there
any objections to this?  It might make the parsing more difficult since
comma is used in the destination field.  What do you think, Weyyi? Omar?

The new RDMAIL is now on all systems.  I've checked them all by hand and
found a number of them screwed up - just goes to show that if you want it
done right, do it yourself.  Anyway, all systems now have the current
version of everything.

About MAILER being deleted from the queue.  Is there any condition that
would cause it to be deleted automatically?  If so, there clearly needs
to be a way to override that.

Subject: Bug in TELECO/AUXMOX - dies after TALK ALL. 

At 20 minutes before 10pm, AUXMOX stopped working on system 55.  It died
again, 10 minutes before 10pm.  I was watching with SYSTAT CONT:30.  It
was receiving 5 pages per 30 seconds up until the message "System going
down in 10 minutes" showed up on my screen.  Then it hung for about 5
minutes, not receiving any data.  About that time TELECO on 930 gave up
waiting and aborted.  AUXMOX should have requested that TELECO re-transmit
the last packet.  Bug.

Bill,

I say we get the commas out of the usernames now.  This will prevent
any possible future conflicts and will make the login parsing more
straightforward.  The user that uses all of the commas can use one of
the non-illegal characters as a substitute.

As Omar suggests (below), eliminating the comma laced user names now will
simplify things and prevent a possible ``crisis'' campaign to eliminate them
at some future time.  Let's see if we can get the customer to cooperate.

Subject:  McDonnell Douglas system analysis/design materials.

1)  I currently have an evaluation copy of ProKit*ANALYST.  This is a
    system analysis tool that consists of a graphic Data Flow Diagram
    editor linked to a Data Dictionary built on a relational database.

    I have run this package to evaluate it and have found it to be a well
    designed and useful system designer's sketch-pad.  It is possible to
    quickly put together a description of a current or proposed system
    which can be easily understood and discussed.  

    ProKit*ANALYST is a product of McDonnell Douglas ISG, Improved
    System Technologies Dept.  It requires an IBM PC with a graphics
    adapter (color is helpful).  A hard disk is essential (the program
    takes 3.5mBytes), a math chip is necessary for good performance
    but not for evaluation, and a mouse is nice, but unnecessary.

    The current terms under which I have the evaluation system
    require that I have it in the mail by Feb. 6,
    although it is likely that an extension would be granted if other
    units are interested in evaluating it.  The list price of PKA
    is approx. %2500.  It is being offered in-house at $200.

    Please contact me (Jonathan Doskow) at 446-6325, since I rarely
    log in to ONTYME.

2)  Improved System Technologies offers public seminars in topics
    related to system analysis and design.  One is scheduled for
    San Francisco Feb. 9-13 titled "Structured System Analysis and
    Design".  Topics covered include structured analysis and design,
    top-down development, and structured walkthroughs.  This seminar
    is being offered an in-house rate of $648/person. (I don't
    know the list price.)  

    A seminar entitled "Derived Design (tm) Strategic Activities" is
    being offered in S. F. April 21-24.  It is described as
    follows:  "... sets forth the context of strategic design, describing
    the tools and techniques useful for strategic design, and provides
    design sessions so participants can develop and improve design skills."

    A seminar entitled "Advanced Structured Analysis and Design" is
    offered in S. F. on June 8-12.  It's description: "... concentrates

    on the bridge that connects one structured technique to another.  It
    introduces static and dynamic models of data, describing how these models
    are derived from the data flow diagram."

    For information on any of these seminars call (800) 325-1087.

I'm interested in the ROM, too, but I'd like to look at what you have first

Subject: Intra-LATA Legality 

Hello Folks,

After some cursory research and investigation into the matter of
intra-LATA legality, Steven Bell of Squire, Sanders and Dempsey,
a law firm under retainer by Tymnet, has written up a letter
stating the legal position on the matter.

The issue of intra-LATA legality involves a circuit with endpoints
confined within a LATA, but with passthrough nodes that reside outside
the LATA.  As stated by Mr. Bell, there has been no clear guidance
on the issue, and at this point Tymnet has taken a stance of allowing
the afore-mentioned scenario to occur, legally.  However, there may
be a time in which Tymnet would take a different standpoint, if
the line between passthrough and processing is crossed.

The scenario presented above indicates the the packet data is actually
confined on an endpoint basis to within a LATA, but may PASS THROUGH a
piece of hardware that is not within the LATA, as part of the route from
origin to destination.  Now if the data was further processed on the
hardware outside of the LATA, like some value added service was provided
by the extra-LATA hardware, Tymnet's standpoint on the issue could be
completely reversed.

In summary, the indication is that a message which originates and terminates
within the same LATA is an intra-LATA communication, even if it briefly and
incidentally transits another LATA.  The issue of transport and interpration
of this data outside the LATA must be watched carefully.

A copy of Mr. Bell's letter is being sent in the mail.

THIS COMMUNICATION IS OF AN EXTREMELY SENSITIVE NATURE AND IS
NOT TO BE GENERALLY DISTRIBUTED.

Thanks...Omar

All the work for SWB is under PIR #2214.  We also have a PIR (#1553)
to implement Host names.  As fo the comma, it will be part of the

I was able to figure out most of it but now I am stuck.  There is a
procedure 'exists' which seems to return true if the file exists.

Here are a couple of examples of how it is used:

	until exists(source&"["&cvusername(sourceppn)&"]");

do delay!bar _ 0 until not exists(list!semaphore);


These are from (swedel)gr.sai if you want to see more.

the disk manager cannot lock his own lock, right?  won't he have
to for diskclean to run?

we can have a second kind of lock, call it a deadbolt.  it has
2 bits: 1 in the locks address space, and 1 in the global
memory.  if you want the lock, you call a single routine
which gets both.  if you can't get the second one, you
release the first one and try again.  so in the case of the
disk, if we anticipate the disk manager needing to lock
that lock, we need a deadbolt for that process.  of course,
you never try to get the local lock unless you have the global one
first.  they must be done in order or you get a kind of 'deadlock'
(pun). the global lock bit is analogous functionally to
locking the bus.  each place we need a deadbolt for a different
kind of process we need a different bit in the global 
memory.

"Pentagon Planning to Restrict Access to Public Data Bases"

     The above article by Judith Axler Turner appears in the January 21, 1987 
issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education.   In this article Ms Turner 
indicates that the administration has established a new office in the National 
Security Agency (NSA) which will be responsible for the security of ALL 
COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT MAY CONTAIN SENSITIVE INFORMATION-WHETHER OR NOT 
COLLECTED AND STORED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, WHETHER OR NOT CLASSIFIED OR 
DIRECTLY RELATED TO NATIONAL SECURITY.  This would include such commercial data
bases as Dialog, Nexis, Lexis, etc and perhaps even Bionet.   Ms Turner quotes 
Stephen B. Gould, director of the project on access to scientific and technical
information for the AAAS as noting this will be "likely to create red tape for 
American scientists and engineers" and that this would "deter even those with 
legitimate reasons to use information from seeking access to it." Ms Turner 
quotes Diane Fountaine, director of information systems in the office of 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for communications, command, control, and 
intelligence "The question of the 1980s is not, 'will there be restrictions or 
controls on the use of commercially available on-line data bases?', the 
question is, 'How will such restrictions or controls be applied'".  Ms Turner 
further notes that the White House has defined a new category of "sensitive but
unclassified information" that could affect national security or other federal 
government interests if it were revealed, lost, misused, altered, or destroyed 
(personal comment L. Yarbrough: that should cover about anything!!). Robert L. 
Park, executive director of the American Physical Society, has called this new 
directive "a loaded weapon".  He notes "Agencies that want to use it will use 
it for anything they want to bottle up", including research reports.  Park also
indicates that "if any fraction of the money to produce the information comes 
from the government, the agency can label the

report 'sensitive' and control it."

   Ms Turner indicates NSA's announcement has provoked anger on Capitol Hill 
and led to proposed legislation to put control of electronic data-base security
in the hands of the National Bureau of Standards.  The House Govern Operations 
Committee will hold hearings on this legislation very shortly.

   I urge you to get a copy of this article and read it for yourself.  If you 
find the idea of such control of information by the government repugnant and 
scary, as I do, I urge you to express your concerns to members of Congress.

Lyn Yarbrough

PS: for some very interesting reading try "The Puzzle Palace" by James Bamford 
which describes the origins and functions of the National Security Agency.

Bill,

I looked over the logon syntax, and it looks great.  In the transit field
why is there optional host#, host#, yet not optional hostname, hostname
or -RPOA, -RPOA, -RPOA?  Currently we are only supporting single -RPOA
entries, yet the syntax should provide for multiple -RPOAs as well as
multiple hostnames, seperated by commas.

I will get the examples generation program going right away, it shouldn't
take too long.

bill,


as you are aware, we have lost the use of the laser printer link from
the Eunix UNIX system.  this link is also the link that Tums
goes across, between the 10's and the Eunix system.  so,
the problem is this: that we only have 1 link.  not wise if it
includes mail systems.

this is the same problem that we have with the large printer
up front - it only has 1 neighbor.  we sometimes lose the
link, so we lose the use of the printer.

this is the same problem we had in the CMTI unit, when testing
with the Fremont host - we only had 1 line to their front end.

this sounds like a pattern to me.  not good for a networking company.

there ought to be a law of networking that says you can't bring up
a network if there is not at least 2 paths to every resource (joke).
"this is 1987..." we ought to have things more fully connected.

maybe you know all this and bubbnet people know all this...
but at the very least when we make The Move it ought to
be a REQUIREMENT that every resource be doubly connected, at a minimum.
this should be high on the priorities for the The Move.

A message from Jerry Causley to all ISG employees. . .

    When I reported to you on ISG's third-quarter 1986 results,
I said that if all of us could give the remaining months of 1986
our best shot we would "prove to the world that ISG is back on
track."  It is clear now that you did indeed give ISG your best
shot.  Thanks in large part to an excellent fourth quarter, we
finished 1986 with a solid profit at the performance earnings
level -- that is, before the write-off of acquisition costs --
and we achieved revenue growth in line with the industry
average.

    In the fourth quarter, we achieved performance earnings of
$29.2 million, as compared with a $2.6 million profit in the
same quarter of 1985.  This quarterly performance -- our best
ever -- capped off a year of steady, quarter-by-quarter earnings
improvement and brought us to a yearend profit of $2.5 million
at the performance earnings level, compared to a 1985 loss of
$42.0 million.

    As you know, performance earnings are the basis upon which
MDC measures our performance.  Our bottom-line results in 1986
will include $67.9 million to cover the cost of acquisition
write-offs, compared with $66.3 million in 1985.  Even so, we
produced an improvement of $44.5 million, and that is something
of which we can be very, very proud.

    As I noted above, we produced this improvement while
maintaining a competitive rate of revenue growth within an
industry that is still suffering a serious recession.   Our
fourth-quarter revenue of $326.8 million brought our 1986
revenue to $1.2 billion.  When we adjust this figure to account
for the divestiture of Dynatax Systems, our revenue grew 8.0
percent over 1985.  We expect that to be consistent with the
average growth of the industry as a whole.  (Both the revenue
and earnings figures I have given here are as we report them to
MDC; they do not reflect certain consolidating adjustments MDC
makes for public segment reporting.)

    Yes, your efforts did pay off in 1986.  What is more, your
good work over the past few months has given us a strong start
on 1987.  From this point on, it is crucial that we continue to
build the momentum we generated in 1986.  We must do that to
make good on our commitment to an ambitious 1987 operating plan,
not to mention the further commitments we will all be making as
part of the Significant Business Issue process.

    I will be sharing more of my thoughts with you in an
upcoming issue of the ISG Spectrum newspaper.  For now, please
accept my congratulations and thanks for a job well-done, and my
best wishes as you go forward to meet the challenges of 1987.

shared memory





we need to decide how to do shared memory for the node code



we could use the IPCF mechanism to pass the pointers; the node codes

would need access to the mechanism, and they do the rest





IPCF mechanism has 1 thing we need to consider: when we send a

pointer to some memory to another processor, we need to update

the destination processors MMU tables or he cannot

access that

memory! so we also need to know the length of the area.

and, we should consider how we can take this out of the MMU

tables of the processor, when he was done with the area - 

i.e. provide a trap of some kind, so the holder of the memory

can say, free it up - remove it from muy MMU tables.

what do you think?

Never heard of her.  I haven't seen any ads either.  I would tell your friend
to make sure she has licensed physician backup on call at all times.  Most of
the midwives that are C.N.M.s do have physician backup.  Most of the lay
midwives are "underground", which makes it much harder for them to work with
establishment physicians. 

I personally wouldn't go to any midwife that didn't have physician backup.

Another thing for her to consider is that if she contracts with a midwife for
delivery, she will usually have to pay both the midwife, the hospital and
the physicians if things end up in the hospital.  She should check with her
insurance company to see if they are willing to pay for all of that.

I think she should try calling some of the C.N.M.s that advertise in the
area for references on Veronica.  Some names are Robin Liang, Kate Bowland.

The FCC is considering reregulating the packet-switching networks like Telenet,
Tymnet, Compuserve, The Source and PC Pursuit.	This could result in additional
costs to the user.  This is excerpted from Infomat magazine which is available
for downloading.


 ====================================
 COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE NEWS -- PART 1
 ====================================

 by Tim Elmer

 ------------------------------------
 FREE LOCAL ACCESS TO PACKET
 SWITCHING NETWORKS MAY BE ELIMINATED
 ------------------------------------

 (BPS) -- The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will vote on a proposal
to reregulate packet switching networks that, if approved, would eliminate
free local telephone access to those networks.

 "If this occurs, it might eventually double or triple the costs to those
using packet switching networks to access commercial on-line databases and
information services and triple or quadruple the costs to those using
Telenet's PC Pursuit," said Philip M. Walker, vice president and regulatory
counsel for Telenet Communications Corp.

 Predictably, the initiative to reregulate packet switching networks comes
primarily from the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) and secondarily from AT&T.
These companies provide local telephone service to vast majority of telephone
customers throughout the U.S. and will benefit the most from FCC reregulation
of the packet switching networks.

 Under current FCC rules formulated in 1980 in the FCC's Second Computer
Inquiry, called Computer II, a distinction is made between "basic services"
and "enhanced services."

 "Basic services" are those that don't offer protocol conversion such as local
and long-distance voice telephone services.  "Enhanced services" are defined
in an open-ended fashion as computer-based services that are more than a
"basic service," in other words, services such as packet switching networks,
database and on-line type services, and remote computing services that offer
protocol conversion, according to Walker.

 Under the 1980 Computer II Inquiry, the FCC ruled that "basic services" would
continue to be regulated as they had always been.  However, the FCC also ruled
that "enhanced services" would be deregulated, which opened up the industry to
competition.  This resulted in numerous companies entering the packet
switching business, including BOCs, AT&T and at least a dozen others.  The
competition resulted in significant price reductions for packet switching
services.

 To prevent monopolization of the packet switching industry by the Big Boys
(the BOCs and AT&T), the FCC ruled that they had to keep separate accounting
figures for their "basic services" and for their "enhanced services," and that
they could not use revenues from their lucrative "basic services" to cross-
subsidize their "enhanced service" packet switching networks.

 The FCC also ruled that if the BOCs and AT&T used their "basic service"
telephone lines for packet switching services, then they must let their
competitors have access to those lines on the same basis, which would preserve
true competition in the industry.

 "Now, under the FCC's Computer Inquiry III, the FCC is asking, should we
redefine protocol conversion services as 'basic services' rather than enhanced
services?  Should we redefine all those companies as common carriers?  This
would, in effect, subject them not only to federal regulations but, even
worse, to state regulations," Walker said.

 The result would eliminate comparable interconnection requirements currently
imposed on BOCs and AT&T, allowing them to charge their packet switching
competitors local dial-in fees to access packet switching long-distance line
networks.

 It would also allow BOCs and AT&T to offer their own packet switching
services on a non-compensatory basis and, finally, allow them to cross-
subsidize those services with revenues from their much more lucrative voice
telephone service revenues.  In short, it would allow BOCs and AT&T to
monopolize the packet switching industry and probably drive out most
competitors.

 "In terms of cost impact," Walker said, "if we had to pay local access
charges, it would cost us about $3.60 an hour at the originating end, for
calls made by users to on-line databases and information services like
CompuServe and The Source.

 "And with PC Pursuit, for which we have out-dial modems, we would have to pay
not only 3.60 per hour access fees at the originating end but also $4.80 at
the terminating end, a total of about $8 or $9.  Obviously, to survive, we
would have to add those additional charges to our current fees and pass them
on to our consumers," Walker said.

 That would almost certainly spell the end of PC Pursuit, and it would likely
put out of business not only many independent packet switching networks but
also many on-line databases and information services.

 FCC approval of changes being considered in Computer III, Walker said, "would
really have a major impact on anyone using a packet switching service to
access online bulletin boards, databases, or information services aimed at the
residential user.  They are just going to get creamed if this happens."

 Walker said that is was not clear exactly when the FCC would vote on the
proposal, but that it would probably be the latter part of January or early
part of February, 1987.  "They are moving very fast on this," he said.

 "Low-Cost packet switching Service Threatened"

 by Alan R. Bechtold

 As described in our lead news story this issue, the FCC is now considering a
major change in the way packet switched phone services are defined.  This
change is likely to lead to the demise of many of these services, and to much
higher prices for the use of the few that will eventually remain in business.

 At the risk of over-simplification, I think I should first describe just what
a packet switched networking service is.  These are the services you use to
access online databases and commercial online services, such as CompuServe and
The Source, with just a local telephone call.  Once you call the local Telenet
or Tymnet number, for example, and a connection is made, you are then
connected with a computer that puts you in communication with the online
services with which you wish to communicate.

 This computer is handling a number of calls into the main system computer at
the same time.	It takes information you send and delivers it in "packets" to
the proper destination, picks up information from the online service computer
you called, and sends it, also in "packets," back to you.  All of this
communicating is done in these so-called "packets" because this allows the
network's computers to offer protocol conversion and handle several ongoing
communications sessions at the same time.

 FCC regulations allow AT&T and Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to engage in
packet switching network operations, but they must also maintain completely
separate accounting of their voice and packet switching operations.  They must
also offer free local-calling access to their lines to any competitors engaged
in the packet switching service industry.

 The above regulations have allowed Telenet and Tymnet, among others, to
operate at a reasonable cost in a competitive atmosphere.  This is a case of
regulation of a business actually RESULTING in increased competition and lower
prices to consumers.

 As things stand now, you can call any local Telenet or Tymnet access number
and use these services to inexpensively access such online services as
CompuServe, The Source, Delphi, and countless others.  In addition, GTE's new
PC PURSUIT service now offers you access, through their Telenet packet
switching service, to literally hundreds of local bulletin boards in cities
all across the country--for a flat charge of $25 per month.

 But, the FCC is now being asked to REREGULATE this segment of the
communications industry, eliminating the FCC requirements that AT&T and BOCs
keep separate accounting records of their voice and packet switching services,
and eliminating the stipulation that the BOCs and AT&T must offer their
competitors in the packet switching business free access to their local
telephone connection lines.

 The idea is patently ridiculous.

 Mark Fowler, Chairman of the FCC, has been hailed by the press as a "fair-
market zealot."  The chances are very good that he views this proposed
reregulation as the magic road to increased competition and fairer pricing for
consumers.

 Unofficially, the word is out that the FCC advisory committee now considering
this matter is indeed leaning in favor of the proposed reregulation of the
packet switching industry.  If the committee recommends these changes, it's
likely that a majority of the five voting members on the Federal
Communications Commission will vote in favor of the changes.

 I have talked to sources within the industry who say it is the BOCs who are
pushing VERY HARD for this reregulation, because they want to get into the
packet switching service business in a big way, and they would like to rid
themselves of needless competition on their way to success.

 What's that?  RID themselves of competition?  But--the proposed reregulation
is supposed to FOSTER competition!  Why would a group of companies (BOCs)
hoping to eliminate their competition PUSH for this reregulation?  I hope the
answer to THAT question is entirely clear.

 Here we have an industry that is currently populated with plenty of
competition.  Prices are already reasonable.  Reregulation of the packet
switching service industry will IMMEDIATELY give giant corporations the upper
hand, and will allow them to cut off free access to their local access phone
lines to their competitors, namely Telenet and Tymnet and other similar
services that now offer you high-quality service, in a competitive
marketplace, at reasonable prices.

 The proposed reregulation, however, would force all packet switching services
to compete with the BOCs and AT&T, companies that would be able to use the
enormous profits they earn with their voice telephone services to cross-
subsidize their packet switching services and offer them on a non-compensatory
basis, at least until their competitors are eliminated.  When that happens,
they are then sure to jack up their fees to any level they want.

 It would also force their packet switching competitors to pay access fees for
connection to local phone lines.  The access fees alone could add as much as
$4.00 per hour to the fees packet switching companies would be forced to pass
on to their customers.	This will be added to your hourly connect-time charges
for accessing ALL online databases through these services.

 The proposed reregulation could very well spell the death of PC PURSUIT.
Because GTE also uses dial-out modems at the other end of their Telenet
connections for PC PURSUIT service, the company would be forced to pay an
hourly charge at BOTH ends of the phone line--totaling up to $8 or $9 per
hour.  These fees would have to be added to the flat $25 per month that GTE
now charges for access to PC-PURSUIT.  It would simply make the final cost to
PC-PURSUIT customers too high for the service to remain practical and
affordable.

 So--this is ONE TIME you MUST use your word processor to produce some letters
opposing this proposed reregulation!  Write to:

 Honorable Mark Fowler
 Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
 Washington D.C. 20554

 Refer to Computer Inquiry III in your letters.  State clearly, in your own
words, that competitive packet switching services should not be reregulated or
subjected to carrier access charges, and then explain why not.	Tell Mr.
Fowler that reregulation of packet switching services will completely destroy
the existing fair market for these services, and eventually increase costs,
not DECREASE them.

 And hurry!  I have heard this matter will be going before the FCC for a vote
in the latter part of January or early part of February.  Time is running out.

If you are reading this message on a computer system (and you probably
are), then the following article is directly and immediately relevant
to you.  Although this happened sometime last fall, I had not seen or
heard anything about it until this article.

The article is from "Information Today", a newspaper for users and
producers of electronic information services.  I find it to be one of
the most frightening things I have read since Nixon's Senate Bill 1
back in the 70's.

I strongly urge all of you to write to your senators, congressmen, and
whomever else you think might be appropriate.  I believe that the subject
covered here strikes at the absolute essence of our freedoms.


-------------- From "Information Today", January, 1987 ---------------

Headline: IIA Opposes Restrictions on Unclassified Databases.

The Board of Directors of the Information Industry Association (IIA)
has issued a statement opposing efforts by the Department of Defense
and the National Security Council to restrict public access to
unclassified information and to establish a monitoring system for
watching citizens who use commercial electronic databases.

At the IIA's annual meeting in November 1986, a senior Department of
Defense official said that the Department is reviewing recommendations
regarding  restrictions on access to such databases that contain
"sensitive but unclassified" information.  In a letter to Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger, the Association has called for withdrawal of
the new security classification for "sensitive but unclassified
information" and asked the Defense Secretary to make public the
concerns that prompted the new classification.

According to an IIA press release in December, the Department of
Commerce recently attempted to obtain from private information
companies the names and addresses of all citizens who use an
unclassified database.  The release also stated the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has "secretly established a
'no-no' list containing the names of private companies - both American
companies and U.S. allies -  who are to be denied subscriptions to
unclassified NASA information merely because they have foreign
customers."

NASA's "no-no" list of organizations not provided with subscriptions to
NASA Tech Briefs, technical support packages, or other documentation is
said to include British Aerospace, Find/SVP, Info/Doc, Information on
Demand, United Book Services, University Microfilms International, and
Washington Bibliographic Service, among others.

In addition, the IIA reported that representatives from the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
have been visiting private U.S. information companies to ask questions
about who is using their unclassified information.

IIA Board Chairman Carl Valenti, vice president for information
services at Dow Jones & Company, stated: "These actions appear to be in
response to concerns that the Soviet Bloc is getting information they
shouldn't have.  But we can't be sure.  The defense community has
refused to discuss the reasons for its concerns or provide the public
with specific examples.

"All we have been told," Valenti continued, "is that this issue is
discussed in a secret Air Force report.  Our industry strongly supports
efforts to protect national security.  But these government actions are
not directed at controlling classified national security information.
Instead, they are directed at controlling unclassified information that
has always been available - information you can get by going to any
public library.  It also appears to some of our members that the
government is attempting to achieve its objectives through intimidation
and coercion, apparently hoping that private information companies will
voluntarily restrict access to their information or police who uses
it."

The IIA represents 460 leading information companies and claims, on
their behalf, that restricting the right to create and distribute
unclassified information will severely hinder their ability to do
business and will contribute to "the further decline of the U.S.
balance of trade."  The IIA maintains that any attempt to deny citizens
the right to acquire information will have "a chilling effect upon
those who use information and will retard U.S. technological growth."

Paul Zurkowski, IIA president, noted: "The strength of America's
democracy is its systems of checks and balances.  Through that system
we have spent more than 200 years establishing a balance between the
preservation of individual liberties and protection of national
security."

"There is now a grave danger." Zurkowski asserted, " that certain
elements within the defense community may upset this balance by
carving away the First Amendment in the dark of night.  If these
activities go unchecked, we may have to show our passports at the
library door.  I echo the statement of Secretary of State George
Schultz, who stated earlier this year that 'the information revolution
promises to change the routine of our planet as decisively as did the
industrial revolution of the last century.  Our policies must always be
based on the fundamental process of freedom - freedom of thought,
freedom of research, and the free flow of ideas.'"

The official IIA position paper sent to Secretary of Defense Weinberger
stated in part: "United States policy should continue to foster openness
and the unimpeded flow of information.  Restrictions on the right of
citizens to create, acquire, use, and disseminate information should be
the absolute minimum necessary to protect national security.

"National security is best protected by using the long existing
classification system to ensure that government information vital to
national security is not released to the public.  The concept of
'sensitive but unclassified' information provides an unchecked hunting
license for government officials to deny citizens access to information
and must be rejected.

"The security classification system should not be used to unnecessarily
restrict public access to government information; the decision to
classify information should weigh national security interests against
the right of the public to acquire information.

"Classification of information for national security purposes should
not be based on the media in which the information is available.
Information which is unclassified and available to the general public,
such as in print through a library, must not be restricted or
classified when it enters an electronic database."

--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an earlier article in misc.legal that mentions that there
is a hearing coming *soon* on this subject.

If you are a citizen of the United States and you think that the
Bill of Rights is something more than a piece of scrap paper on
display in Washington, D.C., I urge you to contact your senators
and congressmen and say "ENOUGH!".

THE ETHICS OF COMPUTER CONFERENCING

                               By John R. Cook

                                   ABSTRACT

The objectives of the present study were twofold. First, an attempt was made to
assess the extent to which some traditional moral principles governing 
face-to-face communication have gained acceptance by the users of computer 
conferences. This was done by assessing the prevailing community standards for 
computer conferencing on Compuserve's CB and on BITNET's Relay. The assessment 
was carried out using email and other message facilities on both of these 
networks to distribute a 24-item questionnaire entitled Questionnaire for Users
of "CB's" and Other Computer "Chats". The second objective of the study was to 
explore some approaches that might be taken towards distributing questionnaires
and collecting data over computer networks.

The 25 CB and 112 Relay users participating in the study tended to be male, 
undergraduate students in their mid-twenties and their average level of 
education was that of a college sophomore. Six of the CB users also turned out 
to be Relay users. In terms of their use of electronic journal and mail 
services, the largest portion of Relay users (21%) were Psychnet subscribers, 
followed by NetNorth (17%) and COMSERVE (16%).

CB users were found to be much more reluctant to participate in the study than 
Relay users, as evidenced by their lower response rate.  Also, Relay users were
found to be more accepting of a proposed rule requiring users to register their
true names and identities before signing onto the system.  Otherwise, there was
a high degree of similarity in the responses of CB and Relay users on this 
survey.

The moral or ethical standards for computer conferencing revealed by the survey
were found to be largely consistent with the moral principles governing 
face-to-face communication. One difference between computer-mediated and 
face-to-face communication was suggested by the conference users' greater 
acceptance of practices such as adopting nicknames that are considered sexually
provocative or sharing details of one's intimate personal relationships on a 
public channel.

However, when CB and Relay users were asked to evaluate the potential benefits 
of computer conferencing, they appeared to discount the importance of some of 
these practices, in a way that brought them back in line with traditional moral
principles governing face-to-face communication.

In conclusion, it seems we do tend to attach importance to the same sorts of 
activities both on- and off-line.  In this respect, several  traditional  moral
 principles  governing  face-to-face communication have been found to be 
accepted by the users of computer conferences. One area where discrepancies 
between our on-and off-line ethical standards do tend to occur, is in the 
larger range of behaviors we are willing to consider as morally acceptable in 
other conference users.

This is an abstract of the full paper, which is still in preparation. For a 
copy of the full paper you may send your electronic mail address to John R. 
Cook, UD118169@NDSUVM1.Bitnet, and a copy paper will be sent to you when 
available.

Subject: Logon Syntax 

Hello Folks,

Regarding the SWB logon syntax;  I hope that the syntax explanation will
hold them off for a couple of days to allow us to finalize the diagram.

As far as I know, the syntax is good as it stands, we must simply finalize
loop counts and include a loop for the transit field to allow multiple
entries.  A "Note 3" will indicate that the loop count for the overall
transit field loop is currently only 1, which will also be indicated in
the loop count fields.  I will attempt to come up with meaningful loop counts,
or at least character counts, for each field.

Thanks...Omar

Bill,

I will research the loop counts for the logon syntax.

The IGNORES description has a bug.

We need a description for NODE-NUMBER.

We should indicate a loop to allow multiple Transit Field entries
of the form =RPOA=RPOA=HOSTNAME=HOSTNUMBER.  The loop count will
indicate only one entry is allowed for now.  A NOTE 3 indicating this
fact may be helpful.

I don't think there are any more problems with it that I can see, although
I am canvasing the Sup unit for input.  I will come up with the loop counts
by Tuesday afternoon.  Please let me know when we can discuss the final
diagram before you go to print, to insure agreement.

As always, any time frame that is suitable to you;  I am flexible.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: SASI-VME host adaprot limitations 


For your information

The current CMF SASI-VME host adaptor does not appear to be able to generate
more than a 24 bit VMEbus address.  I do not know if there are any SCSI or
SASI host adaptors capable of generating a 32 bit VMEbus address.
This limitation may affect the way board VMEbus base addresses are assigned
or the design of the algorithm used to load system software from the
local system disk into the memory of the various processor boards.

Wayne,
  Tuesday 2/24 should be alright for me, although I may have a little bit
of trouble getting there by 11:30.  We have our regularly scheduled monitor
group meeting on tuesdays at 10:00, so to allow for traffic and such, I'd
most probably arrive between 11:30 and 12:00 noon.  Any problems with this,
and we should probably make it a little later...

Bill,

I have given my comments on the logon syntax to Omar.  I also talked to
Allyn to check with Su to see if the conference call with Jerry was
necessary.  Hopefully, the explanation from Omar was satisfactory.  
Apparently, as of noon today, the explanation was not sent.  Are we sure

RE:  Comments on Recommended New Cost Tables by Farhangian

CC:  Omar Serang, Bill Soley

=========================================================================

I have reviewed the recommended changes to the supervisor cost tables
by Keyvan Farhangian dated 5FEB87.  My only comment is that if the cost
tables are changes to "allow some batch traffic to travel through high
or medium bandwidth terrestrial links even if alternative satellite
links are available", then I am concerned about building such circuits
during non-prime hours and then impacting interactive circuits being
built later during prime time.  Unless we have a means of dynamically
diverting traffic depending on load, I feel that a closer examination on
this subject may be needed.Received: from X32.Tymnet by B39.Tymnet; Tue, 10 Feb 87 18:13:01 PST

Subject: "Bill, Operations in bldg C are"... 

Bill,
  Operations in bldg C are rather upset that they keep getting messages for
users that have not logged in for 30 days, to read their mail sent from the
XEXEC job processor.

  I created (OPER:*)MAIL.FWD which contains "!OPER/OPER.MSG" and later went
around to see which systems accumulated similar mail.  System 70 had a 135
page OPER.MSG file, 95 had a 22 page OPER.MSG file and 930 had a 51 page
OPER.MSG file.  The others appear unchanged from the initial telecopy to
each system (although I didn't verify that they didn't just get one or two
messages).

  Until I remove this MAIL.FWD file, no NEW MAIL will be seen by operations
in any building unless they care to wade through the mail ffrom postmaster.
Why is this mail still being returned?  (Only on some systems?)

  The messages on system 70, appear to be for the same two users again and
again, repeating they cycle of days, more than once from their daily jobs
which ran until they hit an error and stopped running.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  I'm thinking of changing the default for the MAIL option to NONE and the
user will have to specify MAIL:ALWAYS or MAIL:ERROR etc if he wants mail.
This is the OPPOSITE of what PERP did, but unless MAILER and friends can be
made more reliable, there isn't much I can do.

Please see (OPER:70)OPER.MSG for an example of the mail.
Ignore the ones from X32, as they were caused by MAILER reading the messages
in the MAIL directory which I restored to X32 from C70 when I was building
X32's 2-pack test system from C70 all-files tapes.

The reason this irritates operatios so much is not that they get the mail,
but MAILER prints "
[you have a message from Postmaster@C70.Tymnet]
"  again and again on their logged in terminals, and when they said "MAIL"
they got an error trying to read it... I suspect a bogus copy of one of the
mail programs, or a protection mis-match.

Re: MAIL problem... no idea what msg.
Now that I've routed their mail into a data file, typing MAIL just returns
"no mail". Sigh.

As per returned mail... they're getting a truckload on one system and none
on the others... that's what I was complaining about, not that they're
getting returned mail.  It just seems inconsistant, as though something is
broken.
  And as per getting returned mail, because MAILER thinks that the user
has not logged in (actually logged out) in 30 days seems to be in error
for most of the messages we've gotton on 930 et al, so I suspect a bug!From: William R. Soley <WRS@B39.Tymnet>

If MAILER is not, or was not running on the exact day that a mail file
became 30 days old (based on the creation date, not the latest message)
then the mail will not be returned.  The decision to return is based
on an exact match to cope with the problem of the system being brought
up with bogus dates far in the future and all the mail being returned.
A side effect is that if MAILER does not run at least once per day, it
may not notice that a particular person is not reading their mail.  Once
a person's mail becomes 31 days old, there will never be an oppertunity
to return it again.

Also, its not when a person last logged out that matters, just the fact
that there exists at least one unread message which is 30 days old.
The last logout date is provided only for the edification of the sender
as a clue to weather the recipient has fallen into a black hole (and thus
never logged in) or is just being rude or stupid and not reading their
mail.

An international conference on Electronic Publishing, Document Manipulation and
Typography will be held at Nice, France, on April 20--22, 1988.  The Conference
is being organized by INRIA, France, in association with a number of sponsors. 
This conference may be considered as a successor to the EP86 conference 
organized at the University of Nottingham, England, on April 1986, by the 
British Computer Society.

The conference will cover all aspects of computer document preparation, text 
processing, and printing.  It will include topics such as document design, 
authoring systems, electronic publishing, digital typography, and it will 
definitely be oriented to new ideas and techniques on such matters.  Papers, 
which should present original research work or give a comprehensive survey of a
particular area, are invited on any new topic related to document processing, 
including the following (but not limited to the following):

   - Document structures (analysis and recognition)

   - Document editors or formatters, integration of text,

      graphics, and images

   - Markup languages and translation from one to another

      one

   - Computer-based and dynamic documents

   - Page description languages

   - Interfaces with other software

   - Expert systems for editing

   - Specific documents (mathematics, chemistry, humanities,

      music, exotic languages, ...)

   - Electronic publishing---applications and techniques

   - Linguistic approaches and semantic structures of text

The chairman of the conference is Jacques Andre (IRISA/INRIA) and the 
vice-chairman is Brian Kernighan (Bell Laboratories).  The program committee 
also includes Patrick Baudelaire (TANGRAM), Richard Beach (XEROX PARC), Charles
Bigelow (Stanford University), David Brailsford (University of Nottingham), 
Heather Brown (University of Kent), Giovanni CORAY (EPFL), R. W. Davy

Subject: Recommendation for new cost tables 

It looks like everyone has some questions about the recommendations -
a request was submitted for them to update the cost tables because we
had instances of circuits coming from Japan (batch) which were routed
over 3 satellite hops - instead of a 56kb terrestial line.  Obviously
Bill has spotted yet another undesirable by-product of the table, and
I'm afraid there are more if we check out the table carefully.

Le'ts get together with Farhagian so we can give him our input - what's
a good time for everyone next week?  Wed (2pm?) here on Bubb Road?

Thanks -

Subject: host names 

les and i have come up with a suggestion for host naming standards
when we get all our new systems:

1) servers should be named with a theme.  we suggest star trek
characters (kirk, spock, mccoy, scotty, etc.)  this is in keeping
with the theme of naming products after star wars people, but different
enough not to be confusing.

2) workstations can be named by their owners, to something personally
significant (but preferably not obscene!)

if the mail system is set up correctly, so that user@tymix or
user@any-server gets forwarded to the user's primary login machine,
it shouldn't be too much of a problem remembering host names.

(i also eventually expect to set up outgoing mail so that mail sent out
of tymnet from any of our unix machines appears to be from tymix!user
or user@tymnet.com)

anyway, i'd appreciate comments on this naming scheme, and alternante
suggestions if any.Received: from tymix.Tymnet by B39.Tymnet; Tue, 17 Feb 87 6:16:28 PST

Subject: TUMS on TRWNET. 

The people at TRW are interested in TUMS running on their 2020.
1) Do you want TUMS on a non-TYMNET system?
2) Would it be OK for SENDMA/RDMAIL/TUMS to deliver local mail only?
3) Should MAILER running on TRW's 2020 be expected/allowed to build a circuit
   thru the gateway to deliver mail to 930 and 26?  (That is, leaving the
   public-network password to username MAIL exposed.)
4) Could MAILER on 930 pull messages from TRW instead?

Or should I tell them that TUMS is not a product, cannot be supported, and
cannot be provided.

An immediate answer is not necessary - this may involve policy decisions.

Subject: "bill, i want to get whatever PC"... 


bill,


i want to get whatever PC programs you have that are sharable.
i am liberal on that point (sharable...).  would like
an HP terminal emulator, but vt1xx is fine.

do you have any source code for a terminal emulator? i have a couple
of things i want to change and need source code.

do you have an 808x disassembler? do you have 808x assemblers,
linkers,etc?  do you have  a C compiler?

thanks,

kevin

Hi Kim, I got your message just fine.  Keep this address handy as its the
fastest way to get ahold of me (unless of course the interface is down).
In that case, you'd need to call.  Let the receptionist know that its
urgent and she can call me at home.  Let me know how your experiment goes.

Bill,
      I need to communicate with some folks on BITNET.  Apparently I can get
an account on a 4381 in Arlington running VM/CMS which participates in BITNET
but it's certainly not an ideal solution.  Is there any sort of gateway to
BITNET that you know of or is this truely a case of "You can't get there from
here!"?

Subject: DOUBLE TRANSIT FIELD 

Dave,

The interpretation of two transit field RPOA entries is fairly clear,
however I'm not sure we intended to support it on this first pass.  It
does not seem to be a part of either phase 1 or 2 SWB, yet we should
design with the intent of supporting multiple transit field entries in
the future.

Perhaps we should discuss this among the Sup unit to come to a clearer
understanding.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: Tums and Ontyme 

Bill,

Something occurred to me recently which may help provide more efficient
Tums service.  If Tums is logging into each Ontyme username , retrieving
messages, and logging out, it could be much faster if it used the Ontyme 
'imi' command to 'imitate' a user.  This way there would be a single
logon per Tums retrieval session.  Tums would need access to a username 
with account supervisor status, but I doubt if that's a problem.

If Tums already works this way, just ignore this message.

Always trying to think of better ways...

Elliot

Subject: VMdebug 

	Recommendation for Rodney
		John Kopf

	RODNEY provides distributed management of a Skywalker system's
resources, and each instance of RODNEY (i.e., each card) provides some
(limited) set of capabilities.

	One such capability is the determination of the card's resources,
such as memory available;  another is the provision of a software USART.

	A function provided by RODNEY is loading the initial code to be
executed into the card ("bootstrapping").  For want of a better name, I
will refer to this initial code as a "Monitor" -- it may be ISIS-kernel,
IOC-kernel, or Diagnostic-kernel.  Thus RODNEY is -- to some extent --
providing a "virtual machine" to the monitor being loaded.  In the future,
RODNEY must be expanded to provide multiple virtual machines within a
single card (e.g., the "ATC" configuration, where the single processor
must be capable of support of both ISIS and IOC).

	In other instances, RODNEY may be controlled by additional
mechanisms, for activity such as DLL or Debugging.

	One area where debugging is particularly painful is that of
debugging "system" code -- kernels and RODNEY itself.  The pain would
be greatly eased if the tools available for debugging applications
cound be brought to bear, permitting high-level debugging in real-time
code.

	Such a capability could be provided relatively simply by the
development of a VM debugger -- a special Monitor which would control
the MMU and emulate privledged capabilities while executing the code in
slave-mode.  Except for the interception of privledged operations and
MMU violations, such a debugger would otherwise be transparant to normal
debugging.  Hopefully, the MAXsbug code is sufficiently modular that
a small amount of development would permit recasting it into the role
of such a Monitor, perhaps with the addition of some Emulator capability
(assuming that Emulator source-code is available so we can "steal"
appropriate sections of code), and with the (hopefully) standard system
modules (such as MMU support).

	The effort expended in developing VMdebug would be more than
paid back in the effort saved for ongoing development and mantanance
of system code, especially in those cases where the code being developed
must interface with other processors running existing code.

	I strongly recommend that the concept of VMdebug be given further
consideration, because I feel that immediate diversion of effort toward
it's development will reduce the effort required for subsequent development,
and thus reduce the risks associated with RODNEY and Monitor(s) development
and enhancements.

Subject: 'sensitive' information 

The current issue of InformationWEEK (Feb. 16, 1987, pg. 17) has a short 
article on the effects of the recent definition of "sensitive, but not 
unclassified information" issued by John Poindexter, former NSC adviser to 
Reagan.

He said that any information which the "disclosure, loss, misuse, or 
destruction of could adversely affect national security" would be subject to 
careful monitoring.

The article then mentions some of the types of information that might fall in 
this category...then there is a very eye-openning paragraph:

   "Under these guidelines, the US Air Force, the CIA, and the National 
   Security Council have asked the keepers of some fo the country's largest 
   PUBLIC [my emphasis] databases, including Mead Corp.'s Nexus, to supply 
   names of subscribers and install software that will allow the company to 
   more accurately track who asks for what information and when."

Under the broad definition of vital information, an agency of the government 
may decide that any other private information is valuable, and it can monitor 
or hinder, that flow of information.  

I was just imagining the next step...tie the government systems into the city 
and university libraries, then start checking into what we buy at book stores, 
followed eventually by monitoring what we read in the papers.  I feel like some
of my freedom is eroding again.  Thoughts?

Well, now I will have someone watching what I read and what I pee.  Isn't it 
nice to have all this attention?

P.S. Sorry to complain...guess I am just having a bad day!

Office sees the .Tymnet and sends it to me.  It doesn't realize its in
two domains.  There is nothing wrong with the address, just that there
must be a bug in the mail handler on Office-1 that doesn't realize that
"OFFICE.TYMNET" is one of its names.

I'm not sure off the top of my head how to get to BITNET, but I know
they have an internet (Arpanet) gateway.  You can go through SUN to
get to ARPANET as follows:
	smu!convex!sun!user%domain

I do remember seeing an article in CACM that mentioned a gateway into BITNET.
I will see if I can find it, meanwhile, you might ask your contact in the
BITNET land if they know how to access from The Arpa Internet and then stick
whatever they say in place of user%domain in the above address.  Don't forget
to change the "@" to an "%" or it'll never get past your mail system.

More later.

How about right after the (1500) Cost Table meeting, whenever that breaks up.
Or we could just make it for 1600 if any non-cost-table people are involved.

do we need to coordinate our file updates?  if you work mostly
at night then the answer is  no.  if you see another wrs
logged on to minimac, then you could 'talk'
to me - but talk won't work if we are both logged
on as wrs.   unless you have a way to target talk
more explicitly...hmmmm what to do? i won work
past 11 pm in any case.

the file mm.macros has what looks to be a free-form comment

is this a pointer or a free form comment? does ls have

That's a symbolic link.  The file really doesn't exist in my directory,
its merely a pointer to the real file.  I'll explain the difference between

No, LS has no comment capability - alas, Unix can't do everything, yet.

You have been selected to define the requirements for a disk
system to be used by skywalker.  Your requirements will be used
in a vendor selection process for the purchase of the necessary
disk controller and if appropriate the necessary software to
support a file system on that controller.

The Rodney documentation suggests the creation of a file system
for skywalker.  If that approach is taken then the requirements
of a controller must be defined.  An alternative approach is to
purchase a complete product "off the shelf".  If that approach is
taken then the requirements for the "off the shelf" product must
be specified.  You may entertain alternate proposals.  The use of
the file system remains as a loading source for skywalker. 

Time is critical both in the definition of the requirements and
in the implementation of skywalker.  Please have a draft report
by Feb. 26.  If there is any resource you need please let me
know.

The only thing I'm not sure about is if sun handles the

send through us.  Might also try just
	...convex!sun!user%address.bitnet

Subject: LOGII GED Update 

Hello Folks,

I am sending another update to the LOGII GED.  The major addition
is the section on the new Accounting Type 4.7 message for the preamble,
to handle LOGII related Accounting data such as Origination Address and
Collect Call indications.  Some minor changes include clarification of
handling of backlevel destinations, and the specific disallowing of
LOGII and old style logon session messages combined in the same session.

The sections that are changed are the Table of Contents, Major Functional
Blocks, New Message Overview, RCRI, CCN and the new Accounting section.

This is of particular importance to MIS who has not been on the copy list
for this design until this revision.

Thanks...Omar

Subject: Rodney comments 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

bill,


someone said during the meeting that the pseudo code had
a reference to keeping a linked list of the bad apges -
which we had but removed form the drawing.  you might
want to removed that from the fefs.c.

i made a quick look for it but i don't see the reference.

the fefs.h file has the Home struct defining a pointer to
the 'bad page list', perhaps this is what they meant.  the
Home structure actually has some kind of list of bad pages
within it.  by the way, what if this list fills up?
do we chain off of the home page? in which case, each chain has the
same header? another way to do this is for the Home page
to point to a file, and the file is the list of bad pages,
and the file can be of any length.  Then the Home page
is kept clean, and easier to manipulate.

RODNEYWALKTHROUGHMEETINGNOTES: 

 
	 20 February 1987
 
	 To:Distribution
	 From: BJ
	 Subject: RODNEY WALKTHROUGH MEETING NOTES
 
	 Here are the notes from yesterday's meeting.
 
	 CONTENTS
 
	 1.Procedural issues from meeting:  Agenda, players, etc.
 
	 2.Problem areas/issues for which action items were defined.
 
	 3.Detailed notes from walkthrough on section by section basis.
 
 
	 SECTION 1 - PROCEDURAL
 
 
	 PLAYERS:
 
	 Dan Lasater, Bill Soley, Dick Rawson, Steve Feldman, Dave
	 Smith, Kevin Sinclair, Bill Euske, Michael Stimac, Pat
	 Driscoll, John Kopf, John Coons, Mike Rude, Dave Bliss, John
	 Burke, Jim Willott, Dennis Ernst, BJ
 
	 AGENDA ITEMS:
 
	 I. Rules:
	 - Purpose of meeting is walkthrough for clarification
	 - Lasater is responsible for keeping us on track
	 - Design must be confined to meeting market window
	 - We should identify areas where further completeness in spec
	   is required to initiate other design work.
	 - We will contract an editor to deal with editorial
	   changes in document required prior to marketing
	   distribution.
	 - We will not defer distribution of agreed design document
	   to necessary NTD personnel to wait for this editing.
 
	 II. Scope of work:
 
	 This discussion resulted in 1 action item - to review and
	 rework introduction to document describing who Rodney is and
	 what the intention of the document is.  Basic concept here is
	 that the level of completeness expected of the document is
	 that sufficient for Design Objectives to be defined for all
	 SKYWALKER system components, and for project plans to be
	 developed for each of these system components.  Any
	 shortcomings in the design which preclude these two results
	 are to be identified as action items and assigned.  The
	 concept is further refined to state that this architectural
	 specification need not be detailed enough to permit detailed
	 design of each system component, nor is it necessary for it
	 to include internal design detail for specific RODNEY
	 components.
 
	 Since RODNEY appears to becoming some form of entity in and
	 of itself, we anticipate that detailed design issues for
	 RODNEY will have to be addressed in follow-on RODNEY design
	 documents. Definition of who Rodney is has been assigned
	 to Dick for presentation on Tuesday.
 
	 III. Action items
 
	 (Note, some of these references are rather cryptic.
	 They are listed in the order they were raised, so for
	 further clarification	you might want to reference the
	 detailed discussions notes (in the next section) where you
	 might find explication, or at least, other, related
	 cryptic references.)

	 Section IV.- Detailed notes from discussion and walkthrough
	 RODNEY
 
	 (Note - this contains comments and discussion. Issues that
	 appeared to be problems or concerns are flagged with "==>".
	 Some, but not all of these appeared on the lists above.
 
	 Section 1.
 
	 IOC 68010s.  Concerns:  16 bit automacy (bus width of 68010 -
	 16bit).  Test and set instructions reuqired.  local use of
	 Test and set not sufficient with dual porting.  Requires
	 simulation of compare and swap.  Concensus appears to be that
	 the 68010 is a pain to have to deal with in design.
	 Discussion of options for elminiating it by a) redesign of
	 IOC using 68020, or b) purchase of 68020 IOC.	Conclusion
	 appears to be that these are really not options if we are to
	 meet either cost or time targets.
 
	 Distributed processes proposed to minimize single point of
	 failure.
 
	 Serial numbers set in PROM, not set by SW. SW will prohibit
	 write.
 
     ==> ALFRED is new debugger for engine to be used as model for
	 SKYWALKER. ALFRED needs better definition/description in
	 document.
 
     ==> No hot swap of cards in phase 1. We need to insure that
	 we can add hot swap in phase 2. Issue here regarding futures.
	 How much backward compatibility between phase 1 and 2 does
	 marketing want/need?
 
     ==> What about case of adding new boards with different
	 capabilities? (like swapping out an 8 mg board for a 4 meg
	 board). Can the software handle this case?
 
	 Section 2
 
	 Different vendors use difference VME addressing schemes.
	 Types of addresses affect difference address modifiers.
 
	 Motorola and Heuricon boards have some overlap in addressing,
	 Tadpole and Heuricon have no overlap.
 
      ==> The use of the term GLOBAL MEMORY in the document is
	 unclear. All memory is accessible globally but it wont be
	 used in that fashion. Memory is owned by specific processors.
	 Memory on board is used only to describe things on that
	 board. All memory is readable and writeable by processors
	 other than the owner processor.
 
	 Issue of local and VME addressing is still unclear.  Mapping
	 from VME into local RAM is handled by switches on boards.
	 Not all boards permit SW to read switches.  If an oeprator
	 miss-sets vME address we need to be able to figure that out.
 
	 If different cards can't talk to each other because of
	 incompatiblities in space addressing do we have a problem? We
	 can`t mix card types that are incompatible.
 
	 <Here there were two diagrams>
 
	  In this section there is no description of the utility
	 required to put VME addresses into EROM. IOCs. get their
	 address from port number.
 
     ==>  Section 2.2 needs more detail on local addressing.
	  Section 2.6 Extended memory - design documents. Scope of
	  architectural spec is components where interface is needed.
	 ISIS design issues need to be addressed in isis design.
	 Extended memory is not a proboem except for PASCAL and SNA.
 
      ==>  RODNEY  needs definition. RODNEY is a multiprocess
	 definition. IThis document defines an architecture that
	 underlys ISIS. RODNEY is the interface between ISIS and
	 system components. RODNEY manages global resources, ISIS
	 manages each machine.
 
	 Section 2.5 Serial#, Model#, HW SW FW Vrs#.  Only Model # and
	 Serial # actually make up UID.  Some capabilities
	 identification derivable from model #, however this doesn't
	 necesarily include clock and memory size.  Kopf thinks it
	 might be handy to know and tell software about memory, clock
	 or other characteristics.  If HW vers# is stored in EPROM, is
	 that affected by ECOs?  Not on CPs for phase 1 but yes for
	 our own built boards.	IOC has EEPROM.  Can change version #
	 when ECO is applied.
 
     ==> Make the utility that updates EEPROM for ECO revision a part
	 of the board diagnostics so when MFG does the revision, they
	 then run the diagnostics and change the rev.
 
      ==> Marketing has new model numbering scheme.The question is
	  whether or not this has any relevance to our use of model
	 numbers here, and whether they might have some preferences on
	 how these numbers are used to conform to their own schemes.
 
     ==>  2.7 IOC gatearray. Long word boundary issue needs to be
	 addressed.
 
	  Bootstrap - all cards: CP, IOC, Disk Controller.
 
	  GLOB is a data structure held by each processor in its own
	 local memory. All processors have Read access to everyone
	 else GLOB, but can't write into anyone elses glob.
 
    ==>   We need additional description of I/O initialization.
	  "INIT IPCF" also needs process description. Pseudo code
	 probably not necessary.
 
	  How is memory to be managed in cards. Boot allocates what
	 memory it needs, GLOB table and defined structures are all
	 that need to exist after boot phase.
 
    ==>   Global memory management within a card to be addressed as an
	 ISIS design issue.
 
    ==>   Defibrillation code or process description should be added.
	 Code especially desireable.
 
 
    ==>    System configuration test needs to be clarified - for
	 system as a whole and for specific components.
 
    ==>   Add statement that initialization continues even if system
	 fails. component Sysfail turns off lights on all boards.
 
     ==>   Zeroing memory after a dump. On crash, if magic # is bad?,
	  What if disk goes down on power fail?. Do we choose a
	  failure mode when memory might still be good or keeping it
	  desireable.?
 
	  Page 7 GDS - reference to GLOB on arbiter should be
	 deleted.
 
	   Pointers - Device has address, idelly the same address in
	 local as well as VME addressing but vendor cards don't
	 implement it this way. So, pointers become ambiguous, hence
	 clear definition of kind of pointer is needed to know whether
	 it's local or VME address. Implementation must be careful.
	 All VME addresses may be/should by/probably will be via VME
	 subroutine call.
 
    ==>    Add notes about issues of pariticular sensitivity such as
	 global indirections. Paranoia on Data strucutres, Paranoia on
	 bus error handline, paranoia on addressing pointers.
 
     ==>   MAXCAGE - should this be 4 or 8 or 1. ISsue for further
	 study/clarification.
 
	 Section 3 is  part of system initialization. Not really
	 bootstrapping.
 
	 Discuss issue of board death and recovery during expansion of
	 PATHOLOGY section and constrints.
 
    ==> Potential design improvement by including  state
	 tables/diagrams and cases for addressing pathology - in
	 addition to pseudo code.
 
    ==>   Possibly error issues may be "to be adddressed" in detail
	 design.
 
	  Section 4 - Front end file system
 
	 Partition disk into logical volumes.  1 partition for FEFS, 1
	 for ISIS, 1 for ????.	What ISIS thinks is the whole disk is
	 1 logical volume.
 
	  FEFS is for loading, dumping, error log.
 
     ==>  Specify in document that the discussion of the file system
	 is based on a byte stream model.
 
	  ISIS sees a logical volume differenly from this file system.
 
     ==>  Completion issue - Determination of disk and file system
	 distribution ?
	 - Selection of controller?
	 - legal characters in file system?
	 - diagnostic and utility programs - where do they reside?
	 - System convention - what is meaning of character strings?
	 - Define file names and file strings.
	 - How far into file system should redundancy go - disk and
	 file sytem back up?
	 - what is checking for volume integrity taking place?
 
     ==>  Write without pointer advance option may be requried for
	 log. (for periodic writes of event log information)
	 "Frontal truncate " means "circular wrap"?
 
     ==>  Problem area - file system structure, data content,
	 concurent access to logs, etc.
 
	 Comment:   We need a better description of the physical
	 Response: We make no assumptions in the file system about
	 physical media.
 
	  4.2 Loading files onto disk. DL load facility has primative
	 but complete set of file manipulation capability.
 
 
      ==>  Additional discussion required regarding FORCE BOARD. It
	  could meet requirements but tradefoffs required are not
	  desireable, even though alternatives are more expensive.
	  We need further refinement of requriements (HW especially)
 
	  Section 5 - loading.
 
	  Section 4 para2 issue to be addressed in IOC development.
 
	  DL loading algorithm is in ROM
 
	   5:1 Device name - some characteristics in common with UID -
	 e.g. Model #. IOC is associated with physical port number it
	 is connected to. (lowest port # in group of 8)
 
	  Device name used to determine filenmae to look for on disk
	 includes: Filetype, load (for boot), dump, log.
	 Version number has meaning for load files ()=current file, 1
	 and 2 = backup version of code.
 
	  Device name requred (rather than using UID) isnce device
	 name doesn't depend on physlical serial # and can be put into
	 ISIS tymfile.
 
	 Page 22 end - "version " indicates "instance" not to be
	 confused with "version # as in Version, revision.
 
      ==> Loading - need to be able to load from console ports. Define
	 requirements. When ISIS is up it can do loads to update disk
	 while processors are up.
 
      ==> Why is only 1 downline load to be allowed at one time?
	  1 DL load is permitted per IOC not per system?
	  Needs clarification.
 
      ==> Issue of TYMTUNNELS.
 
	  Conclusion seems to be that for first run, ability to load
	  from local disk or from console might permit tymtunnels
	  to work ok even without ability to load across an X.25 link?
 
	  1 copy of ISIS on all CPS instead of multiple copies of
	 ISIS. This is a host sw issue (SKYWALKER UNIX load facility,
	 and CMF).
 
	  Engineering notes that hardware won't support off protection
	  for off card read only references.
 
	  Clarify differences between current boot DLL and this
	 proposal. I.e., add scenarios of load options. E.g., ISIS
	 can be up without node code being up.
 
      ==> Revisit DL loading protocol. Do we need a link level
	 protocol.
 
	 Define command/response sequence (5.5, 5.6 - state machine of
	 possible responses.  State descriptions are important here.
 
	 Access through DDT OR through DDL mechanism are intended to
	 be as symmetrical as possible.
 
	 Section 6 - Configuration
 
     ==>  Configuration detail to be moved to APPENDIX.
 
	  ISIS needs to talk to RODNEY to find out physlica unit (i.e.
	 device names).
 
      ==>  Note in GLOB section that GLOB will be used for
	 configuration.
 
	 Slot - licenses, LU-PU messages, CPH primary, [CPH backup].
	 Configuration changes on the fly allowed through load of new
	 glob configuration file.
 
	 Section 7 - Interprocessor communication
 
	 Device level communication, not slot communication.  Solves
	 concurrency and reace conidtion issues.  Ring structure
	 allowing more than 1 writer into a single ring.  Each
	 processor has only an input ring into which processors write
	 pointers to their rings.  Each entry in ring is 4 bytes long
	 (1 pointer).
 
	 OWNER ID = high order 12 bits of base VME address.
 
	 Must have some polling by reader at least often enough to
	 time out lock.
 
	 When reader checks he needs to know that lock hasn`t been
	 locked and unlocked and locked again since the last check.
	 Does he need to look at a pointer to see if its been update?
 
	 It's important that writer not be interrupted. Can this be
	 done?
 
	  This is an area where we made tradeoffs for performance
	 instead of fault tolerance.
 
	   What about using CAS . Limitation of 68010 need not
	 necessarily be adhered to for operations involving only
	 68020s.
 
	  VME limitations impact us as well. TYMNET IOC design option
	 in gate array, locking bus and local master ' buys you
	 compare and swap but locks local proccessor from access to
	 bus. Simulating CAS by locking bus is trading 1 limitation
	 for another. All boards (ours and others) will hold bus
	 through RMW cycle.
 
	  7.3 correct.
	  7.5 delete.
 
	  Pointer is full VME address (see pseudle code IOC send page
	 35.)
 
      ==>  Define IPCF reply message protocol.
 
      ==>  Message types for IPCF must be administrered.
 
	   Mailbox facility will be used if available.
 
	   Section 8 - I/O communication
 
	   8.1 SIO emulation. IOC would emulate both SIO and some of
	 the functionality in ISIS driver.
 
     ==> Async I/O section needs work.
     ==> Interrpts and ISIS SIO driver require further design work
	 (FIRWARE).
 
	 Sync emulation REQURIED for phase 1.
 
	 8.2 IOCs need to know VME address and physical port number.
	 RODNEY proposes that the backpanel include a way of sending
	 which port group it is back to the IO*c.
 
     ==> Port naming conventions are a problem area.
 
	 <Diagram here>
 
	 Thumb wheel switch on backpanel to set.  Physical port
	 relationships will be defined, this then is used for device
	 name.	Is there a problem with this?
 
	 If breakout panel thumb wheel switches are set wrong, is
	 there any way to tell?
 
	 RODNEY requires the physical port ID for device ID
	 derivation.  Needs help from breakout panel, paddleboard and
	 IOC.
 
     ==> Need more elaboration/alternatives on port numbers including
	 mechanical limits inherent to the IOC/Breakout design (if
	 any). Mapping of IOC names to group of 4 when IOC supports
	 more than 4 might cause a problem if FE's reconnect other
	 4 to another IOC by error.`
 
	  page 37 last paragraph unclear. 4 reads to poll 4 ports (2
	 bits each).
 
	  Section 9 - back-up
 
    ==>  12.2 Clocking relationship of system clock to SUP clock, real
	 time interrups at least once very 16 sec is required for
	 every RODNEY component.  Some of the stuff in this section
	 12.2 should be moved back up to section 9.
 
   ==>	 Should longer locks have crash count?
 
	  9.2 paragraph 1. Conviction is cleared on reset.
 
    ==>   Need more detail of conviction re-setting. I.e., need
	  pardon defintion.
 
    ==>   What about Conviction on 1 accusation in case of only 2
	 processors (no bk-up, only CP and IOC case)
 
	 What of case where there is only 1 witness, for example, CP
	 sees IOC is bad, but no other CP notices or cares or
	 witnesses against it?
 
	  All boards except Plessy can be reset across the VME bus so
	 this is probably what conviction results in - the convict
	 goes back to initialization.
 
	 What to do at initialization? This is decided for prcoessors
	 by ISIS.
 
	 Does convict know why he was reset? Other processors know
	 he's been convicted.
 
     ==>  Need to establish penal codes (reason codes for conviction).
 
	  9.2 ISIS topic for slots to be moved individually - similar
	 mechanisms for slot and card back up.
 
	  On conviction convict code picked up by various back up
	 processors who will load rele4vant slot code.
 
    ==>  Slot backup.  needs forther explication here, as well as more
	 detail in ISIS design.
 
	 Section 10 - Debuggers
 
	 2 debuggers - standalone (like MACSBUG, resident in ROM.
 
	 No separate console board. TTY port on each CP. Any TTY port
	 used to access any standalone or ISIS debugger on any system.
 
	 Implementation through SW uarts.
 
	 Local TTY port woudl have in ROM a soft abort button
	 permitting abort-like functions to occur on another
	 processor.
 
	 Has to scan for data from TTY port
 
	 Assumption here is that standalone debuggers can't work while
	 somthing else is going on.
	 Not a necesary assumption- MACs bug was modified for TTY to
	 permit concurrent functioning of MACSBUG and other things.
	 Can we run standalone debug with other processes? We should
	 evaluate this, it might be nice to have.
 
     ==> <Aside...  at end of day we decided that we should not go
	 looking for trouble, and that we would not pursue this.  We
	 did decide that one could access the standalone debugger on
	 one processor card through the TTY port on another card
	 without disabling the current functioning of the accessed
	 card.>
 
	 10.1 Note: TTY emulation (like engine) is not required
	 because ISIS and diagnositcs are new.
 
 
     ==>  How to handle SW UART lock-out option for notification of
	 lock owner (on TTY port into standalone debugger) that you
	 are taking lock away.
 
	  ISIS debugger is the second debug facility available. Most
	 design of this is planned for the ISIS design activity.
 
	  Source level debugger input/output. Issues of definition
	  regarding slot debugging. Interpreter and Translator issues.
 
	  John would like a future ability to debug a virtual machine.
 
	  Section 11.
 
    ==>   How to handle rewirte of last block in logger requires
	 clarification.
 
	 Log entry:
 
	 time/ UID / code (prod type) / code (event type)/severity
	 code / text .
 
	 Option for part of the message field to be reserved for and
	 used by ISIS for some further identification.
 
	 Section 11.1 Log file handling.
 
	 All log messages are ID'd by UID (paragraph 2).
 
	 Concept here is that the primary purpose of the log is HW.
	 It is NOT a replication of msgs to SUPS etc.
 
     ==> Issue of real time access to HW log - display of last page,
	 last "n" messages etc.
 
	 WHO is RODNEY? Is he a series of PROM routines? (ROMNEY).
     ==> Need RODNEY defintion.
 
	 Message types for logger need administration.
 
	 Section 12 Operating considerations
 
	  Medium performance lock.
 
     ==>  Lock use identification and evaluation needed.
	  Suggestion is made that when programming locks
	  state diagrams be included in design (another paranoia
	  issue). Locks are RODNEY System functions that live in ROM
	 and can be called by ISIS's and node codes.
 
	  (Locks, clocks, heartbeats, interprocess communication are
	  ISIS tools.
 
     ==> Future. For inhouse 68030 - desirable to be able to lock up
	 dual ported memory access to VME bus to allow safe use of
	 CAS.
 
	  Section 13 - Mis. Considerations
 
	  13.2 Dispatcher - single vrs multiple dispatcher. Does
	 affect/impact BACK-UP sceme, but should be addresed from
	 detail design perspective by ISIS design.
 
	   13.4 ISIS library upgrade.
 
	 If we don't rewrite isis libs then we lose abiliyt for
	 hierarchical recovery.  (i.e.	we can`t have option to back
	 up by going to back up code (reload) instead of switch to
	 backup processor.  But..  This is a new and better feature
	 not a replication of existing back up capability, so,...  New
	 library packages are nice but not essential and might be
	 considered to be optional development.  (There is some issue
	 of compatiblity with all interfaces if we do do new
	 libraries).
 
	 13.6 Potential problem with 2 card systems as we can have
	 cofessions but not accusations.
 
	 Interchassis communciation.
 
    ==>  Issue here is what form of backward compatiblity to support
	 interchassis communication developed in phase 2 is required?
	 Is it ok, for example, to require that new phase 2 CPU cards
	 be installed to permit interchassis comm? It is prob'ly NOT
	 ok to require that the chassis be replaced, or that all cards
	 become obsolete when interchassis comm is required.
 
	 We need to take this up with marketing during spec review.

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

Subject: Supervisor cost in the needle dump 

Omar,

I just talked to Edsel Budar and Dennis Jonas.  Both are very receptive
of having the supervisor cost in the needle dump data.  According to
Edsel, nobody else is analyzing this data, so that there is no problem
with including the cost in the dump for version 43.  As we have discussed,
please do it when you plan to do the NSR concerning the history log and
needle dump.

In-reply-to: your message of Mon, 23 Feb 87 13:14:43 PST

Yes, 3/3 appears to be Ok.  I will be coming off 17 & Stevenson out of
class which starts 3/2, so 11:30 will be a little tight, but I will try
to make it for lunch.... (I assume we can delay lunch a little since it
will be a "working" lunch, if I am a few minutes late)...

    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.

      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).

      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.

    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.

Subject: RODNEY COMMENTS FROM JOHN BURKE 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.

bill,


in the ipcf text it says that a writer may accuse the reader,
if the reader is inactive.  but i don't see this in the pseudo code.
is this intentional?  we can comment it if so.

bill,


in file judiciary.c, the accuse() routine near the top has a line
that sets witness1=0 and the next line tests witness1==0.
i don't see what is happening there.  shouldn't the test be 
witness1|=0?  it is not clear.

also, i have forgotten, what happents if two people rae executing this
code,
for the second accusal, and both do the forceReset at the same time?
the card is getting reset twoce, and it may be trying to recover from the
first reset when the second arrives.  that may be ok, but it
may also cause some erroneous recording of state information, if
the card is recording its crash state on a log, for example,
before it finishes its initialization. eh?

Subject: magic numbers 




as magic numbers proliferate, e.g. used in initialization, debugger,
etc - perhaps we should have 2 of them - 1 for initialization,
and 1 for all other uses?  this separation will help keep
initialization robust.

for example, consider a card that was 4 meg long.  we hvae magic
at the start for initialization stuff ('boot').  right around
the 1 meg boundary, some other use of magic occurs, maybe
for a debugger or whatever; the init stuff, by scanning
on 1 meg boundaries, wil think another card starts there; it
may not be able to 'recognize' a card there after finding 
the magic nubmer, but the system is getting screwed.  people
would say, 'how amazing to fnid another magic number on a 1 meg
boundary!' but instead lets just fix it now.  eh?

do we need to store the address and/or length of the log file in glob?
i guess address is not needed for the disk file, since it follows
a standard naming.  but we need to knows its length.  and the
address of the 1k log buffer.  are these in the local symbol table?

Subject: Lock index questioni 



bill,


the struct Lock stores the 1's complement of the card index.
the card index is the high-order 12 bits of its vme base
address.  If this address starts out FF... then the ones complement
will give you a word with the high bit OFF - eh?
won't this affect the TAS status of the field? or am
i confused?  eh?

The struct Lock stores 1's comp of index which is high 12 bits of address.

	|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
	| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | <--------------- ~(A31-A20) ----------------> |

          ^ - bit set by TAS

That leaves the high 4 bits of the 16 bit field always 1.

After looking at code, I am puzzled why this feature is not present.
I think I need to further research PVC circuits, but for right now it
looks to Paul and myself like an oversight, as you suggested.  I will
let you know more as I do.  I am not sure when it will be available, if
we need to add it but will also try and determine that.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

	 From: BJ
	 Subject: SKYWALKER project meeting minutes.
 
	 Here are the minutes from the status review meeting
	 of 20 February.
 
	 Agenda:
 
	 I.  Old items
	 II. New items
	 III.Other new items
 
 
	 I. OLD ITEMS
 
	 Old items were reviewed, including action items from previous
	 meeting.
 
	 1a. The first UNIX training class was completed, another
	 is scheduled. Michael's staff did an excellant job of
	 presenting to 22 class participants.
 
	 1b. Project schedule updates for firmware and diagnostics
	 will be available next week (diagnostics) and after final
	 Rodney review (firmware).
 
	 1c. Engine/68k debugger proposal will be provided on 27 Feb.
 
	 1e. Mechanical engineering  concept review will be held
	 monday 23 Feb at 9:30.
 
	 1f. IOC/HW functional specification review scheduled for
	 25 Feb. Goal is to complete internal reviw by 4 march.
 
	 2a. Update to draft project plan (first submitted for
	 core team review in early january) is distributed for
	 review. Note that there have been a number of changes to
	 this document. Review comments due Thursday 26 Feb.
 
	 2b.  SCCS class will be prepared by Michael's staff. Michael
	 will send out class description, 1 rep from each of hte
	 development groups should attend class, class will be
	 scheduled for week of 1 march.
 
	 2e. Unix system support. This issue was raised at Al's staff
	 meeting. Decision to defer further action until we get more
	 experience with the environment.
 
	 2f.  Trade shows.  QA needs to be involved.  Mktg has asked
	 us to build 12 machines over and above our own use .  QA has
	 asked for a SKYWALKER machine from pilot as well.  Ken is to
	 request that Rebmann specify what level of functionality is
	 reuqired for the trade shows.
 
 
	 II. NEW ITEMS
 
	 New items include:
 
	 1.  Review of project plan
	 2.  Review of change control form
	 3.  Project schedule issues
	 4.  RODNEY issues
 
 
	 1  Revised project plan distributed for review. Comments
	 due back by 26 February. Note that a number of changes have
	 been made to this document.
 
	 2.  Document change control form was distributed for review.
	 and approval of change to "Proposal".
 
	 3.  Players are reminded that project schedule updates
	 are expected monday 1 march.
 
	 4. Rodney walkthrough on 19 Feb resulted in a number of
	 action items for SKYWALKER core team. These are noted below.
 
	 RODNEY issues	are action items defined in the
	 meeting that need resources allocated to them.
 
	 1.  Long word boundary concerns on IOC We need resource
	 assignment to study this with reference to Gate array,
	 Compiler, and Linker.
 
	 ==> Jim Wollot assigned to evaluate this.
 
	 2.  Console (TTY) port loading We need resource assignment to
	 prepare proposal for integration into RODNEY document.
 
	 ==> Kevin assigned to this
 
	 3.  ASYNC I/O We need resource allocation for ASYNC I/O
	 study.  This study includes evaluation of one or more
	 strategies for handling autobaud, 19.2, and SIO async
	 emulation in SKYWALKER, and evaluation of implications of
	 strategies on CONSAT , SIO Emulation, and Firmware
	 development.
 
	 ==> Ernst, Chu, Kopf, Jonas assigned to this
 
	 4.  DISK Controller We need to expeditiously make a decision
	 on a controller for SKYWALKER because the controller
	 characteristics impact design and hence schedule issues.
 
	 ==> Soley and one of John's guys assigned to this.
 
	 5.  Utilities for File and disk system We need resource
	 allocation to define utilities required to support file and
	 disk system for RODNEY
 
	 Comment: Investigate single board computer with disk
	 controller. Consider build or buy decision before committing
	 internal development of a file system.
 
	 ==> Same as 4 above.
 
	 6.  Down line load protocol We need resource allocation to
	 evaluate and define a DLL protocol for SKYWALKER.
 
	 ==> Dave Comstock and one of Mike Rude's guys assigned to
	 this.
 
	 7.  PORT numbers/accounting We need Mike Rebmann to put
	 together a taskforce to define accounting requirements for
	 SKYWALKER
 
	 ==> Ken and BJ to bring up with Rebmann on wednesday
 
	 8.  Administration of penal codes etc.  We need an
	 administrator for penal codes, for message IDs to RODNEY's
	 log, and for IPCF message types.
 
	 ==> Ken
 
	 9.  We need to address MAXCAGE and Model# use with marketing
 
	  ==> Rebmann (Ken and BJ)
 
	 10.  We decided to eliminate non-RODNEY design issues from
	 RODNEY document.  We need to insure that these are instead
	 expressed as design input to other SKYWALKER development
	 activites.
 
	 III. Other new items
 
	 1. Availability/requirements for test beds need to be defined
	 for engineering.
 
	 Project schedules for each group should identify what test
	 facilities they require and WHEN they are required such that
	 we can share resources.
 
	 It is very important that we minimize the number of test bed
	 facilities we have to support during the development process
 
	 ==> Everyone. Include this issue in project schedule updates.
 
	 2. Other new items.
 
	 1. Dan presented the resource re-allocation issue, making
	 specific recommendations regarding resource re-allocation
	 in his area, and requests for resources from other groups.
 
	 Al reported that the only two projects in the division that
	 were not automatically candidates for resource sharing are
	 TSI and SWBELL numbering plan. He agreed to address resource
	 reallocation issues presented to him.
 
	 We agreed to meet on Wednesday AM (9am conference room in
	 BLDG D) to identify specific requirements and to apply
	 (reallocate) resources to meet these requirements.
 
	 2. Dave B distributed copies of memos regarding IOC HW
	 and firmware concerns to be resolved prior to design approval
	 on the IOC.
 
	 3. Weekly status review meetings will, beginning next week,
	 include Mr. Rebmann.
 
	  4. Next week's meeting is scheduled for Thursday 26 Feb,
	  1:30 pm.

Subject: control x 

There is a reason that you may not want to implement the control x immediately.
PVC currently stuffs all of the bits for the options and the TID (if AID)
into one word.  There are 24 bits for options and currently all but a couple
are used and I believe that the used bits were once used but are no longer
used.  Thus, you may want to modify the macros and the code and give yourself
another word of bits.

Also, if the control X is wanted for an ALO PVC then the control X couild
be put into the UTEXT macro as part of the username.  UTEXT("17swedel:39;haha).

BASELINE PRODUCT CODE:NETVAL

VERSION:3.10

CUSTOMER NAME :Morgan Guaranty

QUESTION
Customer has recently upgraded to NETVAL version 3.10 and has some
questions concerning some of thge new features:

 1. I read in NVAL03.Y06 where the REMARK command has been added
    to allow the operator to input a string to be appended to the
    Operator Log CUD change messages, but I can't find documen-
    tation on the use of the command. Can you please provide?

 2. The Operator's Guide for version 3.10 describes the FILTER
    MASTER command which reports MASTER validator activities.
    Could you briefly describe Master validator (we do have
    NETVAL_IS_A_SLAVE enabled)?

 3. Is there any specific timeframe in which version 3.10 will be
    in betatest?

Thank-you...

Friday 3/6 is okay as it stands, but is about 50% likely to be preempted
by YARR (Yet Another Rodney Review).  You can go ahead and schedule it
then, by me, with that provision, or maybe make it for the week of the 9th.
(Gee I was looking at Feb when I said that, but this month it doesn't
matter.  All months should be like that.)  -Bill

It appears that you are now valid on minimac.  At least you have a
directory and all that.  I suggest you use your name from now on and
that will make talk and stuff easier.  We should start to use SCCS
as soon as the class (although I may change my mind when I see how it
works).  Let me know if you are able to log in.  -Bill

        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
.    
        The PATCH FILE, (SOURCE)TII05.P10, contains the following changes: 
.    
        (1)  Patch to fix HDLC micro-engine SIO line initialization
                problem has been revised.  SIO lines which fail to   
                complete initialization within 20 ms. are flagged    
                for another initialization attempt 2 secs. later.    
                Crypto message 72: SIO PORT UNAVAILABLE - LINE= line#,    
                is issued after the first attempt only.    
.    
             Additionally, this patch no longer treats TSI machines
                as HDLC micros.  Rather, TSI machines are treated as 
                regular engines except that 20 ms. are allowed for   
                initialization to complete. 
.    
             This patch does not affect regular engines. 
.    
        (2)  Patch to display 5-digit neighbors has been cosmetically   
                altered for patch file consistency.  However,   
                functionality remains unchanged. 
.    
        (3)  Patch to fix reset problems on multi-line links has been   
                corrected.   
.    
        (4)  Patch to allow version 5.10 nodes to handle Rebuild from   
                future version 6.00 neighbors has been added.   
        ================================================================   
     
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        It is now available on c36 and c39 and will be available on

Subject: TUMS-10 bug report (v44000017 of 18-DEC-86) 

Bill,
I seem to be having some problems with tums.  I opened an archive file
to try to clean out unwanted messages.  Everyother message was just "To:"
and nothing else.  After issuing several "del noarc ..."  I did an
"expunge" .  The result was it started to expunge many of the messages
then came up with an error message and exited tums.  I had a file of 
over 400 messages of which 200 were blanks.  I had gone through approximately
the first 250 probably deleting about 230 of those.  When I looked at
what the exit left me there was only about 5 messages on the archive file
and the same on the tix.

This is one way of cleaning up my old archive files but not exactly what I
had in mind.

Let me know if I followed a bad procedure or whatever.

Thank you,
Diana

 P.S. I just remembered one other thing - in the middle of issuing the
"del noarc ..." commands I , by mistake issued a "del.. " command then
followed it with a "del noarc..." command with the same message numbers
because I relized my error - could this foul things up?

	(non-SIO) ASYNC support to slots running in the Skywalker Environment,
	without requiring modifications to those slots regarding I/O driver
	protocols supported.

Constraints imposed:  The facility MUST be available by Feb '88;  it MUST
	use the IOC and the SCC-chip (i.e., no new card development).

Acceptible options:  Requiring new code be developed, for both IOC and ISIS,
	is expected.

Results:

	ISIS will provide the necessary capabilities to translate between
"normal" and new I/O driver protocols.

	A desirable goal of any new Async-I/O Driver protocol is to provide
a complete set of functionality (both normal and SIO) in such a way that, in
the future, products could migrate toward using the new protocol without a need
for retaining driver-dependent protocols -- THIS IS NOT, HOWEVER, A FORMAL
SKYWALKER GOAL;  it is merely highly desirable from the view of application
support.

	The SCC's inability to support independent input- and output-clock
rates means that split baud-rates can NOT be supported (e.g., 75/1200).


Assumptions and Reasoning leading to these Results:

	It is assumed that the the IOC will be based upon the existing
TSI code;  in particular, drivers for SIO/ASYNC emulation already are
defined and exist.  However, these do not provide either the auto-baud
detect or the output-delay capabilities required of "normal" Async.  It
is not clear if they support Break-generation either.  These are all
capabilities which are required of normal Async, and thus necessitat
that an alternative set of drivers be developed for IOC.  However, TSI
-- and thus hopefully IOC -- support alternative drivers.  The particular
problems associated with auto-baud detection in association with a USART
have been successfully addressed in the ATC product, and thus many of those
algorithms can be readily incorporated into new normal-Async drivers.

	A more complex problem is associated with the IOC's communication
with ISIS and the slot.  Neither the current normal nor SIO Async
implementation is general enough for the capabilities required;  each
provides some of the requirements, but these do not overlap enough.

	Normal Async is based upon input and output rings, but incorporate
both bit-arrays, and incrementable counters -- these are not safe in a
multi-processor environment, since they require "atomic" (read-modify-write)
operations.

	SIO/Async suffers from CCW-oriented output, and a strange form
of input (where characters are input to half-words in an 8-hw buffer, but
the buffer is timeout-driven).  It also lacks the special features required.

	The most reasonable implementation for a new Async is for each
port to communicate to IOC via a ring of 16-bit "characters" for each
direction of communications;  each ring would have a 16-bit fill and
empty cursor, and a data-area whose length is defined by the ISIS-end.
Eack 16-bit data-field would contain two bytes of information; the first,
if non-zero, would specify a control-function, the second the control-value,
or the data if the first was zero (this is similar to SIO-input, where
<0,0> is data-zero, but <1,0> indicates Break).  This communication mechanism
is "safe", in that only one processor writes each field, and the other only
reads that field;  it does suffer in that bit-wise polling is not available,
and instead each such ring must be polled by the receiver in turn, to determine
if there is anything to do.

	It does have the advantage that such polling could be performed by
the ISIS Foreground (in place of the normal Async polling), and then data
could be transfered between the ISIS/IOC rings and the conventional Async
rings of the slot for normal Async Emulation (such activity between ISIS
Foreground and the Slot IS safe, as long as only a single processor is
involved).

	It also has the advantage that a slot could use the mechanism
directly, in future implementations (retrofitting this functionality to
Engine-ISIS would permit full portability of the capability, without the
need for seperate driver-protocols for Async and SIO within products such
as CONSAT and TYMCOM).

	With respect to split baud-rate support, the committee concluded
that while such support is necessary, it is precluded using the SCC chip.
Alternatives require a new card:  one possibility is the use of the "cirrus"
chip proposal;  a second is to use SCC, with one channel for each direction
of I/O;  a third is to develop a card with an Engine, executing the existing
microcode, and performing strictly as a USART!


Async Control Information:

	The existing implementation of ISIS Async currently supports the
following functions:

    o	Generate delay (units of 1/30th second)...leave output in marking-
	state for that long).
    o	Set input baud-rate;
    o	Set output baud-rate:
	(these both present a code which currently selects:
	75 Baud Ascii (i.e., 8-bit);
	10 CPS Ascii;
	15 CPS Ascii;
	30 CPS Ascii;
	40 CPS Ascii;
	60 CPS Ascii;
	120 CPS Ascii;
	240 CPS Ascii;
	480 CPS Ascii;
	960 CPS Ascii;
	10 CPS Ascii (at 300 baud...generate delay between characters);
	10 CPS Ascii (at 1200 baud...generate delay between characters);
	14.7 CPS (2741..7-bit);
	30 CPS (3767..7-bit);
	50 Baud (Baudot..5-bit);
	75 Baud (Baudot..5-bit).
    o	Enter TID mode.
    o	enter data-mtde.
    o	enable.
    o	RS up.
    o	RS down.
    o	Generate 0.083 seconds of output Break-state.
    o	TID mode detected char at assumed baud-rate specified (char observed
	at that baud-rate follows).
    o	Break-begin detected.
    o	Break-end detected.

	Desirable enhancements:
    o	Generate N units of output Break.
    o	Detected N units of input Break.
    o	Echo-control.
    o	Parity-control.

	In addition, it will be desirable to define the Async environment
such that the full set of RS232 signals can be individually manipulated.
The individual pin can be accessible without sharing the pin among different
applications like the existing implementation.  This is especially useful
in the applications where software flow-control is not possible and hardware
handshaking is required to secure the traffic without losing data.

	It would also be desirable if the new Driver-protocol imposed no
hardware-dependent constraints, such as a need to explicitly write control-
registers;  such constraints already are proving awkward in the migration
from SIO to SCC-chips.

Subject: McAuto and ROUTER 

I found a bad ROUTER.DAT in (MAIL:36) and noticed that it is a modification
of an old copy from TUMSPROD.  This brings me to the following comments:

(TUMSDEV) is always newer code than (TUMSPROD).  All changes should be made
to TUMSDEV and eventually, after QA and after the older versions are archived,
copied to TUMSPROD.  When releasing a new version of something like McAuto
or ROUTER, it should be done in TUMSDEV.  Currently, there is no way to
designate which systems are running versions from TUMSDEV (field test code)
as opposed to code from TUMSPROD (production code).  At the moment, 39 is
running TUMSDEV, and so is 36.

We need a procedure to keep track of what versions are on what systems so
that there is no accidental regression as happened today.  Suggestions?

------

To remidy the situation, I merged the changes to (TUMSDEV)ROUTER and
(TUMSPROD)ROUTER and put them in both directories.  I also copied it
to (MAIL:36) and (MAIL:39).  I did the same for MCAUTO.  I think this
will solve the immediate problem.

SUBJECT: Notice to PDP Customers
With the Service Billing migration to St. Louis nearing completion, modif-
ications are becoming final. One of the mods is the change of length to the
user name field. Our thoughts in order to reach all PDP users is to send a
message upon 'sign on' or other applicable way that you may recommend. The
following message is requested to be sent:

"As part of the consolidation process wherein McDonnell Douglas Information
Services Group is integrating the former Tymshare data processing with those
services previously provided by McAuto and, at the same time, introducing a
degree of commonality between processing on IBM equipment and Digital Equip-
ment PDP 10s, it has become necessary to standardize the user name field size
at eight characters. A few customers currently have user names which exceed
this parameter. Please review your files and, if any user names in excess of
eight bytes are in existence, modify them to the extent necessary to reduce
them to eight or less. Effective 1 November 1986, both invoicing reports and
machine readable detail accounting information will reflect only eight
positions in this field. MDISG appreciates your cooperation in this endeavor
and regrets any inconvenience it may cause."

The above message has been agreed to by Joe Godwin, director of Customer
Billing and Forest Moore, director of Remote Computing Services. If you have
any questions or concerns please contact me as soon as possible. We would like
to have this to the customers by the end of August at he latest.

Bill, have you seen this message?

  Seems that someone needs to tell "them" that it isn't just the PDP-10
  customers that will be affected.  This affects all of TYMNET usernames
  in the MUD.  (Of course we "can" go through and weed out usernames that
  are non-unique to 8 letters, but that's a ridiculous waste of time; for
  a group of companies (ISG) not making a lot of money, this kind of
  "busy-work" is very wasteful of resources.)  Comments?

I had to get into an old message that had been archived, so I "openned" the
file, fine.  I found the message I wanted and tried to read it, got an
error. I hit return and part of the message printed out then seemed to abort.
I closed the file and exited.  It started with the "expunging message" but
gave no numbers (it would attempt to expunge to the file I had just closed).
I deleted the tix file, got back into TUMS and reopenned--about 1/3 or 
the messages were gone.  Closed the file again, exited TUMS, looked at the
file via peak--sure enough, gone.  Que pasa?

Subject: SUP date/time and PDP-10 

We just had an incident where system 36 had its date and time set to
21-Nov-1988 when SUP 124 took over.  The PDP-10 has added new code to
the monitor to update its clock whenever the sup reports a new date
and time.  As a result, TUMS returned all unread mail saying...
    "User xxxx has not read mail in 821 days."
Oh well.  I suggest the PDP-10 not accept a date that differs from its
current date and time by more than 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, somebody
should fix SUP 124 and think about a way to insure that BUBBNET date
and time are more accurate in the future now that people are actually
relying on it for relatively critical things.

This brings me to a question: where does the base get the year?  All
the sup seems to know about is the ordinal day of year.  If it really
knows the year, maybe it should be shown in the TIME command?

Subject: eliminating .mcauto 

Bill,
   Ken wants to definitely get rid of the need to specify .mcauto in the
domain address.  This is because some arpa hosts don't have room for an
entire domain address to get a message to PROFS through TUMS.  They
would have room if the .mcauto weren't required.  
   Aside from implementing domain.dat, there is an easy (and somewhat
kludgy) way we could do this.  We would add entries in router.dat for 
slvmcl1, slvm307, etc. which invoke a program that merges these queue
files with mcauto.q.  The mcauto program itself would need a change 
saying: if the recipient host is not mcauto, move it to the recipient
subhost and make the host mcauto.  This would allow the existing
addressing to work also.
   This could be coded up and distributed very quickly.  Ken considers
this address shortening requirement very high priority.  Do you want
to implement domain.dat right away?  Or should I put in this ad hoc
solution for a while?  Or can you think of another way to save 7 bytes
on the address
   m211391%slvmcl1.mcauto.tymnet@office-1.arpa   ?
(eliminating the .arpa is already being done; we need 7 bytes after this.)
RSVP ASAP,
Ron

I'm taking the day off to work on my roof.  I'll get back to you early next
week.  Briefly, though, since you are running AT&T 5.2 as opposed to
Berkeley 4.2 or 4.3, you may have trouble getting the host to talk SMTP
which is the prefered interface protocol to TUMS.  On the other hand, it
is also possible to interface it indirectly using a UUCP protocol to one
of our Berkeley 4.3 hosts.  This is the "native" Unix mail transfer
protocol.  You may check with your system support person about having the
host setup as a "UUCP mail neighbor" to "tymix".  One important question
is weather or not your system has the ability to build Tymnet circuits?


PS - mailed another TUMS manual yesterday afternoon

Asking about saving the profile is a good idea, I'll put it on the list.
As for running TUMS more than once (simultaneously), this is a no-no.  I
need to put in some code to check for it and prevent it, but I haven't
gotten to it and sometimes it happens by accident.  The problem is that
the attempt to concurrently update tums.tix results in chaos and ultimately
the "phase error".  If the phase error persists, you have to delete the
TUMS.TIX file and let tums rebuild it.  This has some unpleasant side
effects, like all your old messages appear unread and undeleted.  -Bill

This Ontyme is setup for ECONET.  If the user really wants to use TUMS, he
will have to request the powers that be (ACS, I think) to have his startup
exec turned off so I can get into normal command level.  If there is special
code running on that machine, I may be unable to talk to it even then.

A second point of concern is that TUMS polls every hour, 720 times per month.
This could be very expensive for a paying customer.  -Bill

It has come to my attention that TUMS makes 28,800 logins to EMSNTD each

Secondly, how is interontyme comming?  Is there any progress being made?
If not, maybe we can reach a compromise with them in view of the above.

Subject: Hertz blacklist/file overflow 

Per Brian Dickerson of Hertz, he would like the following procedure
followed for the Hertz blacklist file, until they and we can work out a
long-term solution to the file overflow problem:

If records (up to 30) overflow from the file, go ahead and put it
on-line anyway, and send Brian Dickerson a Xerox of the fileload
hardcopy so that he will know which records are not on-line.

Please start with the tape we received last Friday.  Should you have any
questions, please contact me.  Thank you.

We were going back and forth rather freely between Eclipse I and Eclipse

liable to show gaps.  Please compare them....in most cases, a gap in one

Subject: 168 live test/Irvine capacity & other info 

After node 2525 was loaded this morning, I loaded 168 from
(luskerj:65)nw2525.n01 for Irvine capacity project.  Barring major
difficulties, we will run on this code through the weekend.

If you should have occasion to load the node or that slot, please inform
me via Irvine opertions (714)851-9660 first, as the DG host and front
ends are running the capacity software, which is incompatible with the
postech version of 168.

322, 1195 & 1826 are running their normal code.  During next week,
we will at various times bring up the capacity versions of 1826 and/or
1195.  I will check my ontyme & tums several times a day, and will
announce the loads as far in advance as possible.

FTS 168 was reloaded at 22:33 by someone with a version of the code not
compatible with the Irvine capacity software running on the DG host that
it talks to.  I don't know who loaded it or why.

I shall load 168 from (luskerj:65)nw2525.n01 shortly.  Barring major
difficulties, I'd like to continue running on it.

If you should have occasion to load node 2525 or its slot 1 (FTS168),
please inform me via Irvine opertions (714)851-9660 first, as the DG
host and front ends are running the capacity software, which is
incompatible with the postech version of 168.

Subject: 168 reload tonight 

Sometime tonight, probably on 3rd shift, Ken Anderson will be reloading
several switches for Telecredit routing, including 1195, 1826 and 168.

1195 & 1826 are currently running code that supports the non-capacity OP
& CPA.  When they are reloaded, they should still be compatible.

168 is currently running code that supports opx/cpx.  Then it is
reloaded, they should still be compatible (you might want to switch to
the hot backup whie 168 is being loaded).

If there are any problems with this, please page me.  Thanks, SET

Subject: CONFIGURATION FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND 

BECAUSE OF HARDWARE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE PERSISTED SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY
(I.E., CP2A WILL NOT TALK TO EII AND HIFTPC2 LINE E CANNOT BE PATCHED
ACROSS TO ANY OTHER FRONT END THAN CP3A), PLEASE OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING:

1.  PUT EI/EI (GREEN PACK) ON-LINE ON ECLIPSE II, WHICH WILL NORMALLY BE
RUNNING WITH CP1A AND CP1C.  THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO START CCBS AND DO
MANUAL EII ACTIVITY ON ECLIPSE II WHILE CONTINUING TO RUN ON THE 3
ECLIPSE CONFIGURATION.  I HAVE MADE DIAGRAMS OF NORMAL RUNNING
CONFIGURATION, SWAPPING PACKS ON EACH OF THE ECLIPSES AND SENDING AMEX
CANS FROM ECLIPSE I (VIA CP2A).

2.  THE DIAGRAM FOR THE "NORMAL" CONFIGURATION IS THE CONFIGURATION IN
WHICH I WILL LEAVE THINGS WHEN I LEAVE TONIGHT.  IT IS FAIRLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD FOR CHANGING TO THE VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS FOR SWAPPING
PACKS AND SENDING AMEX CANS (PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SEND THEM IN THE
CONFIGURATION SHOWN).

3.  IF YOU HAVE ON-LINE PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONFIGURATIONS
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND, PLEASE PAGE ME.  THANK YOU.

No bug actually.  Just wondering if there is a better manual online
somewhere for Tums?  The only thing I can find is TUMS.DOC which doesn't say 
much.  Thanks,

Bill, I would like very much to talk with you regaring moving NTD to EMSBUB
and all the associated info that goes along with that.  I am out the rest of the week
but would like to set something up soon.  Perhaps tuesday so Susie
could attend (ontyme is her project).  What is your schedule like?  I'll 
be checking my mail, so go ahead & send a TUMS.  Thanks for all your help
so far, and in advance for your help to come!!!!

BILL, 

GOT A CALL EARLIER TO DAY FROM MIKE IN OPERATIONS (SHIFT SUP) COMPLAINING
ABOUT GETTING UNUSUAL ERROR MESSAGES WHEN SENDING MAIL ON 39.

WHEN TRYING TO SEND MAIL HE GOT:

?TUMS:ERROR LOGBSY IN MODULE SMTPX, MESSAGE IS LOG BUSY FOR 5 MIN.

HE ALSO GOT THE SAME ERROR MESSAGE REFERING TO MODULES TMS AND MCAUTO.
I TESTING SENDING MAIL TO A USER ON 39 WITHOUT A PROBLEM, BUT I WAS SURPRISED
TO SEE MY MAIL INCLUDED IN MY TUMS MESSAGES.  IS THIS A NEW OPTION OF TUMS???
IS TUMS PERHAPS OVER EXTENDING ITSELF????  

JUST THOUGHT I WOULD PASS THIS ON TO YOU.  OH, MIKE IN OPERATIONS DOESN't USE
TUMS.  (JUST THOUGHT I'D THROW THAT IN THERE.)

Cliff,
At least for now, you can use the username
    MAIL
for tickling the TUMS<->PROFS program.  The password is
    I SPELL RELIEF TUMS
(embedded blanks are literal).
The program is set up right now so it will take your protocol as
we discussed on the phone:

	220 C57.Tymnet service ready
	POLL SLVMCL1
	250 okay
	QUIT
	221 C57.Tymnet closing transmission channel

The numbered lines are responses sent to you.
There may be several lines of garbage (message of the day, etc.) that
precedes the 220 message.
Remember, please send both CR and LF.
The QUIT is optional, you may just zap the circuit if you wish.
Consider any response other than "250 okay" an error.
The interface will not echo.

I have not setup the program to actually respond to the tickle, yet,
so it will still maintain a constant circuit to TUMSGATE.  I will
probably change that after I hear from you that you think your program
is working, since after I change it at my end, it could impact message
reliability if all the bugs aren't out.

There is no harm in sending as many "tickles" as you want while you are
testing.  They're just logged and ignored for now.

Let me know how it goes.
Thanks for your help.
-Bill

Subject: SMI interface macros 

Here is some documentation on the macros needed to make use of the consolidated
monitor (as well as a copy of pscsmi.id, where many of these macros are used).

The intent here is to make it as easy as possible to maintain and add new
log messages, without much programming required.  Note the the bulk of the
macro's are used to describe the log message.  This should be much better
than having to define a proceedure to display every new type of log message.

The reason for including the pscsmi.id file here is simply because not everyone
has access to 65 and because is serves as a real example...that relates
directly to the PMTSMONITOR displays.

One thought is that, with frequent updates to the number of possible log
messages, MMI might send the table of log message descriptions directly to
the various monitoring systems.











                  Slot/Monitor Interface (SMI) Macros

     The purpose of this document is to define the parameters of the macros
used to interface with the SMI.  The macros needed are as follows:

     SMI.ID - Describes a log message and assigns a unique number to identify
	      the log message
     SMI.XS - Defines a hex string subfield
     SMI.GT - Defines a GMT subfield
     SMIGEN - Generates the SMI header for a given module
     SMIRPT - Generates the code to report a series of values to the
              monitor (via the SMI)
     SMILOG - Generates the code to log a unique event (e.g. restart)
              to the monitor.

     The SMI.ID macro will be used in the file, PSCSMI.ID, that is included in
the compilation of all FTSs that employ the SMI. This macro generates no code
in a switch, but only serves to generate a series of equates.  In the MMI, this
macro generates a description of the log message which drives the terminal
display logic.  The macro calls are of the form:

     SMI.ID(idname,value,desc,(type1,type2,type3,...))
          where  "idname"  is a unique name used within the slot to
                           generate messages with the assigned id value.
                 "value"   must be a unique variable/log identifier across
                           the entire network.  If value is not specified, it
                           will default to one more than the value assigned
                           to the previous idname (in the last call to
                           SMI.ID).
		 "desc"    is a brief description of the variable or log
			   message.  This description is displayed by the
			   diagnostic monitor when a data message with the
			   given identifier is received.
		 "type1", "type2", etc. define the type of subfields that
			   comprise the log message.

     Macros SMI.XS and SMI.GT are used to define the type descriptors that
are referenced in the parameter lists of SMI.ID.  MMI uses these subfield
type descriptors for the terminal display of the data sent from the switches
being monitored.  The macro calls are of the form:

     SMI.XS(type,length,desc)
	and
     SMI.GT(type,desc)
	where	 "type"    is the type name used by SMI.ID.
		 "length"  is the number of bytes in the subfield to be
			   displayed.  (SMI.GT always takes a subfield 4 bytes
			   long.)
		 "desc"    is a brief description of the subfield.


     The remaining macros (SMIGEN, SMIRPT and SMILOG) are used in the
body of the module that is making use of SMI.  It is these macros that generate
the code needed to interface with SMI.

     SMIGEN must be the first of the three remaining macros to be called.  The
parameter is just a 10-character module name (e.g. SMIGEN(PSCAUT.A00)).  This
macro call will serve to identify the module for subsequent calls to SMIRPT and
SMILOG.  (Each module in a given slot is assigned a number that is used for all
messages to and from the monitor.)

     SMILOG is used to generate the code to send to the monitor a data
message that contains no data.  The format is simply SMILOG(idname).  Only
the value assigned to idname (by SMI.ID) is passed in the data message
(with, of course, the module number and report number).  SMILOG has limited
use in signaling the occurance of unique events. 

     SMIRPT is used to send data messages that contain data.  The format of
the call is:

     SMIRPT(idname,(a1,l1),(a2,l2),(a3,l3),...)

Each pair of parameters is an address and length, which together define
a data area to be included in the message.

Double lines are a real problem.  The best solution is to set
	TTY WIDTH 80
	TTY CRLF
and then tell your terminal to mind its own business (if its an HP-2621,
that's done by setting Strap "c" to off (miniscule)).  If only just one
terminal manufacturer would get it right, it would truely be refreshing.
Every terminal I've ever seen goes to newline after receiving the 80th
character on a line.  It should in stead do so before receiving the 81st.
The major difference, of course, being that there may not be an 81st.
*SIGH*  -Bill

Bill,

We should get together and go over the SWB document that Gazel gave me to
review.  There are many specific scenarios that I am not clear on.

I will be available tomorrow afternoon and all day Thursday; just TUMS me
when a good time for you is.

I'm sorry for the problems you've been having with TUMS.  Appearently, not
all the files from the new release were properly installed on 62 and 930.
Some of the old programs still existed and caused an incompatibility.  I have
corrected the problem, so let me know if there are any further difficulties.

Subject: gateway 

This is too early to be sure, but I think tums is causing the out of
ports problem (actually triggering the problem).  It seems the gateway
doesn't handle all Yellow balls while in login mode.  I have ring
traces of MAIL:1088 trying to login then sending a YB.  unfortunately
I only have the into gateway ISIS ring, I wonder if you have some log
of these logons (tuesday 1/13 from 3pm to 7pm).  The logon failure reason
is of great interest.  That should allow for duplication of this persistent
problem.

The TUMS log shows mostly "host down" responses.  The target 1088 is on
a micro-node (PDP-11) base, so its network protocol may be strange.  In
a couple of cases, the circuit to the gateway was simply zapped with no
message being output.  I hope this helps.  Holler if you need more.  -Bill

                         An NTN can  be associated with multiple  ports in

                         within  a  LATA  to  prevent  OADR administrative
                         problems and confusion.

                         intended to be part of phase I,  but conceptually
                         poses  no  problems for  integration  to  the new
                         logon  session format  (LOGII).  Once  the BISYNC

                         The  X.25  interface currently  inserts  a called
                         address for  PVC calls that  do not  specify one.

                         addresses and  clear the  call if  necessary, but
                         ultimately, if the address is not present  in the
                         MUD, it is de facto an invalid format.   The X.25

Bill,

  There is no mailer on host D25.  It looks like it never made it, or someone
deliberately removed all current object code files.  There are a total of 29
files in (MAIL), including a set of "<program name>.OLD" files, but (until I
Telecopied in a copy of RDMAIL.SAV) there were NO <program name>.[SAV|HGH|SHR]
files in MAIL.  Since the Job Processor system uses TUMS mail, it is needed on
all the old Tymshare Tymcom-X hosts.  Any questions, please call or TUMS me.

this is sort of a bug.  If I do a 'show alias mark' it did not show alias
MARK (for mark akselrod).  When I do a show alias MARK then it did show
alias MARK.  It seemed to care about the uppercase vs lowercase of the
alias, but it does not care about the case of the address.

Subject: TUMS on TRWNET. 

The people at TRW are interested in TUMS running on their 2020.
1) Do you want TUMS on a non-TYMNET system?
2) Would it be OK for SENDMA/RDMAIL/TUMS to deliver local mail only?
3) Should MAILER running on TRW's 2020 be expected/allowed to build a circuit
   thru the gateway to deliver mail to 930 and 26?  (That is, leaving the
   public-network password to username MAIL exposed.)
4) Could MAILER on 930 pull messages from TRW instead?

Or should I tell them that TUMS is not a product, cannot be supported, and
cannot be provided.

An immediate answer is not necessary - this may involve policy decisions.

Hi Kim, I got your message just fine.  Keep this address handy as its the
fastest way to get ahold of me (unless of course the interface is down).
In that case, you'd need to call.  Let the receptionist know that its

Bill,

Something occurred to me recently which may help provide more efficient
Tums service.  If Tums is logging into each Ontyme username , retrieving
messages, and logging out, it could be much faster if it used the Ontyme 
'imi' command to 'imitate' a user.  This way there would be a single
logon per Tums retrieval session.  Tums would need access to a username 
with account supervisor status, but I doubt if that's a problem.

If Tums already works this way, just ignore this message.

Always trying to think of better ways...

Elliot

Greetings from all in the UNIX class.  Les says "hi".
Boy, this sure looks like TUMS.

Subject: Rodney comments 


Betty Jo, here is my set of comments on Rodney.
        - John Burke.
 
 
4. FILE SYSTEM
 
 
    Lock: a timeout value must be spec'd. Violators should be prosecuted.
 
    Appends:
 
      o Somewhere it was said that a caller will do a two-step operation
        to do an append: first, allocate the page, and, second, write.
        I see no reason why a board should have to call the File System
        to reserve a block before the board is ready to write it.
 
      o Three blocks must physically written every time you do a block
        append: home (advance the Free pointer), the old Last, and the new
        block.  You can't get around writing the Home; but the last and
        the new could be written in one operation.  And if the append
        function can accept several extension blocks, then it need write
        the Home only once.
 
        If the append function says "write k blocks starting at last -n",
        then it's nice and straightforward to the calling board, and the
        service can get the above advantages.
 
        Order of write and disk consistency: the following order works
        okay for "Rewrite the last plus n more blocks":
 
         1. Lock
 
         2. Read Home and n-1 acquired blocks, to get links.
 
         2. Write new Home pointing beyond the acquired free blocks.
 
         3. Write the old Last.
 
         4. Write all the acquired blocks, using the remembered links.
 
         5. Unlock.
 
        More robust 3rd and 4th steps avoid ever having the file chain
        point to the free list:
 
         3. Write the last acquired block (break the chain on disk.)
 
         4. Write the old Last [and the other n-1 acquired blocks].
 
        The Disk Clean should recognize that one block or chain might point
        into the Free List, should log this event and just cut that link.
        More than one of these, though, would be pathological.
 
 
    Multi-block functions:
 
      o If read and write calls are set up so you can accept/present
        several blocks at once, then the File System has a potential to
        serve long reads and writes quickly and the callers can move
        large hunks with greater ease.
 
        If the File Server abandons the function in the middle, it must
        indicate where it stops.
 
    All calls to the server should return a Device Unavailable status if
    the server isn't talking.
 
 
    Overlapped Operations: boards must be able to initiate a read or write,
    go off to process and check later, especially for log writes, which are
    a regular event.  The document should express this somehow.
 
 
    Important functionalities which I think we need in a lowest-level
    service:
 
      o Read Errors: Data should be retrievable when there is a read error.
 
      o Writes: a failure status should be returned; esp. Volume Full.
 
      o Server should tell calling boards what its blocksize is (in Open,
        I guess).
 
    We should state function and parameters for these operations:
 
      o File Delete.
 
      o Delink front blocks off of the file.
 
      o Create the FEFS Volume.
 
 
    Utilities:
 
      o Clean: should not discard pages when links conflict; save the bad
        chains under special filenames.
 
      o Copy:
 
 
5. LOADING
 
 
  o Device names for CPU's: I think we must allow that a CPU lower on the
    bus can have a higher number, in the case where the lower CPU does not
    come up till later.
 
    Also, two processors must have different hard names if they have ANY
    difference which means they can't execute each others' code, thus
    different names for different size memory.  And look how much variation
    we can want in memory size.  Using actual memory size in the name
    doesn't sound reasonable to me.  Maybe they should have thumbwheels to
    set names, so the installer can hand-set them as "CPUA", CPUB", etc.
 
    Maybe all boards should have several extra thumbwheels or dip switches
    so we can be well covered for unanticipated stuff like this.
 
  o Crash on bad message?????  We have to tolerate new messages;
    especially in ROM code.  This would give us a method of telling new
    boards from old ones by their response.
 
 
7. IPCF
 
  o Nack: a generic NAK should be defined, so that any processor can
    always reply "I don't know WHAT you're talking about".  The
    processor which receives an unexpected message must not be
    responsible for it.  The sending process must deal with the situation
    (maybe we got restarted out from under him); if it is misbehaving
    we must rely on the judicial process.
 
 
9. BACKUP
 
    State the scope of the Judicial System.  I would think it is
    available to all components which use inter-system processes,
    whenever they discover non-response to any basic process.  Though
    the processor's heart beats, it might be a vegetable.

        Product Name:    Tymnet-2 Node Code  
        Code Version:   05.10        DATE:02/25/87
        Release Document:     (BASELINE)TII05.X10 
        Release Description:  (BASELINE)NONE 
        Documentation Change: (BASELINE)TII05.W50
        Modified Files:       (SOURCE)

        Test Site Location(s):  NONE    
     
        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
.    
        The PATCH FILE, (SOURCE)TII05.P10, contains the following changes: 
.    
        (1)  Patch to fix HDLC micro-engine SIO line initialization
                problem has been revised.  SIO lines which fail to   
                complete initialization within 20 ms. are flagged    
                for another initialization attempt 2 secs. later.    
                Crypto message 72: SIO PORT UNAVAILABLE - LINE= line#,    
                is issued after the first attempt only.    
.    
             Additionally, this patch no longer treats TSI machines
                as HDLC micros.  Rather, TSI machines are treated as 
                regular engines except that 20 ms. are allowed for   
                initialization to complete. 
.    
             This patch does not affect regular engines. 
.    
        (2)  Patch to display 5-digit neighbors has been cosmetically   
                altered for patch file consistency.  However,   
                functionality remains unchanged. 
.    
        (3)  Patch to fix reset problems on multi-line links has been   
                corrected.   
.    
        (4)  Patch to allow version 5.10 nodes to handle Rebuild from   
                future version 6.00 neighbors has been added.   
        ================================================================   
     
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        It is now available on c36 and c39 and will be available on   
        systems 22, 23, 25, 26, 31, 33, 37, 54, 57, 65, & 70
        within 24 hours of release by Marketing Q.A. to that system.  
     
        Testing  should  be coordinated with  JIM LADEN

Subject: TUMS-10 bug report (v44000017 of 18-DEC-86) 

Bill,
I seem to be having some problems with tums.  I opened an archive file
to try to clean out unwanted messages.  Everyother message was just "To:"
and nothing else.  After issuing several "del noarc ..."  I did an
"expunge" .  The result was it started to expunge many of the messages
then came up with an error message and exited tums.  I had a file of 
over 400 messages of which 200 were blanks.  I had gone through approximately
the first 250 probably deleting about 230 of those.  When I looked at
what the exit left me there was only about 5 messages on the archive file
and the same on the tix.

This is one way of cleaning up my old archive files but not exactly what I
had in mind.

Let me know if I followed a bad procedure or whatever.

Thank you,
Diana

 P.S. I just remembered one other thing - in the middle of issuing the
"del noarc ..." commands I , by mistake issued a "del.. " command then
followed it with a "del noarc..." command with the same message numbers
because I relized my error - could this foul things up?
