After a considerable delay, caused mainly by my running out of time before
running out of town for 6 weeks, I finally found a little time to get
the statistics on the Ride of the Warhorses together at last. After some
fooling around with editing everything into a consistent format, then
sorting and awking the mess, here's what popped out:

In all of the listings below, #CIT stands for the number of times a
warhorse poll participant cited a particular work or composer, and WPs
stands for the number of Warhorse Points a particular work or composer
was credited with (remember that WPs were awarded 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1
for the first 10 places, and 1 for every lower occurrence).

First, I took a look at the composers. The winner here wasn't too
much of a shock; whether you sliced it by number of citations or by
WPs, Ludwig van Beethoven came out well ahead, with close to 2 1/2
times as many citations and points as the runner-up, Pyotr Ilyich
Tchaikovsky. The rest of Classics' Top Ten composers appears below.

Now, it's time for the Big One: Your Classical Hit Parade's All-Time
Warhorse Winner is:

(surprise, surprise) Beethoven's Symphony #5 in C Minor!

And here's the rest of Your Classical Hit Parade:

Nothing much changes here if you add them up by number of citations,
instead. It's still the same ten, just in a slightly different order.

Special Johnny One-Tune awards are due to the following composers, all
of whom received multiple nominations, all for the same work:

Georges Bizet ('Carmen') (although some selected particular arias)
Aaron Copland ("Fanfare for the Common Man")
Antonin Dvorak (Symphony #9)
Felix Mendelssohn (Wedding March from 'A Midsummer Night's Dream')
M. Mouret (Rondeau from 'Sinfonies de Fanfares' [="Masterpiece Theatre"])
Modest Moussorgsky ("Pictures at an Exhibition")
M. Pachelbel (Canon in D)
Henry Purcell (Trumpet Voluntary)
Johann Strauss ("The Blue Danube")
Richard Strauss ("Also Sprach Zarathustra")
Antonio Vivaldi ("The Four Seasons")

Special Blanket Citations also go from various Warhorse voters to
John Philip Sousa ("for everything he wrote") and the Boston Pops
("for everything they have ever played").

I still have all the lists, plus most of the commentary. I also have
complete lists sorted by composer and work, as well as the continuations
of the lists above, which I will be happy to send to anybody interested
in seeing them. I hope you will have as much fun with these results as
I did collecting them (quite a bit!). Thanks to the correspondents
who supplied picks for me:

A subsequent message will contain the current, up-to-date list of all
works receiving at least one warhorse citation. People interested in
helping extend the list are welcome to send on any omissions.

These are my impressions, both positive and negative, of several
CD issues I've been able to listen to carefully.

* Mahler: Symphony No. 2.  Of the three I've heard (Solti/Chicago,
	Tennstedt/LPO, Maazel/VPO) I would recommend the Tennstedt.
	Solti's suffers from an alto soloist in the important
	"Urlicht" movement whose singing I found shockingly bad
	for a major label production.  I found Maazel's shaping and
	pacing of the work inferior, in addition to which the
	CBS recorded sound was significantly more congested.  My
	first preference remains the (so-far) analogue-only 
	release of the Abbado/Chicago Symphony recording on DGG.

* Wagner: Siegfried.  Again, I've heard three (Solti, Boehm and
	Janowski).  The Solti and Boehm derive from analogue tapes,
	the Solti a 1962 studio production and the Boehm a 1966
	live Bayreuth recording.  In almost every regard I
	would rank the Solti first, even, despite its age, the
	recorded sound.  The singing is consistently superior
	(even compared with the same Siegfried and Brunnhilde on
	the Boehm set) to the others; Solti's conducting has
	great animation, power, and allows climactic passages
	greater weight than either Boehm or Janowski; and the
	playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is superior to the
	excellent playing of the Bayreuth Orchestra (Boehm) and
	Dresden Staatskapelle (Janowski).

* Verdi: Macbeth.  Sinopoli's DGG set is powerfully sung, played
	and conducted, and makes an impressive statement of the
	work.  I find it hard to choose, in the grounds of 
	performance, between this and the 1976 Abbado/La Scala
	(analogue) recording.

* Mozart: The Magic Flute.  I haven't heard the Haitink on
	CD, but have heard the Karajan (DGG), Levine (RCA)
	and Davis (Philips) in the new format.  This makes for 
	a difficult choice.  I find Davis' the most beautifully 
	shaped and played, the Levine most dramatic.  There were 
	various sections in which I found Karajan's tempi either 
	too slow or too fast, and there is dreadful singing by the boy
	soloists performing the three genii, along with 
	superb singing by Edith Mathis (Pamina) and excellent
	singing by Francesco Araiza (Tamino).  Davis also has superb
	singing from his Pamina, Margaret Price, but I find
	Peter Schreier's voice unattractive as Tamino.  Levine's
	has the fullest dialogue and is generally well sung,
	although Cortrubas cannot match the sheer beauty of
	either Price or Mathis.  Pressed for a choice, I'd
	probably go for the Davis (Philips).

I understand that the 1953 (mono) recording of Puccini's "Tosca"
with Callas and Di Stefano is planned for release on CD.  This
is by no means a favorite opera of mine, but the performance is
exceptional, easily worth tolerating aging sound, particularly
if that sound is improved in the process.  Do not confuse this
with the dreadful stereo (1965) remake Callas did, conducted by
Georges Pretre.

More impressions of CD's I've had chance to hear:

	Schubert - Symphony No. 9 (Solti/Vienna Philharmonic - London)
		Although the performance is, in many ways, a fine 
		one, I can't recommend this.  The sound is of the sort
		that anyone who wants to condemn digital recordings
		could point to - harsh, metallic, shallow and nothing
		like the actual sound I've heard in concert halls and
		on record from the Vienna Philharmonic.

	Stravinsky - Petrouchka (Michael Tilson Thomas/Philharmonia - CBS)
		This was an unusually good vinyl LP, for CBS.  The CD
		differs very little, since my LP copy had negligible
		surface noise.  In either format, it's a superb 
		performance, rhythmically clean and precise, beautifully
		played, and balanced in a way that illuminates the
		individual strands of the music without losing the
		cohesiveness.

	Debussy - Jeux/Nocturnes (Haitink/Concertgebouw - Philips)
		This is from an analogue master.  I preferred the
		sound of the LP (even better is the open-reel
		tape from Barclay-Crocker), which, even after
		multiple playings is remarkably free of surface noise.
		The CD is by no means bad, but fails to reproduce the
		opulence of the Concertgebouw string section (audible
		in live performance, and, therefore, not the product
		of analogue distortions) as well as the LP.
		The performances are excellent.

	Stravinsky - Firebird (Colin Davis/Concertgebouw - Philips)
		Although also derived from an analogue master with
		the same orchestra and hall as the Debussy record,
		this time I preferred the CD.  The LP is superb with
		very silent surfaces and a wide dynamic range, but
		the CD, on a good player, has a slightly greater
		clarity and focus.  This is also an excellent
		performance, but I prefer the austere clarity of
		Stravinsky's own (much less beautifully reproduced)
		recording on CBS.

So far my experiences with CD had been purely of classical music.
I've since had a chance to hear two jazz vocal CD's, both of which
were derived from analogue masters:

	Billie Holiday - Songs for Distingue Lovers.  The LP version
		of this has been out of print for years, only recently
		resurfacing as a French import.  Those who bought the
		British Verve (Polydor) series of 10 LP's which was
		available in the late 70's will have all of the 
		selections on this album split between Vol. 8 and 
		Vol. 9.  The CD is no better than the superbly
		silent British Verve LP pressing, which gave much
		more for the money, containing significantly more
		selections per LP.  The selections on this album
		are also all contained on an American Verve 2-record
		set reissue which I haven't heard, the 2-record set 
		being considerably less expensive than this single CD.
		These selections were recorded in 1957 in genuine
		stereo and the sound is very clean, closely miked
		(as with the stereo Ella Fitzgerald recordings also
		made by Verve at the time) but free of the blasting
		and distortion that marred many early stereo Columbia
		pop/jazz recordings.  By 1957 Holiday was a physical
		wreck and the voice is frail, tremulous, and very
		limited in useable range.  I found this, however,
		much more listenable than the later recordings made
		with a large orchestra under Ray Ellis ("Lady in
		Satin" for Columbia, and an album simply titled
		"Billie Holiday" originally on MGM), since the
		superb, small group backing her allowed her a
		lightness and relaxation that the heavy Ellis scorings
		didn't.  Those who like Billie Holiday in her later
		recordings will, like those who like the later
		operatic recordings of Maria Callas, have learned to
		listen through the ravages of the actual instrument
		to the still-active musical imagination and flashes
		of insight into the lyrics.  Those who know Holiday
		only by name should be warned that this is definitely
		NOT the voice that originally established her
		reputation.

	Sarah Vaughan - Sassy Swings Again.  In this case the CD
		is a marked improvement over previous LP transfers.
		Vaughan is in good voice (when isn't she?) and
		more relaxed and "herself" than in many of the
		other Mercury recordings made at the same time.

The conclusion I'm gradually reaching is that, where the master
recording is digital, the CD is likely to be preferable to the
vinyl LP.  Where the master recording is analogue, the situation
ch more variable and seems mostly dependent on the quality
of mastering and pressing done on the original LP issue.  A
first-rate mastering/pressing job, as used to be done by Philips
through the 70's, will often sound as good as, or better than,
the CD issue.  The rarity of such quality, however, in the mastering and
pressing of domestic LP's, and the deterioration in the last several
years in the quality of many European LP's indicates a preference 
for the CD.
