While true if refering to Jewish or Moslem circumcision, the origins of male
cirumcision in USA are not religious and some history is instructive.
Believe it or not, circumcision was introduced in USA in the 1870's by the
medical profession to curb the practice of masturbation. At that time the US
medical profession considered masturbation to be one of the leading causes
of insanity. The practice of routine circumcision of males to prevent
insanity caught on gradually in USA, Great Britain, Canada and Australia,
but almost nowhere else.  

Not only was the medical profession mistaken in believing that masturbation
causes insanity, they were also mistaken in believing that circumcision
makes masturbation impossible.  The belief was that the exposed glans would
be so painfully sensitive to the direct touch that masturbation would be
impossible. They ignored the possiblity of the glans getting desensitized on
exposure, or of the use of artificial lubrication to reduce the friction. It
should be pointed out that circumcision was also advocated for girls, but
only if caught masturbating. In the few cases where circumcision was found
not to be effective in curbing masturbation (ie parents caught Junior at it
again), doctors did not hesitate to take more drastic steps : In the case of
girls this ussually involved cliteridectomy, while in the case of boys
blistering of parts of the penis, surgical clamps and sutures on the glans
which made any erection very painful, and in some cases amputation of the
penis was tried. (As an aside I sometimes wonder what kind of family life
Americans had 100 years ago with parents spying on their children in order
to find evidence indicating the need for mutilating surgery !).

By the turn of the century European psychiatrists of Freud's school managed
to convince the English speaking medical world that insanity was not an
incurable disease, so the more barbaric forms of multilation mentioned above
disapeared. However US doctors continued to advocate the more harmless form
of male circumcision since they still felt it was worthwhile in preventing
insanity, even if it was curable. The prevalance of male circumcision
continued to grow in USA as the following statistics indicate :

Year		Estimated Circumcision Frequency

1870		5
1880		10
1890		15
1900		25
1910		35
1920		50
1930		55
1940		60
1950		70
1960		75
1970		80
1979		85

It was not until the 1930's that the medical profession managed to convince
itself that masturbation was entirely harmless. By then the practice of
circumcision had developed a momentum of its own and the medical profession
hated to admit that they had been performing an entirely unnecessary
operation on millions of people, so they suddenly "discovered" a whole host
of medical reasons to justify this operation.  Most of the medical research
purporting to show the medical benefits of circumcision date from the 1930's
and 40's. This research was accepted with relief and rather uncritically and
so the US medical profession continued advocating routine male circumcision.

Medicine was socialized in Great Britain around 1945 and the Government
ruled that male circumcision was not covered, and would have to be paid for
by the patient. The practice of medical circumcision disapeared almost
overnight from Britain, but continued to grow in USA, Canada and Australia.

In the 1960's and 70's more careful research failed to validate earlier
results of the medical benefits of circumcision, but most of the medical
profession in USA wasn't paying any attention. The exception were
Pediatricians who had to handle the complications resulting from this
operation that is usually done by the Gynocologist delivering the baby.
Their national association passed a resolution in 1975 calling for an end to
routine male circumcision. But they failed to change the stand of the
American Medical Association (AMA), largely because of opposition from the
Gynocologists. 

However the AMA finally changed its position in 1985, so that the official
position of the AMA today is that there is no medical reason for routine
circumcision.  This decision received no publicity, and parents considering
circumcision were rarely informed by their doctor of the change in the AMA's
position.

The AMA stand finally received a lot of publicity in 1986 when Blue
Cross/Blue Shield decided that they would no longer pay for circumcision,
refering complaining customers to the AMA opinion. The issue was even
debated on TV in the Donaghue(?) show sometime last month.  I didn't see it,
but apparantly Donaghue was trying to play it up as the medical scandal of
the decade, with the medical profession performing an unnecessary (albeit
harmless) operation on close to 100 million people.

One hopes that circumcision will disappear from USA the way it did from
Great Britain in the 1940's, but this is not certain.  Medical insurance
stopped paying for circumcisions in Canada sometime in the 1960's (anyone
know exactly ?) but the circumcision rate has only been dropping slowly at a
rate of about 5% a decade. Unlike in the case of Britain in the 1940's, the
majority of fathers in Canada and USA are already circumcised, and may be
unable to psychologically accept that their circumcision was unnecessary, or
feel embarassed at showing themselves in front of their uncircumcised sons
in the nude.

The latest evidence does not support the claim that circumcision prevents
penile cancer. To start with the incidence of penile cancer in countries
that do not practice circumcision is generally no higher than in USA where
most males are circumcised. The following are the number of new cases per
100 000 male population per year:

USA :		0.8
Sweden :	1.1
Norway :	1.1
Finland:	0.5
Denmark:	0.9
(National Cancer registries;for USA American Cancer Society, May 26,1972).

Most of the evidence purporting to show that circumcision protects against
penile cancer is based on poor studies. The following is one such example :
(Quoted from reference [1] below):  "In 1961, Dr Samuel Licklider reported
on the 131 cases of penile cancer treated at the Memorial Hospital for
Cancer and Allied Diseases in New York City in the 40-year period from 1919
to 1959. The distribution of these 131 cases by religion revealed that 4
were Jews. According to Dr. Licklider, this table demonstrated the  low
incidence of penile cancer among Jews. The reason given was circumcision.
[However the] circumcision status was not determined for any of the 131
cases." The frequency of circumcision amongst non-jews in USA in 1960 was
around 75%, but this fact was totally ignored in the study !

Note that the total deaths from penile cancer in USA in 1977 was 225,
compared to 540 deaths due to cancer of the clitoris & labia. (American
Cancer Society, July 27, 1977). The ratio between male and female genital
cancer is similar in countries that do not practice male circumcision. In
Sweden the number of deaths in 1968 were 43 due to penile cancer and 121 due
to cancer of the clitoris & labia (The Cancer Registry, Sweden, 1971).
Anyone claiming that circumcision prevents penile cancer is going to have to
explain why the same does not apply to cancer of the clitoris & labia.

Craigs reference to the rate of penile cancer China is illustrative of the
way annecdotal evidence gets promoted to the status of accepted fact.  This
statistic is referenced in numererous medical papers, but the source given
is usually another medical papar which in turn gives yet another medical
paper as its source. 

Actually anyone quoting this statistic could have used common sense to rule
out its validity. The Peoples Republic of China does not collect any
statistics on the incidence of penile cancer and until recently foreigners
were excluded from collecting first hand evidence. Moreover the 8% figure is
off by several orders of magniture from any reasonable value. As given above
the anual rate of penile cancer (new cases not deaths) in the USA and Europe
is about 1 per 100000 males.  Given a life expectance of 70 years this works
out to 0.07% of the male population over their lifetime (the cancer is fatal
in only about 1/3 of such cases). This makes the 8% figure for China over
100 times that of USA and Europe !

The reference below did manage to track down the original source of the 8%
statistic to a doctor who got the statistic at an international conference
during the course of a conversation with a doctor from China. The latter
told him that some 8% of the patients in his clinic had penile cancer, and
that none of them were moslem.  If I remember correctly the number of
patients was 28 (certainly less than 100), so not only is the 8% figure
statistically insignificant, but it is terribly skewed because the sample
included only patients of this particular clinic who were there because they
had some chronic disease.

There seems to be an implication that in the absence of running water (or
personal hygeene) circumcision is medically beneficial, which in the absence
of any scientific evidence is highly questionable. One reason for doubt is
that in Europe all men are tought to regularly wash the foreskin, while
women rarely bother to wash the foreskin of the clitoris.  Gynocologists
report that they routinely find significant amounts of Smegma on the
foreskin of women, and the glans of the clitoris is often irritated and
inflamed on acount of this. Yet there has never been any suggestion that
European women are in any additional danger of cancer of the clitoris on
account of this neglect.

In the first place the foreskin is almost never retracted in a normal
uncircumcised male though it will often retract when the penis is erect.
(maybe that's what Craig meant by "growth" :-))

Second Craig is confusing the problem of adherance, in which the foreskin
partly adheres to the glans, with the unrelated problem of phimosis, in
which the foreskin is so tight as to make errection painful. 

Almost all males are born with the foreskin adhering to the skin of the
glans, a condition that normally disappears only with puberty. Contrary
to widespread belief in USA it is a mistake to try to retract the foreskin
of an uncircumcised male before puberty, since this will almost always
result in part of the glans being "skinned", producing a very painful wound.
In fact in male infants that are circumcised, the "skinned" glans is
perhaps more painful than the actual circumcision wound, (particularly since
the wound often gets soaked in urine).

Likewise the foreskin of all males tends to be tight for some time during
puberty when the penis increases in size rather suddenly. Normally frequent
involuntary erections during this period insure that the foreskin stretches
to accomodate the growth of the penis. Even when the foreskin does not
stretch sufficiently it can usually be treated by regulary stretching the
foresking by hand, and only in extreme cases is circumcision required.

Circumcision can be viewed as harmless since none of the NATURAL functions
of the foreskin (protecting the glans, and as a source of pheromes) are
important in today's world.

On the other hand the foreskin clearly enhances the pleasure of
masturbation, since no messy lubricant is ever required to reduce the
intensity of direct contact with the glans. For a circumcised male
masturbation is only a poor substitute for sex, while for an uncircumcised
male, masturbation is a reasonable alternative to sex. I hope I haven't
encouraged some fundamentalist parents to have their son(s) circumcised :-)

What is really barbaric is that this operation is invariably performed on
infants without the benefit of any anaesthesia in USA. The prime motivation
for this practice is to avoid the mortality risk associated with the use of
any anaesthesia. From the doctors point of view it is a simple tradeoff
between the risk of being sued by the parents if the patient dies, and the
non-existent risk of being sued by the patient for pain and suffering he
cannot remember. Question : are other surgical operations in USA likewise
performed on infants without anaesthesia ?

Most doctors in USA seem to believe that the pain of infant circumcision
does no permanant damage. However there is evidence to the contrary. To
check if male and female behaviour is genetically differentiated, the
behaviour of male and female infants under the age of one was tested (in
USA). The surprising result of the research was that even at that age male
and female infants responded in dramatically different ways to external
stimulus.  Female response was characterized by passive curiousity. Male
infants tended to react much more agressively, taking evasive action if
anything got too close. However when European researchers attempted to
repeat the experiments, they found they could not duplicate the results. In
fact they found that both male and female infants behave rather like the
female infants in USA. The conclusion they came to was that the very painful
experience most males in USA are subjected to within days of being born
makes them permanantly more distrustful of the outside world ! The US
medical establishment continues to deny this interpretation, perhaps out of
some kind of guilt complex, similar to the one which prompted it to
uncritically accept research justifying circumcision in the 1940's.
