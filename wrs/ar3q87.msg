/*
 * Pat- Please review before I distribute. -Bill

Naming symbols inside Rodney should follow some agreed upon convention to
make things more consistent and less confusing.  The following is favored
by Pat and myself:

System calls begin with some functional group identifier as a prefix, but
do not have an underscore, for example:
	slgReport, ipcfEnter, symEnter, etc.

Symbols which are internal to a module (and declared static) can be named
as appropriate.  Symbols which are global to Rodney, but not available to
the patron, should be named with a short identifer of the module, followed
by an underscore, for example:
	k_reset, l_crash, s_zap, etc.
The modules would be:
	a_	agent
	b_	boot
	i_	ipcf
	k_	kernel
	l_	logger
	s_	session
	ss_	skysap
One character should be used unless it conflicts or is confusing.  The
first character following the _ is capitalized as if the prefix was not
present, for example:
	int k_scaler;
	struct k_Structure
	#define k_CONSTANT

Things which transcend modules or are frequently used and well known need
not have a module prefix, for example:
	glob, RERR_FOO, etc.

Actually, as of 19-Dec-86, the public net MUD had 98,572 entries.  I also
don't understand why two entries are required per port.

They could use the NCUD1 protocol, perhaps with minor changes.

I think all this means is that we have to present the actual port address
in accounting records regardless of what method was used to address it.
This would be available with the "symbolic address in access profile" project.

There is also an address table necessary in each interface to know which port
to route to on various addresses.  This is probably statically allocated in
the TYM file, but not sure.

Its not clear how this would work since we have not defined the behavoir of
multiple transits, yet.  I think it would only be on the basis of the origin
and destination rather than the neighbor networks.

We need "symbolic address in access profile" for this, I think.

----

I'm confused about NUA/NUI processing, as well.

----

I think this might be able to be done without any customization by careful
planning of the access profiles.  I need to understand NUI/NUA stuff better
to be sure, though.

In general: very nicely done - stated plainly and accurately.  I should have
comments on Omar's response soon.  Probably Wednesday evening.

The process is terminated as if it had returned from its main function, or
some other process did a k_terminate().  In fact, if the PID is NULL, the
PID of the current process is assumed so you don't have to look it up to
kill yourself.

Subject: "Bill, My concern about process"... 

Bill,

My concern about process trees is that if the Session Services have a session
active for SKYSAP and the process within SKYSAP that initiated the session
goes away, I would like to have the processes within the Session Services
go away also.  Actually, a much safer solution would be for the Session
Services to be informed of loss of process and be able to release the other
end of the connection before terminating.  The ability to be imformed if
a board (TSAP) goes away (Connection Oriented mode) already exists, it only
seems fair that the same feature be available for internal processes.
ISIS handles this situation for slots (a zapper is sent to the remote.

If you feel that this is not necessary or is too difficult a feature to
provide that's OK with me, I'm only trying to provide as much protection
and robustness for the Session Services (and Rodney) as possible.

Xerox printing is pretty expensive.  I doubt that would be cost effective.
Also, the tutorials and full reference manuals for such things as SCCS,
lint, make, MM, etc. are not part of the online documentation, that I know
of.  I think $200 a copy is less than we can make it for if you consider
the fully burdened cost and the paper and all.  -Bill

A SKYSAP process should never "disappear" without doing some call to the
session layer to tell it to clean up.  Just killing the process is not
enough, even if you had that feature, because you'll still need to free
malloc'd memory and probably update your data structures.  -Bill

I realize I may simplify and modify the simulated file loading/dumping
in agreement with file server, but is it all I have to think about?

I don't feel comfortable commenting on test plans since I really don't
think I have a good feel for what is needed.  Somebody needs to do something
to simulate a file server for you, either the real one or a fake one.  Then
you should write some scripts to test the basic operations of the boot
under the simulator.  Its difficult for me to say what needs to be written
without being inside the code, and without knowing really what is expected.
Personally I feel that detailed testing is best left until later when more
things are working and we can test on a real machine, but this view is not
sharred by management.  I suggest talking with Pat.  -Bill

and if so, could you modify it? Or who is responsible if you are not?

Subject: FAX and ECONET 
X-VMS-Mail-To: COLLINGSWORTH

Sue Hacking

Dear Sue,
   I tried sending the following through last Monday, only to have 
Tymshare reply that your ECONET address had been deactivated.  I assume 
that it was a temporary accounting problem and that things are now going 
through.  If that turns out to not be true, we'll adopt another plan, 
like the slow, but reliable, post.
    john
---------------------------------------
   We just tried a FAX transmission again on the number you gave, and it
apparently went through, so you should have it in the morning.  Our
local FAX operator says, this time, that it would "take as little as its
being out of paper for it to not respond as a fax machine", so we assume
that was the problem last time. 
  With luck, this will end the saga, and maybe the next time we will be
able to use the ECONET<->ARPANET gateway. 

  FYI, in the event that the fax once again does not go through, the
instructions for responding to this message from ECONET are as follows: 

  1) In preparing your message, make the first line ween "ARPA" 
and "(TUMS)" and nowhere else.
  2) Make the second line blank.
  3) Put in the message as usual
  4) When you are finished and prepare to send the message, use
      TUMS.GATEWAY
at the "ID" prompt rather than a ECONET user name.
  Usually this works and goes through smoothly.  Sorry for the fussy 
process - it isn't our fault and is probably the best that can be 
managed.

Best regards,
  John Klensin

Use

  .S5 "blah blah"
STDDFS is a gross and disgusting kludge written by somebody who didn't
know anything about TROFF and MM and I hope will go away soon.  Actually
it should just be turned into a preference file to setup a "standard"
style as opposed to trying to reinvent things like the heading macro.

If you edit the read only copy, your changes will be lost!!!
To make it writable, do
	sccs edit file.mm
(or whatever)

PROFS: its getting CMS errors and crashing the virtual machine.  I've
turned it back to SL to try and figure out.  Somebody edited the PROFILE
EXEC on 7/3, was that you?  I blamed SL since it was done at 8:08 AM
and I doubt you or I would have been up then (actually 5:08 here).

  I thought I heard you say that the IPCF receiver functions will be

Well, you sure kept it quiet.  I didn't even know Becky was expecting.

You are now part of a very elite group.  Your initiation will include
changing dirty diapers, being awakened nightly at 01:00, 03:00, 05:00 ...
dirty fingerprints on your floppy disks, crayon drawings on your once
clean walls, assembling various toys which require an engineering degree,
giving driving lessons and paying college tuition, just to name a few.

By the time you have six you will be an expert at answering questions
like "Daddy, what's that?" and "Why???" But by then you will have learned
what the joys and rewards of fatherhood are.

Congratulations to both of you .. !!!

Subject: LOGII GED UPDATE 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been updated to as follows:

- Throughput value 1 (cntrl-B) is now indicated as being 160cps rather
than 128cps.  The CIRCUI.DOC indicates 128cps, and Scott Wedel says
the Node Code actually uses 160cps.  Perhaps some documentation updating
is in order.

- The padding of command channel messages to an even number of bytes
has been deemed uneccessary, and has been removed.

- Section 4.1 examples now include the LGSC message.

- Some guidelines for X.409 usage within LOGII are established in section
4.2 LOGII Message philosophy.  Also RMOs are now defined to be Sequences.
If no SMOs are present, then the SMO Set is not included and the message
is only an RMO Sequence.
It is also stated that the interfaces must await a response from the
Supervisor, before sending any ICRS messages on a logon port.

- The ICRM message, section 4.3 contains a bit in the message header
which the dispatcher sets to indicate that a requested is licensed to
be an Auxiliary circuit.

- The ICRS message, section 4.5 contains only a SMO set and no RMO sequence.

- The rules for NCRM integrity are included section 4.6.

- The interface rules for turning echo on and clearing the logon port
input and output buffers, are stated for each normal logon response code
in the RCRM/RCRI messages (section 4.7).  Two uneccessary reject codes have
been made unused and invalid.

- In section 4.10.1 NCN Overview and Compatibility issues, the handling
of the takeover message LOGII/LOGI indication from the Supervisor
has been slightly modified.  Also indicated is the patching of the
current LOGI Supervisor 42.01 to handle and ignore a LOGII NCRM message.

- In sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.12 the CCN, NCN and ISN have been reorganized
to follow a consistent structure throughout the three messages.
A needleNodeCount MO has been added (MO-28), indicating the number
of node number entries in the needleNodeList MO.  The NCN tail is now
simply a control character pair, with no other associated data.

- In the X.409 tutorial, section 7, the description of long form length
has been corrected and the example now uses a current MO, rather
than the eliminated Dispatcher Key MO.

- The example in section 8 now correctly shows the message size to include the
4 bytes of header data, as well as the MOs.


The Document has been updated on DNDSPEC.

Thanks....Omar

Bill,

1. the 'loadFile" in the glob - is it the default file to load by boot?
2. your statement in Rodney document:
     struct BootBits bootDefault = {....}
  is it a valid C declaration? In other words is it an equivalent
of a #define statement that defines a constatnt structure?

Thank you, I suggest you get a copy of the troff manual and the mm manual.
Remember, that when using mm, you should be very careful about using troff
commands - use only those that are suggested in the mm manual or you will
risk side effects producing strange and unpredictable effects.  More to the
point,
	.nf	no fill
	.fi	fill
	.b	I don't know - not a troff command, maybe a macro
	.B	bold face
	.bp	break page
However, you should probably use displays (.DS .DE) in stead of .nf .fi
and also .SK in place of .bp.  In genera, only use direct troff commands
if you can not find a mm macro to do what you want.  -Bill

The load file is an informational entry set by the boot to the name of
the file the system was most recently loaded from.  -Bill
Oh yes, struct BootBits bootDefault = {...}; is standard C and it
is not equivalent to #define in that it actually allocates storage in
our case in ROM and initializes it to the specified values at link/load
time.  See K&R p. 124.  -Bill

I've made delta's of both red/kernel and rid/ipcf so we can see where it
stands.  I've forgotten exactly how far I was through things when the labor
started.  I think its mostly done, though, making a listing now.  -Bill

Bill,

Labor does tend to interrupt things a bit.  Yu-liang will be sending
you mail regarding the kernel scheduler.  It needs to be integrated
with the Rodney kernel simulator so that we can proceed with
unit testing.

I see exactly how this works now.  I hadn't understood the alternating font
idea, so didn't realize that the leading "", or null, in a comparable 
expression, was significant.  It works fine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THE BENCHMARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR FOCUS ON SYSTEM 47 HAVE UNDERGONE
ANOTHER REVISION, SO THE VERSION ROLL DESCRIBED IN MY JUNE 24TH MEMO
HAS CHANGED.

ON SATURDAY, JULY 25TH, THE FOCUS VERSIONS ON SYSTEM 47 WILL BE
AS FOLLOWS:

OLD FOCUS        - VERSION 4.5.4

PRODUCTION FOCUS - VERSION 5.0.3

FIELDTEST FOCUS  - VERSION 5.0.3

THIS SCENARIO DIFFERS FROM OUR ORIGINAL PLAN BECAUSE, INSTEAD OF
LOADING VERSION 5.0.4 INTO FIELDTEST, WE ARE LOADING 5.0.3.
IT IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE THE SAME VERSION IN PRODUCTION AND FIELDTEST,
BUT, BECAUSE OF OPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, IT IS NECESSARY THAT
WE DO THIS FOR THE BENCHMARK.

AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE BENCHMARK, WE WILL BE INSTALLING VERSION
5.0.4 INTO FIELDTEST WHICH WILL BRING US BACK TO OUR NORMAL VERSION
ALIGNMENT.

THIS LATEST CHANGE SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON OTHER COMMERCIAL CLIENTS
SINCE ONLY INTERNAL USERS ACCESS THE FIELDTEST VERSION OF FOCUS.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS PLAN, PLEASE CALL
CAROL BURKETT (314-234-8786) OR CHERYL SCHROEDER AT
(314-234-6776).

Bill,
In my opinion there should be a third argument to IpcfDone() -
- caller's TSAP. Currently I see no protection for "done-ing"
someone else's message. I know the chance for that is infinitesimly
small but not zero. If you had a TSAP at least you could verify that
message belongs to this TSAP.
The problem arose during my detailed design.

A TMS user said her mail didn't get through on Thursday.  I looked at the
log in MAIL on 29 and saw lots of errors like "FILE system error detected.
virtual addr 191, reason code 05." Any idea why this is happening?  The
errors go as far back as the beginning of the log on Sunday.  
Since neither of us always has time to respond quickly to these things, maybe
a larger log file size would help tracking specific problems people report.
E.g. 300 blocks?

Subject: LOGII GED update 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been updated to as follows:

Section 4.2 indicates that NCN messages contain no RMO sequence.  All
ISIS messages now use bit 1 of the header flags to indicate (if set) that
a message is not the first message of a continuation sequence.

In section 4.4.1, a new ECRI code is added, indicating that a circuit
request has been rejected due to an invalid CCT.  The CCT MO now states
that a CCT MO must be present in the ICRM, or the Node Code will reject
the circuit (with a bad ICRM format ECRI indication).  If the Node Code
detects a non-zero CCT with an auxiliary circuit request, or a zero
CCT with a normal circuit request, the circuit is rejected (with
an invalid CCT ECRI).

In section 4.10.2, the NCN Head has been changed to contain no RMO Sequence
but to simply be a single NCN Head Implicit Sequence.

In section 4.10.3, the NCN Body has been changed to contain no RMO Sequence
but to simply be a single NCN Body Implicit Sequence.  The nCNFlags element
has been removed from the NCN Body.

In section 4.11.1, the LGSC message has an intra-node circuit indication
bit added to the message header flags.

In section 4.12.1, the ISN now has a reserved 16 bit field following
the message size, for use by the Dispatcher in constructing intra-node
circuits.  Also the intra-node circuit bit indication has been added
to the message header flags.  It is now stated that the Node Code
will not divide up ISNs into partial message portions, regardless
of message size and continuation message rules, if the ISN has the
intra-node circuit indication.

The iSNDispSeq element has been restructured, and the origIIX and origPort
elements have been added to the ISIS Dispatcher Sequence.  Also the Aux
circuit indication has been added to the ISN flags.

The Document has been updated on SUPDEV:39.

Well, I guess its okay to make it asynchronous - that is for rkBootStrap
to return to the caller after doing a sprout.  The caller may not expect
it, so we have to make sure its well documented or he might do something
rude like crash.  Now that you mention it I remember that we talked about
doing a k_reset from rkBootStrap and ruled it out because there would be
no way to do, for example, a "running dump".

I'm sorry I was confused about all this.  The sprout idea is good.  It
would help me if I had a copy of the matrix we did on the board that one
day.  Somebody was going to put that in the RED, probably Pat, I'll check

In response to an ancient request, it would be possible for the
SKYWALKER Dispatcher to clear IIX circuits with IIX messages
rather than the current "out of channels" etc. text-strings.

The proposed solution is to send (for IIX circuits) the sequence:

(where 1-byte term-reason corresponds to those defined in the
accounting document), (rather than the text-string followed by the detach).

Please verify that global message 0008 (8088) is not currently in use--
If available, I will document this usage in CIRCUIT.DOC, and implement
the necessary code.

If I receive no objections by August 1, 1987, I will assume approval
and proceed.

While true if refering to Jewish or Moslem circumcision, the origins of male
cirumcision in USA are not religious and some history is instructive.
Believe it or not, circumcision was introduced in USA in the 1870's by the
medical profession to curb the practice of masturbation. At that time the US
medical profession considered masturbation to be one of the leading causes
of insanity. The practice of routine circumcision of males to prevent
insanity caught on gradually in USA, Great Britain, Canada and Australia,
but almost nowhere else.  

Not only was the medical profession mistaken in believing that masturbation
causes insanity, they were also mistaken in believing that circumcision
makes masturbation impossible.  The belief was that the exposed glans would
be so painfully sensitive to the direct touch that masturbation would be
impossible. They ignored the possiblity of the glans getting desensitized on
exposure, or of the use of artificial lubrication to reduce the friction. It
should be pointed out that circumcision was also advocated for girls, but
only if caught masturbating. In the few cases where circumcision was found
not to be effective in curbing masturbation (ie parents caught Junior at it
again), doctors did not hesitate to take more drastic steps : In the case of
girls this ussually involved cliteridectomy, while in the case of boys
blistering of parts of the penis, surgical clamps and sutures on the glans
which made any erection very painful, and in some cases amputation of the
penis was tried. (As an aside I sometimes wonder what kind of family life
Americans had 100 years ago with parents spying on their children in order
to find evidence indicating the need for mutilating surgery !).

By the turn of the century European psychiatrists of Freud's school managed
to convince the English speaking medical world that insanity was not an
incurable disease, so the more barbaric forms of multilation mentioned above
disapeared. However US doctors continued to advocate the more harmless form
of male circumcision since they still felt it was worthwhile in preventing
insanity, even if it was curable. The prevalance of male circumcision
continued to grow in USA as the following statistics indicate :

Year		Estimated Circumcision Frequency

1870		5
1880		10
1890		15
1900		25
1910		35
1920		50
1930		55
1940		60
1950		70
1960		75
1970		80
1979		85

It was not until the 1930's that the medical profession managed to convince
itself that masturbation was entirely harmless. By then the practice of
circumcision had developed a momentum of its own and the medical profession
hated to admit that they had been performing an entirely unnecessary
operation on millions of people, so they suddenly "discovered" a whole host
of medical reasons to justify this operation.  Most of the medical research
purporting to show the medical benefits of circumcision date from the 1930's
and 40's. This research was accepted with relief and rather uncritically and
so the US medical profession continued advocating routine male circumcision.

Medicine was socialized in Great Britain around 1945 and the Government
ruled that male circumcision was not covered, and would have to be paid for
by the patient. The practice of medical circumcision disapeared almost
overnight from Britain, but continued to grow in USA, Canada and Australia.

In the 1960's and 70's more careful research failed to validate earlier
results of the medical benefits of circumcision, but most of the medical
profession in USA wasn't paying any attention. The exception were
Pediatricians who had to handle the complications resulting from this
operation that is usually done by the Gynocologist delivering the baby.
Their national association passed a resolution in 1975 calling for an end to
routine male circumcision. But they failed to change the stand of the
American Medical Association (AMA), largely because of opposition from the
Gynocologists. 

However the AMA finally changed its position in 1985, so that the official
position of the AMA today is that there is no medical reason for routine
circumcision.  This decision received no publicity, and parents considering
circumcision were rarely informed by their doctor of the change in the AMA's
position.

The AMA stand finally received a lot of publicity in 1986 when Blue
Cross/Blue Shield decided that they would no longer pay for circumcision,
refering complaining customers to the AMA opinion. The issue was even
debated on TV in the Donaghue(?) show sometime last month.  I didn't see it,
but apparantly Donaghue was trying to play it up as the medical scandal of
the decade, with the medical profession performing an unnecessary (albeit
harmless) operation on close to 100 million people.

One hopes that circumcision will disappear from USA the way it did from
Great Britain in the 1940's, but this is not certain.  Medical insurance
stopped paying for circumcisions in Canada sometime in the 1960's (anyone
know exactly ?) but the circumcision rate has only been dropping slowly at a
rate of about 5% a decade. Unlike in the case of Britain in the 1940's, the
majority of fathers in Canada and USA are already circumcised, and may be
unable to psychologically accept that their circumcision was unnecessary, or
feel embarassed at showing themselves in front of their uncircumcised sons
in the nude.

The latest evidence does not support the claim that circumcision prevents
penile cancer. To start with the incidence of penile cancer in countries
that do not practice circumcision is generally no higher than in USA where
most males are circumcised. The following are the number of new cases per
100 000 male population per year:

USA :		0.8
Sweden :	1.1
Norway :	1.1
Finland:	0.5
Denmark:	0.9
(National Cancer registries;for USA American Cancer Society, May 26,1972).

Most of the evidence purporting to show that circumcision protects against
penile cancer is based on poor studies. The following is one such example :
(Quoted from reference [1] below):  "In 1961, Dr Samuel Licklider reported
on the 131 cases of penile cancer treated at the Memorial Hospital for
Cancer and Allied Diseases in New York City in the 40-year period from 1919
to 1959. The distribution of these 131 cases by religion revealed that 4
were Jews. According to Dr. Licklider, this table demonstrated the  low
incidence of penile cancer among Jews. The reason given was circumcision.
[However the] circumcision status was not determined for any of the 131
cases." The frequency of circumcision amongst non-jews in USA in 1960 was
around 75%, but this fact was totally ignored in the study !

Note that the total deaths from penile cancer in USA in 1977 was 225,
compared to 540 deaths due to cancer of the clitoris & labia. (American
Cancer Society, July 27, 1977). The ratio between male and female genital
cancer is similar in countries that do not practice male circumcision. In
Sweden the number of deaths in 1968 were 43 due to penile cancer and 121 due
to cancer of the clitoris & labia (The Cancer Registry, Sweden, 1971).
Anyone claiming that circumcision prevents penile cancer is going to have to
explain why the same does not apply to cancer of the clitoris & labia.

Craigs reference to the rate of penile cancer China is illustrative of the
way annecdotal evidence gets promoted to the status of accepted fact.  This
statistic is referenced in numererous medical papers, but the source given
is usually another medical papar which in turn gives yet another medical
paper as its source. 

Actually anyone quoting this statistic could have used common sense to rule
out its validity. The Peoples Republic of China does not collect any
statistics on the incidence of penile cancer and until recently foreigners
were excluded from collecting first hand evidence. Moreover the 8% figure is
off by several orders of magniture from any reasonable value. As given above
the anual rate of penile cancer (new cases not deaths) in the USA and Europe
is about 1 per 100000 males.  Given a life expectance of 70 years this works
out to 0.07% of the male population over their lifetime (the cancer is fatal
in only about 1/3 of such cases). This makes the 8% figure for China over
100 times that of USA and Europe !

The reference below did manage to track down the original source of the 8%
statistic to a doctor who got the statistic at an international conference
during the course of a conversation with a doctor from China. The latter
told him that some 8% of the patients in his clinic had penile cancer, and
that none of them were moslem.  If I remember correctly the number of
patients was 28 (certainly less than 100), so not only is the 8% figure
statistically insignificant, but it is terribly skewed because the sample
included only patients of this particular clinic who were there because they
had some chronic disease.

There seems to be an implication that in the absence of running water (or
personal hygeene) circumcision is medically beneficial, which in the absence
of any scientific evidence is highly questionable. One reason for doubt is
that in Europe all men are tought to regularly wash the foreskin, while
women rarely bother to wash the foreskin of the clitoris.  Gynocologists
report that they routinely find significant amounts of Smegma on the
foreskin of women, and the glans of the clitoris is often irritated and
inflamed on acount of this. Yet there has never been any suggestion that
European women are in any additional danger of cancer of the clitoris on
account of this neglect.

In the first place the foreskin is almost never retracted in a normal
uncircumcised male though it will often retract when the penis is erect.
(maybe that's what Craig meant by "growth" :-))

Second Craig is confusing the problem of adherance, in which the foreskin
partly adheres to the glans, with the unrelated problem of phimosis, in
which the foreskin is so tight as to make errection painful. 

Almost all males are born with the foreskin adhering to the skin of the
glans, a condition that normally disappears only with puberty. Contrary
to widespread belief in USA it is a mistake to try to retract the foreskin
of an uncircumcised male before puberty, since this will almost always
result in part of the glans being "skinned", producing a very painful wound.
In fact in male infants that are circumcised, the "skinned" glans is
perhaps more painful than the actual circumcision wound, (particularly since
the wound often gets soaked in urine).

Likewise the foreskin of all males tends to be tight for some time during
puberty when the penis increases in size rather suddenly. Normally frequent
involuntary erections during this period insure that the foreskin stretches
to accomodate the growth of the penis. Even when the foreskin does not
stretch sufficiently it can usually be treated by regulary stretching the
foresking by hand, and only in extreme cases is circumcision required.

Circumcision can be viewed as harmless since none of the NATURAL functions
of the foreskin (protecting the glans, and as a source of pheromes) are
important in today's world.

On the other hand the foreskin clearly enhances the pleasure of
masturbation, since no messy lubricant is ever required to reduce the
intensity of direct contact with the glans. For a circumcised male
masturbation is only a poor substitute for sex, while for an uncircumcised
male, masturbation is a reasonable alternative to sex. I hope I haven't
encouraged some fundamentalist parents to have their son(s) circumcised :-)

What is really barbaric is that this operation is invariably performed on
infants without the benefit of any anaesthesia in USA. The prime motivation
for this practice is to avoid the mortality risk associated with the use of
any anaesthesia. From the doctors point of view it is a simple tradeoff
between the risk of being sued by the parents if the patient dies, and the
non-existent risk of being sued by the patient for pain and suffering he
cannot remember. Question : are other surgical operations in USA likewise
performed on infants without anaesthesia ?

Most doctors in USA seem to believe that the pain of infant circumcision
does no permanant damage. However there is evidence to the contrary. To
check if male and female behaviour is genetically differentiated, the
behaviour of male and female infants under the age of one was tested (in
USA). The surprising result of the research was that even at that age male
and female infants responded in dramatically different ways to external
stimulus.  Female response was characterized by passive curiousity. Male
infants tended to react much more agressively, taking evasive action if
anything got too close. However when European researchers attempted to
repeat the experiments, they found they could not duplicate the results. In
fact they found that both male and female infants behave rather like the
female infants in USA. The conclusion they came to was that the very painful
experience most males in USA are subjected to within days of being born
makes them permanantly more distrustful of the outside world ! The US
medical establishment continues to deny this interpretation, perhaps out of
some kind of guilt complex, similar to the one which prompted it to
uncritically accept research justifying circumcision in the 1940's.

your archive file back to "(BARTLETW)AR<q>Q<y>.MSG" and re-deleted all

These are the current locations of UNITAP.  All seem out of date except the
one in (CMF:39).  I'd suggest deleting all the old ones, and puting the
correct one someplace convenient such as XEXEC.  Actually, I'll do that,
then people with the proper init program can just say "UNITAP" and don't
have to worry where it is.  I'll leave deleting old versions to you if
that is what you want to do - after all we don't want people flapping
tapes.  -Bill

Routing-info: 

As a matter of principle, I'm one of those people who won't give out my social 
security number when applying for utilities or credit cards. The reasons why 
have been discussed numerous times in various security-related groups.   It is 
my understanding that it is against the law to force someone to give his/her 
social security number unless it is a government agency; although I've often 
run into occasional resistance, a few moments of explanation has usually 
resulted in things working out okay.

Then there's today.  I'm moving to W. Lafayette Indiana in two weeks and I 
called to establish my phone service there.  Indiana is served by GTE for phone
service.  I did not anticipate any problems since I have an excellent credit 
history, as could be verified by a quick check with the local Southern Bell 
folks.  After the rep at GTE took all my information down, she asked for my 
SS#.  I explained that I don't give that out.  She informed me that I would be 
required to pay a $75 deposit if I refused to give my SS#.  So, I asked to talk
to her supervisor.

Her supervisor repeated that I would have to give my SS# to waive the deposit. 
I asked if they could simply call Southern Bell or take a credit card #, or 
they could call Purdue and verify my employment.  He said that wasn't enough --
I had to supply my SS#, no other option.  I enquired as to why they needed it 
-- he said it was for a credit check and to verify future disconnect requests. 
I explained that they could do that self-same credit check without the SS# 
*and* I don't give out my SS# precisely because I don't want it used as a 
verification number on my account.   He insisted I either supply the number or 
pay the deposit.  He also asked why I was being so stubborn -- it was even on 
my driver's license, wasn't it?  (It isn't -- and hasn't been.  In Georgia, you
have always had the option of having a different ID, and now the licenses are 
being issue with those as default.  The guy at GTE claims that the Indiana 
licenses are *required* to have the SS# on them -- anyone know if this is true?
 It shouldn't be...) I explained that having done some work in computer 
security, and personal experience, I know how that number can be abused.  He 
said I was the only person he'd ever run into to refuse to give the SS# (!).

I then asked him if the requirement for a SS# was written policy -- I wanted a 
copy to examine.  He informed me that such information was private to the 
company and I couldn't have a copy -- didn't I trust him?  I then asked if that
policy was on file with the state Public Service Commission.  At that he 
(rather loudly) asked if I wanted service with GTE or not?  I asked him very 
calmly if he was threatening to deny me service -- he quieted down.  I next 
explained that I wanted to see a copy of the written policy because it would be
interesting to include in an article I might write on improper use of SS#s.  He
became very quiet.  I offered to find the name and number of someone at 
Southern Bell who could verify my 9 years of service here.  He said to call 
back with that information (thankful to get rid of me, I guess).

The lady I talked to at Southern Bell was very helpful.  She informed me that 
all the Southern Bell operators are told not to force a SS# because it is 
against both policy and law, but if someone won't provide it they are to get a 
bank account # or credit card number (both of which I am willing to give in 
circumstances such as this).  She was more than willing to talk to the 
supervisor at GTE and give him a credit reference, if only he'd call.  She said
she'd also fill him in on policy.  *AND*, most interestingly, Southern Bell had
somehow obtained my SS# through other means and it was on file, but she marked 
it so that it was not to be given out to anyone, specifically not anyone with 
GTE Indiana. :-)

Back to GTE.  I called the supervisor (collect, of course) and gave him the 
name and number of the lady at Southern Bell.  He was very curt and said he'd 
probably still require a deposit.  He hung up on me.

20 minutes later the original GTE operator called me back and cheerily informed
me that my service would be turned on August 4 with *no* deposit required!

Questions

---------

1) Do many of you (net-readers) withhold your SS# in similar circumstances?

Do you have these kinds of confrontations too?

2) Anyone know if other people at GTE Indiana are such jerks, or is

this an isolated instance?

3) Anyone know if Indiana does, in fact, *require* that the SS# be

on the driver's license?

4) Should I bother to follow-up on this further?  That is, should I bother 
contacting the Public Service commission in Indiana about the treatment I 
received? (I'm currently not sure it is worth the effort).

Too bad we don't have a choice of phone companies as well as long

distance carriers -- I'd keep Southern Bell.

Subject: PDP-10 coding trick 

  In putting together my own octal print routine for my SETOP endeavor
I chose to combine the octal and decimal print routines into one.  This
had the side effect that octal numbers with the sign bit set became
a weird set of punctuation marks (since I had an unsigned print routine).

		  OOPS!

  If you start with a standard routine such as this...

  num = 1
  rem = num+1

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

  I came up with this interesting bit of code as a work around that I had
never encountered in any bag of PDP-10 coding tricks...

OCTOUT:	SKIPA	rad,[^D8]		; octal
DECOUT: MOVEI	rad,^D10		; decimal
; ** begin trick **
	EXCH	num,rem			; setup number in remainder word
	SETZ	num,			; for 2-word divide instead
	LSHC	num,1			; shift sign (if any) to high word
	LSH	rem,-1			; shift low word back into position
	DIV	num,rad			; first divide, results same as IDIV
	CAIA				; or JRST .+2 to skip first divide
; ** end trick **
RDXOUT: IDIV	num,rad			; divide
	HRLM	rem,(P)			; save remainder on stack
	SKIPE	num			; any more digits?
	  PUSHJ	P,RDXOUT		; yes, loop
	HLRZ	num,(P)			; get digit from stack
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)		; convert to digit
	OUTCHR	num			; print it (with routine of choice)
	POPJ	P,			; return when done

; Have you ever seen this used anywhere before?

PS.  TYMCOM-X only...
    replace
	MOVEI	num,"0"(num)
	OUTCHR	num
    with
	OUTCHI	"0"(num)		; outchr immediate

Okay, I think I fixed this bug where TUMS tries to RTS to nobody.  I was 
doing the usual check whether mai:From[M] was null except in this case
there was a way for it to be set up as "@TMS.Tymnet".  I prevented this

You currently have a special home directory on opus in addition to your
normal one on calvin or hobbes, or a special home on calvin and your
normal home on opus.  When the Sun servers are transferred to N. First
St., all three servers will be sharing files via NFS, so there will be
no need to keep these special homes, and they will be deleted.

In preparation for the move, which is currently planned for Tuesday
July 28, please copy any files you wish to keep back to your primary
server.  If you have too much to copy easily, please let me know as
soon as possible so we can make special arrangements.  In any case,
please acknowledge this message so we won't worry that you don't know
about this.

Subject: Re: SETOP passwords 

Of course!  A manager need not know the old password to change someone under
him.  How else could he set the password or change it, when an employee came
and had forgotten his password!!!

YES!!! I agree it should be changed... it should work like PASSWORD does now!
When a manager runs setop... before he can do anything, he must give his
own password... (and if you don't have WC set, I believe it does ASK for OPER
name and password).  Bill, you have enough license that you were not validated
when you changed the password.

Anyway, it makes sense that anyone doing anything should validate himself and
super licenses should still require the validation.  At present, if WRS or CARL
validated themselves, then they could only change people under them... that's
the way SETOP works.

We will have "super-user" status still.. but validatin is required to produce
a proper audit trail. So we should include the validation... and maybe.. just
maybe provide a way in to re-create the world if something happens to th
password file and it needs reconstruction.

I think you misunderstood.  I was saying that SETOP currently behaves properly.
It DOES require your password before you change anyone else's.  It either
requires it when you set WC with the OPER program, or when you enter SETOP.
Both would give you an audit trail if SETOP kept one.  I see no need for any
change to the procedure.  -Bill

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

Overview:

Security is a major concern in all areas of the Network.  From
restricting access to the Network to restricting the range of
capabilities a user has once a successful connection is made to a
host, security is a concern.  This proposal seeks to address one part
of the security picture.

Today, all users on the PDP Code Genning Systems have the capability to
access the NAD program in the (SYS) directory.  This program gives them
Write File (WF) license.  With this capability, any user has the ability
to over-write any file on the system they are logged into.  With NAD they
are also able to gen code and create listings of the Tymnet source code.

What this proposal seeks to control is really two fold.  First, it will
restrict which users are allowed access to NAD in the (SYS) directory.
This will remove their Write File capabilities and not allow them to
create code listings.  Secondly, it will also restrict the ability to gen
code to only those users who have been identified as requiring this
capability.


Goals and Compromises:

The ultimate goal for the implementation of restricted access was to
disallow access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories from all
users except those that require access.  Those requiring access include
all field and Headquarters support people; Project Implementation; the
Field Service Organization; Customers who, by contract, are allowed
access; the Headquarters Quality Assurance group; and the development
organization.  Groups that required access only to a limited set of
files in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories would then be
restricted on a file by file basis.  For example, Customer A has in
their contract a license to gen X.25, Node Code and ISIS.  They would be
allowed access to only the source for this code and be barred access to
the remaining source code files.

Unfortunately, barring access down to a per file per user basis is not
possible under current TYMCOM-X limitations.  This capability would
require modifications to the Operating System.  What is possible is to
restrict access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories as a whole
and restrict access to some of the capabilities of the NAD program. 
Thus, restricting access on a more limited basis is possible.

After the restructuring of the PDP systems, as will be documented,
restriction to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories will be on
a per user basis.  Certain users will be barred from being able to
create listings of the source code and will be able to only write files
into their own directories.  They will not be able to over-write files
at will as they can today.




Restructuring with Restrictions:

There are copies of the code genning program, NAD, on all PDP Code Genning
Systems.  One NAD is the aforementioned copy in the (SYS) directory.
The second NAD is the copy in the (SOURCE) directory.  The only
difference between these two copies of the same program is the license
assigned to the programs.  The NAD program in the (SYS) directory has
Write File license (WF).  Use of this copy of NAD allows the user to
over-write files anywhere on the PDP system they are accessing.  The
copy of the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory has only Home File
(HF) license.  This will still allow the user to over-write files in 
directories under the same GAN.  A change to NAD would be required
to restrict this further.[*]

There is also an important feature of NAD that is part of this
restructuring.  If a user lacks TYM license, NAD will not allow that
user to create listings of the source code.  Currently, most users that
gen code have TYM license.  They are able to both gen code and create
listings of the source code.

The changes proposed to create tighter controls on the capabilities of
users on the PDP Code Genning Systems are:

1.  Remove Write File (WF) license from NAD in the (SYS) directory.

2.  Place protections on NAD in the (SYS) directory so it could only be
    called and used by users that have the license required to do so.
    Even users in the same GAN will be restricted unless they have the
    license necessary to access the code.

3.  Structure the customer directories as follows.

    A customer will have a minimum of two directories.  One will be
    under a separate GAN and will be used for CODE STORAGE.  Code that
    is operating in their network will be stored in this directory.  The
    second directory will be under the same GAN as the (SOURCE) and
    (BETATEST) directories.  This directory will be used only for CODE
    GENERATION.  The second, or CODE GENNING directory, will have an
    ACCESS list allowing the customer to GFD into this directory from
    their CODE STORAGE directory.

4.  Remove TYM license from users who should not be able to create
    listings of the source code.

5.  The (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories should have directory access
    protection of  SHARABLE and LISTABLE only.  They currently have
    SHARABLE, LISTABLE and NEW FILES.




By making these changes, users not in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) GANs,
and without proper license, will not have access to NAD.  They will be
forced to only use the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory.  Without
the TYM license, they would be unable to create listings of the source
code.  Without the additional licenses on the NAD program they would be
unable to over-write files not in their own directory.  With directory 
access set, users will be prevented from writing into the (SOURCE) and
(BETATEST) directories.

With the current protections placed on all (SOURCE) and (BETATEST)
source code, users without the proper license will not have access to
the files in these directories.  They would be restricted from even
viewing the source files.


Concerns and Questions:

Items marked with a [*] throughout this document require further
research.

PEAK and VUE, the text editors on the PDPs, require modification if they
are to be used by users that do not have TYM license.

Will changing the customer's GAN for the code genning directory cause
any problems?  Do any other programs key off the GAN, etc.

Will the customer be allowed to log into their code genning directory
directly or only be able to access it via a GFD from their storage
directory?

Who will be tracking the change of GANs for the customers?

Who will identify the customers requiring these changes?

Who will be removing the Write File (WF) license from (SYS)NAD and the
Home File (HF) license from (SOURCE)NAD?

An ACCESS.LST file will have to be maintained in the code genning
directories to allow the GFD access from the code storage directories.
Recovery procedures will have to be established for the recovering of
these files after accidental deletion.

Otherwise, my vote is that WF be removed immediately from (SYS)NAD, which

1. I know of no non-obvious interaction between setjmp/longjmp and
dbx.  It probably gets confused if you "trace" through one since it
switches stacks out from under it.  

2. By the time k_sleep returns, its not a sleeping process.  If you
want it to be cancelable you can use k_alarm, but canceling an alarm
on a sleeping process would leave it asleep forever.  I'm not sure what
is intended here.

The RSI gives you a pointer to the handle.  If you use it before returning
from the RSI, you don't need to copy it, however, if you want to use it
later (i.e. from background) then you best copy it.  It was determined that
structure copy is OK to use since all the compilers we have do it very well
and all new compilers are likely to since its probably in the ANSI standard.
So...
  struct IpcfHandle myHandle;
  myHandle = *handleArgument;

Subject: LOGII GED Update 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been updated to as follows:

The CCN Flags have a new bit 4, indicating that the needle node list
contains a passthrough node that is not LOGII capable.

The NCN Overview and Compatibility Issues has been expanded to properly
address the host LOGII status reporting within the takeover response
and ISIS and command channel host status update messages.  Also the
creation of LOGI, LOGI translated from LOGII, and LOGII needles is described,
indicating the dependence of the needle form
on the LOGII status of the termination Node/Interface or passthrough
nodes.

The Document has been updated on SUPDEV:39 and OSERANG:39.

Thanks....Omar

Subject: System 70 users are being moved to F33. 

I got call from Barbara V. in Validations on the 27th.  She wanted to know if
I really wanted to keep all of the 1000 page files in (JMS:70) when we get
moved to system 33.  These happened to be test files, which I deleted.
I ran SZRPT with option NUMACCOUNT to get a list of GAN 3 users on F70,
then had RDIST compare corresponding directories on F70 and F33.

The results are in (JMS:70)CHECK3.LOG.  If you want to check your own
directory, use "RDIST (yourname)*.*/HOST:33/MASTER:70/CHECK".     /JMS

Subject: ipcf.h 

Hi Bill,
     the ipcf.h file in lib (which may be old, I don't know) has a couple
of errors-- the bit fields use misspelled define constants.  They end with
SIZE instead of SZ.  Also, struct VmeId is not declared.  I made changes
to this with a copy that I created in the directory rodney/v1/skylog.
I don't know how to officially store this anywhere... what is the command?
Also, the copy which is "magically" placed in your directory when you 
do sccs edit is read-only.  Does this need more work? or do you just 
chmod the file?
     I guess a few of us are going to be learning SCCS real soon...
Thanks, Ron.
By the way, I need some kind of answer on the TUMS question I sent (why
PROFS doesn't work) so I can tell Jerry Oberfranc at TMS.

Bill,
BABY ????......
In the definitions of structures like RodneyBootRsp or ..Req you left
undefined the lenghts of file names (like loadName[?]). Am I correct
in assuming that will have to be fixed in a 'define'? Will it be valid
for the whole interface or every module will have its own?
The reason I am asking is that if we agree on a common number you could
put it in Rodney and I won't have to redefine those structeres in my
boot just because we picked different values. This way I can refer to
the names of your structures if I want to. Am I clear to you?
My concern can be coming with some gaps in my knowledge of C.

Bug #1: Time-out on 930 for when LOGINN was waiting for project code.
	LOGINN demands a CR not just an LF at the end of the project code.
Fix #1: Send two CR's - one for project code, one for "attach to job?".

Bug #2: Gives up too soon when a host with 1B0 set appears in JOBS.DAT.
Fix #2: Stop at -1 instead of negative.  MHX also has this bug, CPY does not.

New:  I added the /MASTER switch so that I could run RDIST on the slave system.
New:  I added version number in DEC standard form.

Subject: RDIST suggestions. 

I noticed that /USER applies to the aux circuit that runs FINDIT and FINDIT
itself, but not to TELECOPY.  That is, when logged in as JMS, TELECOPY can read
or create files in M33, but cannot supercede files in M33 because the aux
circuit built by TELECO is for JMS not M33.  That's the main reason why I added
the /MASTER switch, so that RDIST could be run on the destination system GFD'd
to the right directory as a SUBMIT job.  (My changes are in (JMS:39)RDIST.SAI).

Another thing to consider in the next version is a /GATEWAY command so that
B39 can be kept current with the rest of the world.  /Joe

Also, aren't we going to have a Rodney error for bus error? I added one to the
logger codes, which seems like the wrong place.  And are we going to have 
similar error handling to the VME "jump trap" for case of local memory access
error?  Pat mentioned this the other day.

Subject: skylog red halves 

I have a way to combine the halves of the skylog document by using awk and
two passes of vgr.  This will not affect the other modules and can be used
to apply arbitrarily many fonts to a module in the future (at a slight 
expense in elegance and a very small cpu cost).  The .vS and .vE macros
are "hidden" in turn, currently as .v4, .v5, .v0, and .v1, when going 
through vfontedpr, and then all converted back for roff processing.  I 
intend to change the Makefile line for .mmx modules.  Let me know what
you think...

Also, there may be a problem between the .c and .vX macros used in the 
same paragraph (or else I made some other mistake).  This showed up 
processing the skylog1.mmx half in the regular way.  When xroffed, 
the first paragraph in 1.2.1 "Message Framing" puts the last "APPLICATION 0"
in normal font even though .vX was invoked.  Any ideas?

It just runs FINDIT so...
I suppose I could check for .TMP and try to handle it gracefully, but the
problem here is not .TMP, its binary file names.  The program RDIST blew
up here because it got two files with the same (reported) name.  I guess
that they each contained an embedded blank and differed following that so
the cvxstr routine in sail (which does the wrong thing) stops at the first
blank.  I'm not sure what the best fix would be.  Maybe FINDIT could output
otherwise illegal file names in some special way like '123456654321.XYZ.
Suggestions?  -Bill

I'll have to ook at the notes from our meeting where we made the table on
the white-board to be sure, but I recall that rkBootStrap() should do
k_reset() and so will never return to the caller.  As for the start address,
you'll have to check with whoever specified the file format (Selter?).

Bill,
o.k. - I concur that k_reset() never returns to the caller, but it
will eventually come back through BootInit() which at some point
will return to Rodney (according to my understanding). Also 
rkBootStrap() will return to the caller - remember it will only
sprout BootMain() - k_reset is never called out of rkBootStrap().
These are important points - please agree or disagree.

Thanks for the response - I am glad we clarified it. I do have the matrix

I guess Pat probably recorded it in a document.
When I asked Pat about the validity of the Start Address he referred me

but will be soon when I start coding.

Subject: Logger loose ends 

Pat one day mentioned implementing error recovery for local memory access
similar to the code you invented for VME error recovery.  Are we going to
do this?  Also, did we decide on a simpleDone function for IPCF done while
interrupts are disabled?
Also, the following changes got lost from v1/include some time after I 
added them on July 13:
RERR_LOG_NOLOG		/* no log file is available */
RERR_LOG_NOROOM		/* no buffer space is available */
RERR_LOG_TOOMANY	/* message quota for time period exceeded */
RERR_LOG_BUSERROR	/* bus error during VME read */
RERR_LOG_TRUNCATED	/* log message too long, truncated */
Can we add these back?
Thanks,
Ron

1. No local memory recovery that I know of.
2. SimpleDone - yes.
3. Don't change include/* its just a copy.
   a. what calls are going to return these errors?  I thought the
      logger would never return an error.
   b. if you still want them in, I'll add them to the master copy.

Pat came back from the last RED review and said slgReport should return
error codes after all.  The new errors (except changing RERR_NOLOG to
RERR_LOG_NOLOG for consistency) all come from slgReport.  According to
Pat, the ISIS group wanted to know if the Logger was working because
there is an alternate place to log messages (Alfred???).  This is 
probably good since the Logger often has no choice but to lose its
buffer when the card gets in trouble.  Of course, ISIS's alternate
mechanism may be no better off; I haven't really questioned their
wisdom in this.

Good enough, I won't question it either.  Its certainly safer to return
an error code which can be ignored than to return void.  I'll add the
codes.  Thanks -Bill

I am slowly getting ready to begin coding so you will hear from me
more often to clarify certain points/details.
I have come across something I don't fully understand.
In your doc. you say that handle.msgPtr->datalength will get me this
particular field. well, msgPtr points to struct IpcfMsg which is nowhere
defined (?), second what if I want to address a field outside the header
like 'functionCode'. I doubt handle.msgPtr->functionCode would work.
That is why it is a mystery for me why  handle.msgPtr->datalength would
work sine nowhere there is an information about datalength belonging to
IpcfHdr struct.
My basic problem is what is the trick that would allow me accessing
individual fields of structures like:

struct {
struct	IpcfHder A;
struct	RodneyBootReq B;
}

given handle.msgPter, without allocating memory for them.
I have a few ideas but they are clearly incompatible with your example
with 'datalen..' so they are probably wrong.
If you feel like calling instead of writting - it's fine.
thanks,
Mike J.

I will write down an example, then you can call me if you want more
explanation.  Its okay all evening...

Some confusion is coming from renaming ipcfMsg to ipcfHdr.  It is possible
I did not find all occurances of ipcfMsg in the document (or you have an
older one).  Anyway, ipcfMsg no longer exists so always consider it to
mean ipcfHdr if you see it somewhere.

Now then, this is one of several hundred ways you might do it:

struct BootReqMsg {
	struct IpcfHdr h;
	struct RodneyBootReq b;
} *brm;

Then you can fill in ipcf header fields like...
	brm->h.srcTsap = whateverMyTsapIsCalled;
		etc...
And you can fill in body fields by...
	brm->b.functionCode = RODNEY_BOOT_REQ;
	brm->b.tsap = whateverMyTsapIsCalledAgain;
		etc...
Now the variable length fields are trickey since they are really not there
in the struct definition.  This calls for a bit of "C" wizardry:

/*
 * fillin()
 * Example routine to fill in the string fields of a BootRequestMsg.
 * Assumes brm points to a block of memory that is big enough.
 * Computes sizes for strings and the whole message.
 */
void
fillin( brm, dumpName, loadName )
struct BootRequestMsg *brm;		/* place to put message */
char dumpName[];			/* 1st string */
char loadName[];			/* 2nd string */
{
	char *s;
	s = (char*)(&brm->b+1);		/* compute address of 1st string */
	strcpy( s, dumpName );		/* copy 1st string to message */
	s += brm->b.dumpLen = strlen( dumpName ) + 1;
					/* compute length of 1st string and
					 * address of 2nd string */
	strcpy( s, loadName );		/* copy 2nd string to message */
	s += brm->b.loadName = strlen( loadName ) + 1;
					/* compute length of 2nd string and
					 * address of end of message */
	brm->h.length = s - (char*)(&brm->b);
					/* compute length of message body */
}

Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions 866-0443.

Bill,
Your example that you provided for my benefit with filling in the
string fields in RodneyBootReq suggests that the string lie outside
the definition of the RodneyBootReq structure (that is why you
can say  &brm->b+1  where +1 puts you outside the size of the
structure). well, the definition of the RodneyBootReq structure
has those strings within it so I am not sure how to reconcile
both. am I clear to you?

  Since Joe (also in class) was working with NAD, I had him test the ability

he otherwise would not have access to.  He chose (UN1) for the destination
directory.
  I heard from Dennis Ernst, that HF or WF should probably NOT be set on NAD.
As such, we will be removing WF from (SYS)NAD sometime today...

Thank you for checking with us.  It is bound to screw up

mostly by Tymnet operations and private network customers.
It seems to me they need an alternative means to access
their code, but I don't understand what the procedures
are so I can't suggest such an alternative.  *SIGH*  I
think this is gross negligence on someone's part, but it
is unfortunate that our customers will be the ones to
suffer for it.  I knew about the WF on NAD, but was told
that it enforced its own security, which it at least used
to because I frequently have gotten protection failures
trying to read source code I'm assembling (being in a
different GAN than most of NTD) when I forget to set RF.

I propose more investigation before any action, even
as gross as this appearently is, it can probably be 
left alone a couple more days.  I would normally
volunteer to help investigate, but this is a very bad
time.

Thanks

That is interesting.  They should all be the same.  But I'm very
curious what prompted you to check.  Is there something I should

It sounds like you have done more investigation.  I did a tiny bit, too, and
I see (SOURCE)NAD with HF on 70.  Presumably that is the only way that
a customer can access the files in (SOURCE) since they are mostly ALL RD NO.
However, if NAD does not enforce security itself, this is still a problem
because we do not want customers to be able to read/write even the source
directory except to assemble (but not make listing of) the files therein.
Although this is a smaller box than (SYS)NAD with WF, it still needs to be
addressed one way or another.  -Bill

Bill,
what rkGetBoot() should do if there is no valid set strategy?
it is unclear to me what code should be returned.

also a C question:

If A and B are strucures of the same kind A = B would copy B into A.
Now ltes say Ap is a pointer to structure A. Can copying be done
now with *Ap = B   ...or *Ap = *Bp  (Bp points to B) ???

okay Bill...more q.

1. boot ack sends the _RSP message. the contents of this message should
relate to the current boot process or to the set strategy?

2. what are the RERR_??? codes pertaining to ipcfAssign() that tell
me (boot) in fact "no room for you right now". I was betting on
_NO_SSAPS <= code <= _NO_TSAPS but they sound like SKYSAP related
and I am not sure if I ever going to see them. this is important for me
so I can distinguish between hopless errors and temporary bottleneck.

Bill, along the same lines as last question - how serious is
inability to sprout a process. is it likely to go away after a bit
of pause?
...in case your answer is "it is fatal - crash" do you want me to crash
or would you rather prefer to get some sort of returned error code
(another RodneyError) so you could do with it whatever you want.
this would apply to places like rkBootstrap(), BootInit().

Still 6210, except 922-6210.  
Have to drop by and see me sometime, I'm on the 4th floor.  Out of the
elevator and turn right, past the hall and right at the isle.  2nd on the
right.  B4-535.  Re: TUMS, sorry about that.  Let me know if you can make
it happen at will.  Meanwhile, you're the only one complaining so I think
it may be something you're doing different from others.  I really have
no clues.  Oh well.  -Bill

Yes, either Thursday or Friday of next week are okay.  Lets meet at my office
about 1:30 instead of lunch.  I'd invite you all for lunch, but they're not

It appears that TUMS has read my Ontymes since Monday, 8/3 and cleared
them from the Ontyme read list but not delivered them to opus as
it used to do. 

If this is not a known problem, you are now aware !

Please let me know if when and if this is remedied ...

Subject: Re: Unbelievable MDC Pro-Space Publicity Story!!! 
In-reply-to: MDC-WBD-BY52E

The ad runs on channel 4 (NBC) in the Washington DC area, sometimes in the 
evening between local and national news and often during 11:00 news -- quite 
impressive.  Perhaps the MDC promoters of the Space Station feel they'll get 
more 'bang for the lobbying buck' in this area.  This same ad was used to open 
a space station conference last week in Tyson Corners VA (Vienna/Mclean) -- 
where several hundred 'beltway bandits' gathered to promote the space-station. 

My town, Reston VA, is seeing a lot of space-station related activity.  NASA 
space-station project management is moving into a new building out here (20 
miles west of Wash DC).  A large contract (billion dollars) was recently 
awarded to Grumman to support this NASA function, so they're locating here also
to be near NASA.  A number of smaller companies hoping for mere million dollar 
crumbs are starting to gather around the 'big boys'.

It's interesting to watch the whole process.  The local paper recently devoted 
a issue to the subject -- SPACE, Reston's Next Frontier.  with quotes like 'The
space station could make Reston a coroprate household name, much like Houston's
space flight center was' & 'You're going to see an influx of companies moving 
to the area to start up or set up new divisions'  Based on the combined 1100 
NASA & Grumman workforce, estimates are that 10,000 new space-related jobs will
move into the area in the next 3-5 years.

So.. there is a lot of activity re the space station hppening around here.  
Some of it's joint space-industrial complex hype, but once BIG contracts start 
coming, things start to move -- albeit several years late and at a very slow 
pace, it looks like there's enough momentum now to make the space station real.
 I have no idea where MDC fits into all this.  Except for the ad, I don't see 
much MDC space-related activity around Wash DC.

 I just read your Profs message.  I've been on vacation so as you no

I previously said that one should not k_terminate ones own process.
Well, its coded now, and its okay, if you really want to, it will work
much the same as exit() does in Unix.  In fact if you call it with a

Try eunix.  The data base says you're supposed to get stuff there, and

 	Office Publishing with Ventura Publisher

A PC Week reviewer commented that "software as complete and capable as
Ventura Publisher is hard to improve," but release 1.1 "has made a great
program truly superb."  Favorably reviewed in every quarter, Ventura
Publisher has mastered the job of producing phototypeset-quality
documents in the office.  On the way to creating a program with the
power to process documents with fast turnaround time, the Ventura team
developed unique features that ideally suit Ventura Publisher to network
desktop publishing applications.

This Forum is OPEN.

Host: Kathy Jarvis  (PARC Technical Information Center x4042)

Refreshments will be served at 3:45 P.M.  Refreshments are provided only

Directions to reach PARC:  The Auditorium is located at 3333 Coyote Hill
Road in Palo Alto, between Page Mill Road (west of Foothill Expressway)
and Hillview Avenue, in the Stanford Research Park.  To get here, take
Page Mill Road to Coyote Hill Road.   PARC is the only building on the
left, just over the crest of Coyote Hill.  Park in the large lower lot
if visitor parking is full and enter the auditorium at the upper level
of the building.  (The auditorium is located down the stairs and to the
left of the main doors.)

Subject: Username (ACCESS#) 

THey actually validated that on a PDP-10?????

They can't even look at it woth most software... I wonder if they will be
able to delete it?  NONAME won't let you look at it.

(This is a rhetorical comment... Lynn Lawrence tole me that she talked to
 you and you told her "#" was illegal in a TYMCOM-X username.)

Did you know that LOGINN runs init programs at start-address + 1 ???

(at least by demonstration... it appears that way)
(F40 may not like that... meaning, anyone using an F40 INIT program will
 experience problems depending upon what they do in their programs... the
 program in question does an LUUO '015 at the start address, and a JRST 140
 at start address+1, and it gets a HALT whenever started at start+1)

Is the behavior of LOGINN proper in your opinion?  Should it ever run the
init program at start+1... (I haven't looked, but is this documented?)

Please comment, but no urgency is required... I understand that your
domestic life has changed dramatically over the weekend and you will
definately need time to adjust.  (Are you taking any vacation time?)

Please say hello to Becky and the baby... I'll probably give you a call
but, I'm being "considerate" and waiting until the initial hub-bub has
a chance to die down...

I think it's probably the project code validation program that's running
at start address plus one.  I don't remember that being true for INIT.
What does she want to do about it?  I can still hack things if she wants
to keep the username, but I'll just have to use FET in stead of NONAME.
Oh well.  Life here is going well (and at 150%) but I've given up entirely
on being able to plan anything farther than 30 seconds into the future at
least until 11-Jul-2008.  Oh my, I just realized he'll be graduating from
the class of 2005!  That year does not seem real.  Not even 1990 seems
real.  Maybe they're not.  End babble.  End message.  -Bill

Thanks... you were right!  They had the same program setup as both the
INIT program and the project-code validation program, so I didn't bother
to check it...

I think F40 doesn't like to be started at start+1, so I'm going to
suggest that Lynn has a second program for PJCVFY that sets restricted
restricted mode and the INIT program to run and runs it at the regular
start address...

I think it might be nice (now that INITIA runs the init program for the
user) to allow the INIT command in restricted mode.  Maybe change INITIA
to run the RCF program if there is no init program so it works as expected.

I have a special program for them to run that runs in front of the Fortran
one that sets up stuff.  Do a NONAME on user INFORMATION - I think its
called "SECURE" but I forget what directory its on.  Suggest you use that
if you're going to set it up for her (which would be nice since I'm kind
of tied up at the moment).  Thanks -Bill

Subject: BubbNet hosts 

Bill,
  I will contact Sandy or Kal, but I thought that I'd run it past you first.
We were planning on configuring our micronet and hosts so that they could be
accessed from another network (other than TYMNET) such as as TrainNet or
BubbNet.  The connection into BubbNet was mostly for Dennis Ernst to be able
to access that micronet, but I see an advantage for System 39, if we were to
put both of our 2020s on dual bases, one host on TYMNET and one on BUBBNET
for each host.

  Since our micronet is somewhat the proving ground for what Dennis does, it
wouldn't be in conflict with having only NTD hosts on Bubbnet...  It would
give us direct connections into B39 and eliminate the gateway problems we have
in trying to support system 39 from Tymnet.

  Do you think that we would have any problems getting the host and node
connections to Bubbnet?

Sounds good to me.  I think there would be no problem so long as there

Heavens no!!!  At least not yet...

I have run into string garbage collect problems, so I reduced string usage
as much as possible on output by encoding my own fill routines for numeric
and string output to overwrite the same large constant string...  My string
space still gets larger than 64K and string GC occurs when it needs to expand
and the GC takes 30+ seconds...

Know any way to reduce, turn off string GC?

I'm now re-thinking the data structure into multiple files to increase the
access speed.. expect that to be done the end of this week... I'm in class
over at TYMNET TRAINING (Intro to ISIS) all this week.

Let Wayne know... I may have a preliminary "GED" for him by next week sometime.
...assuming some progress is made this week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



System F70 (Femont) is in the process of being consolidated onto system    
F30 (Fremont), in preparation of being permanently shutdown.  The follow-  
ing groups of users will be the first to be moved from system F70 to F33   
on August 14, 1987 beginning at 1800 pacific time.  The transfer of the    
files will be handled by Fremont Operations and RPM.   
     
If an user is already valid on system F33 with files, that users' files    
will not be overwritten with system F70 files unless otherwise specified.  
     
The users who are moving are: 
CID    DIST USERNAME              COMPANY NAME    
46     148  CSCHROED  Applied Communications 
138    141  NASON     Applied Communications

When the move has been completed, all the above users will be removed from 
system F70 on Tuesday, August 18, 1987. 
     
Please note, system F70 will no longer be timesharing after September 4, 1987.

1. boot ack should describe the current process with the bits which
have been processed cleared from bootBits

2. If you get an RERR from the ipcf, you can consider it hopeless.  It
is not likely to clear up.  The only errors I would think you can recover
from are the failed done states of the ipcf message that are returned in
ipcf progress field.  Things like out of memory (which is the only reason
ipcfAssign and such would fail should be treated as fatal since the only
way to get more memory if the patron refuses to give it to us is to crash
the patron and take it anyway.  These errors indicate a serious problem
and are not something that is expected to happen on a correct processor.

The only reason for sprout to fail is if Rodney is out of memory.  In
the case of the boot, there is no appearent graceful recovery that I can
imagine, so I think crash.  Hopefully, when Rodney calls you back at bootInit
after the crash, you can continue where you left off.  This time there will
be memory (unless things are completely pathalogic).  It is likewise nice to
be able to continue if the ipcfAssign() fails due to lack of Rodney memory.
The ipcf send failure that's reported in the progress field of IPCF_NOROOM
is presumably temporary - retry with some time out.  The IPCF_TOOBIG is also
an indication that there is not enough memory at the receiving end, but this
is almost certain to be permanent (i.e. configuration error vs. run error).

Forgive me if I bable -- I hope I'm making some sense.

The first message sent with connectionMode set establishes a transport
connection.  After that, you may only send connectionMode messages to
that same tsap.  You may still send non-connectionMode messages anywhere
you want, but they are not subject to IPCF_GONE.  -Bill

Correct, the GONE interrupt is only for connection mode.  You could get
GONE progress code, though, if you attempt to send to a board that is out
to lunch (or dinner).

When sending a message to an out-to-lunch board, 
you may either get an RERR_TSAPI error return from ipcfSend(),
or an RERR_OKAY return followed some time later by an IPCF_FAILED
interrupt with the progress code set to IPCF_PROGRESS_NODEST.
I hadn't looked in the manual when I sent the last message, so
I got some of the names of the things wrong, but the concepts are
roughly the same, that is: IPCF_GONE, IPCF_PROGRESS_NODEST, and
RERR_TSAPI all mean that the recipient does not exist.  (none of
them imply one way or the other wether the recipient ever did exist)

    1. I want to copy byte *p into A, so it will appear in its proper

That's a tough one.  In reality, there is almost never going to be another
server.  Perhaps we should have a scheme for a backup file.  There could be
two copies of the same file on the same server and if the primary fails,
you try the backup.  What do you think?  I'm just thinking out loud.

> q2. I want to verify with you I can use bcopy() and bzero() functions.

Yes, in fact I have a couple macros that are nice for using with bzero().
They are in ~wrs/v1/include/zero.h

char *p;
int a;
p = "x";
a = *p;

results in a having a value of 0x78 which I think is what you wanted.
The compiler notices that they are objects of different sizes and does
the right thing.  Objects of type char, short, int, long are all compatible
in this way although storing a big value (i.e. int) into a small variable
(i.e. char) is questionable, it will work if you don't mind it discarding
the high order bits.  Also beware that most compilers will sign extend
the above example, so consider...
p = "\377";
a = *p;
Now a has the value of -1 because on the 68000 char's are signed.  You
can get around this by declaring p as
unsigned char *p;
(or more popular... u_char *p; )
so
u_char *p;
int a;
p = "\377";
a = *p;
Yields a with a value of 0377.

Bill,thanks for your answers. having a back-up file in the same server
sounds ok because there is a good chance if one file is screwed up
the other is not. if we decide on it I can easily add this to my logic.
I was told however that there may be more than one server - SFS0 to SFS9
and currently this is my primary way to recover. if you say it will be
seldom that more than one is available - then there is a problem.

your answer to char/integer problem does not satisfy me 100% - it is
my fault I did not present the case clearly enough.
p is actually a pointer defined like p = (char*)malloc(size).
so 
a = *p
probably would transfer just one byte, anyway this statement lacks
the information how many bytes I want to transfer.
to be more specific I am going to use it when reading Start Address from
the file. suppose I find out that its length is 3 bytes (length of StartA..)
and I want to transfer those 3 bytes into 'a' which probably must
be declared as long int.
if i did
a = *p
how the system knows how many bytes I want to transfer?
thanks

Well, there are many difficulties in writting code like that which interfaces
with outside data structures.  I'm almost sure the start address would be 4
bytes and so you would just do a cast:

char *p;
u_long startAdr;
p = malloc(whatever);
a = *(u_long*)p;

This makes it think, temporarily, that p is a pointer to a long and so
it does a 4 byte move, but it isn't clear the bytes are in the right
order.  You may end up picking them out as bytes and doing << and | to
assemble them into the proper word - to be avoided if possible, but it
sometimes comes to that.  Now if you really wanted 3 bytes, there are a
few things you could do, none of them elegant.  The best is probably to
do the byte by byte thing and use << and |.  That would be most portable.
You could also do 
  a = *(u_long*)p & 0xFFFFFF;
which gets 4 bytes and then discards one.  Again, this suffers from
being byte order dependent.  I don't mean to say that taking advantage
of byte order is bad, but it should only be used when the tradeoff
between portability and effiiency is justified.  It should always by
marked as "byte order dependent" or "machine dependent" by a comment.

-Bill

PS - most of Ron's X.409 code uses byte operations with << and |.  It
is most general and really not the inefficient.  I think I lean that
way personally.

Oh yes,  X.409 integers are very strange.  You never know ahead of time how
big they will be.  You should try to share Ron's routines so we won't have
to have space in ROM for two sets of almost identical routines.  -Bill

Subject: Meeting Info 

Please type (read) the file (CARL:930)SETOP.PRP prior to our meeting.  I
have updated the document to reflect the changes I've made to the design
(some of which are implemented in my test version).

Some questions I have -- open for discussion are:

1)  Who should be allowed to see what information in the oper database.
    At present, any manager may see any subordinate and any individual
    may see their own information.
    How do we allow anyone to grant license to someone NOT subordinate
    one or more levels below them? (If they cannot see them!)

2)  How do we want to make various users able to see and change everything?
    (I'm not asking for implementation details... I'm asking from a policy
     point of view... from a legality point of view [freedom of information
     and all that]).
    Obviously, WRS & CARL & a few others can change anything... but how do
    we want to officiate that capability...  especially in the case of a
    system disaster.

On a different topic... we should discuss any fallout from the NAD episode
of a week or two ago and how that changes would affect various support
and development groups.  (I haven't gotten back to Doug or Dennis on this).


...I'm fading... more questions, but I'm becomng incoherent... see you
both at 1:30pm at Bill's office.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please join me in welcoming Ethel James as the newest member of my staff.
Ethel was hired on August 10th to perform project management duties and
will have several NTD programs to manage after completion of her startup 
training.
 
Ethel comes to us from Quadrex Corporation after serving in many capacities
for over twelve years. Her positions have been varied in such roles as
Technical Editor, Project Administrator, Manager of Administrative and Control
Systems and, most recently, as the Manager of Administration. Her managerial
and administrative skills makes her quite suitable to act as a program
coordinator in the number of areas that require a central contact to
interface with multiple organizations, in and out of NTD.
 
She will be kept busy in the initial weeks becoming familiar with other
job functions performed by Program Management while working to understand
Tymnet technologies. A key part of her training will be to meet the people
from NTD and those of other Network Systems organizations. Her first
assignment(s) will follow.
 
Again, join me in welcoming Ethel aboard and wishing her well in her
new role as a Senior Technical Support Analyst with prime responsibilities
for the project management of one or more NTD programs.

Bill,

Thanks for fixing TUMS for me ... I'm now getting my Ontymes on opus.
Did you fix this only for me, or will others be encountering the same
problem?

Thanks again,

John

Bill,
I will ask you to add a few errors to enum Rodney Error that will
be used in errorCode of boot rsp msg. dose it have to be something
general like - some failure, I am retrying - or something specific
like - msg deliver failure, or file server does not respond, or
file continuity failure, etc. ? I can do it either way.
also in case rkBootstrap() can not sprout Bootmain, should I crash
or - maybe better - return another Rodney Error code ?

If sprout fails, I think just crash.  It is not something that will fix
itself so waiting and trying again won't help.  As for an error code, I'm
not sure that the caller can do anything constructive.  Its like "what do
you when you're trying to commit suicide and the gun doesn't work?".
You probably don't want to take it back to the store, you probably want
to just jump out a window.  -Bill

Bill, if I read your answer correctly I don't have to worry about
the precise definition of errorCode in BOOT_RSP. But pobably I have
to be more precise when logging an error message.

Subject: FINDIT modified to not list TMP files. 

So as to not confuse RDIST with garbage names from deleted files, FINDIT
no longer reports files with an extension of ".TMP" or files with bit 8 set in
.RBLIC (the TMP file bit).  Column 60 of the output is blank for normal files,
is a dollar sign for JIS-8 Katakana files.  (SPL)FINDIT.DOC has been updated.

Subject: "RDIST sometimes skips files. On"... 

RDIST sometimes skips files.  On directories with many files (such as M33 which
has much less than 8000 files), RDIST sometimes reports "missing on slave" and
"missing on master" for files that exist on both systems.  Sometimes running 
RDIST a 2nd time works fine - I haven't noticed any particular pattern yet.
Just thought you'd want to know.   ?joe

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Employees requesting a security escort to their cars should first
call x 6191 or x 6192, which is the security control center.  This
will enable the officer on duty to dispatch a guard to our lobby
for escort purposes.  The control center is manned on a 24-hour
basis.
 
If any employee is refused escort service, he/she should obtain the
name of the guard (if possible), note the date and time, and report
the incident to John A. Miller, Administrative Manager of Guard Ser-
vices, at x 6192.

Subject: "Bill, those infinite questions"... 

Bill,
those infinite questions about error conditions haunt me...

1. if load bits indicate that I should wait for a file and
   in the meantime F server goes bananas - should I keep on waiting?
2. if load bits indicate crash if file does not exist - and file
   does exist but F server becomes sick - what do next?
3. use residual memory image - like before file exists but server
   starts acting up...?
4. can you think of any F server error conditions that would
   suggest trying another server except perhaps _SHUT?

hobbes is a Sun server running 4.3 Unix slightly modified by Sun.
25 MHz 68020.  So are calvin, opus, rocky, borris and bullwinkle.

Yes.

In general, if the file server is sick, I think you can treat it the
same as if the file was not found, except maybe log it.

>     starts acting up...?

Same answer as #2.

I don't know, what are the F server error conditions you aren't
sure how to handle?  I don't have a copy of the file system doc here.

Is "B39.Tymnet" part of the same domain as "xxxxx.Tymnet.com"?
Does Hobbes have its own connection to .COM or does it go thru
something else (like OFFICE-1.ARPA)?

We're not really part of .com officially, and hobbes shouldn't really be
using that name.  It isn't clear what our official address will be if we
ever get around to getting one.  Probably (for example) jms@x930.mdc.com
or possibly jms@x930.tymnet.com, but not likely since that's not our name.
Currently, there is no name server in TUMS or on the Unix systems, so I
(tums) assume that anything ending in .com .gov .arpa .edu, etc. is on
the DARPA internet and route it to office-1.  So, wrs@hobbes.Tymnet.com
is not likely to work, although I may make a special case check for it
and change it to just wrs@hobbes.Tymnet (kludge).  At any rate, I've lost
track of your question.  I think you mea to understand how we can be
addressed from other nets and the answer is: from usenet, only by explicit
path ...  ...oliveb!tymix!jms%x930, and from anywhere on the DARPA internet:
jms%x930.Tymnet@office-1.arpa (also <@office-1.arpa:jms@x930.Tymnet> but
that doesn't work in some mailers so some sites may not be able to send
that kind of address).  Did I answer your question?  -Bill

Is "B39.Tymnet" part of the same domain as "xxxxx.Tymnet.com"?
Does Hobbes have its own connection to .COM or does it go thru
something else (like OFFICE-1.ARPA)?

DRUE HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE SNA/SDLC TEAM SINCE 1983 WITH PRIME RESPONSIBILITY

PRODUCT.

I FEEL THAT DRUE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PRODUCTS AND EXPERIENCE WITHIN NTD

Sounds good.  That would also work well with the controller development
situation, until you actually start selling them.  What does it entail
and would the Corbin2 assholes go for it??

Subject: Re: ARPA net and others 
In-reply-to: your message of 08/20/87 16:26:27

An arpanet user should be able to send you mail using the following address:
	M173036%SLVMCL1.McAuto.Tymnet@Office-1.ARPA
this should also work, but some sites don't handle it right:
	<@Office-1.ARPA:M173036@SLVMCL1.McAuto.Tymnet>

Likewise, you can send to ARPANET by simply using their address in the first
line of your PROFS message.  The line must be of the form:
	TO: address1, address2, ... , addressN (TUMS)
If there are too many addresses to fit on a line, you may have any number of
such lines as long as there are no blank lines or other lines in between.
An ARPANET address looks just like a TUMS address except it ends with one
of the following domains: .ARPA, .COM, .EDU, .GOV (and some others I don't
remember).  For example, to send me mail on my ARPANET address, begin your
PROFS note with
	To: Bill Soley <WRS@Office-1.ARPA> (TUMS)
or just
	To: WRS@Office-1.ARPA (TUMS)
[everything outside <> is ignored by the mail system]
Then send the PROFs note to TUMSGATE at SLVMCL1.  There is a directory of ARPA
users maintained by SRI-NIC which can be accessed online or in printed form.
Very few users are actually registered, however, so I've always found it
useless.  For more information on that, send mail to Bill Daul:
	Bill Daul <WBD.MDC@Office-1.ARPA>

TUMS can communicate through ARPANET to bitnet.  I don't know how.  I think
Bill Daul can tell you this, also.  In general, if you know how, you can
talk to just about anything through TUMS.  The ones I have used are:
	ISG operated Tymnet hosts
	Usenet (Unix)
	ARPAnet (DARPA Internet)
	Telex
	TWX
	WU - mailgram
	WU - telegram
	PROFS
	TMS
	Ontyme

I hope this helps -Bill

This Friday you were supposed to have some time open in the
evening!

There will be interesting things for both B&B (and maybe even B).

By the way, since you two are going to SF (and we are not, I guess),
would it be possible to stop at Headlines while you are up there?
There are a couple of sites, one at Polk/Sutter and one on
Market St. (cross?).   I know that parking is really the pits,
but I thought I'd ask.

The item is a blue/green Lava Lite!  It costs $49 at headlines
and ~69 at the Exploratorium (that's an unreasonable price).
The blue lights are very hard to find whereas the red/yellow
ones you can get at Best for $39 -- in stock.  But I really
like the blue/green ones the best.  I think I'll go for a Prisoner
decor!  (Now, where did I leave that weather balloon?)

Bill,

I was thinking of getting some Phillip Glass myself but have no idea what
the stuff is like.  I'm worried about it being boring, but really don't
know for sure.  Let me know if you risk it.  There's lots of stuff in
the new age section that I have no idea what or who it is, and no
way to really find out.  Some of the CDs that I got that were really bad
I returned as defective (trading for something else), or just sold
to the stores that buy used CDs.

Thanks...Omar

A lower priority process will not run if a higher priority process is
on the run q (i.e. ready).  So: until the first process blocks. (k_sleep
or k_wait cause blocking, but k_dismiss does not).  Try getting a newer
copy of the exec gid:
	cd ~wrs/rid; make exec

Right.  I'll probably talk to you before you read this, but I'll reply
anyway.  I won't forget about Friday, but since Ola's been sick, we are
reluctant to bring the baby to the house.  I may come alone.  I know that
Becky would like to see the stuff, but another day, perhaps.

Meanwhile, thanks for baby stuff.

Corbin & Corbin called Putney and said we need to pay them $175/month
for Monte Bello or get out.  This is most likely prohibitively
expensive.  We are considering alternatives.  One of them is to get
rid of San Benito (sell it to someone else).  One of them is to just
sell everything and say "fuck it".  One of them is to tripple the
dues (which wouldn't work).  One of them is to incorporate as a non-
profit organization and then they can write it off (and so can we).
One of them is to keep everything and look for another site.  One of
them is to have a nervous breakdown.  Oh well.

Subject: ARPA net and others 

Cliff Achord directed me your way for the following questions, ifyou are not
the proper person please direct me elsewhere.

1. It looks as if we can send PROFS notes to ARPA net user's thru TUMSGATE
   on CP20.

2. How do we come up with the mailing address info for ARPA net users? I
   think that I have part of a address for a user. In that from some samples
   that I have, ARPA net users appear to have mail distributors.

3. Is BITNET accessable to TUMSGATE/CP20 Profs? What other nets can be
   accessed thru these means?

4. Do we have some kind of ARPA net directory?

Thanks,
Jim Weinhold

Bill,
In case of DONE interrupt I hope handle.msgPtr will point to the
outbound message that was declared DONE. is it the case? if not, and
handle is valid only for inbound msg I wonder how big a deal it was
to expand its meaning?

Since we are already located at the new campus, we would really
appreciate an Ontyme (if possible) or memo from other divisions
as they move in.  One of the difficulties we've experienced is
sending mail out and not knowing if the recipient is already in
the complex, still at Valley Green, etc.
 
Please address the Ontyme to NTD.SUP and it will be forwarded to
all of us.
 
Thanks, and we look forward to having everyone here!!!!

Not declaring the argument is a judgement call.  I think its okay.  After
all, there is precedent for it in main() which may be declared without.
You might ask someone else, like Steve, if you're still uncomfortable.  -Bill

I think I lent you an old textbook of mine on data structures back when you
were doing the garbage collect stuff on the sup.  Do you still have it?
Don't go crazy if you can't find it, I really don't remember what came of
it.  I believe it was Addison-Wessley Computer Science Series.  I don't
remember the author.  The title was simply Data Structures, I think.  -Bill

Bill,
  Do you know why I get "Access bared" when I try to build a circuit
from BUBBNET back into TYMNET?  It makes it a little difficult to do
anything on system 39.

  If I masque as WRS or something, it works fine...  if you could fix
the problem for me, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks /Carl

PS.  We've played muciscal hosts in preparation for the move.  X930 is
still the same host, but right now it keeps crashing.  It would be best
to try sending mail to X14 or X17 if 930 is down, or maybe best to D35
during the move.   I will update my local MAIL.FWD to go to 35.

Bill,
a C question:

struct A {
	struct B b;
	struct C c;
	char d[50];
};

are the expressions below correct?

sizeof( A.b ) and
sizeof( A.d )

I suspect the first to be incorrect (the correct is sizeof( struct B ),
but how can I come up with a correct sizeof declaration for the
last element of structure A (regardless of the fact that I know
it is 50) ?

Bill,
  Do you know why I get "Access bared" when I try to build a circuit
from BUBBNET back into TYMNET?  It makes it a little difficult to do
anything on system 39.

  If I masque as WRS or something, it works fine...  if you could fix
the problem for me, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks /Carl

PS.  We've played muciscal hosts in preparation for the move.  X930 is
still the same host, but right now it keeps crashing.  It would be best
to try sending mail to X14 or X17 if 930 is down, or maybe best to D35
during the move.   I will update my local MAIL.FWD to go to 35.

We got em!  But I notice strangness:
  1. they seem out of order
  2. look at the To: field, it has an extra ":"
These could be our problems, but I haven't seen either one before.

In-reply-to: your message of 08/28/87 15:05:02

Well so far I've only received one copy.
I believe the line you are refering to is filtered out (the on that
contains, among other things, the subject field, right?) so it is not
part of the checksum.  Below is a copy of the field that was checksumed
in the note you just sent me, for example:

--begin checksum--

	<M108013@SLVMCL1.McAuto.Tymnet> 
Bill, I have a hunch that you will receive three notes from this test. The
check sum depending on how you do it may find a difference in the last line of
the note PROFS creates. It has a hex field that can be used for number of
copies of the note. It is not always consistant, so you cant use it to
eliminate duplicate notes, but it may be enough to fake out your newest mod to
identify copies. I thought of this after your last phone conversation and
thought I had better do a test and not leave it to the user that reported the
problem.
Have a good day,
Carol

I only need your verification that ipcfLookup( ABC, &hisTsap )

also in ipcfAssign( key, function,...) where function is to be a pointer

name, right ?

In-reply-to: your message of 08/28/87 16:49:41

My messages are actually originating from B39.Tymnet and not Ontyme.  Ontyme
is only an intermediary (in some cases) so the data is just passed through
transparently.  Ontyme users can't do that except to put a seperate TUMS
header in the body of the message which is probably a great pain and not
worth it.  This message and the last one, although replies to your message
which was sent to my Ontyme name, were sent directly from system 39 through
TUMS without going through Ontyme.  I'm not being very clear, I hope this
makes sense.  Anyway glad to see it seems to be fixed.  Sorry if I dropped
the ball before, I had thought the problem had cleared up.  Thanks -Bill

	Either ABC must be a char array holding the name, or you
	meant to say
		ipcfLookup("ABC", &hisTsap)
	which will work.

	You can say
		ipcfAssign(key, &function, ...)
	which might be more readible, but both are correct.  The "address of"
	operation is implied by simply referencing the function name so the
	"&" is optional.

Bill,
while coding the boot I assumed in case of dumping the core that 
somehow I will know where the core starts and ends. have you got
any idea how those two values will be given to me?
also...in the attributes for dumpFile I set it to be read-only (??),
and start address to zero (what else?), type normal. how does it
sound?

I'd dump all of "core".  I don't think dumps need to be read-only.
And they should have no start address as opposed to a zero start
address.  If the file format doesn't allow that, some special value
that is clearly illegal should be used, such as -1.  I guess that you
still need somebody to tell you where "all of core" is so Rodney can
give you a couple of variables somewhere, don't know what they'll
be called, but they would be either start and end address or start
address and size, or maybe all three.  -Bill

By time out send, if you mean DONE, that should be quick, even 5 secs
would be long enough.  If you mean the reply from the file server,
20 seconds is probably good.  It should be easily changable and in
fact during integration, maybe we'll change all the modules to use
the same symbol for timeout.  -Bill

right.  hobbes is the master server, calvin and opus are slave servers.
when a client comes up it broadcasts asking for a yp server.  the first
one to answer wins (on the grounds that it is the least heavily loaded).
that server is used until there's no answer from it, in which case the
process starts over.  and you can be a server for yourself.  so unless
the network is totally dead or all the servers are down, yp will work.

1. make sure your Ontyme password is different from any of your other
passwords (change it if necessary)
2. give me your Ontyme name, password, and the system you want it sent
to and the login name you want it sent to
3. sit back and enjoy TUMS

Subject: syslog now running 

I have set up syslog so that all log messages go to hobbes.  This means
that some error messages which formerly used to appear on various
system consoles now all go to the console on hobbes, and are recorded
(along with lots more stuff) in /usr/spool/log/syslog on hobbes.

(All I had to do to set this up was create an alias for hobbes called
"loghost" in /etc/hosts.)

Subject: NAD %1.07 

I've looked at the code for NAD and it appears that listings are currently
available to anyone running (SOURCE)NAD or anyone having TYMSHARE license.

Actually if the FPN of NAD matches the PPN of the input file, (or TP license)
then a listing can be generated.  What this means is that the current scheme
will allow anyone running NAD to get listings of any file in SOURCE since the
only version of NAD that is really NAD will be in SOURCE.  Files in BETATEST
are not listable unless you have TP license.

I know where to make the changes... as soon as Dennis Ernst confirms which
source file is the correct file then I will make the changes we discussed.

I feel the following "other" changes should be made...
  1)  Listings can only be generated if you have TP license (or)
      if the input file is in your own directory (or)
      if the input file is in your own GAN [since these are unreadable if
                                            the file is protected, so all ok]
  2)  As per (1) don't care what FPN NAD is run from -- remove check.

...otherwise having everyone run (SOURCE)NAD will allow everyone to get
listings whether or not they have TP license.

To Dennis:  Any reason why your current changes cannot released to the
            entire world?  Or should I change (NAD)NAD01.R05 as well as
            your version [NAD01.R06 or NAD01.R07?]

To Wayne:  Please pass this on to Doug so he knows about the listing 'twist'.

Bill,
a "C" question:

afunction();
{
  int(??) abc;

........
  bfuncion();
  return;
}

how can I define int abc to be a local function inside afunction()
so bfunction() could also access it? is there a way at all? the point
is I don't want abc to be an external variable.
thanks,

The function has to be declared in the same lexical scope as the usage or
in a surrounding lexical scope.  The dynamic (run time) scope is not
important to declarations.  You didn't give me enough information to answer
the question, but I'll take a guess

void
a()
{
	int c();
	... c() ... /* function c referenced here */
}

void
b()
{
	... a() ... /* function a referenced here */
}

In this example, c() does not need declaration inside b() since it is only
called inside a().  It does not matter in tis respect that b() calls a().
You may also say
	extern int c();
if the function is declared outside the module, but it is unnecessary and
a matter of style.  I usually do. 

By the way, this is the same way you should deal with forward references
that are not of type int.

The problem mentioned in Dave's memo is the same one I recently reported
as a Microtec bug.  The problem also occurs on the SUN C compiler.  Since
it is clearly a compiler bug and not a shortcomming of either the 68000
or of C, we should expect a fix [Julie: have you gotten any feedback on
it yet?].  I suggest that it be "worked around" in such a way as to be
easily understood and possibly later removed when the bug is fixed.  I've
found the following to work on both the SUN and MICROTEC compilers without
the need for any assembler code:
	int	CompareKludge;
	if ((CompareKludge = a - b) < 0) ...;

	#define SignBit 0x8000
	if ((a - b) & SignBit) ...;

The later is probably less obscure.  Its the one I use.  -Bill

Bill,
thanks for last answer and I have another C question:

Can something like this be made a macro?:

if(test > 0) return(quit);
else goto LABEL;

and even if possible that LABEL be an argument to the macro.
all books on C describe only one kind of macros, I have not seen
even an example with a macro spanning over more than one line.

a small comment to my last question:
I have those lines of code repeating like 20 times throughout
the code and I can not make it a function for obvious reasons.

Subject: background problem? 

You had suggested managing my background on/off facility with a special
event that could be k_caused from dbx.  When I call k_cause on this
event (or any other) when it does NOT have a pending k_wait, I get a
segmentation fault in k_cause at the line "while (pid = deq(&eventp->q)))".
Apparently eventp->q is not at a valid address but is at something like
0x7b.  When the event is k_waiting, it works ok.
Well?

The problem mentioned in Dave's memo is the same one I recently reported
as a Microtec bug.  The problem also occurs on the SUN C compiler.  Since
it is clearly a compiler bug and not a shortcomming of either the 68000
or of C, we should expect a fix [Julie: have you gotten any feedback on
it yet?].  I suggest that it be "worked around" in such a way as to be
easily understood and possibly later removed when the bug is fixed.  I've
found the following to work on both the SUN and MICROTEC compilers without
the need for any assembler code:
	int	CompareKludge;
	if ((CompareKludge = a - b) < 0) ...;

	#define SignBit 0x8000
	if ((a - b) & SignBit) ...;

The later is probably less obscure.  Its the one I use.  -Bill

Define it on one line...
#define THEMACRO(LABEL) if(test>0)return(quit);else goto LABEL;

There is a way to put new lines in macros (end the line with a

Before the first k_cause, yes.  (Not between k_causes.)

Apparently the eventp itself is a bad data address.  Either eventp was
garbaged (probably unlikely) or the argument allocated by the k_call
from dbx was not in an area accessible to the program, maybe?

Subject: Wonders of dbx 

There seems to be a bug in dbx in which, if it catches an interrupt
signal for the program, it forgets how to pass parameters in the 
'call' command.  I used three different functions (k_cause, printf,
and one I wrote called dump) and in each case they work if the dbx
program has not yet seen an interrupt, but the parameter is garbaged
after the call if it has seen an interrupt!

Whatever processes are waiting for the event passed to k_alarm will be
woken up.  If no process is blocked for the event when the timer expires,
a flag is set and the next (one) process to do k_wait(whateverEvent) will
wake up immediately.  k_alarm actually does a k_cause.  -Bill

My edit comments on your setop memo follow(I'll use you no. scheme for ref):
Employee record -  6th line - replace"may also be found" by "can be listed

Security mail address - still think it should say "Mailing address  (tums
preferred, or Ontyme, or Other)
Oper name record - as definition of "license" - "current active licenses
for this name"
Still an open action item for me - to check to see if all"isg no.s" are
infact "employee no.s" - If so, you will change appropriate text accordingly.
Another action item for me - To establish validity critiera for input items.
   Some answers to your list of questions:
1)any manager see below him(her) and any person can see one person's 
records (but by opername signon)
2)similar ans, except the "change anything part" will need much more
thought - in general NO - I envision some kind of "change privelege
table, with each opername being assiged a 'level' of privelege"
Only a very SMALL no. of people to have "all priveleges".

Subject: NAD %1.07 

I've looked at the code for NAD and it appears that listings are currently
available to anyone running (SOURCE)NAD or anyone having TYMSHARE license.

Actually if the FPN of NAD matches the PPN of the input file, (or TP license)
then a listing can be generated.  What this means is that the current scheme
will allow anyone running NAD to get listings of any file in SOURCE since the
only version of NAD that is really NAD will be in SOURCE.  Files in BETATEST
are not listable unless you have TP license.

I know where to make the changes... as soon as Dennis Ernst confirms which
source file is the correct file then I will make the changes we discussed.

I feel the following "other" changes should be made...
  1)  Listings can only be generated if you have TP license (or)
      if the input file is in your own directory (or)
      if the input file is in your own GAN [since these are unreadable if
                                            the file is protected, so all ok]
  2)  As per (1) don't care what FPN NAD is run from -- remove check.

...otherwise having everyone run (SOURCE)NAD will allow everyone to get
listings whether or not they have TP license.

To Dennis:  Any reason why your current changes cannot released to the
            entire world?  Or should I change (NAD)NAD01.R05 as well as
            your version [NAD01.R06 or NAD01.R07?]

To Wayne:  Please pass this on to Doug so he knows about the listing 'twist'.

Subject: LOGII GED update 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been updated to as follows:

- The RCRM flags element has two new bits, indicating a logon zapper
ack is present, and whether the RCRM is a reject (MO-27 present).

- The RCRI MO-24, circuit rejects from the Node Code has code zero
reworded to read "ICRS received for port allready in logon mode".
Two new codes were added.  Code 4 indicates that an ICRS was received
on a port before that port was sent an RCRI.  Code 5 indicates that a port
timed out before sending a subsequent portion of a partial message.

- The unused byte present in all LOGII command channel messages
(NCRM, RCRM, and CCN) now contains 80 to avoid escaping.

- The CCN username for destinations that are not LOGII capable (reduced needle)
contains the non-LOGII username prefix and suffix.  Correspondingly, the
transparent logon indication and sub-host elements are not included in CCNs
bound for non-LOGII destinations, since this information is part of the
reduced needle username.

- All references to "host unknown" have been removed since there is no
difference between a "down" or "unknown" host.  This makes the RCRM/RCRI
MO-27 codes 6 and 16 unused and now invalid, and makes the RCRM/RCRI MO-04
code 8 unused and invalid.

- The Specified Destination List Supervisor translation does not convert
the SDL characters to upper case.

- Reverse charge host status reporting is documented in the section
on Reverse charge.

- The Supervisor takeover message for a LOGII Supervisor has bit 1
of the Supervisor number byte set to indicate a LOGII Supervisor, rather
than resetting bit 0.

- The logon reset indication causes the Supervisor to discard any
information for the logon session, except the CCT, OADR, IIX or UUN
requested indications.

- Accounting type 4.7 unfilled records are padded with "00" rather than
"FF".

- The 032A needle body control character pair is followed by a halfword
if physical record length for the needle body.

- Four new MOs 48 - 4B have been added to the CCN and NCN messages, for
Skywalker access licensing.


The Document has been updated on DNDSPEC:39, SUPDEV:39 and OSERANG:39.

Thanks....Omar

Subject: "Bill, a few things: since I created"... 

Bill,
a few things:
since I created boot.h I think you should remove from rodney.h
all references to bootstrap just for consistency, otherwise we will
overlap.
in boot.h I defined all boot function codes (like RODNEY_BOOT_REQ),
is it ok. ?
the description of k_startPatron() is a bit confusing because it
suggests that it causes the Patron to be started, and just below
it says that "control" is passed tp Patron by (*......
I think it is only an unfortunate selection of words - k_start
only passes the start address.
question -
if a function expects 3 arguments, and I want to pass only the second
argument, others being null is it correct to say acall(, arg,)?
I am getting syntax errors in this area and have problems with
interpretting it.

At least temporarily... you need to have the router forward mail for
system 930 to system 35.  most of the messages in this file on 39 were
probably sent from mailing lists..?..  anyway,   XXX@X930 won't get
delivered until 1) 930 comes back up, and 2) we get a tymnet line to
our micronet so that we can get to 930 from Tymnet.

can you do anything about it... (other than edit the .Q file changing all
the X930's to F35 and renaming it 35.Q ???)

Is this an existing capability of ROUTER.DAT?

Have you implemented the "do not retrun this message" feature when users
do not read their mail?  ...or was it "discard after 30 days" ..or "n days"?
(the second is excellent for messages which are "timely").

When the gid says that "passes control to the Patron by (*startAddress)()",
it means that the startPatron call does that.  It does it however as the
foreground, and you are running in the background so you will still be
returned to.  

You must always pass all arguments.  Depending on the argument type,
there could be a value that the function ignores or treats like no value
such as NULL or 0 or -1 or whatever.

If I change ROUTER.DAT, the mail will be sent to 35, but 35 needs to have
something to do with it.  It'll spend alot of ime sitting there trying to
deliver it to the real 930 or worse yet, to itself.  I'll work on it.  For
now I'll just send it to 35.  -Bill

Two people have asked "how do you get ONTYME to send to TUMS?"
The file "*** TUMS.HLP" does not exist on any ONTYME system (appearantly
ONTYME outputs a message that refers to that file).  One of the askers
was just looking for documentation, the other is Tom Marconi who wants to
have IBM370 CRASH-MAIL sent to a PDP-10 system.  Is there a way to go from
TYMCOM-370 to TYMCOM-X other than via ONTYME?   /Joe

When I tried to log into JMS:14, the Supervisor told me the host was down

The following hosts are transparent: 1,2,4,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,20.
The following hosts are normal: 3,7,10,15,17,18,19,21.

Someone needs to tell the Supervisors that hosts 14 and 16 are normal hosts,
not transparent.   /Joe

Mike Mo got the word from Tadpole that this is NOT a design
feature of the GP.

John Coons made a suggestion that the serial number of the
board (each board is supposed to have a unique serial number
in the EEPROM) could be used to find out where in memory
the board is located.  The board could write it's serial
number in a known location where other boards could read it.
Each board could assemble a table, also in a known location,
as it read through memory of the board's serial numbers and
their VME addresses.  A board could then read another board's
table, find it's own serial number and address.

Subject: ISIS integration needs 

Bill,

  Dan indicates that the ISIS kernel group could use a version of the
Rodney Kernel with IPCF facilities by 10/23.  I need to talk to you
about whether we can focus development and testing to deliver a
stripped-down version of Rodney by 10/23.  We won't need bootstrap,
session stuff, bus error handling, but will need IPCF with
posssibly a faked GLOB.  When can we get together?

I believe the process tree elimination will not affect you.  If I remember
correctly from earlier discussions, you will have one main process for all
TSAP/SSAP, plus one process per TSAP/SSAP for down-level traffic, and one
process per TSAP/SSAP for up-level traffic.  The main process would do a
pair of k_sprout() calls for each new connection to setup the traffic
handling processes.  When the connection is closed, the two traffic
handling processes for that connection would be terminated by [somebody] as
part of cleaning up the connection.  This could be done either by returning
from the main function of each of the processes, or by calling
k_terminate().  This would work for both the old and new scheme of
processes.  I should emphasize that you would have to keep track of the PID
of each process and when you want to do the terminate, call k_terminate()
once for each process.  (Except if k_terminate() is called from within the
process being terminated, the PID is not required.)

I wanted to make sure there is no misunderstanding here before I delete the
tree feature, but to my knowledge, nobody was actually going to use it.
Is my summary correct, above?

Subject: UNIX documentation 




Bill,

I too am amazed that UNIX documentation has not been copied and distributed
to all, as I found out just yesterday that the library was unwilling to let
people make copies of the docs they have due to copyright notices.
However, we have ON-LINE copies of most man pages which include no notices.
Do you know an easy way to to do a "man -t" of all of man(1), for example,
without having to do it separately for every command? Then we could copy and
distribute these to everyone at negligible cost.

Let me know ...

John

The  DNDSPEC directory which contains development documents  will 
now  reside on system 38 instead of system 33.   This system move 
is  a result of the recent TECHREF directory move from system  56 
to system 38.

Only ERS documents will be transferred from the DNDSPEC system 38 
directory  into  the  TECHREF  system  38  directory.  All  other 
development  documents will stay in the DNDSPEC directory.   This 
will  be  managed  by  the  Quality  Assurance  Document  Control 
Coordinator  (Tom Turner; 408-432-5025).

When  a  document  is transferred from  DNDSPEC  system  39  (NTD 
environment)   to  DNDSPEC  system  38  (TYMNET  environment)   a 
notification  memo will be sent out.   Those to be informed  are:  
Software Technical Services, Hardware Technical Services, Quality 
Assurance,  Product  Marketing and Fixed  Assets.   The  ontyme's 
included are:

MAYBE I CAN TYPE A LITTLE SLOWER.  I AM READY TO RELEASE THE NEW ACCESS#
PROGRAM.  I WOULD LIKE IT TO HAVE THE SAV SAME KIND OF PROTECTION THAT THE
INFORMATION SYSTEM HAS, NAMELY THE LOGOUT ON DISCONNECT PROTECTION.  THE 
DIFFERENCE IN THIS NEW APPLICATION IS THAT IT RUNS IN MAGNUM.  I KNOW HOW
TO SET UP THE MAGNUM TO AUTOLOAD ONCE THE "FTMAG" COMMAND IS ISSUED.  I
WOULD RATHER NOT STORE ANY OF THE RELATIONS OR THE ACCESS# PROCEDURE UNDER
THE USERNAME ACCESS#, BUT RATHER USE THE SCHEMA AND RELATIONS UNDER THE
USERNAME DDD ON SYSTEM 38.  ACCESS# IS CURRENTLY UNDER SYSTEM 74, BUT I
CAN GET THE ACCESS# LOCATION CHANGED.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO MODIFY THE
SECURE PROGRAM TO FUNCTION IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?  I NOTICED IN ITS DOCUMENTA-
TION THAT YU DISABLED LOWER CASE DUE TO ITS USE WITH FORTRAN.  I WILL NEED
LOWER AND UPPER CASE ENABLED FOR THIS APPLICATION.  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS/

	To: WRS@B39.Tymnet (TUMS)
in the first line of the Ontyme (or PROFS) message and then send it
to TUMS.GATEWAY (or TUMSGATE).  However, if you are on Ontyme, it
is much simpler to just send to NTD.WRS since that mail is automatically
forwarded to me at WRS@B39.Tymnet.  I'm looking in to the disconnect/
reconnect problem now.  Will get back to you shortly.  -Bill

ACCESS# is going to be a little problem.  The "#" is illegal in
user names (actually some programs don't care and some do).  We
will have to talk on the phone to figure something out.  Is it
going to run on only one system (74)?  I don't see DDD valid there.
Is it going to have a password?  (since its published, why bother)
It may be wise to get rid of the "#" by setting up ACCESS# to
just print a message like
	The name of this service has been changed from "ACCESS#" 
	to "ACCESS".  Please type "ACCESS" at the "please log in:".
	please log in:
This is just a thought.  Anyway, let me know when everything is
ready to cutover and I'll figure out some way to do it, even with
the "#".  Its actually not much of a problem.  -Bill

Subject: SFTP 

Bill,
  Would it be possible to install SFTP on system 26?  I have been working
on moving the MXP source to a Sun, and would like to be able to get the
results on 26 without going via 39.  I noticed that the SFTP.SAV on 26
is older and different than on 39, but was reluctant to move it myself.
If it is OK, I can move it (I may also want it elsewhere, but not now).

thanks,
Paul

Yes, that's okay to move SFTP to 26, and almost anywhere else.  The master
system is 39 so that should be the correct version to use.  Please move
  SFTP.SAV and SFTP.DOC
please do not move the sources.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: Re: boot.mm 

Please go ahead and update boot.mm, kernel.mm, and ipcf.mm.  I talked
with Steve about the boot looking for alternate file servers and
we agreed that the boot would search only for SFS0 through SFS9
in order to keep the boot simple. This should be documented in
boot.mm.

On another issue raised at the review, how will the kernel
(or kernel processes like the logger) check pointers passed
as arguments?  We may need a scheme like that used for VME
accesses or a routine like rkCheckPublic.

If the pointer is checked and found invalid then a new
RERR code must be created.

Have you thought about how rodney should handle crashes?
Specifically, what errors should be treated as recoverable
or non-recoverable?  Should an internal process crash
Rodney if an internal consistency check fails or
log the problem and re-initalize?

Any new additions to the family?

Actually the water just broke and we're getting contractions at 20 min,
so...this must be the weekend.
Boot can scan for "*:SFS?" and take the minimum function of the result or
it could do repeating lookups, but repeating lookups use alot of VME
resources (ten times the cost of a scan).  Either way, I'll say its 0-9
in the document, the rest is an internal issue.

I'm not sure the kernel needs to check pointers, it will find out if
they are invalid when it references them.  Data structure inconcistencies
have always been the most severe type of crash on the Tymcom-X.  By the
time we noticed that a linked list looped, or something like that, there
were usually so many other things screwed up that there was no way to
recover.  If you consider what has to go wrong to damage, a data base
for example, it usually involves some module that shouldn't be accessing
it at all scribbling in the wrong place.  Assuming the code that updates
the data base is correct (which is reasonable since it is usually very
simple and can be subjected to formal proofs) then its only a hardware
failure or another section of code that can screw it up.  Reinitializing
the victim is usually fruitless and there is no way to determine who
actually did the corruption.  I strongly suggest crash on data structure
inconsistency.  If its a fixable problem, the crash will fix it and
make useful information available to support staff, not crashing may
cause data integrity errors (undetected) and just have things limp along.
There are also few cases where you can reinitialize part of the kernel
data base without seriously confusing the patron.  For example we can
not reinitialize the symbol table or the TSAP data base because there
is no way to recover the data from the patron and other processes.  I
also think it will be a very rare thing in Rodney, running in ROM on
a single board computer.  Enough soap box.  -Bill

Well, yet another somewhat biased, but mostly accurate opinion.  One thing
I have noticed about the circumcision issue is that every discussion I've
heard quotes different "facts" and consists of about 66% emotional bias.
I don't really disagree with anything he said, just his style (and that of
the only reference he quoted).  Anyway, its past the 8th day, so the point
is mute.  I only feel unconfortable with the decision because I feel I've
been unable to collect accurate information, however I have certainly
collected alot of dubious information.  Sigh.  One last note on your comment
about being more sensitive when circumcised, there were two cases quoted in
one of the books we read of adults being circumcised by choice.  One was
very happy and one felt it ruined his sex life, but they both agreed that
it made them less sensitive.  -Bill

SINCE SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF PROBLEMS EXISTED WITH THE ACCESS#USERNAME, I HAVE

FOLLOWS:

I HAVE A USERNAME CALLED ACCESSNUM ON SYSTEM 38.  UNDER THAT USERNAEME THE
REQUIRED MAGNUM PROGRAM PLUS RELATIONS WILL BE RESIDENT.  I HAVE SET O UP
THE MAGNUM TO LOAD AND RUN AUTOMATICALLY.  THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE

LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS ON THIS.

Subject: the Rodney utcGet() function 

Bill,
In the description for the Rodney utcGet() function, you say that
the slow and fast clock values that are returned are "consistent"
with each other.  What does this mean?  Specifically, does this mean
they are synchronized with each other?  Alfred would like to be able
to get values that are synchronized (or enough info to synchronous
the two itself) for the printing of timestamps to the millisecond
level.

I am concerned about the use of MAGNUM for several reasons.  First it is
not a supported product.  Second it is prone to altering the environment
and possibly defeating the security measures.  Third, there is nobody to
work with to verify or correct these problems.  Fourth, it is very
expensive.  I would consider volunteering my services to write a SAIL
program to provide the required services.  I believe this would be a
relatively minor effort which would have a considerable payoff.  The
second suggestion is to incorporate it into the INFORMATION username.
If it was not in MAGNUM, this would be simple and would reduce the
security exposure by having only one environment to worry about.  Please
let me know your thoughts on this.  Thanks -Bill

They are synchronized in the sense that the expression
	utc * 1000000 + fastc % 1000000
whould yield the number of microseconds past the origin date if the
machine actually had a word size long enough to compute it.  Put
another way, at the theoretical instant when utc is incrimented,
then (fastc % 1000000 == 0).  Is this what you need?
-Bill

PS - don't forget to do something to make reading the pair atomic or
you will get occasional off by 1 second errors.  You could use MOVEM.L
or a read,read,compare loop.

Lynn,
I've checked out the ACCESS.NUM program on 38, and I've found several
problems with the data that we should talk about.  I also finished a
SAIL program which is functionally similar to the MAGNUM program, but
since it uses the same data, it suffers from the same problems which
I will mention.  In short, I've found areas that have local access which
are not in the file, and I've found cases where the number listed is
out of the area even though a number exists in the same central office.
Examples:
	408-980 says closest is 415-Fremont, but what about 409-980-8100?
	716-745 says no local, but 716-285 is local.

Thanks, that's exactly what I need.  What happens to fastc during
seconds that are half-length or double-length for correction?
Also, my copy of the Rodney doc does not show fastc anywhere in the
glob, may I assume that it will be placed right next to utc?

Subject: kernel scheduler 

I have 2 questions regarding to the kernel scheduler:
  1. While playin your testing program with the dbx, I found that the dbx
     was acting funny.  Although I ignored the ALRM, I am not sure if this
     has anything to do with the setjmp and longjmp.

  2. Is there a possibility that one may want to cancel a sleeping process?
     If yes, then k_sleep needs to return the reqid.

TUMS was unble to deliver to the Unix systems (including opus) since all
mail into and out of the Unix world is routed through tymix and tymix has been
down due to the move.  All the mail bound to Unix from TUMS (including
Ontyme) has been queued and should be delivered to you by now.  Unix on the
otherhand returns any mail that hasn't been delivered in 3 days to the sender
so mail sent from a Unix system to TUMS (inclusing Ontyme) has likely been
returned to its sender on Unix.  If it isn't returned, it is probably delivered
by now (i.e. mailsent within the last 3 days).  Let me know if there is any
further problem.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: ICON 


I made it back to Dallas safely.  It only took 56 hours once I got on the
road.  Had to have Constant Velocity joints (what ever those are) replaced
before I could start.  The most interesting part of the trip was a brief hail
storm in New Mexico.  I had a very full car - no room for hitch hikers - but
decided to stop anyway when I saw two figures being pelted with hunks of ice.
Managed to move enough stuff from passenger seat to the back so that the two
of them could just squeeze in out of the storm.  Good thing they were small.
It turned out to be a couple of Navaho girls;  cousins hitching back to the
reservation from Phoenix.  Went to a resturant for lunch;  They decided not
to try for a more spacious ride so I took them all the way to the reservation.
It was a good cross-cultural experience.  I learned, and have since forgotten,
a bit of Navaho.  Also learned a lot about relating to 'minority' people.
Though I have had some experience and a lot of training I have never had an
opportunity quite like this one before.  It is hard to communicate very much
in a couple of hours but we did amazingly well.

Oops got to go soon and I wanted to give you some ICON addresses:

ARPA:	icon-project@arizona.EDU
UUCP:	...{allegra, ihnp4, noao}!arizona!icon-project

FTP from /usr/ftp/icon on arizona.EDU

That out to do it.  I have postal address if you need it.

I'll try to get on birdix later.

see you.

Thanks for the info on icon, the latest manual for 4.3 BSD includes a

be that it is distributed along with 4.3 BSD.  I'll look for your mail

Bill, I have a hunch that you will receive three notes from this test. The
check sum depending on how you do it may find a difference in the last line of
the note PROFS creates. It has a hex field that can be used for number of
copies of the note. It is not always consistant, so you cant use it to
eliminate duplicate notes, but it may be enough to fake out your newest mod to
identify copies. I thought of this after your last phone conversation and
thought I had better do a test and not leave it to the user that reported the
problem.
Have a good day,
Carol

   macros should be included in a psroff/MM package for standard
   NTD documentation styles, such as internal memoranda and 
   development documents. We will discuss the "STDDFS.MM" macro 
   package and its various versions. We will also discuss other
   topics such as index, change bar, and graphs. Yes, we will 
   also like to be able to update the status of our efforts to
   upgrade DWB software to release 2.0 by the meeting time.

Subject: Clock Wrapping and MCC68k 


For your information in using Microtec C compiler:


				    MEMO

To:	Dan Lasater

From:	Dave Smith

Date:	Sept 3, 1987

Subj:	Clock wrapping in C

=============================================================================

There is a problem in C programs on the 68020 when the usual relational
operators >, >=, <, <= are used to compare two values of a clock or other
variable that can wrap from positive to negative and back to positive.
The problem is that if the variables are declared to be unsigned, then the
test fails when they wrap from negative to positive and if they are declared
signed, the test fails when they wrap from positive to negative.

The reason this is a problem on the 68020 and wasn't on the Engine is that
the Microtec C compiler uses the 68020 BGT, BGE, BLT, and BLE instructions
for signed compares.  These instructions take into account the value of the
overflow flag as well as the sign bit when deciding when to branch (see the
appendix below).  The Engine did not have an overflow flag, so this was never
even a consideration.  The 68020 also has instructions that test only the
sign bit, but there seems to be no compiler-independent way to get the
compiler to use them.

The solution is to use assembler routines to compare the values of two clocks
or other such variables.  The following routines are defined in the file
/usr/hobbes/skyisis/src/lib/clkcmp.s under SCCS for the Microtec assembler
and are also available for the Sun assembler:

	clkgt(arg1, arg2)
	clkge(arg1, arg2)
	clklt(arg1, arg2)
	clkle(arg1, arg2)

They each return 1 if the first argument has the indicated relationship with
respect to the second argument, or 0 if it does not.  Note that the equal and
not-equal tests do not have this problem and can use the regular test
operators.

Please make all Skywalker developers aware of this problem and the solution.

Neg-to-pos: 00000001 - FFFFFFFE = 3, N=0, V=0, C=1

In both cases, the first value is larger than the second for a continuously
incrementing clock.  The Negative flag indicates this, but the oVerflow
flag is on in the first case and that causes the BGT, BGE, BLT, and BLE
instructions to consider the Negative flag wrong, thus signed compares
do not work; the BPL and BMI instructions ignore the oVerflow flag and
would work fine.  The Carry flag is wrong in the second case, so unsigned
compares do not work.

Subject: Re: Clock Wrapping and MCC68k 

Bill,
The problem is NOT a compiler bug; the compiler should do what it does in
most instances, since that will give the correct result for an arithmetic
compare even if there is an overflow.  The problem is that a comparison of
a clock is not strictly an arithmetic or a logical comparison.
Your first "work around" will work only if the compiler generates a MOVE
instruction to save the result of the subtract; a smart compiler (I'm not
sure if ours is smart enough) might assign the variable CompareKludge to
the same register that the subtract is done in and no MOVE would be
necessary.
Your second "work around" requires that you know the length of the variables
being compared to get the right value of SignBit.  Using a subroutine
eliminates this problem (at least for char, short, int, & long).  It
also makes it very explicit that an unusual type of comparison is being
performed.
Dave.

I agree that (a < b) behaving as indicated is not a bug, however, I was
refering to ((a - b) < 0) being a bug as indicated.  You might argue that
in the case of overflow, the results need not be defined, but when you
add the variable to save the partial result, ((c = a - b) < 0), it is
very clear that this should produce the same result (no matter what) as
the case without the c =, which it does not.

I agree my suggested work arounds are obscure, but the case
	(kludge = a - b) < 0
should always work assuming that MICROTEC does not change their optomizer
without fixing the bug first.  A hypothetical other compiler can be
assumed to not have the bug so having the register "assigned" would not
matter.  That beside the point, since I went and looked up my bug
report, I remembered a still better work around:
	long zero = 0L;
	... (a - b) < zero ...

The subroutine call is clearly the cleanest style, but it is relatively
expensive and since this is usually a problem for clocks and is running
at interrupt level, that may be a concern.  Perhaps a macro could give
the best of both?

-Bill

PS - I suppose we should finalize on something so if you want to publish
a summary to the mailing list, feel free to do so and I'll shut up.  Also
below is a copy of my bug report to MICROTEC (and SUN).

/*
 * Incorrect and inconsistent results are produced when the value of an
 * expression whose evaluation causes overflow is compared with zero as
 * demonstrated by the following program.  The generated code sequence is
 *	move.l	_a,d0
 *	sub.l	_b,d0
 *	bge	label
 * but should be either
 *	move.l	_a,d0
 *	sub.l	_b,d0
 *	bpl	label
 * or
 *	move.l	_a,d0
 *	sub.l	_b,d0
 *	cmp.l	d0,#0
 *	bge	label
 * of which the first form is obviously prefered.  The code generator
 * appearently assumes that
 *	((a - b) < 0) == (a < b)
 * which is only true when -infinity <= (a - b) <= +infinity and therefore
 * does not cause overflow.

No, I didn't get your mail, but I see it in the log (Thu 10:06 AM).  Some
errant program on system 70 sent me slightly over 6 megabytes of garbage
yesterday and it probably got lost in the shuffle.  I tried to go through
the file with GREP to see if there were any legitimate messages
interspersed but I must have overlooked yours.  I did get a message from
Mark - at first glance I see no problem with his suggestion.

I've been trying to get caught up this week on the clock internal design
and have clearly underestimated the size of the task.  None the less it
will be done by Monday morning (barring natural disaster or nuclear war).
The implementation is probably overestimated so it may balance out in the
long run.

Have a nice weekend.

Subject: Public addresses 

Hello, Bill.
We had a meeting on Friday regarding the hardware change and you proposals
on the public addresses. I also sent you a mail on Friday, but since I
have no response it sounds like it did not reach you. Please, disregard
this mail if you got the first one.

What I whould like to suggest instead of your proposal is to have our
pulic address equal to Tadpole physical (as per recently received
documentation). Notice, this is not the proposal to do away with the
concept of the public address, just make it equal to Tadpole physical
for Release I. This may have some advantages. For example, the monitor
should work since RAM is not relocated this way. Anything else in Rodney
related to pre-MMU RAM usage could also be simplified.

At any rate, I would like to understand the reasons why a lot of things
should be relocated if my proposal is unacceptable. Before we had
problems with the location of Plessey VME extended and 1M resolution
requirement. Since both went away at the moment, I do not see why the
relocation is necessary or what could be the advantage of doing that.

      Best regards
               Mark Akselrod

Subject: Question I have 


Bill, I have the following questions:

(1) Is it necesaary to do a RETRY in handling bus error routine ?

    I have been questioning Mike Mo whether GP will get a bus error when

    it wants to talk to another GP, while the bus is busy ( or saturated ).

    His answer is NO, and he also get a confirmation from the vendor.

    So, why do we need to do a retry ?  
    
    If the device is not there ( or hardware/memory problems ) which causes 
    
    the bus error, retry is not going to help. If the bus error happens to be 
    
    a VME data reference, we may start ACCUSSING the non-responding GP/IOCP.
    
(2) The interface to your bus error handling routines is not clear to me.

    Need to discuss this more.

    - rkBerrBegin
    - rkBerrEnd
    - BusError


(3) The final MEMORY/IO map for RODNEY/ISIS.

There is no good way, the calls program helps you do it by hand by
showing you how things nest.  Its in ~wrs/bin and there is a manual
in ~wrs/man (put it in your MANPATH and do a man calls).  -Bill

How is the GP boardname defined.  The Rodney Arch spec has it as
CPP0, CPP1, etc., this doesn't look right.

Stack size is a problem.  Only you can determine that.  I suggest using the
program ~wrs/bin/calls to analize the nesting of your code and then go in
and add up (by hand) the sizes of variables and stuff allocated by each fn.
Come by in the afternoon and I can shed some more light on this terribly
painful subject.  I have a 2:00 so 3 or 3:30 should be good.  -Bill

Overview:

Security is a major concern in all areas of the Network.  From
restricting access to the Network to restricting the range of
capabilities a user has once a successful connection is made to a
host, security is a concern.  This proposal seeks to address one part
of the security picture.

Today, all users on the PDP Code Genning Systems have the capability to
| access the NAD program in the (SYS) directory.  This program has read
| file license (RF) assigned to it.  With RF license, any user has the
| capability of accessing any file on the PDP through the NAD program.

| What this proposal seeks to control is really two fold.  First, it will
| restrict which users are allowed to use the NAD program.  This will
| restrict users without RF license from accessing files on the PDP they
| should not access.  Secondly, users who are allowed to access the NAD
| program and gen code but should not create code listing will be
| restricted from performing the listing function.


Goals and Compromises:

The ultimate goal for the implementation of restricted access was to
disallow access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories from all
users except those that require access.  Those requiring access include
all field and Headquarters support people; Project Implementation; the
Field Service Organization; Customers who, by contract, are allowed
access; the Headquarters Quality Assurance group; and the development
organization.  Groups that required access only to a limited set of
files in the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories would then be
restricted on a file by file basis.  For example, Customer A has in
their contract a license to gen X.25, Node Code and ISIS.  They would be
allowed access to only the source for this code and be barred access to
the remaining source code files.

Unfortunately, barring access down to a per file per user basis is not
possible under current TYMCOM-X limitations.  This capability would
require modifications to the Operating System.  What is possible is to
restrict access to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories as a whole
and restrict access to some of the capabilities of the NAD program. 
Thus, restricting access on a more limited basis is possible.

After the restructuring of the PDP systems, as will be documented,
restriction to the (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories will be on
a per user basis.  Certain users will be barred from being able to
create listings of the source code and will be able to only write files
into their own directories.  They will not be able to over-write files
| of any other users and will be restricted from accessing files that are
| protected and not in the (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) directories.



Restructuring with Restrictions:

There are copies of the code genning program, NAD, on all PDP Code Genning
Systems.  One NAD is the aforementioned copy in the (SYS) directory.
| The second NAD is the copy in the (SOURCE) directory.  Both of these
| copies are identical.  They are both assigned Read File license.

There is also an important feature of NAD that is part of this
restructuring.  If a user lacks TYM license, NAD will not allow that
user to create listings of the source code.  Currently, most users that
gen code have TYM license.  They are able to both gen code and create
listings of the source code.

The changes proposed to create tighter controls on the capabilities of
users on the PDP Code Genning Systems are:

| 1.  Make modifications to the NAD program so the NAD program in the
|     (SYS) directory will only be a verification program for access
|     control.  The NAD program in (SYS) will verify the user attempting
|     to call the NAD program is validated on a GOODGUY list.  If valid,
|     the user will be routed to the real NAD program in the (SOURCE)
|     directory.  The (SYS)NAD program will be given ALL RD RD
|     restrictions.  (NOTE:  This is a common practice for programs on the
|     PDP's today.)
| 
| 2.  Place protections on NAD in the (SOURCE) directory so it can not be
|     called directly unless the user can override the restrictions with
|     their own license.  This is will prevent users (such as customers)
|     without proper license from accessing the (SOURCE) NAD program
|     directly.
| 
| 3.  Modify the NAD program in the (SOURCE) directory to set Read File
|     license selectively.  When running NAD, the NAD program will set
|     Read File license if it is attempting to read a file in the
|     (SOURCE) or (BETATEST) directories.  If it is instructed to read a
|     file in any other directory, it will not set Read File license.
|     This will require any file that needs to be read by NAD to have the
|     proper protection to allow it to be read by all users.  This
|     includes files such as patches in other directories or special
|     source files in other directories.  The purpose of this is to not
|     allow users to use the Read File license of NAD to access files they
|     should not have access to.
| 
| 4.  Each customer will be placed in their own GAN.  This will restrict
|     them from being able to look at files in any directory but ones in
|     their own GAN.

| 5.  Remove TYM license from users who should not be able to create
|     listings of the source code.
| 
| 6.  The (SOURCE) and (BETATEST) directories should have directory access
|     protection of  SHARABLE and LISTABLE only.  They currently have
|     SHARABLE, LISTABLE and NEW FILES. 



| When these changes are complete, users not on the NAD GOODGUY list and
| without proper license will not have access to the NAD program.  Without
| the TYM license, they would be unable to create listings of the source
code.  Without the additional licenses on the NAD program they would be
unable to over-write files not in their own directory.  With directory 
access set, users will be prevented from writing into the (SOURCE) and
(BETATEST) directories.

With the current protections placed on all (SOURCE) and (BETATEST)
source code, users without the proper license will not have access to
the files in these directories.  They would be restricted from even
viewing the source files.

| Without proper license, users will not be able to view other users files
| in directories under different GANs.


Concerns and Questions:

PEAK and VUE, the text editors on the PDP's, require modification if they
are to be used by users that do not have TYM license.

Who will be tracking the change of GANs for the customers?

Who will identify the customers requiring these changes?

| An access list will have to be maintained for the (SYS)NAD program.

The project was canceled before anyone wrote TUMS.HLP, so...  there is
actually no documentation.  If he wants his Ontymes forwarded, he just
needs to send me his ontyme name, password and PDP-10 user name.  It is
somewhat expensive, so I don't want to do a whole bunch, but a few is OK.
There is no interface at this time to the 370 except through PROFS which
I think they are not running.  If he is in the MDC PROFS system, he can
send mail to the PDP-10 via PROFS by sending a NOTE (must be a note) to
the address TUMSGATE SLVMCL1 and including the real destination address
in the first line of the note as follows (for example):

To: Bill SOley <WRS@B39.Tymnet> (TUMS)

The "To:" must begin in column 1 and the (TUMS) must not have any
trailing blanks.  He can send to multiple addresses this way, by
just seperating them with commas or using multiple To: lines or both.
He can also leave out the name and <>...

Bill
I got a C problem:
when I declare - static char bb[20];
and later say bb[20] = "ABCD" the compiler does no like it.
I know it would probably prefer -
char *bb
and later - bb = "ABCD" but I need real string rather then pointers
since later I want to append something at the end of that string (add
a few characters).
what is a "safe" way to initialize a string?

This is the hardest part of C to master, but once mastered, it is the
most powerful.  'C' works on data types.  There are three data types
relavent to our discussion:
	char	c;		/* character */
	char	*pc;		/* pointer to character */
	char	ac[10];		/* array of characters */
It is very important to understand their differences.  The character is
the simplest.  When you declare a character, the compiler allocates one
byte of memory and gives it the name declared.  In assembler, this would
look like:
	c:	dc.b	0
When you declare a pointer to a character, the compiler allocates a long
word of memory and gives it the name desired.  In assembler, this would
look like:
	pc:	dc.l	0
Finally, when you declare an array of characters, the compiler allocates
space for all the elements of the array, and gives the first element the
name desired.  In assembler, this would look like:
	ac:	ds.b	10

It gets complicated, but 'C' keeps track of the type of each identifier
in its symbol table, so whenever "c" appears in an expression, it knows
that it is a location in memory that contains a character.  Likewise, it
knows that "pc" is a location in memory that contains the address of a
location in memory that contains a character.  Finally, it knows that
"ac" is a location in memory that contains the first character of an
array of characters (but it doesn't keep track of how many).

Now, if you want to use "pc", you have to give it some value.  That all
depends on what you're using it for.  Remember that it's just a pointer
and it doesn't have in itself any space to store a character.  If you
want to, for example, build a string that contains the concatenation
of two strings, lets say "abcd" and "efgh", you might do this:

	char	buffer[9];	/* room for both strings plus a null */
	strcpy(buffer, "abcd");	/* copy abcd into buffer */
	strcat(buffer, "efgh");	/* concatenate efgh to the end */

Now, "abcd" is just like a character array that is initialized to
'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', '\0' at compile time.  In particular it is
a pointer to an area in ROM that contains the character 'a'.  In
the next location in ROM is 'b', then 'c', and so on.  So if you
had a pointer to the first character of an array that contained
one of the above strings, it could be used in the same way:

	char	abcd[] = "abcd";
	char	buffer[9];	/* room for both strings plus a null */
	strcpy(buffer, abcd);	/* copy abcd into buffer */
	strcat(buffer, "efgh");	/* concatenate efgh to the end */

Of course, when you do this, abcd[] is probably something that is
passed as an argument to a function or out of some data structure
or something.  I just used an initialized array for an example.
You must be careful to make sure there is enough space for the string
that is being copied in.  For example, in the above example, if abcd
actually pointed to a string of length 5, lets say "abcdx", then you
would end up with buffer containing 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'x', 'e',
'f', 'g', 'h' and the null would be stored in whatever variable happened
to be allocated next in memory (you can't predict).  This is a very
common bug and you need to be very careful.  "C" does not ever do any
array bounds checking.  

Getting more to your message:
----------------------------------------------------------------
>  when I declare - static char bb[20];
>  and later say bb[20] = "ABCD" the compiler does no like it.

I don't blame it, "bb" is an array of characters, "bb[20]" is
the character after the last character of the array (illegal),
and '"ABCD"' is a pointer to a character.  So you're trying to
assign a pointer to a character - type mismatch!

>  I know it would probably prefer -
>  char *bb
>  and later - bb = "ABCD" but I need real string rather then pointers

Well, this is syntactically correct, but if you try to append to it
you'll actually be appending to the constant string "ABCD" which is
stored in ROM so that won't work.  I think what you want is

	char	buffer[123];
	strcpy(buffer, "ABCD");
	strcat(buffer, whatever);

"C" Won't copy strings (structs, yes, but not strings)  You have to
write a loop or use a library sunction like strcat.  See the Microtec
manual for a writeup of strcpy, strcat, etc.

by the way, I have seen examples of declarations like that:
static char qq[10] = "hello !"
so I reckoned the same can be done in the flow of the program - and
this is apparently not so. (page 387 "C primer"). so what such a
declaration actually does - loads array or initialize pointer ?

char qq[10] = "hello"; 
is a kludge to make life easier ... it really does
char qq[10] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
however,
char *qq = "hello";
initializes qq with the address of 'h' 'e' ... 'o' '\0'

BEWARE though that initialized anything will go in ROM so if you do
	char qq[10] = "hello";
and then try to append to it with
	strcat(qq, " there");
you'll just get a bus error.

Subject: module symbols 

/*
 * Pat- Please review before I distribute. -Bill
 */

Naming symbols inside Rodney should follow some agreed upon convention to
make things more consistent and less confusing.  The following is favored
by Pat and myself:

System calls begin with some functional group identifier as a prefix, but
do not have an underscore, for example:
	slgReport, ipcfEnter, symEnter, etc.

Symbols which are internal to a module (and declared static) can be named
as appropriate.  Symbols which are global to Rodney, but not available to
the patron, should be named with a short identifer of the module, followed
by an underscore, for example:
	k_reset, l_crash, s_zap, etc.
The modules would be:
	a_	agent
	b_	boot
	i_	ipcf
	k_	kernel
	l_	logger
	s_	session
	ss_	skysap
One character should be used unless it conflicts or is confusing.  The
first character following the _ is capitalized as if the prefix was not
present, for example:
	int k_scaler;
	struct k_Structure
	#define k_CONSTANT

Things which transcend modules or are frequently used and well known need
not have a module prefix, for example:
	glob, RERR_FOO, etc.

Subject: Sun Unix documentation 

Do you think having complete documentation about the Unix tools and
environment readily available at one's fingertips might improve a
programmer's productivity by ... say four tenths of one percent?

It is certainly not hard to imagine that such a resource would be able
to save the average programmer 9.6 minutes per week.  In addition to
reducing unproductive time spent wandering about looking for the right
document, usually interrupting other people to ask questions, there is
also the less tangible but more important aspect of producing higher
quality work and reducing support costs.

I suggest we order a complete Sun manual for each programmer.  The
cost may seem high, but it is clearly recovered in under a year.  In
the Skywalker project many programmers are using Unix for the first
time and I believe their learning curve to be a significant risk to
meeting the schedule.  Readily available documentation will reduce
that risk.

Bill,

  Good luck on the delivery.  There are no words sufficient to
describe the event.

  On checking pointers, if an MMU violation occurs because the
Patron gave a Rodney process a bad pointer, will the Rodney
process be able to recover and return a Rodney error code?
How will the MMU error handling code know that a process
was using a tainted pointer provided by some other process
as opposed to corrupting it's own pointer?

  Your comments on crashing on detecting internal data structure
inconsistencies make sense.  My comment about checking provided
pointers follows an additional philosophy, i.e. never (almost)
crashing on external error events, such as protocol violations,
bad function call codes or parameters, etc.

  Off of my soapbox now.

Subject: TUMSGATE Problems 

  Bill I the messges you sent me indicate that the 191 disk was having
problems which I think I caused. I was trying to look at the TUMSGATE NETLOG to
determine how many copies of a memo was being sent out through TUMSGSGATE. The
file is A0 so I linked it MW, which has been ok in the past if done VERY
carefully. It certainly is not a recommended procedure and we do it only when
we are sure that we do not make changes on the disk at the same time the other
user is writing to the disk. I suspect since the advent of Release 4 of CMS
that the "rules are changed" making this an absolute no no since the log file
was messed up. I renamed it yesterday and restarted a new file but have not
dared to look to see if everything is back to normal. Could look at the file
and let me know if it is functioning properly again?
  Is there a problem making the NETLOG an A1 file for debugging purposes? Also
wondered if you could give me a "safe" way of interrupting TUMSGATE and
looking for problems. How could I determine from this side if the id is busy
handling mail going either direction? That would be a handy feature.
  I suspect the looping problem was the mixed up 191 disk, but the multiple
copies of a message is still with us.  I will forward a note from Ed Roop
explaining the problem.  Have you been able to look into this one further.
   I would like your help in getting smarter about TUMSGATE so I go about
debugging things safely.  Any suggestions or instructions would be welcome.
Thankyou,
Carol

SUBJECT> NTD MOVE TO NEW FACILITIES
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The results of the most recent move negotiations from this morning are as
follows:
 
NTD is expected to be moved in two phases.  The first phase will be for
those people destined for floors 3, 4, and 5 of the new building.
 
The move date for these three floors is Friday evening, July 31st.  Four
hours have been recommended for Friday afternoon to pack boxes.  However,
we have requested that boxes be delivered no later than Thursday, July
30th.
 
The second phase of the move will be for those people destined for floors 1
and 2.  The move date for this portion of NTD is Friday evening, August
14th.  Again, boxes have been requested for no later than Thursday, August
13th.
 
A variety of options have been looked at to reduce employee disruption as
much as possible.  However, it appears necessary to move some of the steel
case furniture work surfaces in advance of the main move.  This requirement
will impact 48 people in Building F and 7 people using freestanding steel
case work surfaces in Building D.  It is intended to move only work sur-
faces early, not partitions or shelving.  Cubicle lighting, power, and ter-
minal connections should not be affected.  It is the intent to replace the
work surface with a temporary desk until the main move on July 31st.
 
Unfortunately the early moving of the work surfaces requires more immediate
attention.  Work surfaces are to be removed on the evening of July 16th
which requires that those employees affected have their possessions removed
from the work surfaces and its associated drawers by the afternoon of July
16th.  Boxes have been requested to arrive late today or tomorrow.  Ter-
minals and phones need not be removed from the work surface.
 
In regard to the early removal and painting of other office furniture, a
detailed plan is not yet available as to which offices and pieces of furni-
ture are affected.  However, we have been assured that if we deem such
activity to be too disruptive, we can delay the painting until after the
move.

the sources are currently (for the rest of the week) on "bigmac", which

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following are the minutes from the Skywalker project status meeting
held Thursday July 16 at 1:30PM.
 
NEXT MEETING
------------
 
    Thursday July 23 at 1:30PM - Building D Conference Room
 
ATTENDEES
---------
 
    Dave Bliss     John Coons     Pat Driscoll     Dan Lasater    Gazel Tan
    Mike Stimac    Allyn Morriss
 
OLD BUSINESS
------------
 
1.  Status of the Tadpole requisition was believed signed by Mike Rude for
    Al Fenn and submitted to purchasing. John Coons was not sure if
    requisition was to be handled by Barbara Veigh or sent direct to VG1
                                                                Page  2

    Purchasing.
 
2.  John Coons has hired one consultant for IOCP bring up support.
    Another consultant was mentioned as additional requirement.
 
3.  No further status to report on Indian Hills coding style.
    Bill Soley has been kept busy with domestic matters.
 
4.  Regarding testing, most of the Skywalker team attended a Brown-bag
    presentation on test methodology given by Charlotte Hollander on 7/13.
    Several useful ideas were found to be applicable but current scheduling
    does not make allowance for the time needed to test with this level
    of vigor using this procedure. Suggest a further discussion of this
    and sizing of the schedule impact if methods are adopted.
 
5.  Action on 68851 PMMU was completed by Bliss with copy of issues sent
    to Dan Lasater.
 
6.  Concerning a/NTDDOC/SKY for storage of Skywalker documents under UNIX,
    Allyn Morriss took an action item to meet with Alex Ting for better
    understanding of what would be involved. Broader issue of document
    transmittal and control was mentioned and its similaries with software
    library service by Allyn. This action clearly falls in Sheldon Cohen's
    area and procedures will be drafted after clearer picture is known.
 
7.  To restate from last week's minutes, software development has requested
    a test bed on 4th Floor with 2 GPs in the mini-lab. Engineering has
    no problem and Sandy McFarland has been apprised.
 
8.  Schedules were requested of those not having them available last week.
    Those received were placed in Ken Holcomb's office by Allyn Morriss.
 
9.  Regarding SUN documentation, Mike Stimac has prepared a memo stating
    the subset document requirements he recommends for developers.
    Decision to stock each floor of new facility with complete set rests
    with Al Fenn. See additional comments under New Business.
 
10. Export Compliance. See New Business.
 
11. Nothing to report on Microtec Compiler vs SUN. John Kofp was
    to work with Mike Stimac to identify differences, document and provide
    solutions.
 
12. Security on Eunix as reported by John Kopf was discussed.
    Mike Stimac had not received memo from Ken detailing John's concerns
    but both Dan Lasater and John Coons made it clear that all command
    capability is to be eliminated from the logon prompt on the VAX
    implementation of UNIX.
 
13. Complete Skywalker Documents list NOT INCLUDED here.
 
NEW BUSINESS
------------
 
1.  Dave Bliss met with Pleasey to assess them as alternative to Tadpole.
    Pleasey is the more experience manufacturer but has restrictive
    manufacturer's rights. Tadpole contracts out much of its manufacturing
    and is less restrictive as to rights.
                                                                Page  3

 
2.  Update on export compliance draws attention to potential serious problem.
    Exporting of 32-bit technology is Okay for Western-allied countries.
    Sweden is regarded as 'neutral' country. This needs further investigation
    as pertains to Televerket.
 
3.  Bliss met with Bill Schrader and in the course of their meeting was
    shown a Skywalker Gantt chart that indicates 'Packaging
    Complete' on 8/87. Dave thinks the chart came from Mike Rebmann.
 
4.  Coons spoke of Consultant's comments on physical port & IOC board
    mapping. More discussion is suggested since John hurriedly left for
    another meeting at this point saying he would speak further w/ Dave Bliss.
 
5.  Pat had serious concerns over the readiness of test beds.
 
6.  Pat brought up the requirement for human interface to Skywalker utilities.
    File formatter and Logger were mentioned as examples. This was eliminated
    earlier from Alfred spec.
 
7.  Dan is worried about Laser printer compatibility between Xerox and Data
    Products. Xerox is not post-script and picture draw is a must.
    Another printer may be required.
 
8.  Dan called attention to Phase 2 development plans for Skywalker as
    relates to decisions needed for Engine enhancements as tradeoff or what
    might have to be implemented first on the Engine vs. later on Skywalker.
    ISIS work assignments in the near future will depend upon enhancements
    for the Engine vs ISIS68 for Skywalker. Seems like this has broader
    planning implications beyond ISIS development.
 
    Group felt that NTD should begin collecting ideas for Phase 2
    independent of Marketing to be assured that we have done our homework
    before waiting for discussions with Marketing.
 
9.  Mike Stimac says document reproduction rights is expected from SUN
    Microsystems this week. Group says need at least 50 copies of core documents
    to meet immediate needs of Skywalker developers. Eventually, 200 copies
    will be needed. Group would like control over who has what so updates
    can be distributed most effectively. Sounds like a NTD Library
    function although Group seemed to be looking at me to support this.

Putting your oper password in command files is no laughing
matter, Santa Claus.  I fixed your PERP job on 37 so it uses
the license feature in SUBMIT and took your name and password
out of the command file (TEST).  Of course, your TMCS pass-
word is still there, but I don't know what to do about that.
I hope I didn't screw anything up, so you may want to check
it.  

What brought this all on was a problem with the mail the job
was sending caliming it got an error.  Anyway, you may want
to create a MAIL.FWD on 37 as well so you'll get you PERP
mail.

From: Will Martin -- AMXAL-RI <wmartin@almsa-1.arpa>

Subject:  Pro-Space Publicity

I was just looking through a back issue (May '87) of GOVERNMENT EXECUTIVE 
magazine (I'm no executive, myself -- this was an extra copy discarded by the 
library in our building). Anyway, I would recommend that Space readers try to 
locate a copy of this issue, as there are a couple articles in it of particular
interest to you. One is on the management of the NASA Space Station program, 
but the primary one, and why I am posting this with the subject above, is an 
editorial column about how ABC and CBS refused to air a McDonnell 
Douglas-sponsored ad, prepared by J. Walter Thompson, in favor of the 
development of the US Space Station which dramatically displayed our current 
inferiority to the Soviets in space. It's on page 56, and pictures from the ad 
are on page 57. I'll quote a bit:

"... The video portion begins with a a shot of outer space and gradually, as a 
space station comes into view, the voice-over narrator says that 'Right now, in
space' medicines are being developed to cure disease, new materials are being 
developed that could revolutionize the quality of products manufactured on 
Earth and scientific discoveries are being made that could change history.

By the end of the script, a Battlestar Galactica-sized space ship fills the 
screen -- with a red star and the letters CCCP on it. Says the narrator, 
'Shouldn't we be there too? America needs the Space Station.'"

"...Budget limits said they could afford to buy time on only one Sunday morning
talk show and a few local-TV nightime news slots. [This explains why I had 
never seen this ad nor heard of it before now.-WM] The networks made that 
decision easy for them. Only NBC said it would run the ad. ABC and CBS turned 
it down, said it was 'too controversial'."

[About a half-page of discussion omitted, ending with comments on the role of 
the media to censor ads for various reasons.] "... When they deny expression of
'controversial' opinions they don't like, this Republic has a heap of trouble, 
folks." (editorial by C. W. Borklund, Editor-In-Chief)

I think the point here, related to recent discussion on this list, is that 
there HAVE been efforts out there to publicize the pro-space concerns voiced by
many of this list's participants. But much of this effort has been stifled and 
suppressed by enemies of the pro-space viewpoint. If someone with the clout of 
McDonnell Douglas can't get a professionally-produced ad on TV, what chance do 
private persons have of spreading the word with some kind of newsletter or 
lobbying effort? (Though the budget limits mentioned above indicate that McD-D 
wasn't putting much corporate might behind this -- I wonder if the networks 
would have been so quick to refuse a "media blitz" campaign, where McD-D would 
be buying a LOT of ads, not just a few?)

Anyway, I think a lot of the past weeks' posters/participants would find this 
editorial and the series of stills from the ad of great interest. Maybe McD-D 
would donate copies to other groups for dissemination in various ways, like 
local cable public-access channels? Be a shame to waste the production costs...

Regards,

Will Martin

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On August 5, there was damage done to the filing structure of host A:832
about an hour before the daily backup was made.  The next day OnTyme
support attempted to repair the damage.  At about noon on August 6 it was
apparent that the host was going to have to be completely restored, as the
errors found in the database were not recoverable.
 
From 1300 hours on August 6 until about 0900 hours on August 7 all messages
were restored, with the first message being from July 22.  At the same
time, it was attempted to restore all files from July 22.
 
The result is as follows:
 
  o All messages have been restored, but they are in an unread state.  The
    messages that are on the system now that are older than 14 days will be
    purged on the night of August 8.  Messages that were originally sent
    through InterOntyme will be resent, with resulting errors reported by
    SYSTEM.ONTYME II.
 
  o Most files have been restored.  It is known that 18 files that were
    backed up on July 30 are lost.  In addition, any changes to files
    between 1700 hrs PDT (2000 hrs EDT) on August 4 to 1700 hrs PDT (2000
    hrs EDT) on August 6 are lost.  All messages and files are in the order
    they were restored (by date).

We are sorry for the inconvience this has caused you.

          The status of the Tadpole requisition for Unix was signed by Mike
          Rude for Al Fenn and submitted to purchasing. John Coons  was not
          sure if  the requisition  was to  be handled  by Barbara Veigh or
          sent direct to VG1 Purchasing. Dave  Bliss indicates  that we can
          expect delivery from Tadpole around the end of August.
 
          The need  for another  consultant for  IOCP bring  up support was
          discussed. A decision was  made to  pursue this.  A consultant is
          scheduled to start 4-August. The consultant did come on board and
          is working half-time for two weeks and goes full time thereafter.
 
          It was decided to return the { as per Indian  Hills coding style.
          Dan Lasater  to update  coding procedures.  Check on status until
          complete. Dan stated that  the coding  procedures document should
          be updated on Monday if the online document can be found.
 
          Concerning a/NTDDOC/SKY  for storage of Skywalker documents under
          UNIX, Allyn Morriss took an action  item to  meet with  Alex Ting
          for  better  understanding  of  what  would  be  involved.  Allyn
          mentioned the broader issue  of document  transmittal and control
          and  its  similarities  with software library service. Procedures
          will be drafted after a  clearer  picture  is  known.  No further
          progress to report.

          Export  Compliance.  Stan  King  has been assigned this issue. We
          will check on the  status each  week. There  may be  some concern
          over exportation  of 32-bit  technology to a neutral country such
          as Sweden. This needs further investigation. Most of the form has
          been filled out. a couple of questions have arisen. Dave Bliss to
          get them to Ken. Ken has  organized  a  meeting  with  the Export
          Compliance people in Irvine on August 19.
 
          There appears  to be  some vaguely  defined problem  with how the
          Microtec Compiler incorporates H files.   John Kopf  to work with
          Michael  Stimac  to  identify  differences,  document  them,  and
          provide solutions if  possible.  Pam  Whitehurst  talked  to John
          Kopf.  Now  a  list  of  issues exist. The Microtec approach to a
          makefile is  incompatible with  other compilers.  Mike Stimac has
          agreed to  petition Microtec  to comply. Additional problems with
          the Microtec compiler were discussed with  in-line assembly code.
          There  are  some  problems  with  5.3 to 6.0 tools. All are being
          documented  and  forwarded  to  Julie  Stier  to  communicate  to
          Microtec. Ken  to check  with Julie  on forwarding of problems to
          Microtec. Julie has been doing this,  although she  currently has
          two problems which have not been sent on to Microtec.
 
          There appears to be an issues with the test beds. There is a plan
          in place. There is  weekly meeting  in Engineering  to review the
          status.  The  issue  on  disk  drives  on  CMF test beds has some
          financial impacts as well as  significant  impact  on  the Rodney
          schedule.  The  existing  drives  will be replaced with Skywalker
          drives. Susan Dyer will deal with  the financial  paper work. The
          current test  bed requirement was reviewed. It was broken down as
          follows.

          NAD testing would be done on test bed 1 or 2.
 
          BITS testing would be done on 4,5,6 or 7.
 
          XCOM testing requirements were not identified.
 
          There was a discussion on the requirement for  human interface to
          Skywalker utilities which have been eliminated from Alfred. These
          features are needed. Bits can  be  modified  to  add directories.
          There is no good solution for reading the log. Rodney to spec out
          file utilities additions to deliver after release 1.
 
          NTD needs to collect ideas for  phase two  of Skywalker.  BJC has
          agreed to be the clearing house for these ideas. We have received
          no input from IOCP, XCOM, BITS or NAD.
 
          Check with Engineering on the cost  update information requested.
          Ontyme with  update sent  to Marketing  on 30  July. Betty Jo has
          worked  out  some  sample  configurations  which   indicate  that
          materials cost  continue to come down from our original estimates
          and that we are very much inline with the Marketing Requirements.
 
          Mary Arnett  provided  NTD  with  a  Skywalker  Support  plan for
          Skywalker. I asked for comments and have received none.
 
          A new  revision of the Serial I/O Breakout HFS was distributed. A
          discussion of X.422  for  Skywalker.  It  was  decided  that DB25
          connectors  would  be  used  rather  than  some  form  of  37 pin
          connectors.  Version A.13 was approved.
 
          Pat  Driscoll   agreed  to   provide  libraries   for  the  X.409
          implementation being implemented in Rodney for other developers.
 
          Les Seltzer asked how other developers who were not involved with
          the original design  of  various  Skywalker  protocols  could get
          interpretations of  the designs. A procedure was worked out where
          the developers  would review  the documentation  and consult with
          Pat or Dan on any question. Dan further offered the suggestion to
          review the Video tape he made regarding Skywalker architecture.
 
          Schedule updated due to Ken by 14 August.

Would you know any reason for tymix givving errors on ontyme messages?
The major user name seen is your's, ntd.g/bubsy and ntd.d/ellenburg
(neither of which are in ntd).  I know you were working on tums, and I'm
not sure if this is related.  Dave Hopkins showed me a printout of very
frequent error messages.  Sorry I am not more explicit about the

Subject: Debugging the scheduler 

I need a way to disable the background (disable activation of processes on 
the run queue) in the scheduler upon command, for debugging purposes. 
Since I am using dbx and I already have conditional-compilation code in
the logger for debugging purposes, one way to do this would be to have
conditional debugging code in the scheduler which exits the scheduling
routine immediately if a boolean (also conditionally compiled) is on.  This
boolean could be set and unset by dbx.  Can you think of a simpler approach?
If not, could you add such code?
Thanks,
Ron

(I do not subscribe to sci.med, so forgive if this is an old topic. 
I Xposted since sci.med readers may have answers.)

Recent postings on product safety reminded me:

If you have or soon will have small children, throw away (not
just lock up) your Old English Furniture Polish.
I have been told (by a pediatrician and a pathologist (hi, bill!)) that
medical literature indicates this is an extremely frequent cause of
fatal poisoning in children. Evidently ipecac is no help because the
stuff is even more dangerous coming back out than staying in.

I heard of a child drinking some recently while the family was moving;
this was the kind of family that goes to the new house to install
childproof locks on the cabinets BEFORE moving in, and somehow the
child still got to it.

I don't know if it is just the scratch cover kind or all varieties,
but it is the Old English brand in particular. I also do not know if
the brand is more lethal, or just if packaging makes it more desirable
to children. (I would be interested if anyone does know, or has
information more accurate than my hearsay. Do any pediatricians
tell parents about this product?)

Thanks for sharing your story and warning.  We removed the bumper pads
from our son's crib when he was seven weeks old due to a close-call we had.
Recently, I had been considering re-installing them, but now I think
I'll throw them out.  For those who might benefit, I'll tell what happened 
when our son was seven weeks old.  I had left him in his crib for a while
while I was doing some housework.  After a short time, I went to check on
him and found that he had inched up to one of the corners of his crib and
had gotten his face pressed so tightly against the bumper pad that he 
couldn't breathe.  Babies that small can't move backwards, so he was
trapped.  We decided to remove the pads until he was more mobile.  

I've done some checking around on product safety, and found a toll-free
number you can call to get free information about Nursery safety, crib
safety, toy safety, or any kind of product safety you want.  The number
is for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  It is: 
800-638-CPSC.  You can also write to: 
	
		U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
		Washington, D.C.  20207	

The above phone number and address are also the ones to use if you want
to report a product hazard or product-related injury.  

I also found a separate address and phone numbers for information about
toy safety:  
		TOYS
		Washington, D.C.  20207

		ph:  800-638-8326  Maryland only: 800-492-8363
		Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands: 800-638-8333

I called the CPSC when we decided to build our own crib, and found them 
very helpful.  We received the information in less than two weeks.  
They also sent a lot of information we hadn't asked for, but which proved
to be quite valuable.  We got a booklet called "The Safe Nursery", 
which describes unsafe features in baby furniture and accessories, 
and includes a safety checklist to use as a guide when buying new or 
secondhand nursery equipment.  We also received a story book called 
"Little Leon the Lizard" which contains several stories to read to 
preschoolers.  The stories teach children the importance of not playing 
with broken toys, not climbing into chests or old refrigerators, etc.  


I hope someone finds the above information useful.

Although we are cautioned not to regard the new machine as a general purpose 
gateway, does this mean that we (Augment users) can substitute @uunet.uu.net 
for @uucp.css.gov after 1 Sep in the hopes that mail will go through??  Is 
there anyway of telling which UUCP hosts have registered with uunet?  (maybe 
they ave a NIC?? that can be queried??)

Is uunet.uu.net now known to our host tables??  If not, it probably should be. 
I've seen incoming mail with that domain recently.

Following is a list of bugs so far reported to microtec:

Microtec MCC68k version 5.2A - Unix bsd 4.3

* Inconsistent handling of include files between the cc compiler and
the mcc68k compiler which involves specifying the path in the source
code for the include files in some circumstances.  The result 
hampers portability.  The bug was submitted by John Kopf. 


Microtec MCC68k version 6.1A - Unix bsd 4.2

* Version 6.1A does not handle comment statements properly in some 
cases, causing incompatibility problems with source code which assembles
properly with version 5.2A.  In version 6.1A, if the asterisk is not in 
column 1, an ERROR:(528) Invalid Opcode  is gererated and NOP's are
inserted into the object file.  The bug was submitted by John Coons.


* Incorrect and inconsistent results are produced when the value of 
an expression whose evaluation causes overflow is compared with zero.
This bug was submitted by Bill Soley.


* The compiler generates a short branch around some in-line
assembly code when it should generate a long jump.  This bug was
discovered by Ed Gauci and submitted by Pam Whitehurst.



For all of the above problems I have more details on the problem and
most have source code, output and assembly listings available to 
examine.

Subject: PERPOPER 

I just got about 2500 pages (disk) of mail from system 70 that was
returned to PERPOPER because some bimbo never reads his mail but has
6,123,472 perp jobs that run every 4 seconds.  Anyway, I noticed that
systems 29, 55 and 70 didn't have a mail.fwd in (perpoper) so I created
an empty one.  This will send all the mail to the bit bucket rather
than me.  I noticed on the other systems, you had it going to a file,
but I wasn't sure that was a good idea given the huge volume of stuff
that seems to be happening.  Anyway, change it if you want, just PLEASE
make sure it goes somewhere other than to me.  Wasn't sure you knew
about the empty mail.fwd feature.  -Bill

down and fix it with your cooperation.

Please send me a note the same way you sent it to 2336696@tms only use
my address <wrs@b39.tymnet> in its place.  If there is anything that you
can think of unusual about the way you sent that message, please include
that in the message.  In particular, is anything unusual about your

     RE:  PUBLIC NETWORK - X.121 NUMBERING PLAN
          MEETING MINUTES - 28 JULY 1987
     
     ********************************************************************
     
          The Public Network X.121 Numbering Plan meeting was started off
     with a brief introduction by Jeff Oliveto on what the numbering plan
     is and how it affects Tymnet.  The following is a brief description
     of some of the discussion items:
     
        o Current numbering  plan (ADR1)  has duplication of purpose
          between  addressing   formats,  specifically  between  the
          "determination digits", `0' and `9'.
          
        o ADR1 Numbering Plan specifies that when the "determination
          digit" is  `0', the  X.25 called address (or NUA), the NUA
          is to  be included  in Group  19.   This group  offers  no
          password option,  no priority  targeting,  and  no  multi-
          targeting.   This means  that the username that is sent to
          the  Supervisor  is  under  the  originating  host's  CID.
          During  this  call  set  up  arrangement,  the  Supervisor
          assumes that the call is caller paid, even if the call was
          set up with the X.25 Reverse Charge facility.
          
        o ADR1 numbering plan specifies that when the "determination
          digit" is  `7', the call is an origination only NUA.  This
          was used  for nodes  that did  not report originating host
          numbers.   This apparently  has no  practical use  anymore
          since this was reserved for Varian originated calls.
          
        o ADR1 Numbering Plan reserved the "determination digit" `8'
          for PNIC's  (Private Network)  addressing.  This was to be
          assigned for  a new  feature of  XCOM that  is not due for
          release until  Mid-88.   This  appears  to  be  a  useless
          assignment of this digit with the ADR2 numbering plan.  It
          was suggested  that we  enhance the  function of  the  `0'
          option in  the NTN rather then reserving the `8' digit for
          PNIC's.
          
        o It was  mentioned that  the NTN  `9' option  was the  most
          secure in the present numbering scheme and that some Sales
          education was needed for NUN's.
          
        o It was  implied by  Jeff Oliveto that with the change-over
          from the  ADR1 to  the ADR2  numbering plan,  the password
          protection for  NUN's would  be lost.   This is apparently
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           one of  the main  security features that banking customers
          enjoy about Tymnet.
          
        o It was  mentioned by  Bill Soley that a NUI identifies the
          calling party.   He  also mentioned  that we don't get the
          NUI all the time and we can't transport the NUI uniquely.
          
        o There was mention of nationalized calling cards and if the
          X.121 system  would handle it very well.  Would we need to
          prompt for  the called  user field  in order  to request a
          password or PIN.
          
        o It was  mentioned that  it would  be desirable  to have  a
          macro or  some other method of identifying a traffic class
          of service.
          
     
     The discussion changed to the actual plan for Tymnet style
     numbering.  It turned out that there were many ideas concerning a
     practical numbering plan.  Some of the questions that were brought
     up were:
     
          o    How many digits are actually necessary for host
          addressing and sub-host addressing?
          
          o    What would be a practical method for assigning
          block's of numbers to customers?
          
          o    If we were to get rid of the NTN `7' option
          (origination only), what will that effect?
          
          o    Could we define a PNIC upfront by a `$'?
          
          o    Would the plan for implementation allow for down
          revision versions of Node Code.
          
     
     The following is the closest that the group came to defining a
     numbering plan.  Another meeting will be planned for the future for
     additional discussion.
     
          DNIC - 0hhhhhssss (99,000 Hosts)
                 1hhhhhssss (100K and up, Reserved for future)
                 2nnnnnssss (Reserved for various Hunt Groups)
                 3nnnnnssss (Reserved for various Hunt Groups)
                 4nnnnnssss (Reserved for various Hunt Groups)
                 5nnnnnssss (Reserved for various Hunt Groups)/
                            (also the possibility of various WAN
                            applications (as below))
                 6nnnssssss (Telenet type addressing w/o sub-addressing)
                 7nnsssssss (Telenet type addressing with 1-digit sub-
                 addressing)
                 8          (Possible future elimination of PNIC
                            strategy)
                 9nnnn      NUN
                 
     
     Various types of numbering schemes were addressed but need further
     analysis.  An example of such a scheme is shown below:
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
                          DNIC - 34nnnnssss
                                35nnnsssss
                                36nnssssss
                                37nsssssss
     
     There was a concern on the distinction of abbreviated host
     addressing and how it could be effect by the new numbering scheme.
     Needless to say, the new scheme can not be a problem for this type
     of addressing.
     
     This is the best account that I could make on the meeting that was
     held 28 July 1987.  I welcome any comments, corrections, and most of
     all , additions to supplement these minutes.  This will serve as the
     ground work for future discussion on the future plans for Tymnet

Subject: New proposal on the public address 

Hello, Bill.
We had a meeting today this morning and it sounds like at least some
changes in public address structure are inevitable. As far as 16M boundary
is concerned, there were some concerns, Pat will probably inform you about
it. So, I will make this boundary changebale. Of course, if the boundary
is less than 16M, the MMU tables will take much more room (practically
in reverse proportion with the value of the boundary).

Now, suppose the changes to public space will have to be made. My question
is whether you have any specific reason for the public space structure
which you proposed. Moreover, I wonder whether you have any objection
to make the public space structure equal to the new Tadpole physical
address structure. I personnaly do not see anything wrong with it.

Notice, I do not propose to do away with the concept of the public address.
However, Release I could be simplified if physical and public are basically
equal. For one thing, if we do not relocate RAM we will not have any problems
to use the monitor for our debugging. Also, it might be (just might be)
that Rodney is able to disable MMU (or work without MMU) for Release I.
Anyway, I do not see any serious advantage to move thing around if the
whole addressable range is not decreased.

Please, let me know if I am wrong and there is a reason for relocating
which I do not see.

      Best Regards
                    Mark

I talked on Friday to someone at Adobe who said that there were race
conditions in pscomm which would cause it to hang sometimes.  He
sent me a new version which I'm about to try.  It should not have been
turned off.  Maybe we need to rig it up so that you get 120V through
your body if you fiddle with the printer without knowing what you're
doing.  I've seen it "hung" several times recently because it wasn't
online or was powered off.

I have installed the new version of "pscomm".  It seems to be working ok,
but we'll have to wait and see if the hanging problem has really gone away.

Subject: Memory mapping issues 

Bill,

  At our meeting on Friday with Mark, Dave, John, and Thomas the
following issues were raised:

1) 16meg boundary may be acceptable if first 16 meg is used for
   non-Rodney (i.e. off the shelf) boards which only support
    D16 and standard addressing.  No problem for GP ISIS to
   access boards in this area.

2) Mark proposed direct physical to logical map for the GP.
   This would make bringup much easier (MMU is not needed initially)
   and would allow use of on-board monitor without modification.
   Is this acceptable?

3) If the 16meg boundary were ever changed back to a smaller boundary
   then MMU tables would expand greatly.  I don't see any reason which
   the boundary should shrink.  16meg allows 64 processors in a cage.
   The Tadpole board can have it's base address set a increments of
   2 meg.

4) The Tadpole GP may NOT be able to read it's own ram through the VME
   bus.  I haven't had a chance to confirm this with Mike Mo, but will
   do so today.

Comments?

P.S. Mark would like to settle MMU issues ASAP.

Pat

The project was canceled before anyone wrote TUMS.HLP, so...  there is
actually no documentation.  If he wants his Ontymes forwarded, he just
needs to send me his ontyme name, password and PDP-10 user name.  It is
somewhat expensive, so I don't want to do a whole bunch, but a few is OK.
There is no interface at this time to the 370 except through PROFS which
I think they are not running.  If he is in the MDC PROFS system, he can
send mail to the PDP-10 via PROFS by sending a NOTE (must be a note) to
the address TUMSGATE SLVMCL1 and including the real destination address
in the first line of the note as follows (for example):

To: Bill SOley <WRS@B39.Tymnet> (TUMS)

The "To:" must begin in column 1 and the (TUMS) must not have any
trailing blanks.  He can send to multiple addresses this way, by
just seperating them with commas or using multiple To: lines or both.
He can also leave out the name and <>...

To: WRS@B39.Tymnet (TUMS)

Oh well.  -Bill

Bill,
If I understand you correctly if something is initialized during
the definition then it goes into ROM?
how about automatic variables inside functions.
please give me a clue how to tell if a thing will go into ROM/RAM.

I believe that all initialized static variables go in ROM.  The MICROTEC
manual say on page 5-24 that the -r option places "initialized local data
in a seperate section so that it can be placed in ROM".  I guess it means
static when it says local.  We need to use -r and -S in order to have that
kind of stuff work properly.  Without it, an initialized array would go in
RAM, but it wouldn't get initialized.  -Bill

Subject: Proposed change to LOG II 

Since Omar has gone on to other documents, I have taken over maintenance
of the LOG II GED.  Thus, from now on please direct your comments, suggestions
and questions about the document to me.  Also, I have decided to notify
the affected parties of any proposed changes to the document.

Proposed Change:  I suggest an alternate sequence of LOG II ISIS messages
and LOG II message objects (MOs) to initiate a circuit.  I suggest that
if the originating interface sends an ICRM ISIS message that Node Code
will return the ASLP.  The ICRM MO will then be sent by the originating
interface in the initial ICRS ISIS msg.

           Current LOG II                       Proposed Alternative
 Slot       Node Code    Supervisor       Slot        Node Code   Supervisor
 ----       ---------    ----------       ----        ---------   ----------
ISIS ICRM +                               ISIS ICRM
ICRM MO                                   on port 0 --->
on port 0 -->                                    ASLP
       ASLP        NCRM--->                 <--assigns port
  <-assigns port                         ISIS ICRS +
                   <---RCRM              ICRM MO--->
      ISIS RCRI+                                            NCRM-->
  <---RCRI MOs                                              <---RCRM
ISIS ICRS +                                  ISIS RCRI+
ICRS MO---->                              <--RCRI MO
                  NCRM--->                ISIS ICRS+
and so on until succesfull logon          ICRS MO--->
                                                           NCRM--->
                                          and soon until sucessful logon

The proposed alternative would allow slots to recieve an ASLP and hence
an assigned dispatcher port before sending logon data to the supe.  The
current LOG II requires all of the initial logon data be sent on the
initial message (ICRM) which is sent on port 0.  Please note that the
current LOGII method of initiating a circuit remains unchanged.  This
change is to allow an alternate method.  Also, this alternate method
is invisible to supe and ISIS (unless ISIS examines the data within the
ICRM and ICRS messages).

Hello, Bill.
Pat showed me your change to "Public Adddresses" section. I just wanted to
make a couple of remarks about it. First, there are a couple of paragraphs
there where you atlk about address translation performed by MMU. I guess
they have to be changed too. Second, I would like to suggest that any
references to "subject to change" are removed from our documents. I am
kind of nervous about this type of things.

Bill,
when I say in the beginning - void BootMain();
and later -
void

}
- for some reason it complains that I am redefining BootMain().
The problem is even more mysterious because it complains only about
the very first function from the list of function types that 
are being declared in the beginning of the file. by the way-
around - void Bootmain(); it also points to void as a syntax
error ???

Subject: LOADII weirdness 

Bill,
I don't know who to tell about some unexpected behaivor from loadii and I
guessed you.

When I gfd to Albert Lin's directory and type LOADII then LOADII logs me
out with the msg 'LOADII MAY NOT BE COPIED OR USED WITH AUX CIR'.  But,
I did not use aux circuit.  Albert has protection on his directory and
this does not happen if I type 'r loadii'.  Just thought that someone might
care or wonder.

When you GFD to ALIN, and type "LOADII" it runs (ALIN)LOADII since the
GFD directory appears on your search list before (SYS).  When you use
"R LOADII" that explicitly runs (SYS)LOADII.  The LOADII program checks
to see where it was run from and complains if it was not from SYS.  I
don't know why Albert has a copy of LOADII, but that's the problem.  -Bill

	main()
	{
		sysInit();		/* Power up or reset system init */
		patroninit();		/* Patron initialization */
		while (1) {
			rkbgRun();	/* Rodney background */
			patronbkgd();	/* Patron background */

	Does this routine satisfy the requirement for Rodney?

Subject: Password Expiration date in MUDII 

Wayne,

I asked Romolo Raffo about the password expiration date in the MUDII.
This was included in response to a request from DuPont.  The idea was
to have the Supervisor detect when a user's password was expired and
to route the circuit to NETVAL rather than the user specified destination.
This would force users to change their password.

I have re-designed the Skywalker access license bits scheme.  Gazel
will call a meeting in the near future to discuss this issue.  If
you would like to preview the proposed design, it is on (SUPDEV:39)
SKYLIC.DOC.  The design will be reviewed on Monday Sept 21, by the
Skywalker team, so it is not finalized, though I don't anticipate
any changes.

Thanks...Omar

	I need to get your advice on RODNEY system call interface.

     1. All the rodney system call functions have various number of
	arguments and they return different data type. 
	I have no way to build up a system call table which can be
	used  to pass control to the specified system call in trap
	handler routine.
     2. Where can I find definition of ENUM Rsi_event which is used

Subject: Public addresses and MMU 

Hello, Bill.
Sorry to bother you again. I would like just to check with you one place
in your revised document. At the bottom of page 3 it states that modifying
MMU for VME-to-local references is "the only way that a Tadpole board
can verify its own VME address ....". This is, of course, true if you mean
"double check" by "verify". Of course, MMU cannot be modified until
the board own address is known by means independent from MMU. It could be
better to change this place in the document, so that this distinction
is more apparent.
          Best regards
                  Mark

in case my previous msgs got lost:
please remove from rodney.h references to rkPatronUp(), rkSetBoot(0...
...etc. they are all included in boot.h.

also please add to RodneyError:
RERR_BOOT_QUIT  and  RERR_BOOT_RETRY
they are possible (including _OKAY) errorCode-s in the boot response

also since glob.soft no longer exists rkPatronUp() will have NO

Bill,

  Has rkShare gone away? If so then RSI_NOTIFY in boot.mm needs
modification.  Also my notes shows that rkPatronUp has lost

Is this ok?  Also rkConfess seems to have disappeared.

Well, no, actually, I don't get any premium services and Showtime is
definately one.  Another thing is that my deck (2900) is getting flakey.
The night before last, it lost chroma lock on playback (rainbows and then
B/W) -- I dug out the schematics for it last night but it didn't fail.
Unfortunately, I don't know if it affects record operation (it shouldn't -
maybe).

I hope I don't find that all the up-coming Headroom shows I tape have
no color-burst!

Hi, Mike.
I've been trying to get ahold of Alice Hausladen about the Catalyst
application as it says to do in the application if I have questions.
I'm hoping to talk Tymnet into marketing the X.PC stuff for me and
so would want to have their name appear in the Catalyst catalog, but
I'm still negotiating that with Tymnet.  My questions are
 1. does that still meet requirements?
 2. can I apply now, but hold publication until negotiation final?
If these things turn out to be a problem, I will just submit the
application using another product that isn't so complicated politically,
however, I really wanted to do X.PC first for many reasons.  Maybe
you can get answers to these, or light a fire under Alice so she'll
return my calls.  Thank you very much.  -Bill

PS - I was told to order a workstation for the office today.  I
wonder what finally softened Al up?  Rumor has it we'll get 30 this
year which is pretty good since they're not in the budget!

Are we under any constraint to ensure that our allocated structures

It also might start at any position as a result of kludges which copy

I think there is a typo in the ipcfDeassign section of ipcf.mm.  If the
specified tsap is not assigned to the caller, RERR_TSAPI is returned, not
RERR_TSAP.  
I also happened to notice that the description for key under the struct 
IpcfHdr declaration has a sentence fragment in it...

The patron owns everything its given at RSI_STARTUP.  It may, if it
can, give some of it back, when requested to do so via RSI_PALLOC.
Rodney never gives back what it gets from PALLOC.  When the patron
restarts, Rodney restarts and immediately returns ownership of the
memory back to the patron without having modified it (although it may
have run a non-destructive memory test which tests one location at a
time and restores it to its original value).  -Bill

malloc() always allocates a worst-case-aligned block.  That is, if on a
32 bit machine that doesn't care about double word alignment, it aligns
to a 32 bit boundary.  So no need to worry.  Now if you copy it to a char
array, I think the 68020 will do the right thing, but it won't be fast.
I'm not sure what the 68010 does, but I'm pretty sure that it requires
any word or long reference be to an even location.  -Bill

Ah.  I understand about software project management.  Its not just hardware
people that have problems with software.  I've decided that software is
clearly an art (I agree with Knuth, et. al.).  You can't schedule creativity.
If you try, it may appear to work at first, but what you get won't be a
product of a creative effort, it'll just be another liability.

By the way, this isn't a comment about Skywalker project management, quite
the contrary, its a comment about our past style of project management which
has become appearent when contrasted with Skywalker.  I guess I can take
this chance to mention that I'm consistently amazed by how Skywalker is
being managed, and if we follow through with this attitude, we're going to
have one hell of a good product!

Thanks for the reply on the emulator.

I checked out 33 and whatever it was is gone now.  You must have fixed it.
Its not clearwhat it was.  Some program was appearently running, opening
a file, and dieing without closing it (this is detected and the mail is
reprocessed by MAILER thus causing the REQ).  The idea being that when a
program dies without cleaning up, you can't tell if it has delivered the
mail it was working on, so to be safe, you deliver it again.  -Bill

I'm not sure I understand the question.  Which interrupt are we talking
about?  On the real hardware, you just setup the vector with the address
of the function that is the interrupt service routine.  There is a special
option on the MicroTec compiler to generate special code for interrupt
routines (basically it just saves all the registers).  The context switch,
if any is handled by the hardware assuming the new status word is setup
right in the vector.  -Bill

Its just a reminder to me to add descriptions of the glob fields in some
more organized and complete manner.  If they'd only stand still long
enough.  -Bill

BILL,

THE OLD ACCESS#:74 PROGRAM IS HAVING SOME SECURITY PROBLEMS.  IT IS POSSIBLE,
TO DROP OUT OF THE PROGRAM IF YOU HIT SEVERAL ESC'S AFTER THE PROGRAM LOADS.
THE FORTRAN HAS THE ONINT STATEMENT TO COUNTERACT THIS, AND ONE ESC WILL
CAUSE AN EXIT, BUT MANY ESC'S SEND THE USER TO THE XEXEC PROMPT.  WHAT CAN
I DO ABOUT THIS?  ANY INFO WOULD BE HELPFUL.  PLEASE REPLY TO DDD:38, AS I
AM RARELY ON 74.
THANKS,

Bill,
I want to make sure I understand what is being put on the stack
for an estimation of sprout-stack.
Only the automatic variables and perhaps return addresses are put
on the stack. This includes automatic structures, unions etc.
Is it so?
I am not sure about static v., but externals shouldn't go on stack.

The bbram is tempting.  I'm not sure what could be saved there given that
it is subject to erant programs scribbling on it without notice.  It is
clearly something that should be kept in mind.  It would be great if we
could use it for the serial number, but that seems too risky unless we used
some extreemly clever ecc to significantly decrease the chance of an
unrecoverable error.  -Bill

On the stack go any auto declared inside a function.  Its stacked when
the function is invoked.  Also any formal parameter (argument) to the
function, also when its invoked.  Statics and externals do not.  malloc()
memory does not.  Watch out for alignment, for example, the following
function...
	fn()
	{
		long x;
		char c;
		long y;
		char d;
		long z;
	}
could take 20 bytes of stack depending on how clever the compiler is since
it must always force long word alignment.  If you always declare in
descending order of size you are most likely to get optimal packing.  Also
be aware that when evaluation complex expressions, the compiler may push
temporary results on the stack if it runs out of registers to keep them in.
There is no way to predict this.  *SIGH*  If you suspect it, you just have
to look at the code.  -Bill

BILL,

YOU ARE CERTAINLY MORE THAN CORRECT ABOUT INSTALLING THE NEW SAIL PROGRAM.
THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING IS GETTING A VALID DATA FILE FOR THE PROGRAM TO 
RUN OFF (GIGO).  THIS IS PROVING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT WITH INCREASED
SYSTEM LOAD PLUS THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA TO BE PROCESSED.  I HAVE TRIED
WRITING PROCEDURES WHICH WILL AUTOMATICALLY THROW OUT AREA CO AND PREFIX
COMBINATIONS WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT PERTINENT.  EVEN WHEN I DO GET A RUN TO
COMPLETE, I HAVE NO WAY OF IDENTIFYING INACCURATE DATA UNTIL IT SHOWS UP
DURING A PROGRAM RUN.  SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE ARE OFFERING ANYTHING
BASED ON CCMI DIRECTLY TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT NEEDS TO BE CLEANER.

SO, MY CURRENT PLAN IS TO CREATE SOME FLAT FILES AND PROCESS THEM IN TURBO C.
THIS WAY, IF THERE ARE OBVIOUS ERRORS, THE TIME TO REPROCESS WILL BE SHORTER.

THE FUTURE PLAN IS TO REWRITE DDD IN FOCUS ON THE IBM 370...

SO, I GUESS MY IDEA OF FIXING THE SECURITY FOR THE OLD ACCESS PROGRAM
IS A "QUICK FIX" FOR NOW.  SOMEONE WENT IN AND CHANGED THE PASSWORD
LAST FRIDAY TO THE ACCESS# USERNAME.  I LOGGED ON AFTER THE PASSWORD
WAS RESET AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ESC OUT OF THE PROGRAM.

ANY IDEAS/COMMENTS ARE WELCOME.

THANKS AGAIN,

Doug, I've moved my version of NAD to (WRS:33)SYSNAD.* but it should
be installed with the name NAD as follows.

The file (WRS)SYSNAD.SAV goes in (SYS)NAD.SAV with RF license and ALL RUN RUN.
The file (WRS)SYSNAD.LIS goes in (SOURCE)NAD.LIS with no special protection.

NAD.LIS is a demo.  It has comments in it (which you may want to remove
to prevent someone from being tempted to edit it).  Let me know if there
are any questions.  -Bill

Subject: ipcf send 

Does ipcf send still have a second parameter for the done timeout as we
discussed?  I am not using this (since dones are meaningless to the
logger) but I still have the parameter coded in the logger since I didn't
hear anything about a change since our discussion in July about a done
timeout.

Subject: varargs in microtec 

I'm interested in writing microtec c code that uses the "varargs" c facility.
Apparently this facility is not provided by microtec.  I was wondering if
microtec manages its stack the same way that the sun's compiler does, so
that we could use the sun's vararg definitions for microtec.  Do you
happen to know the answer?

Bill:
	The Ontyme-UNIX connection you established for me worked fine
for a few days, but now seems to be broken.  The messages reached my
Ontyme username all right, but were not forwarded to opus.  Can you
fix it, or is it someone else's problem?
	In case you need the information again:

	ONTYME ID:	NTD.D/FIELDS
	ONTYME KEY:	FINE MESS
	DEST. HOST:	opus
	USERNAME:	dfields


					Thanks,

ipcf.mm says that no wild card characters may be present in a symbol name
but there is no error code mentioned in symEnter for this error.  Will the

rkBootStrap should not return to the patron unless the only
action specified is dump.  If there is going to be a reload
or even a restart, it should never return.  As far as the other
stuff, I'll make a copy of the current BOOT and check it.  I'm
not at all sure what you are saying.  -Bill

Subject: "Bill, Pat asked me to review the"... 

Bill, Pat asked me to review the boot part of Rodney doc and I came
across a few points that are still a bit nebulous to me.
rkBootstrap() will return to the patron caller (the doc was modified
in this area), so I think Patron will have to dismiss or sit idle
in anticipation of being halted and/or reloaded.
There is also a statement that got deleted on my request since it has
no bearing in the current code: "if action 1 is requested (use of res.
memory) and there is no start address action 2 (waiting for file)
will take over" - well, currently I don't do any checking on the start
address but even when I do it I still have problems with this statement.
First of all if Patron was ever loaded (it must have been!) the old
start address must be still around and if for some reason it is unwise
to use it then I don't see any point of having action 1 around in the
first place. Pat insisted on deleting all statem. which are incompatible
with current state of affairs, but since this particular area is self-
contradictory (in my understanding) I don't see a chance it will ever
be re-instated unless you shed some more light on it.
