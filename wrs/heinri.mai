Hi!  Thanks for the OnTyme help and gateways.  Also, thanks for the
address.  Becky did not give it to me because she wasn't sure at the
time if you would be able to move into the place.

I finally found a house.  It is in Palo Alto near Middlefield and
Oregon Expressway on a street called Lawrence.  The people I will
be moving in with found it and I went to look at it with them
yesterday.  They're a couple and I know him from Enhansys.  His
name is Randy Lagier and Mary is a history professor at Stanford.
Mary found the house through a friend in her department who owns
the house so we're getting a really nice deal.  No first and last
months rent plus deposit.  We can move in the last week in December,
and we don't have to pay rent until January.  Randy and Mary are
signing a 2 year lease, so I know that I won't have to be looking
around on the spur of the moment, so that's really good.

The house is Eichleresque, but it really is pretty.  The couple
that own the house did alot of remodeling.  From the outside it looks
like an Eichler, but on the inside, it's pretty neat!  It's bigger than
the house I had in Redwood City, eventhough it is only one story.
The living room in huge and looks out onto a large backyard with all kinds
of really neat plants and trees.  Instead of grass, there are alot of
vilots and there is a rasberry bush.  There is also a fig tree, a lemon
tree and an almond tree, plus alot of other kinds of normal trees that
make for lots of nice shading.  

The kitchen is completely remodeled.  It's huge!  It has a new gas stove,
and the counter winds all the way around toward the side of the house
where the wall was knocked out and they built a greenhouse look to it,
so you get to see all the pretty green stuff outside .  It'd be a nice 
place to throw a few stools and have breakfast and look outside.  

The house has gas heat, a fireplace, 2 bathrooms and a newly remodeled
huge laundry room.  I have the front of the house and get my pick
of 3 bedrooms.  I also have my own bathroom.  Randy and Mary
will have the bedroom in the back of the house which is really pretty and
big with a remodeled bathroom.  It's more like a master bedroom.

We also get to pick out what kind of rug and color we want for the 
living room and the owners are paying for it.

The house is white.  And it's also a dead end street so it's nice and
quiet.

I'll give you my official move in date and address and phone number
when I know all of those.  Just remember for now that it's on Lawrence
in Palo Alto and I'll be moving in during the last week in December.

Randy and Mary are really nice good people.  I met Randy a
year ago when he came to Enhansys to do allof our fancy dancy graffics
programming.  He's alot like Dad, and he's around 35.  He likes to
go back packing, cook at home and is real family oriented.  Mary is
a mideaval specialist at Stanford and I thinks she has ten year.  She's
real kind and is alot like Randy but is a bit less outspoken than
Randy can be.  We've planned hiking trips together and I've been
over to their house for dinner and when I had to find a new place to
live, it turned out they had to too.  So, since we really get along
well and we're all alot alike, we thought things over and decided to
get a place together if we could find a nice big one.  

I also have a car now.  Since I'm going to be paying a bit more for
rent again soon, I decided to see if I could find a nice car for 
cash.  A friend of a friend was selling a 1974 Toyota Corolla station
wagon for $800.  So, I went over with Randy and looked it over and
drove it for quite a while on the freeway, and streets, and had the
engine, etc. looked over, and decided that for $800 and for a 
reliable Toyota, that just might be a good deal!  So I bought it for
$750!

It really runs nicely, and gets excellent gas mileage.

That's it for updates for now, I'll keep you posted, and remember if
you need to get in touch with me, send me an OnTyme or call me at
work - ext. 6572.  - Melissa

P.S.  Ontyme is doing pretty good for sending West Wind stuff to Randy.
(West Wind is the soaring magazine we're working on.)
(What I meant to say is tha that I have known Randy Lagier
and Mary for almost 2 1/2 years now.)

Bye again!
