SMPT gets confused when system 930's disks are brought up on 62's hardware.
The microbase thinks the host is 62, in spite of SYSNO being X930.

Someone sent a message, with one copy going to 930 and the other to 62.
MAILER logged in two jobs - one showed up as running "930", the other as "62".
It looks like the one that was responsible for sending mail from 930 to 930
did not recognized that it was on 930, and got "host down" when it tried to
build an aux circuit to 930.  The other job went to build an aux circuit to 62,
and 930 answered.  The message that is supposed to be sent from 930 to 62 went
out on what it thought was a circuit to 62, but really came right back in to
930.  The end result was the message is right back where it started.  At
which point SMTP decides that the message needs to be forwarded to 62 again.

I renamed MAILER.SAV to MAILER.S until 930's hardware is fixed.

I get all of the mail sent to NTD.ASYNC.  Since I am no longer in that group
and more importantly, have stopped caring about consat and tymcom problems,
could you please have TUMS stop sending me NTD.ASYNC's mail?

And I know true messages gobblers is serious work, but there is an intermediate
step which would appear to be simple to do.  Ontyme does have message gobblers
and if I send bad message from tums, I currently wait until tums logs into
Ontyme and then I go in and cancel it.  It seems to me that tums could have
a command which cancels the most recent Ontyme which would be the most recent
tums message (could check subject fields for a match since tums gives you a
copy of your mail).  It just seems wrong that I have to go into ontymes and
cancel it myself.  I accept that messages sent to gazel@b39 (direct pdp 10)
are sent since I know of no way to manually kill those messages (and that is
what I guess the nontrivial part of gobblers).

Most recent is no good, the order is non-deterministic since messages
may be queued by various systems for non-bounded periods.  The gobbler
would have to be a new message sent to the same address as the message
to be gobbled with a special field:
	Gobble-Message-Id: blahblahblah
The recipient would do whatever is necessary to search for that message
ID and kill it.  The problem is this - the TUMS sender does not know
the Ontyme-message ID and can not generate such a message.  There is not
currently a unique TUMS message ID, but even if there was, Ontyme would
not be able to map it into an Ontyme message ID.  The result is that you
(the program) would have to do an :OUT and then a :GET and :LOCATE on
every outstanding message to see if the one in question can be found.
That or it would have to keep its own data base of outstanding messages.

Its even worse than that, the gobbler could get there before the
message to be gobbled, so a data base is absolutely necessary.
I say, so what, ONTYME is the only message system I know that lets you
cancel a message.  US MAIL doesn't, ARPA mail doesn't, UUCP doesn't.

(4) DLL

for local TTY hjow will this work? Rodney controls the TTY

is it a session protocol?

Bill,
LOADII now works with 1022 turned off.  For what 1022 is used for
a very simple file would do.  I understand this is being done.  I
don't expect this to be more than a few weeks of work even for a
novice.  Once done it will eliminate our dependancy on 1022. 
There are appearently plans to cease purchasing 1022.

It is also difficult to reproduce on LOADII.  It only seems to happen
on gateways and only when there are large amounts of delay.  (there is
a 1022 connection in that since gateways accesses are a special case
for accessing the database)  The random element of net delay makes
it difficult.  Most of the time it works except with one customer and
that customer is no longer willing to allow us to test since he is
working with the 1022 supressed.

Ron V. reported that he had seen these problems on other 1022 applications.
I will forward you suggestions to him and the LOADII support people.

Subject: Notes on IOC GED 

	Comments on SKYWALKER I/O Controller GED, Rev. 1.0
		John Kopf
		7 April, 1987


In reading the GED, I note several undesirable constraints which are
imposed.

An implicit assumption seems to be that there are two "players":  the
IOC and the GP;  in reality, there are three:  "GP" actually consists
of both ISIS and Slot.  Only ISIS can issue I/O commands (on behalf of
the slot), while either could issue Channel Commands.  In order to retain
compatability with existing slots, the Channel Commands must retain
the existing (Engine) constraints;  however, there is no need to impose
these constraints upon ISIS.  Eventually new drivers will be defined to
take into account the extended capabilities of the SCC chip, and the
existance of a programmable IOC.  Such new drivers (e.g., BISYNC, X.25,
SNA) need not be subject to existing (Engine) constraints, since they
will never be supported in the Engine environment.

One such constraint is "Quad-word Addresses".  There is no need to
impose QWA on I/O commands -- Where the constraint is required, ISIS
can easily impose the constraint (e.g., HDLC areas).  This removes the
need for the IOC to impose this constraint, thus reducing its load
(and the IOC needs all of its capaco provide throughput).

Sync:  It is not clear that the IOC needs to interpret Sync Rotor
entries.  Furthermore, there is no provision made for the (admittedly,
undocumented) special Sync usage for Node-code (WHICH DOES NOT MAKE USE
OF ROTORS!).  Again, this is a case where it is reasonable for ISIS to
provide interpretation and constraints on slot requests to the IOC.
Also, retaining the Engine's constraint of Sync-input data-areas to
100X bytes is not unreasonable -- I see no advantage to making the
length variable, since no existing product is likely to make use of
this capability, and any new products will probably have intelligent
drivers available (e.g., input channel-programs to receive entire
packets). (Note on page 25:  the actual implementation is:
fold(input_index += 2);
area[input_index] = value;
...where addressing is by bytes, but operands are 16-bits;  also,
input_index < 0 means no ring-activity.)

ASYNC:  Again, provision of forms 2 and 3 is sufficient;  translation
between forms 3 and 1 is reasonably an ISIS function.  I would, however,
recommend that form 3 have each field be 16 bits, and the high-order
8-bits of 16-bit data be used to designate control-functions, rather
then retaining the form-1 escape-convention.

TSI references:  The TSI Postman is probably the greatest bottleneck
to TSI throughput:  we must insure that this bottleneck is not carried
into Skywalker.  There is also no IOC equivalent to "watchdog timer",
or "Console I/O", or even "Console TTY".  (Note on 8.11:  it is desirable
for the IOC to be able to determine the baud-rate on externally-clocked
Sync (and HDLC) ports;  this information should probably override any
baud-rate specified, or at least log an inconsistancy -- ideally, the
system should be flexible enough so that baud-rates need only be specified
for those ports which generate clocks, and the actual speeds are determined
for all other ports.)

TelecommunicationsSystem, MartinMarietta, contracts, governmentcontracts: 

BETHESDA, Md. -- Competition for a huge federal government communications 
contract heated up again last week when Martin Marietta Corp. said it had 
signed up TYMNET McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co. to provide packet 
switching services between major urban centers as well as some local data 
services.

TYMNET is a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Co. (St. Louis).  Martin Marietta 
had already recruited several other leading electronics companies into its 
bidding consortium, including MCI Communications Corp., Northern Telecom Inc., 
the seven regional Bell operating companies and Southern New England Telephone 
Co.

The estimated $4.5 Billion FTS 2000 contract is also being sought by another 
group headed by Boeing Co. and AT& T Co.  A third group, led by US Sprint 
Communications Co. and a large aerospace contractor, is also expected to enter 
the fray.

The much-delayed award is expected in about 6 months.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Training Department on Valley Green is looking for up to 3 managers
from NTD to attend a pilot training class on 4/22 and the morning of 4/23.
It will be held on First Street at the TTE building and there will be no
charge.
 
The course is the replacement For Finance for Non-financial Managers.
This new course is entitled 'Business By The Numbers' and is being given
for the first time in the Bay Area. It originated out of St. Louis and will
be facilitated and taught by a member of ISG Corporate training staff.
The focus of the course is on the internal management of financial
information as it relates to the performance of the business.
 
People attending this first session will be asked to evaluate the
course and, if found successful, will be scheduled several times throughout
the remainder of 1987.
 
Please contact me no later than next Monday if you wish to attend.
For those interested, I have a brief course description in my office that
you can review.

Subject: Question for SWB 

Gazel and Allyn,

After several meetings, it was unclear what SWB had intended with their
abbreviated addressing (ie. specify NTN or 1+DNIC+NTN for a called
address).  It is especially unclear what addressing scheme the X.25
interface should be employing when communicating to the DTEs.  First,
some background information:

1. SWB requires that the user inputs an NTN or a full address prefixed
by a 1.  This 1 indicates to the network that the following 4 digits are
the DNIC.

2. The X.28 PAD will be able to accept destination address in the form for
SWB, as well as for TYMNET (where the "-" signifies the X.121 address).

3. The sup will be able to handle the input login string defined for
TYMNET, as well as for SWB.  We will be able to handle the "1" and the
"-" method, separately or simultaneously.

4. Currently, we are planning to maintain our design whereby our
notation for X.121 addressing is the "-" for all network messages.  That
means that origination and destination addresses in LOG2 will be the
full address prefixed by the "-".  However, if an address is in a login
string, this rule does not necessarily apply...the sup will parse it to
get the necessary information.  This will apply to both TYMNET and
SWBNET.  Note that the only difference will be the full address
indication in the login string.

That seems to satisfy our and SWB's requirements.  However, I am
concerned about the link between the X.25 interface and the DTEs.  Since
these DTEs can be hosts, smart terminals, and even networks, is SWB
requiring the prefix "1" to be maintained across these links in the
called address field?  I do not think so, but I am not sure.  A true
standard link should not recognise the customized prefix of "1".  But
could all of SWB's DTEs be customized to use the "1"?  Note that a user
of a smart terminal talking X.25 should be inserting the "1" prefix, so
does that mean the smart terminal have enough intelligence to strip the
"1"?

Perhaps Bill or Dennis may have a simple explanation.  If not, then we
should pose this question to SWB.

Rodney will "call" the routine whose address is specified in the call to
rsiSet whenever the event happens.  This is like an interrupt only in stead
of putting the address at a particular vector in the interrupt table, you
do a system call.  The reason that's prefered is not important.  I may have
confused you when I said there is only one.  The application can specify
a different service routine for each event, however, ANY incomming IPCF
message that's not for Rodney is considered one event (RSI_IPCF_IN).  This
means its up to the application to dispatch based on the IPCF receiver
address field.  Its NOT up to the application to dispatch on event type.
So, if you temporarily forget about all other events, you do a call
	rsiSet( RSI_IPCF_IN, myServiceRoutine );
And thereafter, any messages that come in that are not for Rodney will be
passed as an argument (by reference) to myServiceRoutine.  Its really just
a subroutine call.  Its then up to myServiceRoutine to decide what kind of
IPCF message it is and what other routines to call to actually deal with it.
Quite possibly it will just queue the message for processing in the background
since the event occurs at interrupt level.

DONE is always relative to the sender.  That is, its definition is invarient:
   DONE is set only if there will be no more references of any kind made
   to the storrage holding the message by anyone other than the originator.
This basically means the storrage is free.  Now FastDone comes in because of
the progress field, primarily, and also due to flow control.  If the application
sending the message does not care about progress codes, and it has some other
means of flow control (not sending messages faster than the receiver can deal
with them) then he can set FastDone.  This allows somebody in between the
sender and receiver (such as agent) to set DONE as soon as he has copied the
message into a transmission buffer since once that happens, all references
will be to the copy, not the original, and the sender can free the storrage.

If this is all confusing, it may be clearer when the document is done.  I
plan to do alot of work in that area.  Meanwhile, in ISIS' case, I think
you can ignore the issue for now.

Please note that REPLY has gone away.  It is now (reluctantly) necessary to
send another message to send a reply.  This just happened last night.

The start address is part of the object file that gets booted.  Probably
e.out or some modification thereof.  We do not anticipate needing to know
the address of anything other than RSI service routines.  That is provided
by the rsiSet routine.

Subject: LOGII and X.409 

I am sorry to bring this up so late in the game.  As part of the Skywalker
design, we are looking at X.409.  This spec describes exactly what we are
doing in the SMO.  I would like to suggest we adapt the X.409 in place of
the SMO if for no other reason than it is very well documented and it
would save us time and confusion in that regard.  Conceptually X.409 is
identical to SMOs and even the syntax is very similar.  The overhead
seems to be comparable, as well.  It is slightly more general.  Sometime
soon we should chat about this, although, perhaps its too late.  -Bill

Subject: rodney, what else 



first, thanks for your replies

second, as i understand it, rodney will ask isis when it needs some
dynamic memory.  ok, what if isis is not there but instead is a 
diagnostic? can rodney still run? in other words, what if you
hvae an applicatino that does not hvae dynamic memory capability?

you should be aware that we feel the amount of detail
in the isis design makes it impossible to meet our original
charter by monday; we will have some conbination of less
detail, and ossibly less functionality....so yucky
as it sounds we may not have dynamic memory.  i can just
hear you screaming now..."but it's not that difficult!!!!@#$@#$%'
anmd you're right...but something has to give, right?
maybe we can contract out to rodney group for programming
services...anwyay today at 1.30 dave goes to a big
managgers meeting with our various options and 
considerations...

let me now about the memory questino above.  what do you do,
also, if you ask for dynamic memory and we hvae no more to give,
on a fully laden system?  would you toss some current
ipcf message or do you 'wait' in some fashion?  you
could also swap stuff to disk...like a real computer.oh well...

(1) how do you get the current GMT time? (the 'from 1974' time)?
(2) at what point do we know you have it, so we can use it?
(3) can you give it to the application at 1 minute intervals? i guess
    the query you have is sufficient.  we will update fastC when
    we query you.
(4) from previous message, just to be sure: what do you do if you have
    an application that canot give dynamic memory? secondly, what do you do if
    you hvae dynamic memory and then it runs out?
(5) how does the application do an accuse()? will there be a subroutine 
    for us to use?  or is accuse() only a Rodney function?
(6) how is the application alerted that someone has been convicted?
    i assume a broadcast IPCF, let me know where it is defined.
(7) we are using symbolics for the TRAPs.  so we refer to TRAP #14
    as TRAP #RODNEY.
(8) do you know which section is going to do the standalone debuffer?
    who specifies its user interface, and so on? (we're not
    supposed to use the 'etc' phrase anymore).
(9) etc

Well, I might be able to come by this afternoon, but I'm not sure yet.
I have to see how the writting goes, I might get done early.  I suggest
you might briefly look at X.409 in the Red Book in the library.  Most of
the paper describes a formal notation for defining the data structure.
There exist compilers that input the formal notation and output parsers
and pretty documents.  Ken Jones supposedly has one for the PC that he
is going to give me source code for (in C).  At any rate, concentrate
on the example on page 87 and 88 - it shows the real bits.  I can then
narrate a little and it should all become obvious.

When I first looked at it, it made no sense at all, then Romalo spent
5 minutes telling me a few things and now it all makes perfect sense.
CCITT documents are that way.

Subject: More on the transit field 


Bill,

[I have appended your memo for the benefit of the other readers.]

I can accept the need for addressing fields distinct from the extension
field, and so I drop the suggestion to eliminate the transit field.
However, I still think we should not dictate syntax in non-local 
addressing fields.

The current destination field has a syntax suited to Tymnet networks,
which is fine when the destination is within the Sup's own network.  But
when there is a transit field, the destination field is ignored by the
Sup and passed on to the next network.  In such a case, we should not
limit the syntax to Tymnet-style addressing.  Therefore, I suggest

(<options>)<username>:<local_dest>:<dest>...:<dest>[<extension>]<terminator>

where <local_dest> is the destination within the current network, and
the <dest> fields are destinations in other networks.  (Currently, we
limit the number of <dest> fields to one).  The <local_dest> field can
consist of a host list, hostname, x121 name, etc., just as in the
current destination field.  The other <dest> fields can contain any
sequence of characters except for escape, carriage-return, semi-colon,
'[', and perhaps a few others, but they are not in any other way
limited.  (Well...perhaps the "<hex><hex> syntax, which is allowed in the
extension field, should be used here too.)

This syntax distinguishes between first (i.e., local) destination and
subsequent destinations.  There is no special marker for final
destination.  I think such a marker (':'  as opposed to '=') would be
unnecessary and misleading.  I'm sure the user will think in terms of
transit and destination, but the final <dest> in the login string is
clearly the final destination and does not need to be marked as such.

The LOGII Transit Field SMO and Specified Destination List SMO would be
replaced either by (1) a single SMO consisting of :<dest>:<dest>..., or
(2) a sequence of SMOs, one for each <dest>.  The latter design would
eliminate the need for the gateway to parse the <dest> list.

I want to emphasize that the particular terms ("local destination",
etc.)  are not the issue here - although we eventually want to come up
with good ones.  What is at issue is the misleading and unnecessary
limitation on the syntax of the current destination field.

. . .

I just talked briefly with Omar about this.  He seems to be in agreement,
but is concerned with changing things so late in the game.  I'm not crazy
about that either, but I think we have not committed ourselves yet to the
current syntax.  The only documents which would have to change are the
LOGII GED, and the yet-to-be-completed ADRII GED.  We have already changed
the syntax on SWB several times, so what's one more time among friends?

In short, I don't think inertia should hold us back.  However, if you have
substantive objections, that's a different story.  Let me know what you
think.

Subject: login string 

I got your mail and will respond more later.  They just took 39 down, so
I'm over here for temporary - don't reply to minimac, use 39 as usual.

USERNAME=-1234:-2345(123)456-7890
Yields:
  lookup( -1234-2345 ) in mud so we can route on the destination even
though the transit is specified.  Also need to do access control for
tarrif reasons on the pair (transit,destination).  This is why we do
not want to support multiple transits until the issue of legal
responsibility is decided (i.e. we can't afford an N^3 mud).

As for allowing "black box" calls to go through without looking at the
destination address...I agree that this is very desirable, but it means
we can't route intelligently without cooperation from the other network.
I forsee that as being done in a later phase with some kind of quoting
scheme (implicit).

Putting parts of the address somewhere other than in the address field
(such as in the data field as we do now) is aesthetically displeasing
and violates the intent of structuring the address into a seperate field.
For example, it makes it difficult for a service access point to recognize
what is an address and what isn't.  Also remember that we need to be able
to have addresses in the MUD in phase 2 which are in other address domains.

Finally the extension field is for data of the flavor of "call user data"
in CCITT X.25 and we should avoid defining the the semantics at the network
layer (or any layer but application).  An example would be a way to pass
a terminal type to a CMT slot.

On the definition of terminology - I believe Dave has published a glossary
which may be out of date and need to be updated, but it is very important
to have accurate, non-misleading terminology, and for everyone to use it
consistently.  This should not, however, be a driving force of the
architecture.

did you hear? dave proposed a radical change in our design for isis
at the managers meeting and that looks like what is going to happen.

a straight port, with as little change as possible to get it to work
and all of this to make the 2/88 ultimate deadline, or
sept '87 i guess for system integration test. 

so, no dynamic memory guy! plan accordingly or sue us in a higher court.
also, we have lost the nice dynamic process creation we had designed,
which was a fairly general mechanism that would provide an 
excellent growth path for the future.  

you know, you can make a decision that can save you a couple of
months time, and be stuck with it for years, even decades.
just like the reviews - here we are with this huge project, and
they give 1 day to review eeach section! the detailed designs
will get reviewed, obviously, but the more things are cast in cement
the harder it is to change them.

when i look at the quality of alfred, it amkes you wonder...
on the other hand, this nice alfred took dave smith 9 months
to do (part time, of course) and he had originally estimated
1 or 2 montsh...so who knows.  but it looks like we won't
have a real computer this time either.  just a communications

- The are plenty of free bits in the message flags fields to indicate
  a future type of "SECURE CIRCUIT" request.

- Only one RPOA is allowed to be specified in the Transit Field List.

- The MYOADR macro was clarified and examples were given as well.

- The "IIX" SMO was changed to two SMOs "ORIGINATION IIX" and "DESTINATION
  IIX".

- Designs were added to allow the Supervisor to inform the Node Code and
  interface slots of the LOGII capability of the active Supervisor.

- The "IRC" SMO is completely described.

- The description of the handling of logon strings and passwords is
  expanded and clarified, and a new SMO is added to the NCRM, "LOGON
  CHARACTERS W/O PASSWORD" which replaces the old NCRM "CIRCUIT
  LOGON CHARACTERS" SMO.  The ICRM/ICRS "CIRCUIT LOGON CHARACTERS" SMO
  has been renamed to"LOGON CHARACTERS", and the "PASSWORD" SMO is
  described completely.

- The INVOICE NUMBER field was dropped from the NCN needle body and tail
  since it was unneccessary.

- The Escape conventions used in the NCN are mentioned.


There will probably be another massive update to incorporate the SMOs
into a CCITT standard protocol, but those changes won't be out for awhile
yet.

Thanks...Omar

sorry to bother you...just was curious if you changed ti system 36
logons for TUMS/ontyme to 39 or something....since 36 is going
away.
  and then told people, so they can set up any changes they
might want
to their forwarding files.

thanks,

kevin


p.s. or do you always logon t oontyme via39?  i guess the
forwarding files stuff still needs changing....

Subject: naming 



2 names for you:

(1) i never liked the magic number thing; it is not magic.  it always
    sounded gimicky to me.  how about this: 'public key'?  it is
    a key, and it is certainly public if it is sitting there in 
    memory where any old joe can come by and read it.  also is
    the correct term if we ever start doing cryptography; i am sure
    you are familiar with public key cryptography, using
    relatively large primes.

(2) well, if you accuse someone you have to store that somewhere,
    right?  so you have a field to store this in.  it might be
    just 1 bit for all I know; but this field must have a name,
    right?  well, lets rename it: the card is in trouble if it
    has an outstanding accusation against it, right? but
    'trouble' is too long a word to be a label...so call this
    label 'danger'.  hence the name fits.  and it is arguably
    the most critical field in the system -
    the Rodney Danger Field.  do you like this use?

(3) i wanted to tell you today but it was too crowded. i resigned
    tuesday.  not out of unhappiness with tymnet, nor due
    to another job calling me.  its a little unusual. we can
    talk about it sometime if you are interested.  i told dan
    i would leave in whatever way was most convenient to him,
    within the next 2 months.  so he has asked me to stay
    until the end of may, when the alfred design is completed.
    but instead of me leading the design, he will and i will
    be a participant.

ok, see you at the carnage review.

bye

bill,


will you have any standards for doing locks in the skywalker environment?
will rodney provide any lock services?

how will the dispatcher handle locks, where both the local
dispatcher
and an off-board dispatcher will contend for the same lock,
which is in the local dispatchers memory? won't that
create a problem?

Subject: isc rodney stuff 



-if rodney comes out well, you can rename it RADney

-if rodney receives a trap from a trapper that is not in sup mode, then
 you will reject it, yes? add this to your error code list
-mmu init was mentioned.  please give what that init will be! details...
 without a bunch of CCITT/ISO/OSI terms..."the CCITT standard
 for PMMU initialization says that..." yuck
-diagram on page 3: you don't want to show the patron as one of
 the entities is Skywalker?
-IOC references should be IOCP
-ISIS references should be ISIS-68K.  Alfred is called Alfred-68K
 for native code and Alfred-E for the Engine Alfred.
-Agent definition is so general that it includes a WIRE as a possible
 implementation...give examples with all definitions.
-mailbox reference on 2nd paragraph on page 16 should be doorbell?
-struct 'variable' length in fig 5 page 17 - what if this
 was of odd length? it should NEVER be.  probably C will make sure
 structs are on word boundaries.  is 16 bit alignment ok?
 in any case, you should state the even-boundary req for structs.
-heap is refences several places, including page 23 1st paragraph.
 but not defined.  what is it, why is it needed.
-page 24: symtab has 2 * preceding it, you wnat only 1 i assume
-do you want a GLOB indicator that says the patron kind?
 'ISIS-type' versus 'UNIX-type' indictor? might simplify
 parsing different product codes? perhaps not.  maybe ignore this one.
-last line page 24 'glob' is not caps or bold; shouldn't it be bold?
-define opaque.
-add an index
-you glossary is way to brief.  beef it up.  'wheres the beef'
-page 25 footnote: missing word 'a' after 'not'
page 26: 'Rodney searches the local card first followed by other
 cards' to find a symbol.  how do you search other cards? broadcast
 message? this is a parrallel search then, and more than 1 could
 respond.  what if they have different attributes of the symbol?
 e.g. what if they show different symtype for the symbol? how do
 you arbitrate? you can just say, 'we take the first response' but 
 you still have to worry how you tell the other guy to fix his
 symbol.
-TSAP on page 28 end of 3.3 is a forward reference
-ARe symbols case-sensitive?  i think so.  please state.
-top of pgae 28 fig 11 - word parameters should not be plural 
 since only 1 parameter within each box
-1st line section 3.4: rodney does not avoid compute intensive tasks
 as the sentence states; it avoids PROCESSING them at interrupt level.
-add summary table for the different RSI in the appendix
-several places 1K is mentioned, e.g. for log file buffer and for
 ipcf messgae buffers.  are you aware that we will propose
 a 4K page size? it will be variable in isis only through 
 recompilation
-regarding RSI_ALLOC, perhaps you also want an RSI_DEALLOC
 routine.  this would ocmplete the dynamic memory interface between
 rodney and an application...even if it were not specifcially
 used in the beginning it would be nice if the routine was there.
-section 3.6.2 2 kinds of log message are mentioned:
 'warning' and 'advisory'.  warning is one of the 8 types defined,
 advisory is NOT.  what does advisory mean here.
-section 3.6.1 you say the patron can read the UTC value directly.
 this is a possible concurrency problem, isn't it, if it
 is 1/2 read and rodney interrupts to update it?
 at least give a warning in the text.  most programmers will not
 think of concurrency stuff unless forced to do so.
-do you log that a boot was started?
-if you halt a card, do you write out its log buffer to the disk?
 it does not say so under boot management.
-page 32 rkBoot routine - no level of authority to do this?
 no cross-checks?
-page 36 1st sentence - 2nd paragraph - misleading.
 says that VMEbus overloads are prevented by sending unending log messgaes!
-define octet on its first use.
-in logs, page 38, if someone logs a panic-level
 log messgae (SLG_EMERG) then you should also automatically
 in rodney send it to the network log!
-page 42: debugger as file servor - this could also be PC hard
 disk receiving log messages, yes?
-page 46a - confession: if the patron updates crashCount and
 crashCode, you hvae a possible concurrency problem; the patron
 may be 1/2 done with updateing when rodney interrupts and does his
 thing to, say, convict this guy.  you could have 1 of the
 fields garbage.  2nd possibility is that the 2 fields are both ok
 but do not match each other.  3rd possibility is that they are
 both written by the patron, then both by rodney; that is ok
 but any log message the patron wrote now does not match
 the real crash reason that rodney wrote.  this 3rd case
 the least important, there may be other log message that
 clarify what occurred.  but the 2st two should be dealt with.

 in general, i don't think you should have the patron update
 the glob.  if you are goign to allow it, then have a very
 clear message of the danger.
-glob: it rodneys memory, yes? which is a different addrss
 space. how does the patron read it.  through a TRAP #RODNEY?
 in which case you can control that no udpates to glob are allowed.
-page 47 1st paragraph - you hve fancy terms like TSAP.  pls
 give your CCITT reference .
-Tymnet in page 48 footnote - all caps
-what did you thinki of the idea to call magic 'public key' ?
-page 54 2nd paragraph - effectively a repeat of the 1st paragraph
 after fig 27 on pgae 53
-pgae 58, and other places similra: in section 5.1
 you give a bunch of new terms, bulleted, without definition!
 'the follwoing terms adefined in the OSI...' sounds good
 but give us the definitions too
-page 67 - the TERROR thing could be where you slip in DANGER
-to my simple minded brain, the multiple TPDU messgaes on pages 
 70 and forwrad could be a single message, with a messge type
 field and a coulpe of variable fields.
-in a TPDU message thereare 2 fields once caleld magic
 and it is follwed by one called key.  if you renamed 'key' to
 'johnson' then you have the pair 'magic johnson' ha ah
-~w wrs2nd
-page 142 (my comments are thinnnig out...) you mention file
 sfs.h in the middle of the page.  why?
-page 143 10.4.4 - you mention a 'regular' file.  what is that?
-sfs.h also on page 150.  grep it.
-once again, i want to say that you guys did a good job.  probably
 the best and largest tymnet manual ever done! it is a good model.


last note: have you listened to radio staion at 99.1? sometimes alittle
weird, but lays a lot of unusual stuff - including electronic music.
soothing.  what i had wanted kblx to be.  let me know if you like it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Adele,

It is my belief than PAD and X.25 should be in strict agreement
as to how we should handle the IIX exchanges after the circuit
request has been processed and the needle is built to the X.25 slot.

Since the NEEDLE message will provide some useful information, I feel
that we should define and confirm the IIX messages currently being
exchanged between PAD and X.25.
After the agreement on the necessary exchanges, we then should look at 
the NEEDLE format and define what information we should take from the
NEEDLE and determine if the IIX exchanges should be eliminated or not.
Of course, there are conditions when either PAD or X.25 is not
LOGII compatible and that we syill have to go through the regular
IIX exchanges.

I like to solicit your input on this and, if possible, set up
a meeting with you to define the scope of the exchange sequences.

Regards,

Subject: Questions for SWB 
RRCPTTo: !WRS@C39.Tymnet

Gazel, Allyn, Bill:

I have listed below some of the questions that perhaps should be posed to
SWB.  Maybe Bill has some of the answers.  If not, then I would like these
questions be presented to SWB as soon as possible.

QUESTIONS FOR SWB:

1. [4/7/87] Are all native DNIC's in SWBNET synonymous?
Here "native" means the DNIC's associated with the network one is
referring to.  "Synonymous" means native DNIC's that are essentially
equivalent, ie. if 3111 and 3222 are native DNICs of a network, then
they are also synonymous when any address of the form 3111xxx... and
3222xxx... refer to the same location.  In the public net, all the
DNIC's are synonymous.

2. [4/7/97] Does SWB expect to use TYMNET II gateways in Phase 1?
SWB is expecting to traverse transit networks, but it is not known
whether they will be using X.75 or T-II gateways.  If so, then work
should be planned (if not already).

3. [4/10/87] Does the link in SWBNET between the X.25 interface and the
DTEs carry abbreviated addresses (like NTD and 1+IDN) or full addresses
(like IDN only)?
We are assuming (unless told otherwise) that the abbreviated addresses
are used mainly at the CONSAT PAD in the login string, for user
convenience.  If the DTE at the X.25 interface allows the user to do the
same, then this DTE is smart enough to do the conversion.  In essence,
the X.25 will never see the abbreviated addressing, since all X.121
adddressing internal to the network will be prefixed with a "-".  Only
the login string may have the abbreviated addressing in SWBNET.

4. [4/14/87] When specifying the RPOA as a transit network, does SWB
require the prefix "1"?
We are assuming "NO".  In fact, we require the prefix "-".  If the
prefix was "1". then we cannot differentiate between the RPOA and a
transit (gateway) host number.  Our assumption is depicted in the syntax
diagram, but SWB may have missed it.

5. [4/14/87] Will SWB use an X.121 name in the user field?  How?
In the syntax diagram, the X.121 name as a username has a fixed prefix
"-", DNIC, and 1 to 10 digits of NTN.  Will SWB require a prefix of "1"?
Whenever we encounter an X.121 address or name, we will lookup the DNIC
table to determine the number of NTN digits to be used in the lookup.
Will that satisfy SWB, or do they care?  Actually, the syntax diagram
requires 1 to 10 digits of NTN in the X.121 name, but we could just
lookup in the DNIC and reject the call if the name is not in the MUD.
Currently, we will follow the latest syntax diagram by Bill Soley, ie.
the X.121 name is prefixed by a "-", must have 1 to 10 digits of NTN,
and will be processed via the DNIC table as in the case of the
destination field.

1. [4/7/87] Are all native DNIC's in SWBNET synonymous?

No, that's just a kludge in the way its implemented, now.  Since in the new
scheme, the DNIC is looked up as part of the name in the MUD, they will
have distinct address spaces (as they should).  If anyone is counting on it
behaving like it does now, they will have to validate more than one host
name.  As for the names that might be generated algorithmically according
to the TYMNET numbering plan, that is a matter for further study.

2. [4/7/97] Does SWB expect to use TYMNET II gateways in Phase 1?

I think they have to use X.75 for interface to carriers, even if they are
TYMNET technology.  Their LATA's are only virtual subnets, so there are
no gateways.  Of course there will be TYMNET-II gateways to Tymnet for the
purpose of down-line loads.

3. [4/10/87] Does the link in SWBNET between the X.25 interface and the
DTEs carry abbreviated addresses (like NTD and 1+IDN) or full addresses
(like IDN only)?

The address provided to X.25 and X.75 interfaces should always be the
full IDN - without the "1".  There was still some debate, last I checked,
as to weather or not they wanted to accept abbreviated addresses at the
X.25 interface (never at X.75).  This is only because they don't understand
the data communication world - it is clear that accepting abbreviated
addresses at the X.25 interface would be a mistake.  At any rate, I
suppose you should check with them to be sure, unless you feel comfortable
doing it right even if they want it done wrong.  I can provide a more
convincing argument than presented here if I must, but I don't really
have the time.

4. [4/14/87] When specifying the RPOA as a transit network, does SWB
require the prefix "1"?

No.

5. [4/14/87] Will SWB use an X.121 name in the user field?  How?

What is an X.121 name?  Assuming you mean a name beginning with a "-",
then what you said is the correct behavoir...

If you allow the X.121 in the user field to be abbreviated as with 1 and
such in place of the "-", then you'll have serious problems in the
transition since numeric names are now legal and have different meanings
by convention.

  You have a message at home @ at the office...  Yesterday, 4/7 someone
(it has not yet been determined who) removed username MAIL from the Tymnet
CUD without using USRVAL, (i.e. no audit records available), and put a
DSTOP of 4/7/1987 in the USERDB on system 74, also without going through
USRVAL.  I will send you more info as I find out more...

If you know anything about this, PLEASE let me know so I will not cause
any problems trying to find out what happenned.

Re:  MAIL username

It appears that someone in validations cancelled username MAIL from the
CUD and put a stop date in the accounting of 4/7/1987.  It showed up on
the inconsistancies report that validations runs against the LUD and so
they called me about it.  It appears that it was cancelled from system
29, probably someone running TYMVALidate, so it didn't leave any tattle
records in USRVAL... sigh.

Info from Nancy Holt was that this occurred at 23:47 GMT yesterday.  The
same session cancelled username SMIBARMAIL then zapped it's circuit.
Jan is going to talk to Vida about this, to try to keep it from happening
again.  (They should look at what they cancel!)

Jan and Nancy are going to put everything back as best they can.  Please
check the CUD entry when you get a chance and make sure it is setup for
all the things we need for username MAIL.  No real need to call me about
this unless there is another problem or you want more detailed info on
when and where it happenned.

A side effect of this is that no TUMS inter-system mail was delivered
while MAIL was gone, however, I suspect that circuits built to ONTYME or
ARPA or MCAUTO etc, continued to work fine.

Since the name was cancelled, it no longer has the same password.  It

Bubb-Net!!!

The problem is in two parts:  Using 1022 seems to cause a random

Since we pay money on a regular basis to Software House, they ought to fix
1022, I would think.  Before we report it, is it predictable in any way
which location gets clobbered?  If so, you can use the address break feature
to find the PC of the instruction doing the store.  I don't think address
break is documented, but it goes like this.

	.get loadii
	job setup

	.adrbrk write 123456

	.start
	<blah blah blah>

	Address break for location 123456 at user PC 400321
	.

It only works on KL-10's, but 39 is and so are most others.  If you can
get FORTRAN to produce pure code, you can also write protect the code
pages.  I'll give you a subroutine if you want.  I do hate to see alot
of effort being put in to rewritting a PDP-10 product when we're trying
to switch to Unix.

Bill -

    A couple of things:

    o  first of all, I have found out that our folks in Irvine (using host
       65 like we do) have not been getting their ONTYMEs for a couple of
       days.  I asked one of the developers here, who gets a daily operations
       status report via ONTYME, if they had been getting to her.  She has
       not received anything on TUMS from ONTYME since 7 April.  I also
       tried sending myself mail via ONTYME; no dice.  I checked the file
       that contains the polling addresses and it appears to be the most
       up-to-date.

    o  Secondly, the problem I mentioned with ONTYME ASD prefixed usernames;
       One of the folks here tried to send something out ("a couple of times")
       using a distribution file that included TUMS addresses and ONTYME
       addresses--prefixes pmts and asd.  Everything got delivered except for
       the asd mail.  She input them individually to resend and had no 
       trouble.  Odd.  I checked her file, the addresses looked fine.
   
    o  Thirdly, late last week I had something rather strange show up:
       I received an ONTYME which had been created using the MEMO command
       and on the TUMS message header, just beneath the SUBJECT line,
       appeared a compressed version of the Subject line from the memo;
       by compressed, I mean without spaces.  Earlier in the day, Harriet
       had attempted to edit a memo she had received--this is all TUMS--
       and resend it to me.  The copy I received looked normal except for
       the part she had added--the entire paragraph was compressed.
       I will give you a portion of these messages to illustrate:

I'll be out of town April 18 through May 11, inclusive.  I will be
reading mail from time to time.  I expect this little trip to reduce
my brain damage back to the single digit range.  See you in May!

I just have this sinking feeling that something is very wrong.
No mail no mail no mail no mail, that is except for a few tums.

"Oh where oh where have my on-tymes gone, oh where oh where can they be?
"

(Don't want them that bad, or I'd get them my self.  I just can't stand
the system.)

Those ontymes are never on time, no?

Yes, at this hour I am a little (little?) cracked.
But then, I am at work now and not at home!


With a trace of sincerity and a bucket of bad jokes,
Bill

There was a problem with the validation of the EMSPMTS user name in BUBBNET
which forced it to always use one particular gateway to reach the public net.
That gateway has been down alot lately.  The validation has been changed to
allow it to use any gateway so the problems you have been noticing with the
collection of Ontymes should go away.  Please let me know if any further

SUBJ>	Arbitration Test Plan For CPU Board Evaluation

======================================================================

After talking with the various people involved in the
68K board evaluation, I came up with the following
list of concern areas for arbitration testing.  They 
are in decending order of importance.

 1.  Verify read-modify-write protocol for the
     Plessy board (i.e. read modify cycle holds
     adress strobe).

 2.  Check all cases of the CAS instruction
        CAS.B
        CAS.W even/odd byte
        CAS.L even/odd byte, even/odd word
        CAS2

 3.  Show VME bus access to RAM can lock out
     local processor RAM access.

 4.  Test VME bus arbitration logic where two
     processors request for the bus simultaneously.

 5.  Verify VME bus capture capability (i.e.
     a processor can hold the VME bus indefinitely).

Please review the above list and give me feedback before
Friday, 4/3/87.  Testing will be done in their order of 
importance.

Your test plan looks complete and reasonable.  #5 might be worded more
accurately as:
  5.  Document effect of holding the VME bus through multiple data
      transfer cycles (i.e. can local processor sneak in between cycles?).

This may be difficult since the Plessey board is incapable of holdin the
bus in this way.  You could test using the Huerikon boards, however, as
bus master and the Plessey as slave.

	Notes on RODNEY External Specification (April 6, 1987)
		John Kopf
		April 8, 1987

Section 1.2:  Since the Skywalker model is so different from the
conventional model of Tymnet (where "application" refers to the set
of processes (interface) in a slot), while using the same words, it
might be appropriate to expand upon this in an appendix, so that all
readers can understand the distinctions between tho old and new meanings
of these words.  In particular, a "slot" is in reality a "client" of
ISIS, and ISIS itself is the "application".  (See also p.16, where
"patron" is defined to get around this usage).  Perhaps an ISO model of
current ISIS and slot could be compared with an ISO model of a slot
within Skywalker, with real benefit.

Also, it should be stressed that system integrity is a joint effort
of all the applications, but not of the slots;  a fault caused by a
slot is actually the responsibility of the controlling application,
since it is the responsibiility of these applications (e.g., ISIS) to
validate client requests before commiting them to the system, (or at
least commiting them with additional restriction information -- e.g.
Addressing-limits on Channel-programs executed by the IOC).  A slot
CANNOT cause a fault unless permitted by the controller, since a slot
does NOT have direct access to ANY system functions.

Section 1.3.4:  Since I can find no reference to the ISIS Dispatcher
within Section 1.3, I recommend it be listed here (unless this is what
is meant by "interprocess Communications Facility -- and if it is, I
doubt that anyone else will identify it as such either).

Section 1.4.2:  There appears to be a discrepency between Rodney and
IOC with respect to "bootstrap" loading from IOC ports...this must be
resolved (I'd recommend a "Boot-driver" in IOC, and Rodney/Skywalker
invoke these drivers when necessary).

Section 2.1:  I am opposed to passing arguments -- upon traps -- via
registers and in-line parameters, having long experience with such
usage in ISIS;  I recommend instead passing a pointer, on the stack,
to a descriptor which specifies the request.  Exceptions should, by
definition, occur infrequently, and thus the minor optimization engendered
by the proposed usage should be insignificant, while potentially causing
problems in the future.  By the same rights, I feel all registers should
be preserved across a Trap;  the specific descriptor can reserve space
for values returned.

Section 2.1.2:  Figure 6 is awkward, especially as it differs from the
usage in 2.1.3 for expounding source code.  I recommend eliminating
"Figure 6" entirely, and retain the 2.1.3 convention for displaying
code.

Section 2.3.1:  There needs to be a capability akin to the ISIS Restart-
SVC so a Patron can tell Rodney where to "trap" to in the event of such
a condition (and possibly others).  Processes such as the Dispatcher
can recover from the condition in the event of such a trap, whereas
"crashing" the dispatcher can leave all sorts of problems dangling.
Also, there is no mention of recovery when Rodney, acting on behalf of
a Patron, engenders such a trap.  There needs to be a mechanism defined
so RODNEY can clean up after itself in this event, and to tell the
Patron if he did it.

Section 2.3.3:  I am still concerned about a desirable future usage
where both ISIS and IOC share the same processor (the "ATC" case).
This would be very difficult if each thought it had the MMU, whereas
arbitration by Rodney would greatly simplify future extensions.  Since
the initialization of the various MMU partitions occurs infrequently
(compared with partition switching), perhaps a compromise could be
worked out wherein Rodney does the initialization, and the patron can
do the switching (of those partitions he has access to).  Such usage
would also permit Rodney to initially map itself before transfering
control to the 
patron.

GENERAL COMPLAINTS:

THERE IS NO INDEX!!!  This is unacceptable on a document of this size.
A desirable index would further identify and distinguish Definitions
from References.

There exist a number of declarations which are apparently based upon
implicit assumptions -- any such assumptions should be explicitly declared
along with enforcement criteria.  An example is the universal usage
of "space"-ASCII (high-order bit off).  Is this really the standard
usage?  If so, whose responsibility is it to convert "Mark"-ASCII to
the standard form (such as might arrive from the network or terminals)?
This is certainly critical for file-names, and a universal convention
would certainly eliminate the need to manipulate characters anywhere
other than at the origination.  (Also, if space-ASCII is the convention
for characters, is there any system meaning for the alternate mark_ASCII
(e.g., special usage such as EOF, EOT, etc)?

Gazel,

Since there will be new messages created, and new message switching
formats defined(SMO), it seems more desirable to have a library
accessible to all interfaces to handle the various SMO messages.

This library should be maintained as an ISIS library package and
deployable to all the network interfaces.

Preliminary Announcement

The 1987 UT Year of Programming

                            with the support of the

U. S. Office of Naval Research

                                  announces

The Institute on Logical Foundations of Functional Programming

   Scientific Director: Dr. Gerard Huet, INRIA

                                   Austin, Texas

                                  8-12 June 1987

There is a growing realization that mathematical logic provides a foundation on
which programming languages and environments for software engineering can be 
soundly based.  Such a foundation should include a highly expressive notation 
for formalisation of requirements, an efficiently implementable language for 
coding programs, and a means of systematically deriving each program from its 
specification, together with such proofs of correctness as are needed.

This Institute concentrates on a particularly simple paradigm.  The type 
verification rules of a programming language such as PASCAL or ADA may be seen 
as a logical inference system.  The rules of inference can be extended in a 
uniform manner to check the validity of a program with respect to more general 
formalized comments, assertions, and specifications.  A powerful constructive 
logic may thus be considered as the backbone of a pure, strongly typed, 
functional programming language.  We may thus envision programming environments
for such languages in which programs are designed consistently with formal 
specifications.  In such a system, a well-typed program serves as its own proof
of correctness, which may be checked by type-checking throughout the period of 
program development.  There is hope that in the future some of the more routine
parts of programs can be generated with machine assistance.

This approach to software engineering is currently the subject of much 
speculation and research, involving both theory and practical implementation. 
One of the leading research projects is Project Formel, which is jointly 
sponsored by INRIA (Rocquencourt, France)  and Ecole Normale Superieure (Paris)
and led by Dr. Gerard Huet of INRIA and Prof. Guy Cousineau  of ENS.  The Year 
of Programming has invited Dr. Huet and his senior colleagues to present their 
work in the Institute on the Foundations of Functional Programming.

The first three days of the Institute will be a tutorial on type theory, 
functional programming, and their relationship to one another.  It will prepare
students with some background in theoretical computer science for the more 
advanced Research Seminar on Thursday and Friday, at which presentations will 
be made of research in progress in several countries around the world.

The tutorial on functional programming and type theory will present a unified 
view of computational structures described by categorical combinators.  These 
combinators may be seen as proof combinators from a sequent formulation of 
intuitionistic logic, or alternatively as the building blocks of an 
environment-manipulating machine well suited for executing lambda-calculus and 
other functional programming languages.  This introduces the Categorical 
Abstract Machine (CAM) (a simplification of Landin's SECD machine) for 
executing call-by-value lambda-calculus.  The language CAML (Categorical 
Abstract Machine Language) is closely derived from languages such as ML and 
Hope.  The compilation of CAML on the CAM will be discussed and compared with 
related projects (ML on the FAM and the G-machine, Amber on the Amber machine).

Polymorphic types and the problems of type synthesis will be discussed at two 
levels: ML's parametric polymorphism, and full polymorphism in Girard's 
second-order lambda-calculus.  A very general logical framework, the Calculus 
of Constructions, will be described.  It will be shown how this formalism 
combines the expressive power of Girard's higher-order polymorphic 
lambda-calculus, Martin-Lof's theory of types, and de Bruijn's AUTOMATH.   The 
tutorial will be taught by Prof. Cousineau and Dr. Huet, the scientific leaders
of  Project  Formel where CAM, CAML, and the Calculus of Constructions have 
been designed and implemented.  An implementation of CAML on SUN workstations 
will be available for demonstrations and practical exercise sessions.

The Research Seminar will present research topics in Linear Logic and 
Constructive Semantics.   Linear Logic, a new formalism designed to serve as a 
logical foundation for parallel programming, will be presented by its inventor,
Prof. Jean-Yves Girard, Groupe de Logique Mathematique, Universite Paris 7. 
Under the general title of Constructive Semantics, recent research in Type 
Theory under way at various centres in the USA and in Japan will be presented 
by four research leaders in the field: Prof. Albert Meyer (MIT), Dr. John 
Mitchell (AT&T Bell Laboratories), Dr. Susumu Hayashi (RIMS, Kyoto University),
and Prof. Andre Scedrov (U. of Pennsylvania).  The Seminar program will be 
augmented by short communications of research work in progress by the seminar 
participants.

It is recommended that potential participants in the seminar register early. In
order to facilitate interaction, the number of participants will be limited.

Original-Subject: Radiation risk at airports?

   On Saturday, April 18, the major wire and news services carried a story, 
attributed to the New York Times, saying that the FAA was about to start 
testing of a prototype neutron beam-based system for detecting the nitrogen in 
explosives that might be in luggage/cargo loaded into plane cargo holds. This 
is a computer-based system that bombards luggage or other cargo with a "beam of
slowed neutrons" and uses a computer system to analyze the signature of the 
resulting gamma radiation emissions to characterize for the potential presence 
of explosives.

   The Associated Press inaccurately suggested that the manufacturer of this 
equipment was a firm named "Thermedics."  The actual NYT article gives much 
more detail and accurately names the manufacturer as "Science Applications 
International Corp." of Sunnyvale.

   Some months ago, when this technology was originally mentioned in the press,
there was some discussion of the radiation problems inherent with this sort of 
technology.  While one would assume care would be used to make sure animals 
traveling as cargo are not subjected to a neutron beam, the problem of 
secondary radiation effects on the clothes, foods, medications, and everything 
else that travels as cargo/luggage seems to be glossed over by the press.  
While normal X-ray technologies do not produce secondary radiation at 
conventional power levels, neutrons are extremely energetic and in fact this 
explosive detection system appears to be depending on secondary radiation for 
its very operation!

   When this system was first discussed in the press some months ago, there was
mention of the problems of cargo and luggage becoming "slightly radioactive" as
a result of being subjected to the "slowed neutron beam."  The current 
discussion in the press seems to be avoiding this issue entirely, instead 
mentioning that the people operating the equipment will not be subjected to 
more than "government standards" for radiation exposure (many persons seem to 
feel that these standards allow far too much exposure as it is).

   The question then, for anyone who understands this technology or knows about
Science Applications International, is: what will happen to luggage, cargo, 
etc., possibly including foods and other items that can be ingested or will be 
in close proximity to persons for long periods of time, after passing through 
such neutron beam systems once or possibly many times in the course of complex 
or multiple trips?  Are airline passengers to be subjected to the radioactive 
luggage and cargo simply because the emission levels meet "government 
standards"?  Will the frequent traveler be at greater risk than the occasional 
traveler?  What is the real story about these systems?

     In case you're wondering who will be the first guinea pigs for this 
technology, it's the folks in the SF Bay area.  San Francisco International 
(SFO) is slated to get the first prototypes of these devices sometime quite 
soon for at least a 4-week trial.  The equipment is then to be tested at other 
major airports and the FAA hopes to have it in widespread use within 2 years.  
Apparently the prototypes to be tested are "improved" versions of an earlier 
model that required 30 seconds per test--the new equipment bombards the target 
material for 6 seconds (possibly longer if the typical conveyer and luggage 
problems cause clogs on the transport system).  Of the two prototypes, one 
supposedly uses a continuous neutron emitter based on an internal chunk of some
radioactive material, while the other uses a "turn-offable" system for 
generating the neutrons.

   Can anyone out there shed some light on the risks associated with this 
   technology?

[The computers in this system may or may not present risks, e.g., if the 
computers are involved in control, or if the signature analysis is faulty.  In 
any case, the risk issues are interesting enough to warrant some KNOWLEDGEABLE 
discussion here.  Let's avoid SPECULATIONS, PLEASE.  PGN]

can you tell me a good source for magnets

i want the strongest ones, and a second source for the cheapest ones
i want various sizes, including mostly small ones like 1 inch max size
(bar, round, etc).

thanks,

kevin

p.s. wasn't it you who told me of the new magnets that are of much
higher density? are they available commercially yet?

You might try Edmund Scientific for
magnets.  I know they have some, but
I don't know if they have the latest.
I'm not sure where they are located,
try WATS directory assistance.  -Bill

Office-1 is still logging in and creating a 23-page nnSMTP.TMP file.
Last time I checked, there were 4 such files, each with the same checksum.
Someone is sending a catalog of bearings, more than 100000 bytes long.

As for distribution, Carl's CPY program does not use UPDATE mode unless you
ask for it.  However, it does not preserve license and protection.  I did
a "CPY SMTP.ROL" which defaults to /SUPERSEDE/NOUPDATE/HOST:*.  Other than
ROLAID, we don't have a post-processor for TELECOpied files.  Do you?

I noticed that the home system for MAIL is 29 in the MUD, but Office-1
insists on building a circuit to 57.  Could you get the prople at Office-1
to use a less loaded system in Fremont?  F58 has very little load these days.

Subject: electric motors 



given an electric motor running at a certain rpm on 6 cells

if i run the same system on a 7 cell battery (cells in series)
what will happen? voltage is higher, so rpm should go up. so
current should go up.

what will this do to running time?
what will this do the the impedance the motor presents, at the
new max rpm?

thanks,

it would be nice if a person could have the message headers
not appear in the message.  it could just have a date line,
  then the subject line, etc.

a related question is this: is anything in a unix system changeable?
do we have source code to any of this?  so if you wanted to
chagne the mail program on unix, could you do it?

thanks,

You should all have received a copy of the GED for the ADRII project.
In the cover letter, I requested comments by Friday, May 1st.  I really
meant Friday, May 8th.  Of course, you feedback after this is still
welcome, but is less likely to have an effect on the design.

Subject: LOGII GED FINAL 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED is being distributed in it's final form and should
reach you in the office mails within a couple of days.  The GED
is also available on system 39 DNDSPEC as LG2GED.DOC.

The document has been completely rewritten to incorporate CCITT
standard protocol X.409 into the logon session design, and the
logon session logic flow has been completely changed.  A full description
of the existing and LOGII logon sessions is provided.

X.409 is A VERY IMPORTANT addition to LOGII.  I cannot emphasize enough
the importance of X.409, specifically the STANDARD TYPE REPRESENTATION
which is used throughout the LOGII GED to represent X.409 data elements.
The notation will undoubtably appear somewhat cryptic, but do not be
put off by this.  After having worked with X.409 over the last month
in the LOGII design, I feel that it the best protocol notation I have
ever used, allowing unambigous notation of complex data streams, in
a concise readily interpretable, standard notation.

Please take the time to UNDERSTAND X.409 AND THE STANDARD TYPE
REPRESENTATION.  One section at the end of the LOGII GED illustrates
the expansion of a X.409 notation into an octet stream, to ease the
reader into X.409, but the X.409 CCITT standard must be studied and
understood before attempting to digest the LOGII message descriptions.

Any comments or questions, feel free to contact me via TUMS/OnTyme
or by phone, at (408)446-7667.

Thanks...Omar

THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE IS SOME FACILITY TO TRANSLATE 
A FIELD DIFFERENTYL THAN IS NORMALLY SET UP IN THE CMT INTERFACE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE HOST SEND A HEX 15 BACK TO THE BSC INTERFACE WHICH
THEN SENDS IT TO THE CMT FOR TRANSLATION TO ASCII AND BACK TO THE

CUSTOMER NAME : FORD MOTOR CO./DCS-MSA

NODES:4545

3.  (JMORDEN:33)BADCMT - - - CMT RING TRACES OF EVENT.


PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

RE-GENNED CMT TODAY TO INCLUDE NEW USERNAME MAPPINGS.  FIRST THING IT DID
DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS GENS WAS THAT IN LOGGING ON IN VT100 MODE IT PRESENTED
ME WITH A BELL AND THE CHARACTER "C" IN THE CURSOR HOME POSITION.  INTERACTION
WAS OKAY UNTIL I ISSUED A CLEAR SCREEN SEQUENCE.  THE SCREEN WOULD CLEAR, A
BELL WOULD AGAIN SOUND, A "C" WOULD AGAIN APPEAR IN THE HOME POSITION, AND THE
CMT WOULD NOT RE-ENTER THE UNLOCKED STATE.  RE-SETTING THE KEYBOARD DID NOT
REALLY FREE UP THE CMT; IT WOULD ACCEPT DATA FROM THE TERMINAL BUT WOULD NOT
FORWARD TO THE HOST UPON RECEIVING A CARRIAGE RETURN.  ALSO, WHEN I KILLED
THE CIRCUIT FROM THE TERMINAL TO THE CMT THE CIRCUIT FROM THE CMT TO THE PBH
WOULD REMAIN UNTIL I HALTED THE SLOT.
TY

PROVIDE RELATED CUSTOMER SVC/NSSC TICKET # (without this number, your
escalation will be rejected) :42441

STEPS TAKEN TO RESOLVE PROBLEM:

1.  REVIEWED SLOT CODE FOR ERRORS BUT FOUND NONE.  MADE SURE I WAS GENNING
    FROM PROPER DIRECTORIES AS PER RECENT ONTYMES.
2.  RE-GENNED FROM NETWORK DIRECTORY SINCE THAT CODE IS RUNNING WITHOUT
    PROBLEM.  PROBLEM OCCURES WITH THE RE-GEN.  ALSO TRIED A REGEN IN WHICH
    I REMOVED ANY POSSIBLY AMBIGUOUS LABELS SUCH AS MENU BUT THE PROBLEM
    STILL OCCURED.
3.  GENNED A TEST SLOT USING THE CODE NOTED ABOVE.  THE SLOT IS RUNNING ON
    NODE 3735, KERNAL 3559, SLOT 2, USING TEST HOST NUMBER 3116.  THIS TEST
    SLOT CAN BE USED TO ACCESS THE FORD SYSTEM BY USING:

       TESTID1;SUN2SHINE

    A SCREEN CAN BE GENERATED FOLLOWING SESSION ESTABLISHMENT BY ENTERING THE
                                                                Page  3

    STRING
            /FOR MSA
    YOU NEED GO NO FURTHER FOR THE TEST; CLEARING THE SCREEN HERE OR AT ANY
    OTHER POINT SEEMS TO HAVE THE SAME CONSEQUENCES.

4.  COMPARED TRACES OF THIS CURRENT GEN OF 3.00 WITH TRACES OF THE PREVIOUSLY
    GENNED, AND HEALTHY, VERSION OF 3.00.  A COPY OF THESE TWO TRACES IS
    AVAILABLE AS NOTED ABOVE.  THE FIRST NEEDLE TO ZAP SEQUENCE CONSISTS OF
    A PROPER FUNCTIONING SEQUENCE OF LOGON, SCREEN REQUEST USING /FOR MSA, 
    A PA3 ISSUED, A CLEAR SCREEN ISSUED, AND THEN ANOTHER /FOR MSA TO VERIFY
    ALL IS WORKING OKAY.  THE SECOND NEEDLE TO ZAP IS OF A NEW, MALFUNCTIONING,
    GEN IN WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO RECREATE THE SAME SEQUENCE BUT BECAME "FROZE
    UP" AT A PA3.  THE THIRD SEGMENT OF TRACE IS A "FREEZE UP" OCCURING WITH
    A CLEAR SCREEN.  DIFFERENCES IN THE CMT TO TERMINAL DATA STREAMS BETWEEN
    THE TWO GENS INCLUDE MISSING UNLOCK KEYBOARD SEQUENCES AND SUBSTITUTION OR
    ADDITION OF BELL(07) CHARACTERS.  TO THIS POINT I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
    BOTH CLEAR SCREENS AND PA3'S CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS AND BOTH RESULT IN AN
    EXTRA DATA CHARACTER BEING DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN; A "C" WHEN A CLEAR
    SCREEN IS DONE AND AN "F" WHEN A PA3 IS DONE.  I KNOW THIS IS STRANGE, BUT
    BOTH THESE CHARACTERS HAPPEN TO BE THE ASCII REPRESENTATIONS OF THE WCC
    OF THE HOST RESPONSE TO THE ISSUED SEQUENCES(C3 AND C6).

5.  CHECKED THE INITIALIZATION FILE FOR ANY CHANGES BUT DID NOT SEE ANYTHING
    OVERT.

6.  GENNED ON SYSTEMS 25, 33, AND 54 WITH SAME RESULTS FROM ALL.

7.  THIS PROBLEM IS SO WEIRD THAT I HOPE I'M NOT OVERLOOKING SOMETHING
    REALLY SIMPLE.  I'VE TRIPLECHECKED WHAT I'VE DONE AND IT ALL COMES
    OUT THE SAME.

QUESTION:

Customer is using EXECULINK software / terminal type, which supports a
25th status line.  25th status line works perfectly.

However, since I have STATUS LINE turned on in code, all terminal types
now have status line, which erases data on 24th line.

I know that all terminals have a keyboard sequence to erase the status
line, however...........

    Is there a way to only turn on STATUS LINE for one terminal type
    and DEFAULT all the others to NO status line?????

----> CC: *** CMT, Steve P, Phil K
-----> Why: Esc. # 16720 for Ford, The Twilight Zone CMT
 
Jeff,
 
Well, I really don't know. It's a hung jury over whether this warrants a
heat-seeking missile or not. On the one hand, it's obvious you worked your
butt off trying to figure out what was going on. On the other hand . . .
What happened was some of the labels you used for the DEFELE macroes, 
DSP135, DSP150-155, 158, and 160, happen to be labels in the code. By the
way, so is MENU1, although that wasn't causing the problem. And if you're
wondering why I'm calling this the Twilight Zone CMT, while it was still
in the process of exchanging IIX protocol niceties with the PBHI, CMT was
also processing an Erase/Write command it picked up from somewhere. (The
WCC of the Write command in the IRING being C3 was just a bizarre and 
confusing coincidence, it wasn't the source of the C on the screen.) The 
moral of this story is, never use labels starting with DSP or MENU, even 
if the manual does give them as examples. I guess it was an easy thing to 
do, so I'll hold off on the heat-seeking missile for now. 
 
Keep walking past the open windows.

RE:  FORD ESC.  #16720 - - - TWILIGHT ZONE CMT    
     
TOD, 
     
THANKS FOR THE HELP AND FOR HOLDING BACK ON LAUNCHING THAT MISSILE.   
     
NORMALLY I WOULD FEEL A BIT SHEEPISH ABOUT THIS KIND OF OVERSIGHT BUT THE  
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT, IN THIS CASE, SEEM A BIT EXTENUATED.    
     
1.  I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR SLOT CODE, WITH THESE SAME LABELS, FOR
    ALMOST A YEAR WITHOUT PROBLEMS.  IN FACT, AS RECENTLY AS 2/9/87 I DID  
    A GEN OF THIS SAME CODE WHICH HAS BEEN RUNNING WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY. 
    WHAT IS DIFFERENT NOW SO THAT THIS SAME CODE AND LABELS CAUSE A MALFUNCTION?
     
2.  IN WORKING WITH THIS VERSION OF CODE I HAVE HAD TWO PAST OCCURANCES OF 
    TRYING TO DEFINE LABELS THAT WERE ALREADY USED IN THE SOURCE CODE.  IN 
    BOTH CASES I RECEIVED ERROR MESSAGES AT GEN TIME ALERTING ME TO THIS SO
    THAT I COULD CORRECT.  WHY DIDN'T THAT HAPPEN IN THIS CASE?  EITHER I  
    HAVE A KNACK FOR PICKING LABELS ALREADY IN USE OR YOU MAY FIND OTHERS  
    GETTING INTO THE SAME BIND.    
     
3.  REGARDING THE LABEL "MENU1".  YESTERDAY I GENNED ANOTHER CMT OF THIS VERSION
    IN WHICH "MENU1" WAS A LABEL I DEFINED FOR A MENUSR STATEMENT.  THE SLOT    
    OPERATED WITHOUT PROBLEMS EVEN WHEN LOGGING ON USING THE DEFUSR ASSOCIATED  
    WITH THAT LABEL.  JUST AN OBSERVATION WHICH I'M SURE IS RELATED TO OTHER    
    VARIABLES IN THE GEN.
     
4.  A LAST OBSERVATION REGARDING THE BIZZARE AND CONFUSING "C".  THE EVENT IS   
    MADE A BIT MORE CONFUSING BY THE FACT THAT AN EXTRA "F" WAS ALSO DISPLAYED  
    ON THE SCREEN WHEN THE WCC WAS A C6.  A DOUBLE COINCIDENCE WHICH, UNLESS    
    THE PROBLEM CONTINUES, IS REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN A CURIOUS BUT MOOT  
    POINT.
     
     
I REALLY DON'T NEED ANY ANSWERS TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS; I'LL JUST CONSIDER THEM 
TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES OF LIFE.  MEANWHILE, I'LL MODIFY THESE LABELS  
AND TEST THINGS OUT.  DE-ESCALATION WILL FOLLOW.  
     
     
THANKS AGAIN FOR WALKING WITH ME IN THE.......TWILIGHT ZONE

FOR ANYONE NEEDING TO GEN CMT VERSION 3.00 -
 
          The latest patches released to Source make it necessary to
          be careful with the labels in your tymfile. Please do not use
          labels beginning with MENU or DSP anywhere (MENU, MENU1, DSP,
          DSP1, DSP135, etc.). Most tymfiles that use it have it in a 
          MENUSR macro, i.e., MENUSR(MENU), and its matching DEFMEN 
          macro, or in a DEFELE macro, i.e., DEFELE(DSP135,. . .). 
          If MENU or DSP is used as part of a label you may get a gen 
          error or you may get no gen error and have strange errors 
          and/or crashes when the code is loaded. As an alternative to
          re-writing your entire tymfile, you can look up any labels 
          you have questions about in the Cross Reference of a version 
          3.00 code listing. If you find it in the Cross Reference you 
          should not use it in your tymfile. As an example, DSP135 is 
          a label in the source code which you can find in the Cross 
          Reference, so you should not use it. DSP136, however is not 
          an existing label so it is all right to use it in your tymfile.
 
SOURCE PATCH FILE UPDATE -
 
          The patch file in Source for version 3.00 of CMT - found in
          (SOURCE)CMTI03.P00 - is now o.k. to use. Those of you who 
          genned code with the patch file in TFISTE or TECHSERV please
          change your commands files back to SOURCE. Thank you all for
          your attention to this matter.
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

-----> Why: Esc. # 17277 for Social Security Admin., Slot out of ports
 
Dawn,
 
This is going to sound like a very picky question, but was the slot out
of ports message in uppercase or lowercase? Knowing this will help us
track down the origin of the message, since I cannot find anyplace in
the CMT code where we send this message out. Also, for the slot dump
you gave me, I see where there were two users logged in with crt/prt
pairs, then one of them logged off. I see no needles indicating login
attempts. Can you give me some idea of when users got the message in
relation to when the dump was taken? Thanks.
 
Keep walking past the open windows.

I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DEFINITE ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS YOU ASKED
IN YOUR MEMO ABOUT THE "SLOT OUT OF PORTS ON NODE 5553" MESSAGE.
I NEVER SAW THE MESSAGE MYSELF AND ONLY HAVE WHAT WAS REPORTED IN
THE TICKET TO GO ON.  AS SUCH, I'M NOT SURE IF THE MESSAGE WAS
IN UPPER OR LOWER CASE.  HOWEVER, I WOULD GUESS THAT THERE WAS
A BIT OF A DELAY BETWEEN THE TIME THE USERS RECEIVED AND REPORTED
THE MESSAGE, AND THE TIME WHEN THE DUMP WAS TAKEN.
I KNOW I HAVEN'T GIVEN YOU MUCH INFO TO TRY AND ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.
ALSO, THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I KNOW OF THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS
BEEN RECEIVED BY SOCIAL SECURITY USERS.  UNLESS THERE'S
SOME OTHER INFO I CAN PROVIDE, I MAY HAVE TO DE-ESCALATE
THE PROBLEM IF IT DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
AND IF (NOT WHEN !) IT DOES HAPPEN AGAIN, I'LL TRY AND
CAPTURE THE INFO YOU REQEUSTED THIS TIME.
THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP WITH EVERYTHING !!

SUBJ: New terminal type macros

--> To: Roger Rouselle
---> From: Tod Fiste
----> CC: *** CMT
-----> Why: New CMT terminal types
 
Roger,
 
It has come to my attention that macros written by the QA group to allow
emulation for the Execulink II terminal emulation have not been included
in the version 4.02 init file. These macros worked for version 3.00 and
4.00, but I am told that they need to be modified significantly to work
with version 4.02. Is there a procedure by which the QA group passes new
terminal emulation macros over to your group? If not, perhaps one could
be established. In the meantime, how can we get the Execulink macro and
any others that may not have gotten into the 4.02 init file modified so
that they can continue to be used? Several betatest customers will not be
able to use 4.02 until this terminal type is available to them.
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
 
Regards,
 
Tod Fiste

--> To: Larry Borsa
---> From: Tod Fiste
----> CC: *** CMT, ** RFI, Dan Gauvin
-----> Why: RFI # 16639 and 19487 for SUNY, Character remapping
 
Larry,
 
We do have the capability of remapping the characters we receive from the
host, although you have to be a little careful about what you're doing be-
cause of the optimizer. But for most characters, all the information you
need to know is in (TECHREF:56)CMTI.ERS, pages 82-84, under CHRMAP and
REMAPC, which are the two macros you need to use. Check out the manual and
let me know if you have any specific questions about what you need to do.
 
As for giving the customer a copy of our 'translation table', it doesn't 
exist in any form that I think we could give to a customer - I suggest
you explain what we are capable of doing for them (referring to the CMT
manual), and then if they still want to change their side tell me what
specific functions they are looking for and I'll help you figure out how
we translate them.
 
Keep walking past the open windows.

QUESTION
TOD, THANKS FOR THE NICE REPLY LAST TIME. THESE GUYS ARE FULL OF 
QUESTIONS.
THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO KNOW IF THERE IS SOME FACILITY TO TRANSLATE 
A FIELD DIFFERENTYL THAN IS NORMALLY SET UP IN THE CMT INTERFACE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE HOST SEND A HEX 15 BACK TO THE BSC INTERFACE WHICH
THEN SENDS IT TO THE CMT FOR TRANSLATION TO ASCII AND BACK TO THE
TERMIANL, CAN WE TRANSLATE THIS HEX 15 TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE
NORMAL ASCII???????  THANKS FOR THE HELP.

Bill,
I'm going to be submitting some PIR's to improve the way CMT handles
file transfer.  I sounds like DuPont has some thinkg in mind with
the request you made a few weeks ago for tranparency.
Please give me a call at (408)432-5239.  I'd like more details on what 
it is that DuPont needs.  Thanks.
Mary

TODD, THIS IS A FOLLOWUP TO MY PHONE CALL REGARDING THE CUSTOMER 
WANTING TO KNOW WHAT CHARACTERS HE CAN SEND FROM HIS HOST TO THE BSC
AND CMT INTERFACES THAT WILL TRANSLATE INTO A CR AND LF AT
THE TERMINAL. HE FEELS THIS IS ALL HE REALLY NEEDS. I WORKED WITH HIM 
USING THE ENGINE CARD AND HE SAID HE TRIED THIS TRANSLATION FROM
EBCIDC TO ASCII AND IT DIDN'T WORK.
IT SEEMS WE ARE NARROWING IT DOWN. THANKS FOR ALL THE SUPPORT.

Cherie,
 
The looping problem that you experienced was fixed by a patch Norman 
wrote which is now in the Source patch file. The code was genned prior
to the patch being put in the source file, because the patch isn't in
the dump. Regen the code and you should have no more problems with it.
 
By the way, thank you for the thorough way you gathered the information
for this escalation. It is much easier to solve problems when the data
is presented so completely.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.

Mary,
 
Since the last time the customer "fixed" their side, I am not able to re-
produce the problem as I was before using the lab slot and version 4.02.
I wonder if something changed on their side in the process of correcting
whatever problem they were having. Could we get some feedback, and could
you and/or the customer confirm what I'm now seeing?
 
And above all, Walk Safely.

Grace,
 
The present CMT code allows you to turn the status line on and off for all
terminals, but you can't turn it on for some and not for others. The user
can, as you mentioned, turn his status line off after he has logged in, but
that is about your only option. If you have any other questions, please let
me know.

PRIORITY LEVEL 5

BASELINE PRODUCT CODE: CMTI

VERSION: 3.00

CUSTOMER NAME and CID#: Bechtel Power - 59486

QUESTION:

Customer is using EXECULINK software / terminal type, which supports a
25th status line.  25th status line works perfectly.

However, since I have STATUS LINE turned on in code, all terminal types
now have status line, which erases data on 24th line.

I know that all terminals have a keyboard sequence to erase the status
line, however...........

    Is there a way to only turn on STATUS LINE for one terminal type
    and DEFAULT all the others to NO status line?????

----> CC: *** CMT, Pam Pobat, Phil Kiefer
-----> Why: Esc. # 20547 for Heller Financial, looping problem
 
Cherie,
 
The looping problem that you experienced was fixed by a patch Norman 
wrote which is now in the Source patch file. The code was genned prior
to the patch being put in the source file, because the patch isn't in
the dump. Regen the code and you should have no more problems with it.
 
By the way, thank you for the thorough way you gathered the information
for this escalation. It is much easier to solve problems when the data
is presented so completely.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.
 
 
Regards,
 
Tod Fiste

Subject: Esc. # 22301 for Host Int'l, Slot crash 

--> To: Michelle Willhauck
---> From: Tod Fiste
----> CC: *** CMT, Kushi Kullar, Cheryl London
-----> Why: Esc. # 22301 for Host International, Slot Crash
 
Michelle,
 
The illegal memory reference happened because of a wild jump into some
code that referenced register 8, which at that point contained invalid
data. You can tell that it was a "wild" jump because the GETSCN routine
where the crash point is was called by the DSP100 routine, which processes
Erase/Write commands. The two terminal DCBs registers 11 and 12 are 
pointing to are for terminals which the rings show to be in the process
of logging on and have not received any commands from the host yet. (The
fact that reg. 11 and 12 are pointing to 2 different terminal ports is
another reason to guess a wild jump.)
 
Unfortunately, the only thing I can see that may have caused such an
occurrence is the fact that two of the labels in your tymfile, MENU1
and MENU2, are also labels in the source code. There is no evidence
in the dump to prove that this was the cause, but wild jumps often do
result when labels are duplicated. I would suggest that you change
these two labels and regen your code, and then if you get another such
crash perhaps another dump would give me more information to work with.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.
 
 
Regards,
 
Tod Fiste

Michelle,
 
The illegal memory reference happened because of a wild jump into some
code that referenced register 8, which at that point contained invalid
data. You can tell that it was a "wild" jump because the GETSCN routine
where the crash point is was called by the DSP100 routine, which processes
Erase/Write commands. The two terminal DCBs registers 11 and 12 are 
pointing to are for terminals which the rings show to be in the process
of logging on and have not received any commands from the host yet. (The
fact that reg. 11 and 12 are pointing to 2 different terminal ports is
another reason to guess a wild jump.)
 
Unfortunately, the only thing I can see that may have caused such an
occurrence is the fact that two of the labels in your tymfile, MENU1
and MENU2, are also labels in the source code. There is no evidence
in the dump to prove that this was the cause, but wild jumps often do
result when labels are duplicated. I would suggest that you change
these two labels and regen your code, and then if you get another such
crash perhaps another dump would give me more information to work with.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.

QUESTION:
PARKER HANNIFIN HAS FINALLY AGREED TO GET THEIR USERS MOVED
TO A CERTIFIED TERMINAL PACKAGE (OUR SMARTYM PRODUCT) AND OFF OF
THE "TOPS" PACKAGE THAT MARY ARNETT WROTE THE "TOPS.MAC" MACRO FOR.

NOW THAT THEY ARE MOVING TO A CERTIFIED PACKAGE THAT SUPPORTS THE
25TH STATUS LINE THEY HAVE REQUESTED THE STATUS LINE BE TURNED ON...
BUT ONLY FOR THE SMARTYM TERMINAL MACRO.  SINCE THE STATUS LINE
IS DEFINED DEFAULT ON- WHEN IT IS ALLOWED THIS POSES A PROBLEM
FOR MOST OF OUR CUSTOMERS.  THEY WOULD PREFER AT THIS TIME TO
HAVE THE DEFAULT OFF FOR ALL OTHER TERMINALS AND ON FOR THE SMARTYM.

SINCE THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE I HAVE TO
PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH THIS REQUEST IS TO EDIT THE CMTI03.I00 FILE
AND CHANGE THE "STADEF" TO "(-1)".  THIS ACCOMPLISHES THE REQUEST
BUT  WILL THIS CODE BE SUPPORTED BY HQTECH?

--> To: Roseann Koralewski
---> From: Tod Fiste
----> CC: *** CMT, Steve P., Phil K.
-----> Why: Esc. # 22217 for Clark, Dispatcher Crash
 
Roseann,
 
As we have discussed over the phone, the crash occurred while the user
was in the process of logging in, at the terminal type screen. Instead
of a 1 or 2 digit number as we were expecting we got more than 50x "u"s.
The oring shows us responding by sending a bell to the terminal for each
"u" we got plus an error message asking the user to retype the terminal
type. CMT attempted to send the bells and the error message all together
in one IIX data message, which was larger than 9F and therefore caused
the Dispatcher crash. 
 
There are two obvious problems here. One, we shouldn't be getting all
those "u"s from the consat. This is a known problem. Second, the CMT
should never try to send a data message longer than 9F. This problem is
complicated by the fact that the routine that collects the terminal type
number from the terminal does not send bells in response to invalid 
terminal input, so the bells should not have been sent at all. If we
were sending them from another routine we got into accidently I can see
no evidence of it, and I can see nothing in the tymfile that would cause
a wild jump into some other routine. 
 
The dump is not going to be enough information to pinpoint why we sent
the bells, and without knowing that I won't be able to know why we sent
that many characters in a data message. We discussed the possibility of
reproducing the problem; could you let me know when you have determined
whether or not this can be done? If we can reproduce it, I am confident
that we can solve it.
 
Keep walking past the open windows.

---> From: Tod Fiste
----> CC: *** CMT, Grace Intres
-----> Why: Esc. # 85660 for Numerax, Remapping linefeed and CR
 
Tom,
 
The problem with the remapping that the customer wants is that the optim-
izer seems to do strange things to most EBCDIC characters less than 40,
including 25 and 0D, when they are sent to a crt. To say this is improper
is not true, since the 3270 protocol states that these are valid format-
ting characters for printers, but not for crt's. We actually do one step
better than an actual IBM CU (which we emulate to the host/FEP); if a 25
is sent to a real 327X terminal hung off a CU, the terminal session is
terminated. 
 
As far as what we would need to do to allow these characters to be sent,
I cannot give you a good answer. I believe at least 2 patches would need
to be written, but I have been unable to determine the degree of difficulty
involved because I haven't been able to track down where in the optimizer
the problem arises. 
 
On the other hand, if the customer can send us some other character instead
of 25 for linefeed, 0D for CR, etc., we may be able to do something for 
them. What we could then do would be the opposite of what Tom did in the
tymfile in (TSAMPSON:54)NW7756.T02. For example, we could map EBCDIC AA
to ASCII linefeed. My initial tests show that this would work, but I want
to stress that the optimizer, under the right circumstances, could still
cause problems. The CMTI.ERS manual suggests that when sending escape 
sequences to the terminal (basically the same type of situation), the 
escape sequences should be sent in a seperate Erase/Write command, pre-
ceded and followed by empty E/W commands to insure that the optimizer 
will not get in the way. I think that even this customer can see that
doing that would be more trouble than getting rid of whatever home-grown
software they're using that is causing all these non-IBM hassles. But
of course they still have the option of trying to just send the special
characters in with the rest of the 3270 data and hope they'll be lucky.
 
I want to stress again that the job of CMT is IBM 3270 emulation, which
means that we act like a 327X CU as far as the host is concerned. We
cannot be expected to anticipate every protocol violation a customer
might want to indulge in and react appropriately. If the customer was
of the understanding that we would pass anything we got from their host
through to the terminal transparently, either they understood wrong or
it was explained to them wrong. A protocol converter cannot be transparent
and still do translation. A computer program like CMT has to have a set of 
rules to follow in order to operate, and the rules CMT follows are IBM
3270. 
 
If you have any more questions, just ask.

Larry,
 
The CHRMAP macro doesn't work properly. Putting the statement 
GENMAP  EQ  1
in your tymfile will make it work. I also want to refer you to the
CMTI.ERS manual, page 91, "Sending Escape Sequences From Host To Terminal"
which advises that the host application send the characters to be 
translated into the escape sequence be sent in a seperate E/W command
preceded and followed by seperate E/W commands with no data so that the
optimizer will not modify them. This may not be necessary in all cases,
but you should (and the customer) should at least be aware of it and 
keep your eyes on it, or better yet, have him do it this way from the
start.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.

Stephanie,
 
The dump reveals some interesting things, most notably some invalid char-
acters from the host. But before I start pointing fingers at the host, I
want to check a couple of other things out. Can you tell me what the term-
inal or emulation package was that was logged in when (that is, before) 
the dump was taken?
 
Keep walking past the open windows.

Cherie, 
 
The trace I got really doesn't contain anything I can see that would cause
CMT to send this message. I would like to trap the occurence by having 
you or the customer log through CMT host 1894 into the customer's SNA slot
and try to reproduce the problem. When you are successful you will get a
"hung" condition rather than the error message. If you are unable to re-
produce the problem in this way, please talk to the customer about allow-
ing us to test after hours. Be sure he understands that he will not have
use of the CMT while we are testing. The test should not take long.
 
And above all, keep walking past the open windows.

Rick Gottesman, my contact at SUNY will be unavailable for further
testing until Monday, May 4th.  We'd like to set up testing at
your earliest convenience Monday morning. 


As a result of this delay, please feel free to lower the priority of
the escallation.

Thanks for all your help on this one Tod, I now that Rick appreciates
all the time you've been spending on it and so do I.  Talk to you
Monday morning.

The impedance will remain constant so
long as the load is constant.  Given
a constant impedance, P=E*E/R, so the
power will increase as the square of
the voltage applied.  With one more
cell you will have 7/6 times the volts
and 7/6 times the power so the run
time will be 6/7 times.  It is really
more complex than this since the load
is not likely to remain constant since
the driving characteristics will vary.
I'm also not sure of the exact relation
between impedance and load.  It is
probably different for different motors.

Subject: Ribs data 


Hey, South Bay types:

In case you haven't heard, there's a really good barbecue 
restaurant in Mountain View (of all places).

ALLEGED FACTS:
It's called the Sunset Barbecue. The proprietor is known only as G.T.,
and he practices a brand of cookery he calls "Tennessee barbecue."
My girlfriend's a Chicagoan, and we both remarked when eating it
how much it reminded us of Chicago-style barbecue. Turns out
G.T. spent a good part of his life working at Leon's Ribs (the one
and only), and claims he built Leon's smokers. Whatever, he knows his
stuff.
The sauce is very rich and smoky, and not too sweet. Everything
is charcoal grilled, and crunchy on the outside and juicy on the
inside. The salads are professionally done, and the cornbread muffins
are soft and sweet. Prices are about average for the area--figure $10
a head (max) for drinks and dinner, half as much for lunch.
G.T. himself is a kick. He sings, juggles, and will talk you to death
if you give him half a chance. The restaurant is in the back of a 
blue-collar neighborhood bar, and so has a full line of drinks for
very cheap.

HOW TO GET THERE:
US 101 to Rengstorff Ave. South on Rengstorff to the first traffic
light. Right on Old Middlefield Way, and immediately left into
the parking lot. The building is the Dublin Inn. If you go in the
front you get a full-scale bar complete with pool tables.
If your taste is more refined, you can go around the back and come
straight into the restaurant.

The place is really funky and has good food. Try it, tell 'em

I put up a newer version of SMTP that
  1. is more efficient with large messages
  2. rejects large messages with the proper error code
This version (26) should fix the problem,
however if Office-1 sees fit to keep sedning
in spite of the error codes, there is little
I can do except to call Bill Barns or Bill Daul
at Office-1 and have them do something.
I'll check it in a few more minutes to see
if things have settled down.  The new
version should be sent to every system
but that's too much for now.  Did anyone
ever write a nice distribution program
or fix telecopy so it doesn't use update?
That would help.  -Bill

Subject: The ARPA to MCAUTO connection. 

Let me see if I've got this right.  When someone on ARPAnet sends a message to
someone on MCAUTO, the message goes from ARPA thru OFFICE-1 to D57 on TYMNET,
then from D57 to B39 on BUBBNET, then from B39 back to TYMNET to the MCAUTO
server.  

Was this done so that only 1 PDP-10 system talks to the MCAUTO server?

We have been going around to all systems looking for 62.Q, editting it so
that the recipients are @930, then renaming it to 930.Q.  Is there a better
way of rerouting all mail for one host to a different host?     /Joe

The MAILER on Office-1 needs to be told to use a different PDP-10 on
TYMNET as soon as possible.  Now that accounting has moved to an IBM
system in St Louis, system 58 is idle.  I recommend building a circuit
to MAIL:58 instead of MAIL:57.   /Joe Smith.

Yes, all that is so only 1 pdp-10 talks to
mcauto.  I'll be changing that to a public
net host when I get back, probably 58
as per your suggestion.  That would take
one hop out of the path.  There seems
to be a bug in SMTP that lets it keep
the message that's too big.  I'll try
to hold things together until I get back and have time to fix it.

I'll setup ROUTER.DAT to send 930's

still be a problem when 62 gets it the
mail will still be addressed to 930 -
I will think of some kludge to get around

if power increases as the square of the voltage, then having 7/6 times the
volts should give (7/6)*(7/6) the power not just 7/6, right?
which is 49/36, which is an increase of 36%.  how do you
calculate the run time?

MINUTES:
 
The second SWBT project status meeting was held on April 24 in Building D
to discuss the following topics:
 
1.  Identify all documents written and planned for the Phase 1 projects.
    These were supplied by Gazel and are listed here:
 
                                             Section          NTD      Marketing

    X.25 General Internal Design (GID)       X.25             6/8/87   See note
 
    Note: ERS and GID normally are not reviewed by Marketing. Can be furnished
          upon request if need be. Also, dates for Marketing review of documents
          are estimated. Exact dates will depend upon NTD internal review/update
          periods needed per document.
 
2.  Detailed schedules were to be furnished by each development Section.
    These were furnished on diskettes as activity network models done using
    SuperProject Plus application. An integrated schedule done at a higher
    level (ie. less detail) is to be prepared from these for publication.
    Schedules from NETVAL group was deferred until late last week due to
    technical questions that schedule depended upon.
 
3.  Gazel was preparing list of technical questions from each Section that
    needed to be presented to SWBT for clarification. She will issue these
    to Sue Heisler and copy all.
 
4.  Rehash of requirements list of those items that were questionable for
    Phase 1 development were resolved. Now all items indicated by SWBT as
    features to be supported in Phase 1 are in agreement with NTD developers.
    Items in question were 37, 38, 41, 50, 51 and 53.
 
5.  Response to my memo to Sue Heisler calling for status on action items
    from March 18 meeting with SWBT was shared with the group. Most SWBT
    action items are still 'open' and not yet resolved. Expected response
    from SWBT on LOG II document review was set as 4/30/87. No word on
    this as yet. All attendees have copies of my memo and Sue's response.
    We will wait for an update to this.
 
6.  In response to SWBT request to learn of NETVAL procedural changes,
    Romolo suggested using the NETVAL ERS and the User's Guide that
    document same. Without knowing the specific concerns of SWBT, this
    was felt to be the best references to use that explain differences
    under NETVAL development for Numbering Plan (e.g Host Names).
 
7.  Need for new TMCS project was discussed. Romolo indicated that mods
    to support Numbering Plan will be addressed in Version 11.XX.
    Also, no RAM project will be part of Phase 1 of Numbering Plan.
 
8.  Henry Rivers of the X.25 Section joined the meeting and is assigned
    to design/implement X.25 features of the Numbering Plan.
 
9.  The remaining portion of the meeting and the majority of the time was
    spent discussing review comments on Paul Chu's CONSAT GED. Revisions
    to the document were made the following week and document is ready for
    Marketing review. GEDs for MUD II and ADR II were to also be ready
    for internal review the same week.
 
10. The product versions of code being modified for Numbering Plan are:
 
                        CONSAT(PAD) 7.00
                        NODE        5.30

          PLEASE NOTE:  THE REGULAR WEEKLY STATUS MEETING WAS SCHEDULED FOR
          FRIDAY, MAY 9 AT 1:30, INSTEAD OF THURSDAY.
 
          The FASB sign off procedure was discussed. Dave Bliss stated that
          hardware feasibility has not been established yet.
 
          CSC has asked whether Engineering would be willing to provide PLC
          release materials to accelerate production.  Dave Bliss is to get
          back to Ken.
 
          A Skywalker  performance meeting  was scheduled with Chung Lam on
          5/8/87 from 9:30 to 11:30.
 
          A meeting with Mary Arnett was scheduled for 5/4/87 to discuss QA
          test plans and coordination issues with NTD.
 
          Skywalker cost  estimates are  to be  received from Dave Bliss on
          5/4/87 ( BJ, I still need a copy).
 
          The respective team leaders will be requested to  keep a  list of
          coordination topics and to meet weekly to discuss them.
 
          It  was   agreed  that   for  the  software  engineering  effort,
          intermediate results produced by  the  individual  teams  will be
          distributed  to  improve  communication  and  reduce  the  review
          effort.
 
 
 
                                          1

 
 
 
 
          The following distribution  for  project  released  documents was
          agreed upon:
 
               Dan Lasater         16 copies
               Dave Bliss           2 copies
               John Coons           9 copies
               Gazel Tan            3 copies
               Pat Driscoll         8 copies
               Michael Stimac       5 copies
 
          This is in addition to the Core Team distribution.
 
          All documentation for Skywalker will be placed on MINIMAC. Ken to
          set up a directory with the appropriate protection.
 
          The Indian Hills coding convention was adopted for the C programs
          with one exception as to the position of the {.
 
          It was agreed that all C code must pass LINT before compilation.
 
          SCCS  was  adopted  and  proposed  to  be  included in a division
          programing practices for C.
 
          Ken is to put together a release procedure for Skywalker.
 
          All future  change  control  documents  will  require  a revision
          history.
 
          There was  a brief  discussion on the Motorola board.  Due to the
          sensitivity of the issue, it was  decided  to  raise  it  at Al's
          staff  meeting.  At  the  staff  meeting  it was decided that the
          board's design was inferior to the existing selected board.
 
          There was a discussion on VME monitors. Engineering is evaluating
          some and it was decided to table this issues until the evaluation
          is complete.
 
          Mike Rude is to write a PIR to provide for Standard Documentation
          macros.
 
          There was  a request  to Dave Bliss to provide some documentation
          for the current selected board (Plessy).
 
          There is an immediate need  to  define  the  format  for  the DDL
          record (  X.409?).   Michael Stimac, Dan Lasater and Pat Driscoll
          are to get together and resolve.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                          2

 
 
 
 
          There is a requirement for a statement to the effect  of reducing
          or  eliminating  the  use  of  vendor  specific  features  in the
          software implementation.  When use of these features is required,
          those features  should be  contained in modules which are clearly
          identified as non-portable. John Coons, Dan Lasater, Pat Driscoll
          and Bill Euske to provide an update on this item at next meeting.

[The April 30 issue of Computer News (the magazine that ran alone with the 
story for months before the rest of the media noticed) carried the most 
complete summary I have seen to date. Here it is, slightly abridged.  Brian]

DEFENCE DEATHS: THE FACTS BEHIND THE STORY

The mysterious deaths of two Marconi systems experts first reported in Computer
News have sparked off intense speculation. Tony Collins clears up the confusion
surrounding this baffling series of events:

Late last year, a Bristol coroner, Donald Hawkins, spoke of a possible 'James 
Bond' connection between the deaths of two computer experts involved in key 
underwater defence projects.

Since then the mysterious deaths of five other defence workers have come to 
light.  In addition, another scientist has disappeared and a senior ICL 
employee is critically ill after an unexplained fall.

Most incidents have occurred after the men have successfully completed

important projects or left one job for another.

Although there are police suspicions that many of them were depressed for 
different reasons, Computer News could establish no obvious motive for suicide 
in any of the cases.....

Four of the dead men were employees of the GEC group - three at Marconi and one
at Easams. Two others worked at separate times at the Royal Military College of
Science at Shrivenham.

A Computer News investigation has established that most of the men were 
involved in computer simulation, arguably the key which opens the door to some 
of Britain's most secret defence technology.....

Marconi is Britain's only torpedo supplier and was last year awarded the 
Ministry of Defence's largest weapons order - (pounds) 400m  for advanced 
anti-submarine Sting Ray torpedoes.  The Sting Ray's computer aided guidance 
system is so advanced it is being used in the development of Marconi's 
strategic defence initiative (SDI) programmes.

The Royal Military College at Shrivenham is also involved in a number of 
Britain's leading edge defence projects.  The college develops new testing 
devices for the Ministry of Defence and is engaged as a sub-contractor to 
defence companies on research and development.....

All the men involved were ambitious and demonstrated a special ability in their
particular field.  Marconi employee Vimal Dajibhai, 24, found dead beneath the 
Clifton Suspension Bridge last August, was about to leave Marconi for a higher 
paid job.

Ashad Sharif, another London programmer found dead in Bristol, was about to 
take over the running of a department at Marconi's Stanmore headquarters.

David Sands, who died in March as his car loaded with two cans of petrol 
exploded into flames as it crashed into a disused cafe, had just returned from 
a family holiday in Venice to celebrate the ending of a three year command and 
control systems project for Marconi's sister company Easams.

Marconi Space Systems employee Victor Moore (46) had just finished work on 
infra-red satellites at Portsmouth when he was found dead from a drug overdose.
His death is said to have instigated an MI5 investigation, the results of which
will remain secret.

There is also a separate investigation into Marconi based at Portsmouth by the 
Ministry of Defence Serious Crime Squad.

Early this year, two lecturers on top secret projects died in separate 
'accidents' of carbon monoxide poisoning.  Both had recently returned from 
America and had conducted research at the Royal Military College in Shrivenham.

The first, Peter Peapell, a lecturer and underwater acoustics expert, was found
dead under his car and the garage door was closed.  Although an inquest 
returned a verdict of accidental death, police are unsure how the accident 
happened.....

Despite reports that Peapell had no connections with electronics or computers 
he had in fact written a book on basic computers.  He also had a paper 
published on underwater acoustic emissions.

The second, Dr. John Brittan, a former computer science officer at the Royal 
Military College was also inexplicably found dead in his car this year. He too 
was involved in computer simulation.

A few weeks ago, Stuart Goody (23) a post graduate at the Royal Military 
College at Shrivenham was killed in Cyprus while on holiday.  He died instantly
when his hired car collided head on with a lorry.  The lorry driver was said to
be unhurt.  At least one senior employee at the college considered that the 
death could be significant.

Avtar Singh-Gida, a researcher working on an important Ministry of Defence 
underwater project, disappeared just three weeks away from its successful 
completion.....

About two weeks ago, Robert Greenhalgh, a contracts manager at ICL's defence 
division at Winnersh near Reading, suffered multiple injuries after falling 
from a railway bridge on his way to work.....

The firm admitted he had been positively vetted and may have had access to

secret UK and Nato data.....

After every death, police have given unofficial press briefings which provide 
journalists with plausible though unconfirmed explanations for the accidents or
apparent suicides.

The major problem for police has been the lack of obvious signs of depression 
in any of the cases.....

Several MPs have demanded a government inquiry although there are no signs that
ministers will agree.

The answer to the mystery may never be known, at least in the short term.  As 
one policeman said: "We'll probably know all the answers when the papers are 
released in 30 years time."

Subject: include bug in mcc68k 

	mcc68k.bug

I have encountered what I consider to be a serious "BUG" in the mcc68k
C-compiler, related to the handling of "include" files.  The mcc68k
implementation prevents reasonable maintenance, and is counter to
Kernigan & Ritchie's explanation (pp. 207, sect 12.2):
"
  A complier control line of the form
	#include "filename"
causes the replacement of that line by the entire contents of the file
filename.  The named file is searched for first in the directory of the
original source file, and then in a sequence of standard places...
"

This says that if one has a file-structure of the form:

	x
	 \
	  y
	 / \
	C   z		C = 'c' file
	     \
	      I		I = included file

then C should say '#include "z/I"'.  This is the way Vax cc works;  it
permits you to say 'cc C' from anywhere (including x), and have it work
right.

However, mcc68k performs relative to the EXECUTION DIRECTORY, not the
source-file directory!  The above form will work if you are executing
from directory y, but not from directory x!  If in x, the command
'mcc68k y/C' will only work if C is changed to say '#include "y/z/I"'.

This is neither portable, nor even useful in a released form -- the
process of release requires that the include statements be changed
(and it's even worse if you wanted to compile a released C from other
than the specified path).

We need to get this changed, so that mcc68k works right.

Yes, and no.  P=E*I, I=E/R, so P=E*E/R.  Since R is constant (maybe not true)
then P=E^2 so adding another cell would give you 49/36 or 36% increase in
power.  If the efficiency and impedance remain constant, that's 36% more
power to the wheels.  Batteries are generally rated in amp-hours (capacity)
so the run time is proportional to I, not P, thus an extra cell will give
you 7/6 the run time for the same percentage of discharge.  -Bill

Yea, he lives and works in Fremont along with Carl Baltrunas.  His
extension is 116-2512.  JMS@X930 is his correct address, but system 930 may
be down for ever, so try JMS@X62.  He's one of the two significant official

Armond Briggs,
 
Please pass this document to Verne Hale.  Thank you.   Linda
 
 
    Business Environment
 
    A.  The Aerospace Environment
 
        1.  The business environment in which McDonnell Douglas
            operates is changing in fundamental ways.  There
            has been a redirection in the Federal budget with
            less resources being allocated to national
            defense.  Factors contributing to the decline in
            the defense budget are complex but include the
            perception of a lessening of tensions with the
            Soviet Union, concern over the growth in the
            national deficit and increasing pressures for
            improvements or increase in various social programs.
 
        2.  The Challenger disaster (and resultant chaos in the
            National Space Agency) has lowered public
            confidence and support for space related programs.
            Delays in launch capabilities have caused extensive
            stretchouts in major projects.  Resultant cost
            overruns have precipitated congressional calls for
            re-evaluation of program goals and priorities.
 
        3.  The investigation of the Challenger accident, the
            pressure of foreign imports and the poor
            performance of some major weapon systems have also
            served to focus national attention on the issue of
            quality, particularly for aerospace and other
            defense related products.
 
        4.  The market for civil air transport is considerable
            more robust than for the defense sector.  However,
            competition is expected to be intense and the
            outlook for earnings is constrained unless
            significant decreases can be achieved in the cost
            of production and assembly.
 
        5.  The net result of these changes is fewer major
            program starts, potential cut backs in current
            programs, and intense competition for all defense
            and space related projects and civil aircraft
            sales.  To survive in this changing aerospace
            environment, all companies will have to reduce
            costs, improve product quality and develop
            innovative approaches to managing resources.
            Teaming arrangements, either for technical reasons
            (e.g. to secure specific technical capability) or
            to increase the probability of program wins will
            become more common.  These dynamics will cause
            significant change in program support requirements
            for both information systems and telecommunications
            services.
 
    B.  The Telecommunications Industry Environment
 
        1.  The primary purpose of electronic communications is
            to support the business objectives of the company.
            The explosion in personal computers and other
            terminal devices, and the thrust for increased
            automation in offices and factories, has placed
            enormous demands on telecommunications
            organizations for services.  Telecommunications
            users insist on more capacity (bandwidth),
            increased transmission speeds, improved
            connectivity (local, regional, national and
            international) and improved reliability and
            quality. Management has supported user demands but
            is increasingly concerned with rising costs for
            telecommunications services.
 
        2.  Public telecommunications carriers are in a state
            of disarray and confusion as they struggle with
            deregulation and attempt to move from a
            monopolistic to a competitive posture.  The
            predicted benefits of "equal access" to residential
            and business customers have not yet been achieved.
            AT&T has had great  difficulty in adjusting to a
            free market and has had to write off much of its
            antiquated transmission and switching facilities
            while investing in new plant and equipment.
            Thousands of employees have been laid off and
            earnings are marginal at best.  U.S. Sprint and MCI
            Telecommunications, Inc. (the major competitors to
            AT&T for long distance service) appear to have
            underestimated the enormous investments required
            for development of transmission and switching
            facilities nation-wide.  They have also had great
            difficulty in managing their expansion and in
            providing quality service.  Both are losing money
            and are having great difficulty in achieving a
            significant market share.  With local operating
            companies offering more long distance type regional
            services, it remains to be seen if either Sprint or
            MCI will become true full-service national carriers
            or will have to settle for various niche markets.
 
        3.  Industry and Government telecommunications
            "experts" are beginning to propose that company
            management consider "leveraging" of
            telecommunications to enhance or secure a better
            competitive position in their industry.  Examples
            include airline passenger reservation systems,
            financial networks, and enhanced services such as
            videoconferencing.  In this leveraging concept, a
            company attempts to extend telecommunications and
            information systems into the marketplace as a means
            of selling another service or product or to enhance
            its image as a progressive and well managed
            enterprise.
 
            Within the aerospace industry, Boeing appears to be
            moving in this direction by establishing dedicated
            videoconferencing and high speed data transmission
            facilities at the outset of proposal preparation to
            tie major subcontractors with the Boeing program
            office.  It is assumed that this improvement in
            communications will result in a higher quality
            proposal and that an already established network
            will have a favorable impact in evaluating their
            capability to manage the program after winning the
            contract.  The next obvious step (which is clearly
            spelled out in the proposal) is to include the
            customer in the network or to turn the network over
            to the customer.  The B-1 network is an example
            where Boeing took a Westinghouse initiated effort
            for a point-to-point videoconferencing link to
            coordinate flight test activities between Boeing
            and Westinghouse and then sold the concept to the
            Air Force System Program office (SPO) as an Air
            Force network.  This unsolicited proposal was
            accepted by the Air Force and Rockwell (the prime)
            was later required by the SPO to join the network.
            Boeing received an additional contract award to
            design the network and the Air Force
            videoconferencing facility.
 
        4.  The present and projected state of the
            telecommunications industry suggests that large
            companies need to maintain some private network
            facilities as a hedge against AT&T again developing
            a monopolistic position and to maintain the
            flexibility required to
 
            meet changing business requirements.  Selective
            private networks also serve to control transmission
            and switching costs (particularly in the local and
            regional environments where public service
            telecommunications costs continue to increase).
 
    C.  The Technology Environment
 
        1.  No entirely new or "breakthrough" technology
            developments are expected in the next five to seven
            years for telecommunications.  There will be
            extensive change however, as present advanced
            technology is implemented.  Major changes expected
            are:
 
            a.  Nationwide implementation of fiber optic
                networks.
 
            b.  Development and implementation nationwide of
                all-digital, high speed switched networks.
 
            c.  Development and implementation of all digital
                voice and data switching systems (Private
                Automated Branch Exchange's and Central office
                switches).
 
            d.  Extension of communications servers into the
                using environment.
 
            e.  An explosion in local area networks (LANs)
                products to support distributed systems and
                personal computers.
 
            f.  Development and implementation of wide band
                "metropolitan" networks to tie LANs together on
                a regional basis.
 
            g.  The implementation of "gateways" to
                interconnect LANs and regional metropolitan
                networks on a national basis.
 
            h.  Wide band facilities for international
                transmission.
 
            i.  Additional intelligence embedded in networks.
 
            j.  Implementation of the complete functions of the
                international standards organization (ISO)
                network model.
 
            k.  Fully integrated (voice, data and image)
                network implementation locally/regionally and
                then nationwide.
 
        2.  The long awaited national fiber optic networks are
            rapidly coming into place.  If competition is
            sustained, bandwidth (and high speed transmission)
            should become an available commodity for most
            users.  These fiber circuits are expected to
            provide significant improvements in the cost
            effectiveness, reliability and quality of all
            transmissions.  The switched digital public
            networks will provide dial up capability for 56
            kilobit to 1.544 megabit services but will probably
            be limited to point-to-point interactive data
            transmissions.  Multi-point wide-band interactive
            needs (and various forms of broadcast
            transmissions) will likely continue to be satisfied
            by satellite transmission as this medium is more
            flexible, easier to implement and less costly than
            use of multi-point terrestrial circuits.
 
        3.  The expected growth in the volume of data being
            transmitted (and the increased capability for
            access to most computer applications and data
            bases) creates significant risk for compromising
            MDC sensitive, proprietary and private data.
            End-to-end digital transmission and switching,
            however, will facilitate encryption.  Company
            policies dealing with protection and security of
            data, voice and image transmission should be
            implemented as soon as feasible.
 
        4.  Technology advances (and the thrust for greatly
            expanded connectivity and networking) tend to
            eliminate the concept of geographic networks and
            entities.  Network design, management and
            operations will have to be either completely
            centralized (or at least centrally controlled) in
            order to support communications interconnectivity
            and company business objectives.
 
    D.  MDC Business Assumptions
 
        1.  The demand for improved high speed, wide-band
            communications (intrabuilding, intercampus and
            regional) will accelerate and grow dramatically
            over the next five years.  This will include
            specialized LANs, fiber and microwave networks for
            high speed data and television transmission.
 
        2.  The implementation of remote manufacturing and
            assembly facilities will require significant
            redesign and/or extension of MDC networks and
            transmission systems.  It is anticipated that 10 to
            15 new MDC sites will be established during the
            next five years.
 
        3.  Teaming arrangements with other companies (and the
            need for increased electronic information transfer
            with suppliers and customers) will place
            significant demands on network capacity,
            reliability, flexibility, connectivity and
            functional capabilities.  Telecommunications
            services will have to be more universal and be less
            MDC specific (e.g., improved protocol translation,
            improved gateways, etc.)
 
        4.  Intercomponent work transfer will increase which
            will generate additional needs for information
            transfer.
 
        5.  Increased security (government, industrial and
            company sensitive/private) on major study and
            development projects will complicate the potential
            for advanced telecommunications to contribute to
            business objectives.  Security requirements will
            also increase the costs of information processing
            and transmission.
 
        6.  Business needs for information and data transfer
            will keep pace with computing, office, and factory
            automation technology advances, thus generating a
            continuing increase in demand.  Concurrently,
            component critical business issues (and the general
            thrust to reduce costs) will put severe constraints
            on telecommunications headcount and the capital
            required to implement new or expanded
            telecommunications services.  However, where a good
            business case exists for new or expanded services,
            management support to secure funding can be
            anticipated.
 
        7.  The need for international information transfer
            will increase as international customers perform a
            greater share of manufacturing and assembly or as
            foreign manufacturing facilities are implemented.
 
        8.  Air travel costs will increase due to airline
            mergers and the need for improved earnings by the
            major carriers.  This will put increased pressure
            on alternative forms of business communications.
 
        9.  Electronic training (Teletraining) for MDC
            employees and customer personnel will increase
            significantly.  This will require new forms of
            communications (e.g. one way analog video, graphics
            and audio bridging, local video networks, etc.) and
            connectivity of MDC networks with major
            universities and company training centers.
 
        10. Acquisitions will continue to be made selectively
            by MDC.  However, no acquisition activity is
            expected that will have significant impact on
            telecommunications during the next 2-3  years.
 
        11. Telecommunication systems and network designs must
            be sufficiently modular and flexible to accommodate
            expansion and contraction of services to conform
            with business needs.
 
    E.  Internal Telecommunications Environment and Assumptions
 
        1.  Telecommunications managers must be increasingly
            involved in and aware of MDC long range business
            goals/objectives.  They must also be in a position
            to recommend telecommunications strategies that
            line, functional and executive management can
            implement and leverage to improve their competitive
            position and achieve strategic advantage in the
            acquisition of business.
 
        2.  There will be continuing and strong management
            emphasis on improving communications locally,
            between geographically separated MDC groups and
            between MDC and suppliers, teaming partners and
            customers.
 
        3.  Increased management emphasis on improving
            communications coupled with advances in technology
            will increase the demand for telecommunications
            services as follows:
 
            a.  Voice - 15 to 20 percent annually.  Demand will
                be higher on the West Coast than in St. Louis.
 
            b.  Data - 20 to 25 percent annually for regional
                and long distance growth with very high
                (50-80%) annual increase in the local
                environment as local area networks (LANs) are
                implemented.
 
            c.  Video - 20 to 25 percent annual increase in
                satellite network transmission.  Very high
                growth in local area transmission.
 
            d.  Graphics - (high resolution systems to support
                teleconferencing and CAD-CAM) 25 to 40 percent
                annual increase to support decentralized
                product development, increased intercomponent
                work transfers and teaming arrangements.
 
            NOTE:  Service costs should decrease significantly
            on a unit basis as fiber optic facilities and
            improved data compression technologies are
            implemented.
 
        4.  Advanced telecommunications systems can be
            leveraged to enhance or improve MDC's competitive
            position and provide strategic advantage.  This
            will include the implementation of special purpose
            systems  to support proposal preparation, teaming
            arrangements, customer needs and remote facilities.
 
        5.  Present electronic mail systems are inadequate,
            network constrained and too difficult to use to
            meet current and future business objectives.  The
            demand for electronic mail nationwide and
            internationally requires a system that is not
            vendor dependent.
 
        6.  Contractual agreements for services must also be
            carefully evaluated to provide for business
            exigencies and changes in demand, particularly
            since telecommunications suppliers are asking for
            longer term commitments and are offering incentives
            for such contracts.
 
        7.  Local twisted pair data networks will grow rapidly
            as new products are developed and integrated with
            PABX products.
 
        8.  High capacity and high speed LANs are proliferating
            and are expected to rapidly grow and diversify in
            all local areas.  LANs have a strong potential for
            improving information transfer and for support
            business objectives.  Since these networks are
            often user implemented, care must be taken to
            recognize the need for compatibility/connectivity
            and for gateways to support transfer between
            geographic areas and organizations.  Corporate-wide
            standards are needed and central coordination and
            audit of user implementation activities appears to
            be essential.
 
        9.  Every user is demanding premium service, and the
            ability to prioritize traffic by application within
            shared networks is rapidly diminishing.  This has
            the result of categorizing all traffic based on the
            priority of the highest single application using
            the network thus increasing transmission costs.
 
        10. Voice, data and image (video and graphics)
            integrated networks will start to develop in the
            local environment but are at least 6 - 10 years
            away for national networks.  The lack of a
            universal data or message addressing scheme will
            also inhibit transfer of information across
            electronic networks.
 
    F.  Regulatory Issues and Assumptions
 
        1.  AT&T will continue to exert its technology and
            marketing base and will apply increasing pressure
            to MCI, Sprint etc. over the next five to ten
            years.  In the near term, real cost competition is
            expected to evolve in long haul markets.  In the
            long term, AT&T will continue to dominate major
            market segments to the point that competition will
            decline.  Large corporations will have to maintain
            various forms of private networks to control costs.
 
        2.  The task of managing telecommunications services
            will become increasingly difficult due to
            deregulation.  Local telephone companies (Telco's)
            (e.g. Southwestern Bell, Mountain Bell etc.) are
            expected to aggressively compete with AT&T and
            others within their local and regional areas and
            will press their demands for relief of present
            deregulation rules.  The separate developments and
            offerings of these local Telco's and other
            independent carriers create a complex multivendor
            environment that each telecommunications manager
            must deal with.  The need to transfer information
            across and between these various "domains" will
            further complicate system design, equipment/service
            selection and network operations.  Standards will
            be very difficult to invoke.
 
        3.  Cost for long distance public carrier services will
            decrease at the rate of 8 - 10 percent annually
            over the next 3 - 5 years.  Local Telco costs will
            continue to increase until approximately 1990 and
            then start to decline as technology in the form of
            fiber optics, data/voice compression and advanced
            switching systems become widely employed.  State
            regulatory commissions, consumer groups and other
            political pressures will also act to stabilize and
            reduce local Telco costs.

The after-lunch slump that can take the punch out of a productive work day can 
be avoided with a keen eye for balanced foods and limited calories at 
lunchtime.

If high in sugary foods, can overpower your system.  Not a very efficient 
approach to the afternoon, especially if you need to be at peak performance.  A
400-calorie (women) 700-calorie (men) lunch, no alchohol or gooey desserts, and
a balanced selection of foods with 20% protein, 30% fat and 50% complex 
carbohydrates.

Balanced lunches, low-fat dairy products such as milk and yogurt most closely 
meet the 20-30-50 ratio.  An added piece of fruit provides fiber to speed 
digestion and essential vitamins with few calories.

Complex carbohydrates such as vegetables, whole-grain breads and cereals, and 
fruits also help resist a midday slow down because they are metabolized more 
slowly than simple sugars and provide consistent energy.

Deli takout: turkey sandwich on whole wheat, with lettuce and tomato, or cup of
soup with mixed green salad and whole wheat roll.  Fruit, cheese and a bran or 
corn muffin also works well.

Coffee Shop: Choose between a small chef's salad.  Add toast, tomato or

veg. juice, and sparkling water.

Fast-food:  baked patatoe with cottage or regualr cheese or a single hamburger 
on a bun with lowfat milk.  Pizza shop, stick with one slice of pizza and a 
tossed salad.

Traditional Restaurant: green salad with small potions of fish or chicken, 
assorted vegs and small baked patato.  Or a tossed salad and half order of 
pasta primavera with sprinkling of cheese and one slice bread and fruit.  A 
more formal meal: cup fo consomme, small potion of veal, assorted vegs and 
rice.

Vending machine:  snack pack of crackers and cheese or peanut butter and

cheese crackers, raisins or dried fuits and nuts.

The following is from an editorial by Wayne Green in the June, 1987 issue

of 73 Amateur Radio magazine:

                        CONGRESS GOOFS

The recent legislation making cellular phone calls illegal to listen in on has 
provided a bonanza for both organized and disorganized crime. It's difficult 
not to laugh over the situation the cellular industry has gotten itself into in
its blind pursuit of the fast buck.

What's happened is a mass move into cellular by criminals. They buy a cellular 
system, have an unscrupulous dealer alter the electronic serial number (ESN) on
the built-in programmable IC, which makes calls both untraceable and free--a 
great combo. They tool around town, making calls to Pakistan, Columbia, and 
their Caribbean drug warehouses at will.

Cellular has turned out to be great for coordinating every kind of criminal 
activity. It's just what criminals have been needing for years-- a dependable, 
free, untraceable, and safe communications system. With a combination of pagers
and cellular phones, crooks are making a shambles of the cellular system--all 
protected by Congress.

If you wanted to deal in drugs, how better to get orders from your customers 
than by giving them your cellular phone number? There's no way to tap a 
telephone that can be anywhere in a big city, operating through different cells
as it moves around. And with an altered ESN it's all free!

If it weren't against the law to listen to cellular channels, I'd suggest we 
hams help the law by listening for suspicious cellular calls and recording 
them. Say, how'd you like to get the goods on some serious crooks and find (a) 
the evidence is inadmissible because it was illegally attained and (b) yourself
on trial for making the recordings. So join me in a big laugh, okay? --

Subject: LOGII GED update 

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been update on DNDSPEC to include the following items:

- Some MO codes were reserved for LOGII related Applications not
documented within the LOGII GED.

- The RCRM/RCRI circuit response and reject codes have been completely
re-organized.

- The RCRM/RCRI normal circuit reject MO-27 code 0C "failure limit exceeded"
(i.e. escape count exceeded), is modified by an accompanying normal
response MO-04, to reflect what condition caused the failure limit
to be exceeded.

- A PID of Rejecting Host MO was added to the RCRM/RCRI messages.

- An originating host PID MO is sent to the termination in the CCN,
NCN body and ISN.

- A terminating host PID MO is sent from the Supervisor to the origination
in the CCN and RCRI for logon success.

- The Example of X.409 Type Representation Interpretation was
clarified by minor reformatting of the presentation.

Thanks...Omar

The following is from an editorial by Wayne Green in the June, 1987 issue

of 73 Amateur Radio magazine:

                        CONGRESS GOOFS

The recent legislation making cellular phone calls illegal to listen in on has 
provided a bonanza for both organized and disorganized crime. It's difficult 
not to laugh over the situation the cellular industry has gotten itself into in
its blind pursuit of the fast buck.

What's happened is a mass move into cellular by criminals. They buy a cellular 
system, have an unscrupulous dealer alter the electronic serial number (ESN) on
the built-in programmable IC, which makes calls both untraceable and free--a 
great combo. They tool around town, making calls to Pakistan, Columbia, and 
their Caribbean drug warehouses at will.

Cellular has turned out to be great for coordinating every kind of criminal 
activity. It's just what criminals have been needing for years-- a dependable, 
free, untraceable, and safe communications system. With a combination of pagers
and cellular phones, crooks are making a shambles of the cellular system--all 
protected by Congress.

If you wanted to deal in drugs, how better to get orders from your customers 
than by giving them your cellular phone number? There's no way to tap a 
telephone that can be anywhere in a big city, operating through different cells
as it moves around. And with an altered ESN it's all free!

If it weren't against the law to listen to cellular channels, I'd suggest we 
hams help the law by listening for suspicious cellular calls and recording 
them. Say, how'd you like to get the goods on some serious crooks and find (a) 
the evidence is inadmissible because it was illegally attained and (b) yourself
on trial for making the recordings. So join me in a big laugh, okay? --

Hi Dave, welcome aboard!  I'm afraid I can't be much help on the DCS stuff.
Last I knew, that needed a PDP-11 to work, but it must have been changed
since then.  I think all the people who worked on that project have since
left the company, so I don't even know who to refer you to.  The best I can
do is to promise to help try to figure it out from whetever documentation
you can locate.  If you get me a copy and leave it in my mailbox next week,
I will look it over and try to get together with you the next day to see
if there is anything I can further illuminate (maybe something will ring a
bell).  Sorry I can't be more help.  -Bill

Somewhere in the code there is a .ie .el that's nested too deep or
is recursive (and so nested too deep).  I suggest the divide and conquer
approach: put
  .tm "Made it to 1.2.3"
every so often.  -Bill

Subject: Inactivity timeout bug fixed. 

There is a bug in the job inactivity timeout killer that has been fixed.
The bug has existed for some time, and caused F29 to crash 3 times this
weekend.  The noname stopcode at TTYFND+2(SCNSER+13721) was triggered when
the inactivity timeout monitor noticed a job logged in as MAIL running TMS
that had been idle for more than 15 minutes.  In the process of killing it,
accumulator J got set to 777454, which is not in the JBT tables.  The was
not noticed on F29 before because (MAIL)TMS was not running on that system
until this weekend.  (Bill said he was moving the major MAIL functions from
system 39 to system 29.)  This may also explain some of B39's crashes.

The fix is in (M33)INTKIL.PAT on all systems, and has been applied to
(SYS:29)SYSTEM.SAV=F29-P035/B03-3 and (SYS:29)NEWMON.SAV=F29-P035/B04-3.

I doubt the inactivity timer bug is responsible for any crashes on 39
since it was never used (to my knowledge).  In fact it should not be
expiring on 29, so I have to go check why it was being inactive for so
long.  -Bill

I believe that Carl set up MAIL:29 and HELGEM:29 with the enable-inactivity
bit set in the LUD just for testing purposes.  Any job logging in on that
system with those user names would automatically get the 15-minute timer
set.  I noticed that the jobs in question were detached and ^C.  /Joe

	Unexpected operation in Sun's C-compiler
		john Kopf

I have encountered an unexpected operation using the Sun C-compiler,
which may impact anyone using it and expecting results consistant
with the MicroTEK C-compiler (mcc68k):

A declaration of the form:

long	zero[1];
	...
	(a bunch of storage reservations for various objects)
	...
long	zero_end;

and an initiaization routine of the form:

	long	*zero_pnt = zero;
	while ( zero_pnt < &zero_end )
		*( zero_pnt++ ) = 0;

seem to do what is expected on mcc68k:  "zero" is assigned an address
lower than "zero_end", and everything works as expected.

However, the Sun C-compiler places each declaration in "common"; and
common ends up in the reverse order from the declarations:  thus
&zero > &zero_end (!!!), and the loop quits "early"!

This usage may be critical for anyone who intends to debug mcc68k-code
on the Sun-Systems...BEWARE!

I do not know which implementation is used by the VAX's C-compiler.

   Private Network Systems).
   
   Congratulations to  Mark Johnson  on his  promotion to  Western Region
   Manager!   Mark has  been with  Tymnet since  November, 1981  and  has
   served very  successfully as  a district  manager during the last four
   years.   His most  recent challenge was the effective consolidation of
   two  districts   into  the   current  Pacific   West  District.    The
   consolidation was conducted smoothly, and the Pacific West District is
   now an  effective team with a great deal of focus and direction.  Once
   again, congratulations  to Mark on his new assignment.  I look forward
   to working  with Rory  and  Mark  on  Western  Region  challenges  and
   opportunities of the future.
   
   Please provide  your assistance  and support to Rob, Rick, and Mark as
   they lead  their new  organizations to  higher levels  of success  for
   Tymnet.
   
   Bernie

Subject: NCC questions 

Chuck,

I don't see any problems with the two sce{narios you posed :

item 1 - I don't think anything checks for machine # and
         slot # in association with the Node Code slot.  The
         reason slot # 0 is reported is that Node Code was not
         modified to report otherwise.  If your patch works,
         then I am sure no other utility (PROBE or otherwise)
         cares.

item 2 - I don't see a problem with reporting the same node #
         from the primary and backup slots.  Why are the
         kernel host numbers different?  If anything causes a
         problem, this might - but I don't think it will because
         the 'new' takeover response will have the new number 
         (kernel host) in it.

Hope this makes sense,
Gazel

Subject: Re: xroff broken? 

it couldn't find xroff because you're setting your PATH environment variable
(on minimac, anyway) in your .login file.  .login doesn't get executed

Yes, that's right.  ipcfAssign now takes an extra argument which is the
address of the function to call for any interrupt related to that TSAP.

ALL gone, only from the 22nd of may.  His tums.tix and tums.msg are

Bill,

how does one set up having their ontymes go to unix (say hobbes) instead
of tums.  A while back, I believe, Steve Feldman mentioned you had to do
some hocus pocus to a file on 39.  That was while you were on vacation
and I never got around to asking you afterwards.

This is the command I use for fixing the page number placement problem.
	xroff -rL10.7i -rW6.5i files
For nroff, its similar, but different:

These just set registers (see troff manual) so you could supposedly
put them in the macro or source file somewhere, but I've never tried
it.  No doubt they would have to be done before anything else is
loaded which may rule out their use with the -mm switch.

They should create a file in their directory on 39 called MAIL.FWD which
should contain one line specifying their username and host at which they
wish to receive their mail.  For example, one might have

	-type mail.fwd
	wrs@hobbes

	-

problems with TUMS/ONTYME again--I, personally, have not received anything
from ONTYME via TUMS since 20 April.  I understand from my fellow employees
that my experience is far from unique.  Jerry Hwang only requested to be
placed on the polling list week before last; he received a response from
you, but has never gotten his mail.  Several other people discovered that
they had not received it since the beginning of last week.  One individual,
on the other hand, claims to have received his ontymes as recently as this
weekend... who knows?


Thanks for your attention--if you are as busy as we are around here, the
time you put in on this must be nearly a sacrifice.  I know we complain alot,
but we appreciate your help nonetheless.

Bill,
Question:
Can I call ipcfDone() with progress = IPCF_PROGRESS_ACCEPTED, which
according to your manual does Not belong to the DONE class?
thanks,
Mike J.

thanks for reply. it is obvious to me I am missing an important point here.
if I receive (boot) a boot req. message it puts me of course at the inte-
rrupt level. how can I defer processing to background? In other words how
can I get a hold of background. One I execute return from the function
supplied by ipcfAssign() I reckon I relinquish control until another
interrupt happens. I thought I was bound to operate at the interrupt
level but now because of your comment I can see that is not the case.
please enlighten me!

Mike,
(by the way you may send to "wrs" on any Unix machine or PDP-10 and I will
get the mail, please don't use Ontyme)

You may have as many processes as we can afford stack space for.  I suggest
one should be enough.  I would think it would normally be asleep waiting for
an IPCF message or another asynchronous event to wake it up.  The exact
interface is not defined yet, but you can get a general idea of what to
expect by looking at the code of what will become the kernel's process con-
trol system which should have been given to you by Pat.  I'd suggest looking
at those routines and then asking questions.  That would be faster then I
can also get suggestions from you as well.

-Bill

I think it doesn't matter if you run at interrupt level or not since the
patron will be "down", but I don't understand why it would be simpler.
Please describe what obsticle there is to running in background and
perhaps it can be eliminated at my end.  My experience has been that you
want to avoid having much code at interrupt level since it is pretty hard
to debug.  I'm out sick at the moment, but I'll still be reading my mail
(although it might not make any sense).  -Bill

Subject: MIDI product idea 

Bill,

I have an idea for a MIDI product that I have not seen before and could
prove VERY lucrative.  Currently MIDI is cabled in a daisy chain or fan
out fashion with the data being accepted based upon it's channel number.

It would be very desirable to have a MIDI network, where each instrument
or physically co-located group of instruments to plug into a MIDI
transciever.  The transciever would simply broadcast and receive the
any MIDI data presented to it from it's local devices and received
from other MIDI transcievers.  This would eliminate the need for the
MIDI cable nightmares that occur.  It is probably desirable to make
a separate MIDI transmitter and receiver.

The biggest problem to overcome would be interference and data accuracy,
but product could probably be constructed quite inexpensively.  The MIDI
protocol is thoroughly documented, and given your radio communications
experience, I thought I'd run this idea past you.  I would be completely
willing to invest some time and money into this if you think it's
feasible.  This could be a real money maker; the concert and professional
applications could obviously benefit from such a device, in a manner
analogous to wireless microphones and guitar connections.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks...Omar

You had to give your "old" password to get into SETOP.  Normal users use
the OPPS program which does ask for the old.  SETOP is intended to allow
managers to change the passwords of people under them.  Obviously this does
not require knowledge of the old one.

Subject: MIDI data rate 

Bill,

The MIDI data rate is a 30Kbps async.

Your point is well taken about the bandwidth requirements.  Cables are
reliable enough, but it would certainly be elegant to have a wireless
set up.  The wireless audio connections for guitars and microphones are
very popular since they free up the on stage performer's movements.

I bought the Van Tieghem CD yesterday, also got Patrick O'Hearn "between
two worlds" which is great.

New age music is really becoming popular, I'd better finish my album
and strike while the iron is hot.  A friend of mine is a DJ at KKUP
for their new age show on Friday mornings, and he wants to play my work
and interview me.  Oh well, just more computer work to do.  Can't wait
to get a Macintosh-II, priced on out last week for about $7000!!
Pricey but nice.

Talk to you later....Omar

Yes, I got O'Hearn at the same time as Van Tiegham, but you said you had
it so I didn't leave it for you.
MIDI is probably not very tollerant of errors, so you'd have to run X.25
or something so you'd need a CPU at each end.  I'd be surprised if it could
be manufactured for any less than $400 which would sell for $2000 and it
wouldn't be small.

I think you misunderstood.  I was saying that SETOP currently behaves properly.
It DOES require your password before you change anyone else's.  It either
requires it when you set WC with the OPER program, or when you enter SETOP.
Both would give you an audit trail if SETOP kept one.  I see no need for any
change to the procedure.  -Bill

Subject: Risk in ``High'' Financing 
Comment: I thought you might enjoy this excerpt from the RISKS digest! --Bi//
Originally-From: Michael Wester <wester@aleph0.unm>
Originally-To: risks@csl.sri.com

Excerpt from ``Risky moments in the money markets'' in U.S. News & World Report
of March 2, 1987

   According to the New York Fed, Wall Street's average daily volume of bank 
wire transactions totals at least $1.2 trillion---an amount equal to one 
quarter of the U.S.'s total annual economic activity---and could be as much as 
$500 billion a day higher, though no one really knows.  Even at the lower 
figure, that's five times the daily flow since the start of the decade.  Each 
year, transaction volume leaps by nearly 25%, or double the annual growth rate 
in the 1970s.  [...]

   The obvious fear is a financial accident that could bring the system down. 
Banks must settle accounts daily, and a failure to pay up by one could cause a 
chain reaction of problems for others.  Close calls in settling are more common
than is generally known.  A Federal Reserve Board official acknowledges the 
number of ``breathless moments'' averages 10 a year.

   One of those scary scenarios developed in 1985, when the government- 
securities market was severely disrupted by a computer software ``bug'' at the 
bank of New York, preventing settlement for a day and a half.  Only a $23.6 
BILLION [my emphasis] emergency loan by the Fed got the wheels unstuck.  [...]

   Each day, billions of transactions move from country to country over a pair 
of wire systems: The Clearing House Interbank Payments System, called CHIPS, 
operated by 140 banks specializing in international finance, and the Federal 
Reserve Systems's Fedwire, which links 7000 domestic banks and does the 
bookkeeping for Treasury securities transfers among banks.

   The electronic linkages make it possible for money to whiz from computer to 
computer so quickly that the same dollars can be used to finance up to seven 
deals a day, compared to two in times past when paper checks were the principal
method of payment.  [...]

   One danger signal: Last year's daily transaction value was 24 times greater 
than the amount of reserves banks had on deposit with the Federal Reserve 
System, up from a 9.4 multiple in 1980.

   It has become common practice for banks to go deeply into hock each day, 
often exceeding total assets in anticipation of payments they will receive 
before it is time to balance their books at closing.  Such ``daylight 
overdrafts'' account for as much as $110 billion to $120 billion on the Fedwire
and Chips.  [...]

   What makes the climbing debt even more unsettling is that payments move over
CHIPS and Fedwire systems that [Gerald] Corrigan [, head of the New York 
Federal Reserve Bank,] describes as a ``hodgepodge of facilities, equipment, 
software and controls that have little in common with each other.''  Even if 
the hodgepodge is capable of handling the flow now, Corrigan and others worry 
about it remaining adequate if the transaction volumes continues to grow as 
astronomically as it has in recent years.  ``The money spent on computer 
systems has not kept pace with the tremendous explosion in electronic 
payments,'' says a Fed official.

The BTF came up today at the Security Action Committee.  I asked the
committee to provide marketing with more review time to make
sure it fits in with our overall file transfer goals.  

Our next SAC meeting is May 14.  Would it be possible for you all to
collaborate on a marketing position by then?  Thanks much.

FYI, we need to be careful with our statements about flow control
problems.  Those problems only exist in our async interfaces.  Obviously
not i n X.25, etc.

I have attached a copy of BTF.

1. Introduction

     BTF is a means by which binary data may be transmitted through a
TYMNET network while maintaining the use of flow control.



2. Scope

     The scope of this document is to define the protocol Tymnet will
use in providing this service.



3. Methods of use

     There two basic methods in which the BTF can be used with Tymnet:

     A. Transparent to the network.   Tymnet provides no translation.

     B. Transparent to the host (destination) computer.  Tymnet translates
        BTF protocol to and from the user's device into normal binary data 
        to and from the host computer.



        Method A:  Both user terminal and host computer use BTF protocol.

                                             ____________
        /|                                  |            |
       / |         (               )        |    HOST    |
      /__|---------(  T Y M N E T  )--------|  COMPUTER  |
         |         (               )        |            |
       __|                                  |____________|



        Method B:  Only user terminal uses BTF protocol and Tymnet provides
                   the translation for the host computer.


                                             ____________
        /|         (  T Y M N E T  )        |            |
       / |         (   _____       )        |    HOST    |
      /__|---------(--| BTF |------)--------|  COMPUTER  |
         |         (  |_____|      )        |            |
       __|         (               )        |____________|







4. Protocol

     All characters are assumed to be 8 bits with no parity.  All 8-bit
characters can be transmitted without modification except those in the
following list:


     Character    Sent as

     DLE (10x)    DLE,DLE (10x,10x)

     DC1 (11x)    DLE,DC2 (10x,12x)
     DC1 (91x)    DLE,DC2 (10x,92x)

     DC3 (13x)    DLE,DC4 (10x,14x)
     DC3 (93x)    DLE,DC4 (10x,94x)


     In addition to the above, the Tymnet BTF interface may send the
following messages:


     Message                    Meaning

     DLE,SYN (10x,16x)          Enter BTF protocol.  The Tymnet BTF
                                interface will send this message when
                                the circuit to the host computer is
                                complete.  Prior to receiving this
                                message the user terminal should not
                                use the above protocol.

     DLE,SUB,SP (10x,1Ax,20x)   Circuit lost to host computer.  If for
                                any reason the Tymnet BTF loses its
                                circuit connection with the host computer
                                this message will be sent to the user
                                terminal.



     The user terminal has one optional message that it may send in order
to request the Tymnet BTF interface to tear down (zap) its circuit.  This
message is provided as an alternative to the user terminal "hanging up",
or the host computer "logging off" the user.


     DLE,SUB,! (10x,1Ax,21x)    Request circuit tear down.







5. Logging in

  A. Transparent

             When logging in through Tymnet to use the BTF protocol in
        a transparent, mode the user should always use a control-R and
        a control-X in front of their username.  This will enable user
        flow control in both directions.  Failure to use these characters
        may result in loss of data.  In addition to flow control, if
        half-duplex operation is required the user should also use a
        control-H in front of the username.


  B. Tymnet BTF interface

             When logging in using the Tymnet BTF interface, no special
        control characters are required.  The Tymnet BTF interface will
        set bi-directional flow control and disable all local echo (set
        half-duplex).

             Upon sucessful connection to the Tymnet BTF interface the
        user will be prompted for a second "log in".  This will be the
        actual circuit request to the host computer.  No special control
        characters are required at this prompt either.

Subject: Radiation risk at airports?

Original-Subject: Radiation risk at airports?

   On Saturday, April 18, the major wire and news services carried a story, 
attributed to the New York Times, saying that the FAA was about to start 
testing of a prototype neutron beam-based system for detecting the nitrogen in 
explosives that might be in luggage/cargo loaded into plane cargo holds. This 
is a computer-based system that bombards luggage or other cargo with a "beam of
slowed neutrons" and uses a computer system to analyze the signature of the 
resulting gamma radiation emissions to characterize for the potential presence 
of explosives.

   The Associated Press inaccurately suggested that the manufacturer of this 
equipment was a firm named "Thermedics."  The actual NYT article gives much 
more detail and accurately names the manufacturer as "Science Applications 
International Corp." of Sunnyvale.

   Some months ago, when this technology was originally mentioned in the press,
there was some discussion of the radiation problems inherent with this sort of 
technology.  While one would assume care would be used to make sure animals 
traveling as cargo are not subjected to a neutron beam, the problem of 
secondary radiation effects on the clothes, foods, medications, and everything 
else that travels as cargo/luggage seems to be glossed over by the press.  
While normal X-ray technologies do not produce secondary radiation at 
conventional power levels, neutrons are extremely energetic and in fact this 
explosive detection system appears to be depending on secondary radiation for 
its very operation!

   When this system was first discussed in the press some months ago, there was
mention of the problems of cargo and luggage becoming "slightly radioactive" as
a result of being subjected to the "slowed neutron beam."  The current 
discussion in the press seems to be avoiding this issue entirely, instead 
mentioning that the people operating the equipment will not be subjected to 
more than "government standards" for radiation exposure (many persons seem to 
feel that these standards allow far too much exposure as it is).

   The question then, for anyone who understands this technology or knows about
Science Applications International, is: what will happen to luggage, cargo, 
etc., possibly including foods and other items that can be ingested or will be 
in close proximity to persons for long periods of time, after passing through 
such neutron beam systems once or possibly many times in the course of complex 
or multiple trips?  Are airline passengers to be subjected to the radioactive 
luggage and cargo simply because the emission levels meet "government 
standards"?  Will the frequent traveler be at greater risk than the occasional 
traveler?  What is the real story about these systems?

     In case you're wondering who will be the first guinea pigs for this 
technology, it's the folks in the SF Bay area.  San Francisco International 
(SFO) is slated to get the first prototypes of these devices sometime quite 
soon for at least a 4-week trial.  The equipment is then to be tested at other 
major airports and the FAA hopes to have it in widespread use within 2 years.  
Apparently the prototypes to be tested are "improved" versions of an earlier 
model that required 30 seconds per test--the new equipment bombards the target 
material for 6 seconds (possibly longer if the typical conveyer and luggage 
problems cause clogs on the transport system).  Of the two prototypes, one 
supposedly uses a continuous neutron emitter based on an internal chunk of some
radioactive material, while the other uses a "turn-offable" system for 
generating the neutrons.

   Can anyone out there shed some light on the risks associated with this 
   technology?

[The computers in this system may or may not present risks, e.g., if the 
computers are involved in control, or if the signature analysis is faulty.  In 
any case, the risk issues are interesting enough to warrant some KNOWLEDGEABLE 
discussion here.  Let's avoid SPECULATIONS, PLEASE.  PGN]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Several weeks have passed since the quarterly meeting with SWBT in
St. Louis. I have not heard of the status on action items identified
at that time. Some particular items come to mind for Phase I are:
 

1. Approval of 'Recommendations' document by Bill Soley as guiding specification.
2. The review progress by SWB of LOG II GED written by Omar Serang.
 
3. The appointment of a SWB Program Manager.
 
4. SWB response to Implementation Plan presented by Phil Kiefer.
 
5. Training requirement - recent correspondence from TTE indicated
 
6. Adequacy of CONSAT monitoring features in Version 6.02.
 
7. Decision on acceptance of Tymnet Project management.
 
8. Response from SWB regarding Acceptance Plan requirement.
                                                                Page  2

   none needed by TTE, all by NTD. Jeff Stern was to clarify.
 
Some brief notes...
 
1. NTD project members are meeting each month to discuss progress. 
   We expect to meet more often as development leads to integration.
   Our first meeting was held on 3/27 and our next is this Friday.
   You are welcomed to the minutes and the minutes to be prepared by
 
2. CONSAT/PAD GED is under internal review and comments will be discussed
   this Friday.
 
3. Detail schedules are being prepared and will be integrated for reporting.
   Overall tracking of development progress will begin next week once schedules
   are in and consolidated at higher level. Reporting same will follow.
 
4. Description of NETVAL/validation procedural changes will be provided
   SWB by NTD after some clarification of the need with Romolo Raffo.
   Hope to clear this up on Friday.
 
5. Phase 2 estimates will be made available at next SWB meeting in June.
   Developers are sizing those portion of the PIR 2379 where adequate on
   documentation exists; others will require clarification on need.
 
Minutes from 3/27 meeting and those from this Friday's meeting will be
available early next week.
 
Please respond to me with your input and comments/concerns.

Welcome  to  Rodney!   You  are  priviledged  to  participate  in
Skywalker,  the largest, most important, and riskiest development
project that TYMNET has every undertaken. As the team responsible
for Skywalker's foundation,  i.e. the Rodney firmware, we share a
particularly  critical assignment.  I expect that all of  us will
need  to  put  forth  our  best  efforts  in  order  to  meet our
commitments with the highest possible quality.

A team kick-off meeting is scheduled for 3pm  Thursday, April 23,
1987, in building F's rear conference room, to last about 1 hour.
The agenda  is as follows:

  o handout of the latest Rodney External Design

  o handout of the preliminary task breakdown and schedule

  o discussion of the Rodney team's charter

  o discussion of activities for the immediate future

  o general question and answer period

Re: (MAIL) on system 57

Joe may have already sent you mail... but it appears that OFFICE-1 is
building an arbitrary number of circuits to username MAIL, all running
SMTP [the init program] and many of them trying to transmit the same
mail message(s) via system 57 to MCAUTO.  When this occurrs, it chews
up lots of CPU time and grinds the system to a halt...

  I realize you're supposed to e on vacation, but anything you can do
to help the situation, (or send me mail telling me what I can do about
it), will be appreciated.

As you requested, here is my memo regarding the audit trails for all
validations programs. 

As of now, the audit trail was installed in Tymvalidate ONLY.
It also needs to be installed in the IPC validations program, called
Usrval, and the PDP10 Change password program.

I spoke with Julian Min yesterday (5/11) and he indicated he could install
the audit trail in both Usrval and the Change password program, but would
like a memo from you first.

I double checked with IPC and the Usrval validations program is used
for ALL validations, both PDP10 and 370.

Suzanne--There are two ways that you could get authorization information
for Bealls.

If you only need bankcard information, Gary Wilsey should be able to get
it from the FTS fiche.

If you also need American Express, or if there are items that do not
appear on the FTS fiche (due to someting between the Data Generals and
Converse being down), Customer Support should be able to look them up on
the polled fiche, since Bealls came directly into the Data Generals
during that period.

I'm out all week in an off-site class, so if you need further info,
please ontyme me--Sue

Wayne,
  At this point, I am not sure where the correct sources to PEAK reside
for the current version.  That is the major stumbling block with removing
the check for TYM license.  I am still in NJ woring on a project for AT&T
and will be back next week.  I will contact Ken Dawson and ask where the
current sources are and get back to you.

			AUSTPAC PROPOSAL RESPONSE


Section 5.6.6  Numbering and Addressing


TEAM:	NTD (David Chang, Gazel Tan, Omar Serang, Bill Soley, John Kopf)

THEME:	This section describes the AUSTPAC numbering and addressing
scheme for the new generation packet switching system.  This numbering
plan must comply with the CCITT X.121 RECOMMENDATIONS.  A description of
how Tymnet proposes to support this addressing is included in this
response.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Compliance with stated requirements, which
includes
	* support of the AUSTPAC numbering plan
	* support of symbolic addressing and abbreviated addressing
	* no pre-allocation of address table space
	* support of TNICs
	* support of addressing-handling options

KEY CONCEPTS:  Compliance of the stated requirements will be
accomplished via the following
	* Tymnet's support of X.121 addressing with MUD2, ADR2, LOG2
	* X.25/X.75 local support
	* Tymnet's support of symbolic addressing

DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCES:
	* General External Documents for MUD2, ADR2, LOG2
	* Supervisor Reference Manual (when available)
	* Proposal for Tymnet's Symbolic Addressing (by David Chang,
		12/17/86)
	* X.25/X.75 Reference Manual
	* X.25/X.75 Capabilities
	* EPSN 76 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan (if available)
	* EPSN 84 - Symbolic Addressing Facility Description
	* EPSN 98 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan - Public Issue

PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:
	* Need a copy of EPSN 76 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan.
	* Need to produce the Supervisor Reference Manual.
	* Need clarification from AUSTPAC on
	  - the purpose of analyzing 9, 10, 13, or 15 digits at the PSXs.
	  - the purpose of identifying the PSXs (eg. monitoring(.
	  - the usage of the optional subaddress.
	  - the usage of TNICs.
	* Plan to support AUSTPAC numbering plan by having one MUD entry
	  per address (including symbolic address).  AUSTPAC Phase III
	  expects to have about 70,000 addressable ports.  If there is
	  a symbolic address per X.121 address, then the MUD may contain
	  140,000 entries.  Currently, the MUD in the public net
	  contains about 10,000 entries, which represents 23%.
	  Therefore, support of dual disk or larger disk capacity may be
	  necessary.
	* If support for a "general" address is required, then some
	  means of implementing wild cards must be conceived.
	* Can AUSTPAC's symbolic address/abbreviated address begin with
	  a digit?
	* AUSTPAC may need to administer their address with one
	  facility.  Currently, NSHS is used for the existing network,
	  and NETVAL will be used in the new network.  It seems that
	  in order to provide an automatic update feature, a permanent
	  circuit is required between NSHS and NETVAL with an established
	  protocol.
	* Does AUSTPAC use 3-digit DNICs (or pseudo-DNICs) for access to
	  other networks (eg. 961, 933, 944; see EPSN 98, p3)?
	* What is the complete relationship among NUI, NUA, and calling
	  address?  It is unclear, but it seems that there is a 1-1
	  relationship between NUI and NUA, but no specific relationship
	  with calling address.
	* There are many address-handling options, including those
	  listed in section 5.6 p10 and in EPSN p2 ('mandatory',
	  'optional', and 'forbidden' NUI on a per port basis), that may
	  be implemented locally or at the Supervisor level or both.
	  Tymnet needs to produce a policy as to how these should be
	  handled.
	* EPSN 84, section 6.2, p7 briefly describes charging behavior
	  and implies that NUA may be used as a called address.  Is it
	  not the function of the NUA to represent a NUI in a X.121
	  address form in the call request?

SUBSECTION COMPLIANCE AND RESPONSE

5.6.6.1.1 	WC
Tymnet is in the process of implementing X.121 addressing based on CCITT
Recommendations.  This project, expected to be completed by the end of
1987, encompasses modifications in the Supervisor, NETVAL, PAD, and
X.25/X.75 and will provide the foundation for supporting the AUSTPAC
numbering plan.  Additional features and possible customization will be
needed to satisfy all of the stated requirements.

5.6.6.1.2	WC
The AUSTPAC numbering plan, as it applies to the numbering of ports and
terminals in the network, Network User Identifiers (NUI), and Closed
Users Group (CUG), will mainly be supported by the Supervisor via the
Master User Directory (MUD).  The Protocol Identifiers (PI) will be
supported at the local level by the PAD and X.25/X.75 interface.

5.6.6.1.3	WC
Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project will support the concept of shared
DNICs.  As long as there will be unique addresses between the old and
new networks, there will be no problem with the two parts sharing the
common DNIC of 5052.

5.6.6.1.4	CC
Support for the long form address format "05052+GGG+BB+DDD", short form
address format "2+GGG+BB+DDD", and "real" address format
"5052+GGG+BB+DDD" can be supported with minor modifications after the
completion of Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project.  Essentially,
unadulterated login string with the long or short form address can be
sent to the Supervisor for valiadation and the prefix "0" or "2" can be
detected.  In the both cases, the address is converted into Tymnet's
internal representation "-5052+GGG+BB+DDD".  At the X.75 interface, the
internal representation is converted immediately and then sent to the
Supervisor.  It is expected that only these address formats will be in
the AUSTPAC network, eg. no address of the form "2+GGG+B".

5.6.6.1.5	WC
Once the X.121 Addressing project is completed, the various DNICs used
by AUSTPAC can be easily supported via the MUD.

5.6.6.1.6	AC
The routing of calls will be done by the Supervisor via the MUD.  No
"PSX" in the new generation network will need to analyze the called
address.  However, in the new generation network the PSX will be a
Tymnet node.  If this node needs to be identified via AUSTPAC numbering
scheme (eg. GGGBB), then many monitoring facilities will require
modifications (to convert from octal to decimal).  If this node needs to
be identified via the full address (eg. 5052+GGG+BB), then more
extensive modifications will be required.  Another complication is the
possible requirement for a "general" address, eg. "5052+GGG+BBB" means
any available ports from 5052+GGG+BB+000 to 5052+GGG+BB+999.  In this
case, Tymnet will need to support wild cards in the address processing,
as well as in the address specification (NETVAL).

5.6.6.1.7	FC
In Tymnet, the address table is centrally located at the Supervisor as
the MUD, which is a hash table in a disk.  No pre-allocation of table
space is required to accomodate unused address ranges.

5.6.6.1.8	FC
Not applicable.

5.6.6.1.9	CC
Address fields on all links to the new generation network will be
generated as specified in EPSN 98.

5.6.6.1.10	CC
The PAD or X.25/X.75 interface will compare the inserted (specified by the
user) address with the actual (genned into the interface for the port)
address, and proceed as specified in this subsection.  

5.6.6.1.11	CC
Transit Network Identification Codes (TNICs) are the DNICs of networks
actually transited by a circuit (as opposed to RPOAs, which are DNICs of
networks being requested as transit networks).  The main purpose of
TNICs is for accounting.  Currently, the X.25/X.75 interface dumps the
TNICs into the raw accounting data.  The requirement to include
"insertion of TNICs dependent upon the called and called address on a
per link basis" will require further enhancements.

5.6.6.1.12	CC
Same as above.

5.6.6.1.13	MC
Tymnet does not propose to support SESA multiline links.

5.6.6.1.14	CC
Tymnet currently controls the repeated call failures from a port by
taking the link to the port down.  Tymnet can comply with EPSN 85 by
implementing a forced delay between successive attempts, the recording
of all call attempts in the accounting log, and the specified call
failure codes.

5.6.6.1.15	CC
Symbolic addressing as specified in EPSN 84 can be supported with the
implementation of Tymnet's Symbolic Addressing.  With the completion of
Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project, it will be possible to specify the
desired destination with a symbolic address.  However, in order to
associate the symbolic address with a X.121 address as the called
address, the Symbolic Addressing project must be implemented.  Certain
custom features such as the '?' PAD selection command will require
special customization.

5.6.6.1.16	CC
	(i) It is assumed that "the insertion, deletion or replacement
of address fields" are limited to the DNIC 5052, prefix 0, suffix digits
of the optional subaddress.  If so, Tymnet can handle the insertion and
deletion at the Supervisor level and the replacement at the local level.
If not, then further clarification is needed to determine the exact
requirement.
	(ii) Access barring and call routing based on comparison of
calling address format and protocol ids can be accomplished at the local
level, and the rest at the Supervisor level.  It is assumed that TNICs
in this case refer to RPOAs in the call request.

5.6.6.1.17	CC
EPSN 98 describes the numbering plan for the terminals, NUIs, CUGs, and
PIs, which can be supported by Tymnet.  The terminal numbering plan will
be supportable with some customization at the Supervisor level.  The NUI
numbering plan will be supportable with the implementation of the
Symbolic Addressing project.  The CUG numbering plan will requirement
enhancements in the Supervisor to support interlock codes (a CUG index
in a NUI overridden call request will be mapped via the MUD to an
interlock code, which is sent to the destination for comparison).  The
PI numbering plan can be supported at the local level with
enhancements.
	(i) Access barring will be done by the Supervisor via the MUD.
Each port address or NUI will have a MUD entry specifying allowable
destinations, which include DNICs of transit and foreign networks.
	(ii) The insertion/deletion of the prefix for inter-network
calls will be done at the local level (specifically, the X.75
interface), while the insertion of DNICs will be done by the Supervisor.
The deletion of DNICs is not necessary and will not be done.
	(iii) Comparison checking between the calling address and the
calling subscriber number (?) is being done at the X.25/X.75 interface.
	(iv) Comparison checking between the called address and the
called subscriber number (?) is being done at the X.25/X.75 interface.
	(v) Facilities to specify on a per port basis the complete
called address or the called subaddress is provided at the X.25/X.75
interface.  With the implementation of the Tymnet's X.121 Addressing
project, the full called address is always provided to customers DTEs in
incoming call packets.
	(vi) Facilities to specify on a per port basis transit barring
is provided at the X.25/X.75 interface.  With the implementation of the
Symbolic Addressing project, transit barring (barring calls based on the
originating network and terminating network) will be supportable at the
Supervisor level via the MUD.  It is assumed that transit barring refers
to immediate neighbor networks.


5.6.6.2.1	CC

(i) Details of the address analysis scheme and the address table
structure.

NUI's, symbolic addresses, and X.121 style addresses (for calling and
called addresses) in Tymnet are stored in the Master User Directory (MUD),
which resides on disk.  NETVAL is Tymnet facility that allows for the
administration of the MUD.  A NUI or address becomes a MUD name which
is algebraically manipulated via a hash function to produce a block
number.  In this block of the disk, the MUD entry for this name is
stored.  Entries for MUD names that map to the same block number will be
stored sequentially in the block, with overflows being handled similarly
in the overflow area.  Proper hash function insures even distribution of
the MUD entries on disk.  Disk space must necessarily be large enough to
accomodate the required number of entries, but may not be as large as to
accomodate the entire address range.  Each MUD entry will contain the
access profile for the name, which specifies the allowable originations
and destinations.

Circuit requests in a Tymnet network involve the analysis of the login
string by the Supervisor.  The information of the login string is passed
from the originating interface either in an unadulterated form or in a
partially parsed form.  This information includes the NUI (ie.
username), calling address (ie. originating address), and the called
address (ie. specified destination list), as well as some login
options (eg. reverse charging, throughput class, half-duplex).

The Supervisor will use the NUI or calling address to obtain the "user"
access profile and the called address to obtain the "destination" access
profile.  The user profile is obtained from the MUD entry associated
with the NUI if 
	(1) the NUI is present in the call request, and
	(2) the originating interface indicates "NUI override", and
	(3) the NUI is specified (in the MUD) as "NUI override".
Otherwise, the user profile is obtained from the MUD entry associated
with the calling address.  If the user profile is unobtainable for any
reason, the call is cleared.  If the called address is specified in the
circuit request, then it is converted to a full X.121 address by stripping
the prefix or by inserting the default DNIC (which is 5052 for AUSTPAC).
In this case, the destination profile is obtained from the MUD entry
associated with the full called address; otherwise there will be no
destination profile.  If the called address is specified, but there is
no MUD entry, then the call is cleared.

The actual origination is compared with the allowed originations in the
access profile(s) to determine the destinations to be targetted.  If
there are several possible destinations, then one is chosen as the
resultant destination by determining the least cost path from the
origination.  If no resultant destination can be found, then the call is
cleared.  Thus, access barring is handled by virtue of the data in the
MUD entry.  With the proper addresses (eg. DNICs of foreign networks)
in the origination and destination list of the MUD entry, international
access barring and transit barring are provided.  Requested RPOAs are
also handled via the MUD.  Currently, since CCITT has not specify any
standards for multilple RPOAs, only one RPOA is supported in a call
request.  This feature allows the user to specify a call request to a
destination network via a specific transit network.

The analysis also includes certain address-handling options that are
handled by the Supervisor:
	(1) CUG:  The originating interface will send the requested CUG
number, which is used as an index into a table to obtain the interlock
code.  This interlock code is sent to the resultant destination, which
in turn will covert to a local CUG number.
	(2) reverse charging:  The originating interface will send an
indication that reverse charging is requested.  This is check against
the user profile to determine whether this request is allowed and
against the resultant destination to determine it will accept reverse
charging.

Other address-handling options are handled locally at the originating or
terminating interfaces.  These options would include protocol id and
comparison check of calling address and called address.

(ii) Details of the scheme used to control the insertion of TNICs.

??? Need information from Dennis Ernst.

(iii) Details of the address handling options provided to satisfy the
requirements stated in paragraph 5.6.6.1.16 and 17, as well as any
additional or alternative facilities.

??? Need information form Dennis Ernst.
class/group to define sets of allowable originations and destinations.
facility to restrict NUIs to specific geographical areas.

(iv) Details of the symbolic address handling provided to satisfy the
requirements stated in paragraph 5.6.6.1.15.

A symbolic address in AUSTPAC is what Tymnet refers to as "hostname".
It is an alphanumeric representation of an X.121 address.  This hostname
can be stored as a MUD entry with an origination spec of class 0 (which
means that the circuit can originate from anywhere) and the
corresponding destination spec of the desired called address in X.121
form, which is the resultant destination address.  Since this address
also had a MUD entry defining the actual destination host(s), users have
the option of using either the symbolic address (hostname) or the X.121
address as the called address from anywhere in the network.  These
hostnames are validated via NETVAL as are all other MUD names.  However,
it is assumed that all hostnames begin with an alphabetic character.
(If AUSTPAC requires that their symbolic addresses may begin with a digit,
then Tymnet can comply with further enhancements.)  Hostnames are case
insensitive.

EPSN 84 Symbolic Address Facility Description discusses the various
features/restrictions for symbolic addressing.  Tymnet will or can
comply with each section:
1.  Tymnet's Hostnames and Symbolic Addressing facilities will satisfy
AUSTPAC's requirement for Symbolic Address/Abbreviated Address.
2.1 The character set for these addresses are upper and lower case of
the alphabetic characters and digits are supported by Tymnet.
2.2 Tymnet's hostnames and symbolic addresses are case insensitive.
2.3 The length of addresses can be configured for NETVAL.  However, the
maximum length in Tymnet is 20 characters.  Tymnet may comply if a
greater length is required.
3.  The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will be available to
all X.28 users.
3.1 Tymnet will support the CCITT Recommendation X.28 to address
specification in the call request.  However, the use of "?" in AUSTPAC
will require special customization, since this is not a standard.
3.2 The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will not affect PAD
operation.
4.  The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will be available to
all X.25/X.32 users.
4.1 Since symbolic address/abbreviated address is not a standard
X.25 facility, Tymnet will support this feature for X.25/X.32 access.
4.2 Special AUSTPAC method of specifying the length and field of the
symbolic address will require special customization.
5.1 The administration (creation, modification, and deletion) of
symbolic address will be handled by NETVAL.  If AUSTPAC expects to
administer all addresses at one central location, then a facility to
provide automatic update must be established.  This may be accomplished
by establishing a permanent virtual circuit between NSHS fo the existing
network and NETVAL of the new generation network.  A protocol must be
defined to provide the transmission of the necessary information.  This
will require customization at both NSHS and NETVAL.
    The translation of NUI to NUA may be accomplished via the MUD. It is
unclear whether this NUA is to be substituted as the new NUI or the
calling address for the called DTE.  Since the NUA is used for billing
purposes, it is assumed that the NUA is to be substituted for the NUI in
the call request, which means that the NUA and actual calling address
will be available to the called DTE.  This substitution will require
special customization.
    According to EPSN 98, "an NUI may be defined on a per port basis to
be either 'mandatory', 'optional', or 'forbidden'".  This will require
special customization.  One method of implementation is to have the
defintion of the port (ie. type) be sent to the Supervisor for analysis.  
5.2 NETVAL will support the facility to query the symbolic addresses.
6.1 The symbolic address/abbreviated address will be treated
identically, and as specified above.
6.2 ??? The charging behavior for the actual NUA and symbolic
address/abbreviated address should be identical.  BUT, NUA is subsituted
for NUI and symbolic address refers to called address. ???
6.3 The translation of symbolic address/abbreviated address will require
an additional disk read (for the MUD entry), which will be less than one
second to complete.

(v) Details of the facililties provided to satisfy the requirements of
paragraph 5.6.6.1.10.

??? Need information from Dennis Ernst.

Subject: Austpac response...section 5.6.6 

Hello folks,

Following is my first draft of the response to section 5.6.6.  I would
like to solicit your comments as to accuracy and scope.  I particularly
need further information from Dennis since certain items are in the
X.25 area.  I believe that Gazel is setting up a meeting for Tuesday
at 2pm, which unfortunately I cannot attend (due to ethics class).
However, I would appreciate your response by the end of that day
so that I could update my draft the following day.

Thanks....David

                        AUSTPAC PROPOSAL RESPONSE


Section 5.6.6  Numbering and Addressing


TEAM:   NTD (David Chang, Gazel Tan, Omar Serang, Bill Soley, John Kopf)

THEME:  This section describes the AUSTPAC numbering and addressing
scheme for the new generation packet switching system.  This numbering
plan must comply with the CCITT X.121 RECOMMENDATIONS.  A description of
how Tymnet proposes to support this addressing is included in this
response.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Compliance with stated requirements, which
includes
        * support of the AUSTPAC numbering plan
        * support of symbolic addressing and abbreviated addressing
        * no pre-allocation of address table space
        * support of TNICs
        * support of addressing-handling options

KEY CONCEPTS:  Compliance of the stated requirements will be
accomplished via the following
        * Tymnet's support of X.121 addressing with MUD2, ADR2, LOG2
        * X.25/X.75 local support
        * Tymnet's support of symbolic addressing

DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCES:
        * General External Documents for MUD2, ADR2, LOG2
        * Supervisor Reference Manual (when available)
        * Proposal for Tymnet's Symbolic Addressing (by David Chang,
                12/17/86)
        * X.25/X.75 Reference Manual
        * X.25/X.75 Capabilities
        * EPSN 76 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan (if available)
        * EPSN 84 - Symbolic Addressing Facility Description
        * EPSN 98 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan - Public Issue

PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:
        * Need a copy of EPSN 76 - The AUSTPAC Numbering Plan.
        * Need to produce the Supervisor Reference Manual.
        * Need clarification from AUSTPAC on
          - the purpose of analyzing 9, 10, 13, or 15 digits at the PSXs.
          - the purpose of identifying the PSXs (eg. monitoring(.
          - the usage of the optional subaddress.
          - the usage of TNICs.
        * Plan to support AUSTPAC numbering plan by having one MUD entry
          per address (including symbolic address).  AUSTPAC Phase III
          expects to have about 70,000 addressable ports.  If there is
          a symbolic address per X.121 address, then the MUD may contain
          140,000 entries.  Currently, the MUD in the public net
          contains about 10,000 entries, which represents 23%.
          Therefore, support of dual disk or larger disk capacity may be
          necessary.
        * If support for a "general" address is required, then some
          means of implementing wild cards must be conceived.
        * Can AUSTPAC's symbolic address/abbreviated address begin with
          a digit?
        * AUSTPAC may need to administer their address with one
          facility.  Currently, NSHS is used for the existing network,
          and NETVAL will be used in the new network.  It seems that
          in order to provide an automatic update feature, a permanent
          circuit is required between NSHS and NETVAL with an established
          protocol.
        * Does AUSTPAC use 3-digit DNICs (or pseudo-DNICs) for access to
          other networks (eg. 961, 933, 944; see EPSN 98, p3)?
        * What is the complete relationship among NUI, NUA, and calling
          address?  It is unclear, but it seems that there is a 1-1
          relationship between NUI and NUA, but no specific relationship
          with calling address.
        * There are many address-handling options, including those
          listed in section 5.6 p10 and in EPSN p2 ('mandatory',
          'optional', and 'forbidden' NUI on a per port basis), that may
          be implemented locally or at the Supervisor level or both.
          Tymnet needs to produce a policy as to how these should be
          handled.
        * EPSN 84, section 6.2, p7 briefly describes charging behavior
          and implies that NUA may be used as a called address.  Is it
          not the function of the NUA to represent a NUI in a X.121
          address form in the call request?

SUBSECTION COMPLIANCE AND RESPONSE

5.6.6.1.1       WC
Tymnet is in the process of implementing X.121 addressing based on CCITT
Recommendations.  This project, expected to be completed by the end of
1987, encompasses modifications in the Supervisor, NETVAL, PAD, and
X.25/X.75 and will provide the foundation for supporting the AUSTPAC
numbering plan.  Additional features and possible customization will be
needed to satisfy all of the stated requirements.

5.6.6.1.2       WC
The AUSTPAC numbering plan, as it applies to the numbering of ports and
terminals in the network, Network User Identifiers (NUI), and Closed
Users Group (CUG), will mainly be supported by the Supervisor via the
Master User Directory (MUD).  The Protocol Identifiers (PI) will be
supported at the local level by the PAD and X.25/X.75 interface.

5.6.6.1.3       WC
Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project will support the concept of shared
DNICs.  As long as there will be unique addresses between the old and
new networks, there will be no problem with the two parts sharing the
common DNIC of 5052.

5.6.6.1.4       CC
Support for the long form address format "05052+GGG+BB+DDD", short form
address format "2+GGG+BB+DDD", and "real" address format
"5052+GGG+BB+DDD" can be supported with minor modifications after the
completion of Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project.  Essentially,
unadulterated login string with the long or short form address can be
sent to the Supervisor for valiadation and the prefix "0" or "2" can be
detected.  In the both cases, the address is converted into Tymnet's
internal representation "-5052+GGG+BB+DDD".  At the X.75 interface, the
internal representation is converted immediately and then sent to the
Supervisor.  It is expected that only these address formats will be in
the AUSTPAC network, eg. no address of the form "2+GGG+B".

5.6.6.1.5       WC
Once the X.121 Addressing project is completed, the various DNICs used
by AUSTPAC can be easily supported via the MUD.

5.6.6.1.6       AC
The routing of calls will be done by the Supervisor via the MUD.  No
"PSX" in the new generation network will need to analyze the called
address.  However, in the new generation network the PSX will be a
Tymnet node.  If this node needs to be identified via AUSTPAC numbering
scheme (eg. GGGBB), then many monitoring facilities will require
modifications (to convert from octal to decimal).  If this node needs to
be identified via the full address (eg. 5052+GGG+BB), then more
extensive modifications will be required.  Another complication is the
possible requirement for a "general" address, eg. "5052+GGG+BBB" means
any available ports from 5052+GGG+BB+000 to 5052+GGG+BB+999.  In this
case, Tymnet will need to support wild cards in the address processing,
as well as in the address specification (NETVAL).

5.6.6.1.7       FC
In Tymnet, the address table is centrally located at the Supervisor as
the MUD, which is a hash table in a disk.  No pre-allocation of table
space is required to accomodate unused address ranges.

5.6.6.1.8       FC
Not applicable.

5.6.6.1.9       CC
Address fields on all links to the new generation network will be
generated as specified in EPSN 98.

5.6.6.1.10      CC
The PAD or X.25/X.75 interface will compare the inserted (specified by the
user) address with the actual (genned into the interface for the port)
address, and proceed as specified in this subsection.  

5.6.6.1.11      CC
Transit Network Identification Codes (TNICs) are the DNICs of networks
actually transited by a circuit (as opposed to RPOAs, which are DNICs of
networks being requested as transit networks).  The main purpose of
TNICs is for accounting.  Currently, the X.25/X.75 interface dumps the
TNICs into the raw accounting data.  The requirement to include
"insertion of TNICs dependent upon the called and called address on a
per link basis" will require further enhancements.

5.6.6.1.12      CC
Same as above.

5.6.6.1.13      MC
Tymnet does not propose to support SESA multiline links.

5.6.6.1.14      CC
Tymnet currently controls the repeated call failures from a port by
taking the link to the port down.  Tymnet can comply with EPSN 85 by
implementing a forced delay between successive attempts, the recording
of all call attempts in the accounting log, and the specified call
failure codes.

5.6.6.1.15      CC
Symbolic addressing as specified in EPSN 84 can be supported with the
implementation of Tymnet's Symbolic Addressing.  With the completion of
Tymnet's X.121 Addressing project, it will be possible to specify the
desired destination with a symbolic address.  However, in order to
associate the symbolic address with a X.121 address as the called
address, the Symbolic Addressing project must be implemented.  Certain
custom features such as the '?' PAD selection command will require
special customization.

5.6.6.1.16      CC
        (i) It is assumed that "the insertion, deletion or replacement
of address fields" are limited to the DNIC 5052, prefix 0, suffix digits
of the optional subaddress.  If so, Tymnet can handle the insertion and
deletion at the Supervisor level and the replacement at the local level.
If not, then further clarification is needed to determine the exact
requirement.
        (ii) Access barring and call routing based on comparison of
calling address format and protocol ids can be accomplished at the local
level, and the rest at the Supervisor level.  It is assumed that TNICs
in this case refer to RPOAs in the call request.

5.6.6.1.17      CC
EPSN 98 describes the numbering plan for the terminals, NUIs, CUGs, and
PIs, which can be supported by Tymnet.  The terminal numbering plan will
be supportable with some customization at the Supervisor level.  The NUI
numbering plan will be supportable with the implementation of the
Symbolic Addressing project.  The CUG numbering plan will requirement
enhancements in the Supervisor to support interlock codes (a CUG index
in a NUI overridden call request will be mapped via the MUD to an
interlock code, which is sent to the destination for comparison).  The
PI numbering plan can be supported at the local level with
enhancements.
        (i) Access barring will be done by the Supervisor via the MUD.
Each port address or NUI will have a MUD entry specifying allowable
destinations, which include DNICs of transit and foreign networks.
        (ii) The insertion/deletion of the prefix for inter-network
calls will be done at the local level (specifically, the X.75
interface), while the insertion of DNICs will be done by the Supervisor.
The deletion of DNICs is not necessary and will not be done.
        (iii) Comparison checking between the calling address and the
calling subscriber number (?) is being done at the X.25/X.75 interface.
        (iv) Comparison checking between the called address and the
called subscriber number (?) is being done at the X.25/X.75 interface.
        (v) Facilities to specify on a per port basis the complete
called address or the called subaddress is provided at the X.25/X.75
interface.  With the implementation of the Tymnet's X.121 Addressing
project, the full called address is always provided to customers DTEs in
incoming call packets.
        (vi) Facilities to specify on a per port basis transit barring
is provided at the X.25/X.75 interface.  With the implementation of the
Symbolic Addressing project, transit barring (barring calls based on the
originating network and terminating network) will be supportable at the
Supervisor level via the MUD.  It is assumed that transit barring refers
to immediate neighbor networks.


5.6.6.2.1       CC

(i) Details of the address analysis scheme and the address table
structure.

NUI's, symbolic addresses, and X.121 style addresses (for calling and
called addresses) in Tymnet are stored in the Master User Directory (MUD),
which resides on disk.  NETVAL is Tymnet facility that allows for the
administration of the MUD.  A NUI or address becomes a MUD name which
is algebraically manipulated via a hash function to produce a block
number.  In this block of the disk, the MUD entry for this name is
stored.  Entries for MUD names that map to the same block number will be
stored sequentially in the block, with overflows being handled similarly
in the overflow area.  Proper hash function insures even distribution of
the MUD entries on disk.  Disk space must necessarily be large enough to
accomodate the required number of entries, but may not be as large as to
accomodate the entire address range.  Each MUD entry will contain the
access profile for the name, which specifies the allowable originations
and destinations.

Circuit requests in a Tymnet network involve the analysis of the login
string by the Supervisor.  The information of the login string is passed
from the originating interface either in an unadulterated form or in a
partially parsed form.  This information includes the NUI (ie.
username), calling address (ie. originating address), and the called
address (ie. specified destination list), as well as some login
options (eg. reverse charging, throughput class, half-duplex).

The Supervisor will use the NUI or calling address to obtain the "user"
access profile and the called address to obtain the "destination" access
profile.  The user profile is obtained from the MUD entry associated
with the NUI if 
        (1) the NUI is present in the call request, and
        (2) the originating interface indicates "NUI override", and
        (3) the NUI is specified (in the MUD) as "NUI override".
Otherwise, the user profile is obtained from the MUD entry associated
with the calling address.  If the user profile is unobtainable for any
reason, the call is cleared.  If the called address is specified in the
circuit request, then it is converted to a full X.121 address by stripping
the prefix or by inserting the default DNIC (which is 5052 for AUSTPAC).
In this case, the destination profile is obtained from the MUD entry
associated with the full called address; otherwise there will be no
destination profile.  If the called address is specified, but there is
no MUD entry, then the call is cleared.

The actual origination is compared with the allowed originations in the
access profile(s) to determine the destinations to be targetted.  If
there are several possible destinations, then one is chosen as the
resultant destination by determining the least cost path from the
origination.  If no resultant destination can be found, then the call is
cleared.  Thus, access barring is handled by virtue of the data in the
MUD entry.  With the proper addresses (eg. DNICs of foreign networks)
in the origination and destination list of the MUD entry, international
access barring and transit barring are provided.  Requested RPOAs are
also handled via the MUD.  Currently, since CCITT has not specify any
standards for multilple RPOAs, only one RPOA is supported in a call
request.  This feature allows the user to specify a call request to a
destination network via a specific transit network.

The analysis also includes certain address-handling options that are
handled by the Supervisor:
        (1) CUG:  The originating interface will send the requested CUG
number, which is used as an index into a table to obtain the interlock
code.  This interlock code is sent to the resultant destination, which
in turn will covert to a local CUG number.
        (2) reverse charging:  The originating interface will send an
indication that reverse charging is requested.  This is check against
the user profile to determine whether this request is allowed and
against the resultant destination to determine it will accept reverse
charging.

Other address-handling options are handled locally at the originating or
terminating interfaces.  These options would include protocol id and
comparison check of calling address and called address.

(ii) Details of the scheme used to control the insertion of TNICs.

??? Need information from Dennis Ernst.

(iii) Details of the address handling options provided to satisfy the
requirements stated in paragraph 5.6.6.1.16 and 17, as well as any
additional or alternative facilities.

??? Need information form Dennis Ernst.
class/group to define sets of allowable originations and destinations.
facility to restrict NUIs to specific geographical areas.

(iv) Details of the symbolic address handling provided to satisfy the
requirements stated in paragraph 5.6.6.1.15.

A symbolic address in AUSTPAC is what Tymnet refers to as "hostname".
It is an alphanumeric representation of an X.121 address.  This hostname
can be stored as a MUD entry with an origination spec of class 0 (which
means that the circuit can originate from anywhere) and the
corresponding destination spec of the desired called address in X.121
form, which is the resultant destination address.  Since this address
also had a MUD entry defining the actual destination host(s), users have
the option of using either the symbolic address (hostname) or the X.121
address as the called address from anywhere in the network.  These
hostnames are validated via NETVAL as are all other MUD names.  However,
it is assumed that all hostnames begin with an alphabetic character.
(If AUSTPAC requires that their symbolic addresses may begin with a digit,
then Tymnet can comply with further enhancements.)  Hostnames are case
insensitive.

EPSN 84 Symbolic Address Facility Description discusses the various
features/restrictions for symbolic addressing.  Tymnet will or can
comply with each section:
1.  Tymnet's Hostnames and Symbolic Addressing facilities will satisfy
AUSTPAC's requirement for Symbolic Address/Abbreviated Address.
2.1 The character set for these addresses are upper and lower case of
the alphabetic characters and digits are supported by Tymnet.
2.2 Tymnet's hostnames and symbolic addresses are case insensitive.
2.3 The length of addresses can be configured for NETVAL.  However, the
maximum length in Tymnet is 20 characters.  Tymnet may comply if a
greater length is required.
3.  The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will be available to
all X.28 users.
3.1 Tymnet will support the CCITT Recommendation X.28 to address
specification in the call request.  However, the use of "?" in AUSTPAC
will require special customization, since this is not a standard.
3.2 The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will not affect PAD
operation.
4.  The use of symbolic address/abbreviated address will be available to
all X.25/X.32 users.
4.1 Since symbolic address/abbreviated address is not a standard
X.25 facility, Tymnet will support this feature for X.25/X.32 access.
4.2 Special AUSTPAC method of specifying the length and field of the
symbolic address will require special customization.
5.1 The administration (creation, modification, and deletion) of
symbolic address will be handled by NETVAL.  If AUSTPAC expects to
administer all addresses at one central location, then a facility to
provide automatic update must be established.  This may be accomplished
by establishing a permanent virtual circuit between NSHS fo the existing
network and NETVAL of the new generation network.  A protocol must be
defined to provide the transmission of the necessary information.  This
will require customization at both NSHS and NETVAL.
    The translation of NUI to NUA may be accomplished via the MUD. It is
unclear whether this NUA is to be substituted as the new NUI or the
calling address for the called DTE.  Since the NUA is used for billing
purposes, it is assumed that the NUA is to be substituted for the NUI in
the call request, which means that the NUA and actual calling address
will be available to the called DTE.  This substitution will require
special customization.
    According to EPSN 98, "an NUI may be defined on a per port basis to
be either 'mandatory', 'optional', or 'forbidden'".  This will require
special customization.  One method of implementation is to have the
defintion of the port (ie. type) be sent to the Supervisor for analysis.  
5.2 NETVAL will support the facility to query the symbolic addresses.
6.1 The symbolic address/abbreviated address will be treated
identically, and as specified above.
6.2 ??? The charging behavior for the actual NUA and symbolic
address/abbreviated address should be identical.  BUT, NUA is subsituted
for NUI and symbolic address refers to called address. ???
6.3 The translation of symbolic address/abbreviated address will require
an additional disk read (for the MUD entry), which will be less than one
second to complete.

(v) Details of the facililties provided to satisfy the requirements of
paragraph 5.6.6.1.10.

		AUSTPAC PROPOSAL RESPONSE

Sections 4.6.2.6 and 5.6.9  Routing


TEAM:  NTD (Omar Serang, David Chang, Gazel Tan, Bill Soley, John Kopf)


THEME:  This section describes the AUSTPAC routing scheme for the new 
generation packet switching system.  This document contains:

    - a complete functional description of the routing algorithm
    - responses to the routing requirements stated in section 4.6.2.6
    - responses to the routing requirements stated in section 5.6.9
    - a description of the internetwork routing considerations
    - a response to the request for "internal link" calls as 
      stated in section 5.6.9.1.14


EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Compliance with stated requirements, which includes:

    - least cost routing with load leveling and alternate path selection,
      link restriction and path length limit setting per called address, 
      in the new generation system
    - least cost routing with load leveling and alternate path selection
      from the new generation system to the existing system
    - provision of facilities for "internal links" over a specified path,
      for use in measuring network quality of service and performance


KEY CONCEPTS:  Compliance of the stated requirements will be accomplished 
    via the following:

    - TYMNET's current, centralized "breadth-wide search" routing 
      algorithm with link load leveling and link restriction
    - new features provided in conjunction with MUD2/ADR2/LOG2 in response 
      to the request for path length limiting 
    - new features provided in response to the request for path
      pre-selection and prioritization, and to prevent internetwork
      path "loops"


DOCUMENTATION/REFERENCES:

    - The Supervisor Reference Manual (when available).
      (SUPDEV:39)SPROUT.DOC, (SUPDEV:39)LLEVEL.DOC and
      (SUPDEV:39)IRCDOC.DOC currently contain the
      pertinent information (Omar Serang has the accompanying
      figures for the SPROUT.DOC file).
    - General External Design documents for MUD2, ADR2, LOG2,
      (SUPDEV:39) files MD2GED.DOC, AD2GED.DOC and LG2GED.DOC

PROBLEMS/QUESTIONS:

    - Need clarification from AUSTPAC on:
        * 4.6.2.6 item iv, regarding what is specifically desired
          for TYMNET node (PSX) identification, since there is
          no correspondence between node numbers and addressing
          in a TYMNET network
        * 5.6.9.1.5 regarding what is specifically desired for
          path pre-definition and prioritization
        * 5.6.9.1.8 regarding what is specifically desired for 
          load sharing on the X.75 links from the new generation
          system to the existing system
        * 5.6.9.1.12 regarding what is specifically desired for
          link restriction on a per called address basis

    - Need to produce the Supervisor Reference Manual

    - A potential technical problem area is:
        * 5.6.9.1.5 requesting path pre-definition and prioritization


SUBSECTION COMPLIANCE AND RESPONSE:

5.6.9.1.3	FC
The current TYMNET "breadth-wide search" routing algorithm provides least
cost routing for user circuits, and least link routing for
Supervisor command circuits.

5.6.9.1.4	FC
The current TYMNET routing algorithm provides alternate path selection
to handle link congestion and failure.

5.6.9.1.5	MC
This is a potential problem area since the current routing algorithm
selects a path based upon least cost, with random selection between
paths of equal cost.  It is currently possible to establish pre-defined, 
prioritized TARGETS which would thus affect the ultimate path 
destination, but it would be non-trivial to implement a scheme to
route calls upon pre-specified, prioritized paths on a per user
or per called address basis.

5.6.1.9.6	WC
By establishing the proper X.121 addressing and X.75 host targetting
relationships in the Supervisor, path routing from the new generation
system will select an X.75 gateway that is optimum for the ultimate
destination within the existing system.  The routing algorithm
does not consider any paths outside of the new generation system
if the source and destination are both in the new generation system.



5.6.1.9.7	WC
Logical channels are not restricted to a particular line of multi-line 
links between TYMNET nodes.  The distribution of traffic on multiple lines
will be handled by the Node Code to insure equal loading of the lines
comprising the multi-line link.

5.6.1.9.8	WC
This area needs some clarification from AUSTPAC regarding the
desired results.  The existing system addresses will be targetted to
X.75 gateways in the new generation system Supervisor, in such a way
as to access a gateway that is optimal for the ultimate existing system
destination address.  There will likely be several target gateways that
may be selected for any particular address and there will certainly be
many addresses using a single gateway.  

The traffic load over the internetwork gateways may be balanced 
using host cost reporting by the X.75 interfaces, which will 
affect the path routing to favor hosts with less cost.  This mechanism 
is effective for long term (minutes) call distribution since host 
cost is reported infrequently to the Supervisor.  A multi-target host
random select mechanism could be implemented to distribute calls
over a set of hosts on a per call basis, and would be effective
in distributing calls over the gateways for short term call bursts,
such as a large number of PVCs targetted to the existing network
coming up at once.

5.6.9.1.9	WC
The problem of internetwork cyclic circuit loops is solved by inspecting
the TNIC field and/or the X.25/X.75 call identification number to
insure that a circuit has not transitted a network or gateway more than
once.

The internetwork cyclic circuit loop occurs when a call originating
in a TYMNET network requests a called address that is in an
adjacent network, and the TYMNET Supervisor routes the call to the 
appropriate gateway to the other network, passing the called address
to the adjacent network.  If the adjacent network has the same
called address indicated as being in the original TYMNET network,
the call is routed back to the original network, passing the same called
address, which starts the process again.

Since the TNIC will be inserted by the X.75 gateways for every network
that the call transits on outgoing calls, the X.75 gateways will inspect
the incoming call TNICs to insure that the call has not transitted the
network once before.  If TNIC insertion suppression is used by the
caller (as requested in section 5.6.6.1.11) then the X.75 interface
can check the call identification facilities field to insure that the
call is not already passing through the gateway on another channel.




5.6.9.1.10	FC
The TYMNET routing algorithm disallows paths that passthrough
the same node twice.

5.6.9.1.11	WC
It will be a trivial task to include a maximum path length/cost
and path limit flag in the MUD entry for a user or called address.
The MUD2 processing will provide this value to the ADR2 processing
which will check the path result for compliance.  If a path is built
that exceeds the restrictions implied by the username or called address,
an alternate target selection may occur, or the call request may
be rejected (issuing the reject reason within the LOG2 protocol).

5.6.9.1.12	MC
It is not clear what is specifically desired by AUSTPAC for link 
restriction of calls on a per called address basis.  It is possible
that the current IRC restriction mechanism, which allows certain
users to be restricted from traversing certain links or groups of 
links, could be used to satisfy the requirements.  The document
(SUPDEV:39)IRCDOC.DOC describes the current IRC mechanism.

5.6.9.1.13	FC
The current TYMNET routing algorithm takes the link overload
and saturation factors into account for pathfinding, and enhancements
to the mechanism have been designed to better take account of
any and all link factors that should affect path selection.  The
global, centralized nature of the TYMNET routing insures the
availability of resources at all points of the circuit path.


5.6.9.1.14	FC
The current Node Code XRAY Delay Measurement Circuits facility 
provides the ability to established pre-defined network paths, and to
transfer controlled streams of data on the circuit for the
purpose of performance and delay measurement.  Full details of this
facility are included as part of the information to be provided




INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED:

Section 4.6.2.6 items i - v

The TYMNET routing algorithm utilizes a dynamic, centrally
located network topology database to compute the least cost
path between any two nodes in the network.  The algorithm takes
into account link speeds and condition, and user circuit characteristic
requirements when computing the path, and provides alternate path
routing between nodes.

Addresses within a TYMNET network may be viewed as symbolic
representations of one or more call destination host numbers, and have
no direct relation to the path routing process.  The address simply
yields a set of one or more possible circuit destinations, which are
considered by the routing algorithm when computing a least cost path.
Provision is made to assign dynamic host costs which will affect the
routing algorithm's selection of various possible destinations.
Provision for even distribution of calls over similar costs links
and for link restriction per user is also included within the
routing algorithm.

Since the routing algorithm is not pre-defined or hierarchical, but
truly dynamic, constantly responding to the changing conditions of
network resources, the network is utilized in the most efficient manner
possible, with calls always being routed on the most desirable links
at the time.  This also alleviates the need to administer a pre-defined,
addressing/routing hierarchy, and dissociates addressing with any
actual physical entities.  Thus, the TYMNET network offers unparalleled 
addressing flexibility and administrative ease, providing true symbolic
addressing to be configured in any form desirable.

Since there is no direct relation between PSX numbering and addressing,
clarification must be obtained from AUSTPAC regarding what is desired
for node identification, and in what fashion the identification string
is to be used.  At this time it seems desirable for AUSTPAC to
be able to associate an "address string" with each node/kernel host
in the network, in conjunction with the overall network addressing
scheme.  It will probably not be necessary to maintain this
node identification string on the Supervisor, but on TMCS,
since the probable use of the string will be for operator interface.
A possible scenario is to have a central address administration
program which sets up all the network addresses and corresponding
node/PSX identification strings for the new and existing systems,
and then updates the specific corresponding TMCS, NETVAL and NSHS
databases.

The addressing scheme will also incorporate the interconnection
of the new generation and existing systems, and must be properly
designed to provide sufficient internetwork primary and
alternate resources.




Section 5.6.9.2

i)  The detailed description of the TYMNET routing algorithm is 
currently contained in the aforementioned (SUPDEV:39) files
SPROUT.DOC and LLEVEL.DOC (with accompanying figures provided
by Omar Serang).

ii)  Stated in previous section of this document.

iii)  In order to properly route calls between the new generation
system and the existing system, a coordinated addressing scheme
must be implemented between the new and the existing systems.  For this
reason, this document recommends the use of a single central
administrative function for assigning AUSTPAC addresses.  

Dave Chang's response to section 5.6.6 indicates that NETVAL could be 
modified to centrally administer all AUSTPAC addresses and communicate with 
the existing network services host, NSHS, to update the existing network
accordingly.  Since node (PSX) identification may also be coordinated
with the addressing scheme, it is also likely that another program
may act as a master to both NETVAL and NSHS (and other entities
such as TMCS), providing a central addressing scheme database from
which all pertinent databases are updated.

As long as the addresses are coordinated properly between the two networks,
there will be no additional internetwork routing considerations.

iv)  The XRAY Reference Manual, (SUPDEV:39)XRAY05.DOC, describes in 
detail the Delay Measurement Circuit facility provided in response 
to section 5.6.9.1.14.

Bill,
It was decided between Pat and me that for reason of simplicity
boot will be running at the interrupt level (handling short data messages).
Since you mentioned once that ipcfDone() is not to be used at the
interrupt level I want to check with you if there are similar
restrictions imposed on other functions. My prime interest is in
ipcfSend(). I must be able to do it at the interrupt level.

Bill,
according to tyour document this call never returns unless there is
a problem. while doing loads or dumps i will be doing very little but
waiting for messages. if i am supposed not to return i will idle most
of the time. that is why i have problems with your statement.
what exactly did you have in mind?

bILL, something strange just happened.  When I logged in to 39 this morning i got 
two messages, as usual...
   -[mail waiting]
        and
   -mail waiting

First I read my -mail, which is usaully crash reports from 39, which it was.
But when those finished i got another -mail waiting   message.  So I typed
mail again.  Then what I got, via F29 was all my ontyme messages! one after the
other.  When that completed i went into TUMS which said I had 8 new messages.

When I did a read all I got was ONE message, there were no more.  Why is
my mail going to system mail now?  Can you help?   Thanks,,,slm

Bill, first I wish you quick recovery whatever it was. Yes, I and Pat
thought it would be simpler to limit myself to iterrupt level functions-
no need to worry about how to schedule my background. I admit , at least
on my part, it is ignorance - at the moment I plainly would not know how
to deal with background but right now I am doing some reading and hope-
fully I get some clues from your manuals. But it looks like I won't have
much choice, you pointed out that debugging may be difficult at the intr.
level, but there are other issues. what if boot calls for dumping and
patron is still running (Pat suggested this), then I have to be probably
carefull about how long I spent at the intr. level. Yu-liang sounded also
like calling ipcfSend() from the intr. should not be attempted. Is it
right? 
anyway I am in the midst of intense reading. let me know if you see
some major flaws in my reasoning.

Bill, I guess I have to ask you this. If I am running at the software

to run X out of background? despite my reading it is unclear to me
how to do that. Mike

ipcfSend() could be made to work at interrupt level, but it is not
currently specified one way or the other.  You also asked about ipcfDone.
It can be called anytime ipcfSend could be called, but it does not make
sense to call it while processing an interrupt for an incomming message
since the same function is performed by the return value of the interrupt
service routine.  That would cause DONE to be sent twice.  -Bill

Bill, how are you doing ?  are you going to be in NTD on monday?
I got a lot of questions so I can start a fairly detailed design of
my boot but without the resolution of fundamental issues (like thsi
background stuff) I am stuck. I am studying in the meantime your
latest scheduler spec. some of the things are obviuos some not.
I noticed there is no definition of structures k_process and k_queue
and no definition of k_run function. k_wait is a bit of a mystery
to me. I am not sure yet how important all these things will be for
me. I hope you are patient with me but you probably noticed we are
on a project that requires a lot of interaction. Mike J.

In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 5 Jun 87 8:14:21 PDT

RF modulation of digital data is commonly done for a very low cost, for
example, digital-proportional servos for model aircraft, garage door
openers, BSR X-10 remote controls, and so forth.  The commonality they
have is (1) low data rate, (2) error-tollerant protocol.  The data rate
is typically about 10-50 baud and the data is typically repeated several
times or continously in the case of aircraft to compensate for errors.
Higher data rates are used in packet radio, but require expensive and
complex modems, and expensive radios with lots of bandwidth.  I would
think that reliability would suffer enough to make up for the inconvenience
of physical cables.  Infra red might work but everytime somebody walked
in front of it...  
What is the data rate for MIDI?

Its too early to tell if I will be in on Monday, but its likely I will
be working from home (bed actually).  k_run is an assembly language
function and I only printed out the C stuff.  Its really internal so
you can ignore it.  I'm about to write a memo describing the how to
use the scheduler so this should help.  I am always happy to answer
your questions - I appreciate your patience and courtesy.  -Bill

My only comment on your response to Austpac contained in (OSERANG)AUSPTH.DOC
is that I would hesitate to encourage use of the IRC rotation scheme for
any purpose.  It would be nice not to have to support it for Austpac after
we find a better way to do IRC for Tymnet.

Otherwise, the response looks very good.  Sorry for my delay in reviewing it.

Subject: Re: SETOP passwords 

Of course!  A manager need not know the old password to change someone under
him.  How else could he set the password or change it, when an employee came
and had forgotten his password!!!

YES!!! I agree it should be changed... it should work like PASSWORD does now!
When a manager runs setop... before he can do anything, he must give his
own password... (and if you don't have WC set, I believe it does ASK for OPER
name and password).  Bill, you have enough license that you were not validated
when you changed the password.

Anyway, it makes sense that anyone doing anything should validate himself and
super licenses should still require the validation.  At present, if WRS or CARL
validated themselves, then they could only change people under them... that's
the way SETOP works.

We will have "super-user" status still.. but validatin is required to produce
a proper audit trail. So we should include the validation... and maybe.. just
maybe provide a way in to re-create the world if something happens to th
password file and it needs reconstruction.

     _e_n_u_m k Priority priority;
     _i_n_t st-ackSize;

k_sprout() creates a new Rodney internal process with a  priority
of  priority  and a stack of stackSize bytes running the function
(*mainFunctionp)().  A  pointer  to  the  process  descriptor  is
returned, or NULL if the process could not be created.

k_sprout() may be called from interrupt level,  but  the  process
will  be  run  at  Rodney background level.  If the process' main
function returns, the process is killed.


1.0.2  _k__d_i_s_m_i_s_s()() - _a_l_l_o_w _a_n_o_t_h_e_r _p_r_o_c_e_s_s _t_o _r_u_n

     _v_o_i_d
     k dismiss( _v_o_i_d );
      -
k_dismiss() puts the current process at the end of the run  queue
and  selects the next runnable process.  Note:  this does not run
processes which are at a lower priority.  This is necessary since

Rodney  internal  processes  are  dismissed  only  voluntarily by
either this call or k_wait().

     _s-t__r_u_c_t k event *eventp;        /* reference argument */
             -
k_wait() puts the current process on the queue  waiting  for  the
event *eventp and selects the next runnable process.


1.0.4  _k__c_a_u_s_e() - _c_a_u_s_e _e_v_e_n_t

     _s-t__r_u_c_t k event *eventp;        /* reference argument */
             -
k_cause() causes the  event  *eventp  thus  making  runnable  any
processes  waiting for it.  If no processes are waiting, the next
process to call k_wait() for this event will immediately be  made
runnable.

k_cause() may be called at interrupt level.

k_alarm() submits a timer request to cause the event *eventp  and
set  the  flag *flagp after time MS.  If eventp is NULL, no event
is caused.  If flagp is NULL, no flag is set.

k_alarm() returns an int handle to the timer request which may be
used by k_cancel() to cancel it.

scheduler description ready. I was even thinking of somehow be able
to read directly from your file, this way I don't have to worry
about time lost on any final document preparation chores you may want
to apply and actual printing. the faster the better for me.

Bill,
These are my comments regarding the Rodney Scheduler.

1. In your last update in the definition of k_sprout() there is a line
...struct k_process *...the asterisk being 'uncomitted'. I suspect
this statement to be incomplete.
Could you comment on a possible construction of enum k_Priority
and the importance of stackSize ?
2. The new structure type k_event is used in k_wait() without prior
definition. I can see that you changed it from the last document where
the argument to k_wait() was not a pointer but an enum k_Event. This
makes things a bit ambiguous what is or is not valid in the previous
C-lang. write-up.
4. My attempts to fully understand the mechanism of scheduling were
frustrated by the lack of definition of structures k_process, k_queue.
Now, with advent of k_event there is even more need to have all the 
structures defined. By the way how k_Request relates to it all?
5. k_wait() and k_cause() seem to go hand-by-hand. Am I correct saying
that k_wait is meant to be called out of background? Doing it at the
interrupt level would make no sense to me. Also is there any inherent
correlation between k_cause and k_alarm ? Their functionalities look
so alike yet their C-def seem to be quite apart. Again this must be
my inability to grasp every detail at this point.
6. From the last document I got an impression (it is quite possible a 
wrong one ) there are a few queues  that can either be addressed according
to the priority or event-type. I understand that C-lang. is self-explanatory
for you but it would better reveal your intentions (and make things more
'friendly') if you could provide a concise written explanation of the
whole dynamic mechanism in layman's terms. I mean nothing real elaborate,
a page or two. That could be a real eye-opener.
7. The most important thing I got out of this is the fact the switching
from the interrupt level to background should be relatively easy.
I also suspect I will be using primarily k_sprout().
Regards,
Mike J.

It used to be possible to send email to EcoNet I.  I just
augmented the mail delivery system a bit to enable everyone,

	name@econet1

Christian Stalberg used to know how to send mail to users on PN

Such messages go through a gateway that didn't seem to work for a
while, so you should experiment with it if you want to use it.
But it might be useful to some people during the transition, and
it might be useful with the people who stay on EcoNet I due to
cost reasons (e.g. they're in one of the 10 freebie foreign
countries).

This statement is part of the definition of k_sprout meaning that "k_sprout
is a function which returns a pointer to a structure of class k_Process".
The style we have adopted dictates that the type of a function be on the
previous line and the name of the function being defined begin in column 1.

> Could you comment on a possible construction of enum k_Priority

Currently, k_Priority would be defined as

	enum k_Priority {
		PRI_NORMAL
	};

with others being added if necessary.

The structure k_Event is not defined yet.  It'll probably just contain
a few flags and pointers used internally by Rodney.  The caller should
not reference the elements of the structure and thus does not need to
know what they are.

k_Request is another internal data structure used by Rodney to keep track
of the requests for the timer.  You are given a pointer to it just as a
handle to be used to cancel the request if you so desire.

k_wait may be called only within a process and not at interrupt level,
which is to say, background.

k_cause causes an event NOW
k_alarm causes an event LATER (at a specified clock time)

Hi William,

I'm sorry to disturb you again. I still have problem with
my mail system:
- All mails only come to Tymix but not to Ontyme which is 
  my permanent home mail.

Would you please find time to fixe it for me? Thanks a lot 
in advance.

Sincerely yours,

I'm not sure what you are saying is the problem.  I've checked that your
mail from Ontyme is being forwarded to your name on tymix.  If this is not
what you want, I will stop it from forwarding and you can read your mail
directly on Ontyme.  If I misunderstand, please elaborate.  Thanks -Bill

on Tymix. Since I won't work on Tymix anymore, I would like to have

Bill,

I can try the test,  I think the exit delay is in seconds.  So, if
delay/60 is odd?  The beeping is particularly annoying when you arm it
at night and have to listen to a couple of minutes of beeping.  Is there 
any indication of being in the delay period (blinking light)?  I would 
probably be interested in the new version if we can figure out how to 
get one....

its purpose is to return boot parametrs by sendind BOOT_RSP msg.,

You need an init program to set TTY LC option.  On upper case only
terminals like the model 33 teletype, tilde is the same as an escape.
If you don't otherwise care, you can use (XEXEC)INIT for an init file.
Use the NONAME program to change your INIT program.
	R NONAME
	CHANGE
	6
	Y
	XEXEC
	INIT
	Y
	N
	Q
This will allow you to use tilde and also lower case.  Many other
wonderful things will happen as well.  -Bill

Okay I stopped your Ontymes from being sent to Tymix.  If you want your tymix

	% cat > .forward
	sli.sam@ontyme.tymnet
	^d

Sorry.  odd number of seconds is what I meant to say.  For example, if you
currently have exit delay set to 60 seconds, try 61 in stead.  It looks
like its a single chip microcomputer, maybe an 8049.  If it is I can copy
it here at home, but I might blow it up trying if its not.  I think that
the rep would give me another one if it turns out you need one.  -Bill

The error message "No router table for OFFICE" means that it doesn't know
how to deliver to OFFICE.TYMNET (so why doesn't it say so?).  I suspect
that the .ARPA is getting truncated by PROFS perhaps and TUMS is
assuming .TYMNET.  I've changed the routing table to remove OFFICE.TYMNET
which used to be there because recently there has been some mail that
was looping between Office-1 and F29 as follows:
	F29 saw it was to Office-1.Tymnet and delivered it to Office-1.
	Office-1 saw it was to Tynnet and delivered it to F29.
	etc.
Perhaps this used to work because Office-1 might have known about Office.Tymnet
and treated it specially.  This is probably not a good idea though.

On the PROFS side, if you put the whole WBD.MDC@Office-1.ARPA after the
asteric (*) in your nickname file, I think it will get truncated after
about 16 characters which would leave WBD.MDC@Office-1 which would be
interpreted as ...Office-1.Tymnet since Tymnet is the assumed default
unless otherwise specified.

If SMTP were changed on Office-1 to accept Office-1.Tymnet as its own name
then I can put OFFICE back in the routing table and we can go back to
the old way.  Its not real clean, though, kind of a kludge having two
names for one host.

Bill,
  I started to make a list of things to augment the current SETOP database
as per our meeting and it seems that we can get similar results (as seen in
the detailed plan) by using your suggested text-file format with some minor
additions.

1.  Keep the OPER password file info the same.
    Make a text file that corresponds to the password file containing the
    information to re-create the password file plus the following:
    a. Employee Number
    b. Employee Name
    c. Username (followed by optional additional legal usernames)
    d. Security mail address (TUMS or ONTYME)
    e. Entry date (creation of record)
    f. Employee Change date;Employee Change author

       G;license-names;OPERNAME;date-granted;start-date;stop-date
       R;license-names;OPERNAME;date-granted;start-date;stop-date

The "G" or "R" determines whether the record is a license granted to
someone else or to this opername.  OPERNAME refers to the grantor or the
grantee.  Date-granted is when the change was put into effect and is the
default value for start-date.   Both start-date and stop-date are optional
and if missing default to date-granted and forever.

This capability to generate license values from granted license gives us
the technical structure we want.  Only SETOP cares about the managerial
structure, so it should make no difference at all if different users have
capabilities that their managers don't have (in the password file).  And
the new SETOP would do everything with the text file (locking the entire
file just as it is done now).

What about Phone numbers?  Do we want them for the records with requests
to update them periodically when people change departments?


comments?

/carl

The last question I have is... do we start with one super user that grants
license to some special people and then we propagate this by saying that
licenses are granted by the current managers???   Or do we say, noone has
any license and start acceptng applications for licenses?

The structure works fine once it is in place... but the initial placement
still needs to be ironed out.  I can have somehting together that reads
the format I've prescribed and manipulates the records in memory within
2 man weeks... but how are we going to implement it?

Another possible idea is to accept applications and build the new password
and data file strictly by application and when the cut-over date occurrs,
no-one except those that have applied and have added their own sub-accounts
will exist in the new system.  This would install users and let them run
the new SETOP / OPPS, although it wouldn't take effect until Sept 1, or some
other date.  (I prefer 1,DEC or 1,JAN since it would mean everyone would
be moved into new quarters and we'd get NEW phone or location numbers).

i'm building a common /usr/lib/aliases for all the unix machines,
this has entries to forward everyones mail to their home machines.
this gets read before .forward.  when sendmail attempts to deliver

Bill, we discussed this before but it wouldn't hurt to ask again -
what is the final verdict on ipcfSend(). Can it be called at interrupt
level? Or it is not recommended? Generally I won't try to send any
substantial mess. at the interrupt level, but there is one/two cases
of real simple and short msg.. But I wouldn't do it unless you tell
me it is 100% safe. Mike J.

Would you like to get fancy?  In addition to the entries in /usr/lib/aliases
which you are planning, have one for every NTD employee of the form
	firstInitial.lastName
and then forward to the PDP-10 or Ontyme if they're not a Unix user yet.
BuBubbnet operations could maintain the data base.  -Bill

Well, my answer is still a non-answer.  It can be made to work if you
have to do it, but I'd rather not unless you need it.  So - its up to you.
I think it would be preferable to call ipcfSend() always from background.

that sounds like a good idea, but it probably won't happen until all
of our machines are running yellow pages so the list can be kept
in a central place.  we could even get fancier yet, using other

Hello Folks,

The LOGII GED has been updated to include the following items:

- An X.409 tutorial appendix has been included.

- All X.409 elements have been defined as IMPLICIT (except for the
  highest level elements).

- Certain paragraphs have been clarified.

- The ECRI codes have been updated.

- The RCRM/RCRI codes have been updated.

- A new ISIS message format is implemented.

- A new mechanism is provided to allow large messages to be
  split over several data transfers.

- Two new messages have been seperated from the RCRI message wherein
  they existed as submessages.  The two new messages are ASLP -
  Assign Logon Port (analogous to the pseudo-needle), and LGSC - Logon
  Success Indication.

- The ISN has been re-arranged to provide easy access to Dispatcher
  pertinent fields.

The Document has been updated on DNDSPEC.

Thanks....Omar

TO ALL TYMIX USERS

The 780 VAX system currently used for TYMIX will be converted to a VMS
system in approximately 30 days (mid July).  It will be necessary for
any of the present valid users of TYMIX who still require a unix system to 
be revalidated on one of the SUN servers.  Some of the users have already
been validated, and merely need to move any of their files that they wish
to keep from TYMIX to an alternate system.  To make this more interesting,
I will be on vacation from June 29 til July 13, and would like to have all
the validations completed before that time.  The sooner I know who all will
require new validations and where, the sooner they can be done.  Please let
me know either by electronic mail or interoffice mail all your specific 
validation information, hopefully during the next week.

Thank-you

Bill,

The source for malloc should be in eunix:/usr/mcc68k/src.orig
This directory contains "original" (unmodified) libraries as originally
distributed to us by Microtec last year (bugs, non-re-entrancy and all).
We modified some routines and fixed others, which may be found in
src.rel. Feel free to poke around and find what you need.

Regards,

John

As per our call - malloc() source.  Of course free() needs to be reentrant
as well - its probably in the same directory, if not the same file.  -Bill

The errors from ipcfSend() are of type enum RodneyError which is
defined in the appendix or in file ~wrs/red/error.mm - there are
likely to be more codes as the code is written.  -Bill

I received a telephone call from Charles Cassmeyer, McAir Director Program
Development - Special Projects.  A Mr. Al Wehmeir(?) is establishing the
E-Mail system at Wright Patterson for the program office for the National
Aerospace Plane project.  Last summer, I experimentally exchanged messages
with a Lt. Augustine there.  The objective was that MCAIR people could
continue to use PROFS, but exchange messages with the program office which has
an E-Mail system on DDN.  Mr. Cassmeyer asked if I could call Wehmeir to see
if what Augustine and I had worked out was proper.

I have talked to Wehmeir.  The addressing makes sense to him.  We will
exchange test messages.  I will confirm results with Cassmeyer.  I gave him
Bill Soley's number also.

Since my interconnection project was cancelled, I have no plans to go beyond
this involvement.  If any substantial involvement on anyone's part appears
required to make this successful, I will bring it to your attention.

"oversights".  These are:

Both the Interpreter and Translated code require several 68K instructions
to implement an Engine Instruction.  However, Engine code assumes "atomicity"
such that each instruction will complete before an interrupt (such as
timeout) can occur.  What provision is made to provide this atomicity
to insure such products work correctly?  (One possibility is to "trap"
to special code in such products upon timeout and trust them to exit to
ISIS as soon as atomicity is satisfied.)

The interpreter needs to be explicitly rentrant, to permit concurrent
operation of both Background and Foreground code.

Also, "?stat" must be handled uniquely for interpreted code, again to
permit reentrancy and concurrent operation.

Space for stacks should be seperately protectable, to prevent recursive
subroutine linkage to climb through designated memory unchecked (i.e.,
such storage should be assigned independent of "sections", either for a
specified or a default size; the stack must be known before ISIS can
transfer control to the slot).

Initializing the MMU is expected to be a relatively infrequent operation
(as opposed to switching context), and thus can affort to have additional
processing associated with it.  In particular, the addition of additional
"sections/segments" could benefit from:  1.  identification of "overlays"
(multiple references to the same page), and 2.  identification of contiguous
areas and consolidating them into a single area.  This is especially
important for the dispatcher, which may have occasion to reference a half-
dozen distinct areas for each slot, but which the slot is likely to
allocate in a contiguous fashion (e.g., IRING and ORING can be anywhere,
but are likely to be contiguous;  similarly with the Permuter, port, and
host tables).

Some applications (e.g., Node code) make explicit use of the "Local Clock"
for diagnostic and scheduling purposes...eliminate them (p.22) with due
regard for possible consequences!

I am opposed to argument-passing via registers in Traps;  this implementation
has given us enough problems on the Engine in the past.  I would rather
see a pointer to a request-descriptor placed on the stack, arguments
returned in the descriptor, and registers preserved (a la MTOS).  While
this does incur overhead in relocating such pointers, it results in a
much cleaner interface, and is (potentially) invokable directly from C.

Section 2.4.1:  Since these are significantly different from the faults
which occur in the Engine, it would be desirable to corrolate these fault-
conditions with the fault error-codes which a slot would see resulting from
"FAIL" (i.e., ISIS Restart-SVC specifies a number of codes, such as "parity-
error";  which of these faults produce that code?).

The retention of 3 (6!) processes (Background, Foreground, "DDT") is necessary
for backward-compatability;  is "3" a dsirable limit for the future?  I can
envision significant impact on product design if this limit could someday
be removed, and a slot could be defined in terms of several co-tasks.

Section 4.4:  Elimination of T-II Special SVC's means a MAJOR REDESIGN of
Node Code in order to continue support of Sync-lines!  Perhaps an interim
support of this capability is possible, until the node-code can be redesigned,
is possible.  The alternatives are either: 1.  No Sync-lines for Node Code,
(EVER!!) or 2.  significant possibility that initial Skywalker will not support
Sync lines.

Section 9:  Note that a Backup processor could profitably run the Dispatcher
if Option 3 (Section 5.3) were implemented.

Section 8.1.2:  The LUDEF macro should be expanded.  In particular, SYNC,
SIO, and ASYNC currently specify both the Port protocol ("driver") and
ISIS ("control") protocol used.  Future IOC's may have a variety of "Drivers"
as well "control-Protocols", and this should be taken into account now
(e.g., Input-rings might be one alternative, and another might be input-
CCW programs, so that processes need no longer copy packets from rings
before the ring overruns -- instead merely need refresh CCW lists).
Thus permitting the specification of both driver and control protocols
is a reasonable extension to introduce now...the macro can be made to
default to reasonable values for the current usage.  Also, the use of
absolute port-numbers, without regard to the IOC used, is likely to
introduce a real nightmare for future reconfigurations of a Cage (consider
the possible errors in a reconfiguration which removes IOC3 [of 8] with
the need to reassign ALL port-numbers beyond the ones [4? 8? etc] removed);
a much better strategy is to use some form of port-naming convention
which includes the actual identification of the port used.  Such a
convention would also ease maintenance and accounting, since everyone
could refer to the port with the same "name".

Same Section:  Has any consideration been given to shared resources
(e.g., Memory, Devices [Mag tape or other, for backward compatability],
and even possibly Files)?  All of these are likely extensions required
for applications which are explicitly designed for multi-processor usage
in order to achieve the processing capability required.

Again:  Is it possible for individual slots to be backed-up, or is it
necessary to backup an entire processor?  (i.e., with limited number of
back-up processors, it may be deemed desirable that some slots become
"sacrificial" to insure that slots of higher standing will be insured
of a backup processor to run upon, while designating them to independent
primary processors to provide load-leveling under normal circumstances.)

Lastly:  How are Interpreted and Translated slots distinguished from
Native slots;  how might stack requirements (so the slot cound begin
execution) be defined?

ALFRED:  Since ALFRED receives commands from a variety of sources, the
provision of an additional alternative source -- the disk -- would
permit the concept of command-"scripts".  Such scripts would permit
the development of complex operations from a series of primatives without
the development overhead of coding such "commands".  Future growth in
this area is likely to be in the direction of a command-"shell", and
scripts would be a primative beginning.  Allowance should certainly be
made for the possibility, even if implementation does not occur in the
first release.

First the bad news, the V40 is now $20.95 in 100s (next break @ 1k
price to be quoted) and delivery is two (2) weeks.

Good news, the filters are $2.17 in 100s and $1.86 in 1000s, in
stock at Wyle.

Net result is, add $6.00 for the V40 and subtract $42.24 for the
filters.  There is a filter that is $0.22 cheaper, but nobody
has it.  So the price is trimmed another $36.00.

Subject: system 39 disk space 

I have deleted all but todays accounting files from system 39 in order to free
up some disk space.  The system did not even have enough to allow people to log
in tomorrow morning, much less do anything constructive.  It is critical that
we get more packs added in order to continue running.  The need arises from
users moving their files from 36.

The accounting files are probably not
needed, but if so they can be restored
from tape after a couple packs are
added.  The files are (BILLING10)*.SAT.

This measure is desperate and temporary
and will hold us for a few days at best.

-if rodney comes out well, you can rename it RADney

-if rodney receives a trap from a trapper that is not in sup mode, then
 you will reject it, yes? add this to your error code list
-mmu init was mentioned.  please give what that init will be! details...
 without a bunch of CCITT/ISO/OSI terms..."the CCITT standard
 for PMMU initialization says that..." yuck
-diagram on page 3: you don't want to show the patron as one of
 the entities is Skywalker?
-IOC references should be IOCP
-ISIS references should be ISIS-68K.  Alfred is called Alfred-68K
 for native code and Alfred-E for the Engine Alfred.
-Agent definition is so general that it includes a WIRE as a possible
 implementation...give examples with all definitions.
-mailbox reference on 2nd paragraph on page 16 should be doorbell?
-struct 'variable' length in fig 5 page 17 - what if this
 was of odd length? it should NEVER be.  probably C will make sure
 structs are on word boundaries.  is 16 bit alignment ok?
 in any case, you should state the even-boundary req for structs.
-heap is refences several places, including page 23 1st paragraph.
 but not defined.  what is it, why is it needed.
-page 24: symtab has 2 * preceding it, you wnat only 1 i assume
-do you want a GLOB indicator that says the patron kind?
 'ISIS-type' versus 'UNIX-type' indictor? might simplify
 parsing different product codes? perhaps not.  maybe ignore this one.
-last line page 24 'glob' is not caps or bold; shouldn't it be bold?
-define opaque.
-add an index
-you glossary is way to brief.  beef it up.  'wheres the beef'
-page 25 footnote: missing word 'a' after 'not'
page 26: 'Rodney searches the local card first followed by other
 cards' to find a symbol.  how do you search other cards? broadcast
 message? this is a parrallel search then, and more than 1 could
 respond.  what if they have different attributes of the symbol?
 e.g. what if they show different symtype for the symbol? how do
 you arbitrate? you can just say, 'we take the first response' but 
 you still have to worry how you tell the other guy to fix his
 symbol.
-TSAP on page 28 end of 3.3 is a forward reference
-ARe symbols case-sensitive?  i think so.  please state.
-top of pgae 28 fig 11 - word parameters should not be plural 
 since only 1 parameter within each box
-1st line section 3.4: rodney does not avoid compute intensive tasks
 as the sentence states; it avoids PROCESSING them at interrupt level.
-add summary table for the different RSI in the appendix
-several places 1K is mentioned, e.g. for log file buffer and for
 ipcf messgae buffers.  are you aware that we will propose
 a 4K page size? it will be variable in isis only through 
 recompilation
-regarding RSI_ALLOC, perhaps you also want an RSI_DEALLOC
 routine.  this would ocmplete the dynamic memory interface between
 rodney and an application...even if it were not specifcially
 used in the beginning it would be nice if the routine was there.
-section 3.6.2 2 kinds of log message are mentioned:
 'warning' and 'advisory'.  warning is one of the 8 types defined,
 advisory is NOT.  what does advisory mean here.
-section 3.6.1 you say the patron can read the UTC value directly.
 this is a possible concurrency problem, isn't it, if it
 is 1/2 read and rodney interrupts to update it?
 at least give a warning in the text.  most programmers will not
 think of concurrency stuff unless forced to do so.
-do you log that a boot was started?
-if you halt a card, do you write out its log buffer to the disk?
 it does not say so under boot management.
-page 32 rkBoot routine - no level of authority to do this?
 no cross-checks?
-page 36 1st sentence - 2nd paragraph - misleading.
 says that VMEbus overloads are prevented by sending unending log messgaes!
-define octet on its first use.
-in logs, page 38, if someone logs a panic-level
 log messgae (SLG_EMERG) then you should also automatically
 in rodney send it to the network log!
-page 42: debugger as file servor - this could also be PC hard
 disk receiving log messages, yes?
-page 46a - confession: if the patron updates crashCount and
 crashCode, you hvae a possible concurrency problem; the patron
 may be 1/2 done with updateing when rodney interrupts and does his
 thing to, say, convict this guy.  you could have 1 of the
 fields garbage.  2nd possibility is that the 2 fields are both ok
 but do not match each other.  3rd possibility is that they are
 both written by the patron, then both by rodney; that is ok
 but any log message the patron wrote now does not match
 the real crash reason that rodney wrote.  this 3rd case
 the least important, there may be other log message that
 clarify what occurred.  but the 2st two should be dealt with.

 in general, i don't think you should have the patron update
 the glob.  if you are goign to allow it, then have a very
 clear message of the danger.
-glob: it rodneys memory, yes? which is a different addrss
 space. how does the patron read it.  through a TRAP #RODNEY?
 in which case you can control that no udpates to glob are allowed.
-page 47 1st paragraph - you hve fancy terms like TSAP.  pls
 give your CCITT reference .
-Tymnet in page 48 footnote - all caps
-what did you thinki of the idea to call magic 'public key' ?
-page 54 2nd paragraph - effectively a repeat of the 1st paragraph
 after fig 27 on pgae 53
-pgae 58, and other places similra: in section 5.1
 you give a bunch of new terms, bulleted, without definition!
 'the follwoing terms adefined in the OSI...' sounds good
 but give us the definitions too
-page 67 - the TERROR thing could be where you slip in DANGER
-to my simple minded brain, the multiple TPDU messgaes on pages 
 70 and forwrad could be a single message, with a messge type
 field and a coulpe of variable fields.
-in a TPDU message thereare 2 fields once caleld magic
 and it is follwed by one called key.  if you renamed 'key' to
 'johnson' then you have the pair 'magic johnson' ha ah

push the red reset button on the Compupro

That should result in a little floopy

          contained in your schedules.  I  would  like  to  request  you to
          review  the  information  and  provide  me  with  any  updates or
          corrections at our Friday meeting.

Hi! Bill,

Welcome back - hope the vacation was just great.
Wanted you to know that your assistance has been commissioned for the
work currently in progress to answer the AUSTPAC RFP.
Left some reading material in your mailbox - so happy reading!
(by the way, Skywalker has been allowed to slip, courtesy of the
AUSTPAC work, a month)

SUBJECT:   AUSTPAC Weekly Status Meeting            TIME: 9:30 AM
_________________________________________________________________  


ATTENDEES: Rude,   Coreson,  Lam,  Raffo,  Jones,  Chard,  Bliss, 
           Stimac, Tan, Holcomb, Lampman, Gardina

(1)  Cost code for the project is 95266.
                                        
(2)  Primary phone is 7083; secondary is 7184.

(3)  A  request for a 45-day extension has been made to  TELECOM. 
     We hope to hear from them this week.

(4)  Daniel  Beysson  will  be available  for  an  early  morning 
     conference  call.   UPDATE:   Daniel arrives Monday evening, 
     5/18/87.  Daniel  is the MDISI employee who has worked  with 
     SESA equipment with AUSTPAC. 

(5)  Terry  requested  an on-time breakdown of who is working  on 
     specific tasks in each section.

(6)  Terry  reminded  the  team  that  copies  of  documents  are 
     available in the project office for anyone who needs a copy.

ISSUES DISCUSSED:   

(1)  Lam was concerned about what SKYWALKER really looks like, in 
     regard  to  chassis  being  treated  as  a  node.    Holcomb 
     suggested Lam use the Televerket Transit Proposal  estimates 
     for  dealing  with  the  concept of a  number  of  SKYWALKER 
     systems being used as a single node.  The time frames are in 
     the Televerket document for when we plan to deliver to  them 
     someway to interconnect the chasses so that they look like a 
     single node operating across multiple footprints.

(2)  Gary  mentioned the only written input we have  received  so 
     far is a well written document from Hardware.   The draft of 
     how  we would like the responses to come in was brought  up, 
     specifically a listing that states what the section is,  the 
     team member or members, the theme of the section, evaluation 
     criteria  emphasis,  and the key concepts.   If reference is 
     made  to  any  documents  it  was  requested  that  they  be 
     included.

OTHER ISSUES:                                                     
                     
There  was  discussion  on how to  respond  to  compliance.   The 
following are the results of that discussion:

     Fully Comply     - Something we have today.                  
     Will Comply      - Something scheduled.                      
     Can Comply       - What we are willing to do.
     Alternate Comply - See Sec. 1.7.5.
     May Comply       - See Sec. 1.7.5.  
     Cannot Comply    - See Sec. 1.7.5.

For purposes of response to AUSTPAC specific items,  the earliest 
development could start is January 1,  1988, unless the item is a 
currently approved project.

Question:  What phase of SKYWALKER are we proposing?             
                                                    
Answer:    Not Phase I, but some subset of other phases.

Question:  How  do  we attach one SKYWALKER footprint to  another 
           without  consuming all the  ports?                     
 
Answer:    To  be  developed  by NTD.   A reference was  made  by 
           CATSCO  who,  we believe,  has a product to meet  this 
           requirement.

Ken Holcomb mentioned to Tom Chard that Tom doesn't need to worry 
about  cable  breakout   in  the  response  to  Sec.  5.6.3  with 
SKYWALKER boiler plate.

MEETINGS:  10:00 AM, Tuesday, Bldg. G.

           Daniel  Beysson will give a presentation on  SESA  and 
           AUSTPAC.   At  a  minimum,  all people on the  Network 
           design group should attend.  Everyone should attend!

I have compiled a list of what I believe are the section assignments
for the AUSTPAC tender.  This file was created from the responses I
received from individulas and the April 21 and April 23 memos from
Betty Jo Chang.  Please take time to review this document to insure
its accuracy.  If, after your review, you find any errors, additions
or omissions, please let me know as soon as you can.

==========================================================================
I have compiled a list of what I believe are the section assignments
for the AUSTPAC tender.  This file was created from the responses I
received from individulas and the April 21 and April 23 memos from
Betty Jo Chang.  Please take time to review this document to insure
its accuracy.  If, after your review, you find any errors, additions
or omissions, please let me know as soon as you can.

Thanks

        Subject: Skywalker-X for AUSTPAC
        --------------------------------------------------------------
        
                As I mentioned in the last AUSTPAC meeting,  the  port 
   capacity  of Skywalker Rel 1 cannot meet the requirement of AUSTPAC 
   even at the NET 1 stage.  Basically the 64 port  per  chassis  with 
   the  chassis not tied in together as a single node creates too many 
   nodes in  a  site.  Interconnecting  these  nodes  at  the  fashion 
   suggested by Australia Telecom is almost next to impossible.  

                Therefore,   I   propose   as  follows  a  version  of 
   Skywalker-X , to be released in three stages ,  where the equipment 
   are  expandable  in  a  modular  fashion  to meet this RFP.  Please 
   examine these requirements and  let  me  know  ASAP  if  we  should 
   proceed our network design based on this Skywalker-X products.  

                Our preliminary strategy for network design is: 

                -  A  "split" network where the new generation part of 
                   the network and the existing DPS25 Model 1  network 
                   are interconnected by X.75 trunks.  

                - "Basic" transit network, with seperate Terminal and 
                   Transit nodes.  

                Therefore,    I   have   seperated   the   Skywalker-X 
   requirements  into  "Terminal"  and  "Transit" switch requirements.  
   Note that the HW need  not  be  different  for  the  two,  but  the 
   performance/throughtput  are  different  due  to  their distinctive 
   functionalities.  


        Terminal Switch                         Transit Switch
        ---------------                         --------------


   NET 1:  256 ports / node,                  128 ports / node,
           with at least 24 @ 48KBPS,         with at least 48 @ 48kbps,
           3,000 X.25 dpps in and out         7,000 X.25 dpps in and out


   NET 2:  512 ports / node,                 256 ports / node,
           with at least 48 @ 48kbps         with at least 96 @ 48kbps 
           7,000 X.25 dpps in and out        or 16 @ 256 kbps, (see note 5)
                                             13,000 X.25 dpps in and out

   NET 3:  1024 ports / node,                256 ports / node,
           with at least 96 @ 48kbps         with at least 128 @ 48 kbps 
           10,000 dpps X.25 dpps in and out  or 24 @ 256 kbps, (see note 5)
                                             20,000 dpps in and out


   -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Notes:  (1) AUSTPAC is an X.25 network,  with X.3 and X.28 PAD 
                   for Async.  

               (2) dpps are data packet/sec , 128 bytes, X.25

               (3) Specifed port rate (i.e.,  96 @ 48 kbps)  for  both 
                   Terminal  and  Transit switches must be able to run 
                   at 75% utilization full duplex under Busy Hour, 
                   with Tymnet protocol (i.e, node code, etc.) 

               (3)  Un-specified port rate (i.e,  remianing ports) for 
                   Terminal switch should able to run either 1.2  kbps 
                   Async  (X.3 and X.28) or 9.6 kbps Sync (X.25).  The 
                   actual ratio is about 30% 1.2kbps Async to 70%  9.6 
                   kbps Sync by port count.  

               (4) Un-specified port rate for Transit switch should be 
                   able  to  run  48kbps  Sync  (X.25)  at   a   lower 
                   utilization than 75%.  

               (5)  256  kbps  links  are desirable,  not necessary to 
                   have.  If 256 kbps is not available even in NET  3, 
                   the network can still be designed with only 48 kbps 
                   trunks.

Subject: Questions for AUSTPAC 

Terry,

Gazel did not find the EPSN 76 - AUSTPAC Numbering Plan document in
Euske's files.  Apparently, we do not have a copy.  Could you somehow
get a copy pronto from Australia?

I am working on section 5.6.6 and I have a couple of questions either
for Daniel or Australia:
1. Section 5.6.6.1.11 and 12 talks about TNICs.  How are TNICs used?
What is meant by "insertion...on a per link basis", eg. what do we insert
and when?  Are TNICs similar to DNICs of transit networks?  Are TNICs to
be used for call establishment between the old and new networks?  How can
we accumulate more than one TNIC, and how is this information passed?
2. Section 5.6.6.1.16 and 17 talks about address-handling options.  Can we
get a complete list of these options?  In section 16 (i), the implication
is that we need to support random "insertion, deletion, and replacement
of address fields"...can we get clarification on what exactly we need to
support?  In section 17 (vi), I need clarification on what is meant by
port (origination or destination) when supporting transit barring on
a per port basis?  (This should be at a X.75 interface where calls come
and go thru ports that may be randomly selected!?)

Thanks.

ATTENDEES: Maury,   Lam,   Corenson,  Ernst,  Tan,  Jones,  Gair, 
           Whitlock, Bliss, Budar, Beysson, Lampman

(1)  Daniel  will be here the rest of today and tomorrow,  so  if 
     you  need to know anything about the existing SESA equipment 
     or  something about AUSTPAC,  or if you have any  questions, 
     you can call him at 7083 or 7148 in our area.

(2)  Ron  and I gave AUSTPAC a call last night to ask them a  few 
     questions  that  have come up over the last couple of  days.  
     They  informed me that Section 5.5,  which deals with  ISDN, 
     will be going from category A to mandatory.   It's going  to 
     go  from  CS7  to Q931 which is  LAPD.    They're  doing  an 
     extension for 30 days.   They told me it is very firm and we 
     will  be  receiving an announcement shortly.   I'm going  to 
     have Ron talk about Q931 and what that means.

(3)  We  also  called Catsco,  the company we're looking  at  for 
     doing offset for us in Australia.   They have a product that 
     may be of great service to us in this area.           

ISSUES DISCUSSED: 

(1)  Ron  Whitlock  gave  a  quick overview  of  what  this  ISDN 
     equipment consists of.   Q931 ===> LAPD.  The ISDN interface 
     is involving an out-of-band signalling system which means to 
     our network we have to take that routing information and put 
     it into a special channel and that's called a D Channel.  It 
     comes under the ISDN Q931.
         
     I  am  not sure whether the G703 interface is  going  to  be 
     implicit in the re-written Section 5.5.   We currently  have 
     been looking at the hardware design functions.   As such  we 
     can't say we have a firm design in hand.

                       G.703  =  30B+D interface
                                 64 KBPS

     The  product from Catsco is a fast circuit switch.   It  can 
     make  and tear down connections at the rate of 30  MEG.   It 
     has up to 64 multiplex ports.   With that design it would be 
     possible  to  take several SKYWALKER chassis and bring  them 
     out to the  crosspoint switch.  We could also bring the G703 
     interface   into  this  wide  band  switch  and   take   the 
     information  that  comes in off the channels and  distribute 
     them among several processors conceptually.  That's about as 
     far as we are at this point.  It appears that Catsco already 
     has  such  a product operational on  the  customer  location 
     which I believe is in Sunnyvale.
               
(2)  Erickson has been chosen by TELECOM to supply ISDN.               
                            
(3)  Section  5.5 is now assigned to Marketing and NTD  Hardware.  
     We need to pull Software into this section.

     ====> ACTION: Terry Lampman to request Software assistance,
                   possibly Dennis Ernst.    

(4)  Configurations.    Cynthia  has been assigned to Chung  Lam.  
     We  now have the capability of taking the data which  is  in 
     the tender and putting it in the spreadsheets,  which is the 
     information necessary to input to configurator.
                        
     Network  design  approach.   It  will  be  a  basic  transit 
     network.  Two level hierarchy.  X.75 approach.  We are going 
     to have our equipment probably side by side with SESA.

     ====> ACTION:   Thursday,  May 21,  at 3:00 PM,  the Network 
                     Design  Group  will meet to discuss  design:   
                     whether the network will be a transit switch 
                     or mixed approach.

(5)  There  has been no response from NTD in regard to the  Chung 
     Lam  Ontyme  #M92769  dealing with port sizing  and  thruput 
     requirements of SKYWALKER.

     The Network Design Group will proceed as if the response  is 
     "yes." 

(6)  Network management needs configuration information.  

     Brant  Corenson brought up that Austpac has three hosts  for 
     network management:

     1)  Network service host.
     2)  Customer  services  database  that  Austpac  will   be 
         developing.
     3)  Subscriber database.

ACTION ITEMS:                                  

(1)  Ask TELECOM if bandwidth cost is an issue.    

         ====> Requestor:    Chung Lam.                                   
         ====> Responsible:  Terry Lampman.                                



                                                                       
(2)  Provide information on offsets.                                        
                             
         ====> Requestor:    Dave Bliss.
         ====> Responsible:  Terry Lampman.                       
         *Provided 5/21/87.

QUESTIONS:

Q =  How do we handle the intensity of the packets/sec. necessary 
     for G703?

A =  This should not be a problem in SKYWALKER.                        

Q =  How do we handle charging between networks?                       

A =  This is part of X.75 function.                                
              
Q =  Will Network Design look at all offered configurations?

A =  Yes, and details of each will be provided.                   
                                                        
Q =  Are we proposing SKYWALKER sups?
                             
A =  Not for Phase 1, but sometime near end of Phase 2.

==========================================================================
I spoke with the Telecom Commercial Supply Division (Mr. Woolmore) today
in regard to an extension.  He informed me that an extension has been
granted.  This was not as a direct result of our formal request, but
due to section 5.5 being rewritten.  The extended due date is now 
July 21, 1987 at 2:00 PM.  This additional time will allow us to compose
a proposal second to none.  We still have a considerable amount of work
to do in the time remaining, so keep up the good work and lets get it
done.


Thanks

DATE:      May 27, 1987                          LOCATION: BLDG G

SUBJECT:   AUSTPAC Weekly Status Meeting            TIME: 9:30 AM
_________________________________________________________________  


ATTENDEES: Corenson,  Tan, Maury, Gair, Ernst, Lam, Budar, Bliss, 
           Whitlock, Stimac, Stern, Lampman

(1)  Austpac  has  granted  an extension  to  21  July,  2:00  PM 
     Australia time,  which is the 20th our time.  As a result of 
     that  we  are  looking to receive  responses   on  different 
     sections  by June 15.   That gives two weeks longer than the 
     original  plan.   Please send them to Terry  Lampman,  10161 
     Bubb Road,  Building G.   If you have questions,  call Terry 
     Lampman at 7083.

(2)  Gary  Gardina is in Australia working with Baker & McKinsey, 
     the law firm.   They're supposed to have the legals done  on 
     it  by  June 15.   He's also working with  Price  Waterhouse 
     putting together an offset plan.

(3)  A  couple  of things of interest.   I talked to Telecom  and 
     they don't really care about the line costs at all.   That's 
     not  going  to  be  a consideration  or  constraint  in  the 
     designing of the network.        

(4)  In  the Network Design meeting last week we touched upon  an 
     interesting way of interconnecting the networks,  which  was 
     to  develop an extension cord service for the SESA multiline 
     protocol.   This  means the existing network can be accessed 
     on   the Tymnet network.   Dennis was going to discuss  this 
     development  with  Mike Rude to get approval in  theory  for 
     development,  estimated  2 to 4  man-months.   According  to 
     Dennis  Ernst,  it's  a go.   This effort will  require  the 
     submission  of  a  PIR for formal estimate  and  acceptance.  
     This means that the existing network trunks (on SESA) can be 
     converted  to Tymnet equipment.   This would  allow  Austpac 
     access  to  the  existing  (old net)  network  control  thru 
     Tymnet.  In future phases the local mesh links could also be
     converted  to  Tymnet.   This provides a very clean  network 
     migration  from SESA equipment to Tymnet.   This also  means 
     that  SESA  will  not  have  an  advantage  over  Tymnet  on 
     evaluation of the proposal.
     
ISSUES DISCUSSED:

As  a result of #(4) above,  a discussion was had with concern to 
the following topics:

     a) Network accounting/charging
     b) Network control            


-    What  would happen if an extention cord link/slot,  or  X.75 
     link/slot  failed?   What  type of alarms  and  notification 
     would be passed to Network Control?

     It was pointed out that there would be several of both  type 
     connections   per  site  and  that the  likelihood  of   all 
     connections being out would be virtually impossible.
      
-    Our  existing monitors would report all anomalies on the new 
     network.  It would be necessary to have each line associated 
     with a host number however.   TMCS would show the status  of 
     these hosts.  Extended DDT routines would provide additional 
     detail on an as needed basis.

     Their  existing network would show these problems from  that 
     network's monitor and control system.   If a virtual circuit 
     went  out,  their  existing network would  inform  them  and 
     further diagnosis would be performed on both networks.

     It  was  agreed  that  Austpac is  willing  to  run  network 
     monitoring and control on both networks.

-    Loop  Back.   It  was unclear as to what sort of  loop  back 
     capabilities  they  have today,  manual or  remote.   It  is 
     assumed to be manual.

-    It  was  agreed that we would prefer to have Tymnet  network 
     management to be the controlling factor.

-    Accounting  information  will be collected on the  extention      
     cord  slots.   Statistical information can be gathered  from 
     RAM data.

-    Traffic  that  goes thru the  extention  cord  service,  for 
     billing  purposes,  will be done on the old network as it is 
     done  today.   Austpac  would  be able to  compare  the  old 
     network's traffic to our RAM data for a check and balance.

QUESTIONS:  

Q =  Can the extention cord links be 48K?

A =  Yes.

Q =  Would we allow people to connect directly to our nodes?

A =  Yes.

OTHER ITEMS:

-    Offsets.  Receipt of an offsets letter from Price Waterhouse 
     was  acknowledged.   It  is  still unclear how  offsets  are 
     calculated.

     What  is  the  difference  between  offsets  and   Austalian 
     content?

     Offsets  =  30% of the contract value.   That number is  the 
     value used in regard to development and technology  transfer 
     that  a company is obligated to provide in  Australia.   The 
     highest  value program is exporting technology that has been 
     transferred.

     Australian  content = the portion of the equipment  that  is 
     made in Australia.
           
     Gazel  Tan  offered the services of Richard Dawson  to  work 
     with ISDN section.
     *Richard has been assigned. 

-    Several issues came up in regard to Skywalker.
     *  Lack of resources
     *  G703/ISDN
     *  Port density
     *  Shelf interconnect within a footprint
     *  Interconnect between footprints
     *  How do we migrate from Phase 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and so on?
     *  Funding for other than Skywalker 1 not approved.

     Because of the length of time necessary to discuss the above 
     issues,  a separate meeting was called for on Thursday,  the 
     28th, at 8:30 AM.

     **UPDATE:  A  group was set up as a result of  the  Thursday 
                meeting  that  consists  of  Ron  Whitlock,  Dave 
                Bliss,  Dennis Ernst and Dick Rawson.  This group 
                is  to study ideas presented in that meeting  and 
                present their findings in one week's time.

-    Network Management.  

     A group meeting was set up for Thursday,  the 28th,  at 3:30 
     PM  to  discuss  Network  Management  and  CMF.   The  group 
     consisted  of Brant Corenson,  Michael Stimac,  Les Seltzer, 
     Jeff Stern, Ken Jones, Jerry Messina and Terry Lampman.

     There is a need for immediate funding in this area to  start 
     development  now so that we can respond to the proposal in a 
     manner  in which to get the business.   If we wait to  begin 
     development until we win the contract,  we will not be  able 
     to meet the delivery date.

     *Ken  Jones and Brant Corenson are to perform an analysis on 
     resource estimates so a dollar figure can be placed on  what 
     is  necessary  to  bid this proposal in a  positive  manner.  
     MDISI  is to present this figure to ISG to get a  commitment 
     to finance the development.

Bill,

The source for malloc should be in eunix:/usr/mcc68k/src.orig
This directory contains "original" (unmodified) libraries as originally
distributed to us by Microtec last year (bugs, non-re-entrancy and all).
We modified some routines and fixed others, which may be found in
src.rel. Feel free to poke around and find what you need.

Regards,

John

Sorry to hear that.  Hope you can get well soon.
I was not sure if you want me to do the Rodney and IPCF simulation.
If yes, then I can start working on the Rodney system calls and IPCF
messages first.

Yes, if everything else is done, go ahead and start on Rodney simulator.  I
am going to be working on an appendix to describe the scheduler facility so
that may help.  You can just take that code and put it in the simulator if it
appears to be helpful at some point.  We can keep in touch through mail until
things get better.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: question 

I heard you were here yesterday, I hope you feel better now.
Here are 2 questions that I'd like to ask you:
1. If the RSI_IPCF_IN interrupt routine returns an IPCF_PROGRESS_DONE
   progress code.  Does that mean no further ipcfDone() will be issued
   by the recipient?  If yes, then what kind of response the Rodney
   needs to generate?  (simplely return the original ipcf message ptr
   with isDone bit set?)

2. When Rodney receives an ipcf message, if he finds that both the
   RSI_IPCF_IN is enabled and the function (passed to Rodney at
   ipcfAssign) is set.  What should he do?

thanks for informing me about error codes.
It would be very nice if you could come up with another function
to cancel utcInterval which is pending. I could have a use for it.

utcInterval is a high priority interrupt that is designed to be very fast
and therefore lacks some functionality.  It is also discouraged to use it
in instances where k_wait and k_alarm could be used.  I think you'll actually
find these more convenient, anyway.  Let me know if you want a quick
tutorial on their use and the philosophy behind their existance.  -Bill

Oh yes, I would be gratefull for a tutorial on k_wait/alarm/cancel.
utcInterval looked a bit more friendly and down-to-earth kind of
routine so I felt more at ease with it. Mike J.

I'll give you a call in about half an hour (3:45-ish) and tell you
everything you ever wanted to know about k_wait, etc. but were afraid
to ask.  And...if it doesn't do what you want, I'll even fix it.
Such a deal!  -Bill

Subject: wait signal 

Hi, Bill
If a processor is expecting signals, besides infinite loop, is there
any good way for that processor stays alive and waits for the signals?

Most primitive functions have been coded and tested.  I am experiencing
some shared memory problems.  Setdoorbell and doorbell functions work
all right, but writing memory in one processor and reading it from the
other processor at the attached memory segment does not work.

Subject: ADRII GED update 

The ADRII GED has been updated and is now available in (DNDSPEC:39)ADRII.GED.
There have only been a few minor changes:

    (1) The TYMNET special addressing has changed slightly.  X.121
	destination addresses of the form -31060hhhhhssss must now have
	exactly five digits of host number.  For example, -3106000039 is
	valid and specifies destination host 39.  However, -3106039 is
	considered invalid.  Previously, the two formats were considered
	equivalent.  A subhost number is still allowed and can have zero
	to four digits, as before.  (See section 8.2.)

    (2) MUD user entries which currently contain the Universal
	Target Profile Access group (group 37) must be changed.
	Universal access is now indicated by means of a control bit in
	the user's Access Profile Entry.  This applies to the TYMNET
	network only.  (See section 12.)

    (3) MUD destination entries of the form G<dnic>T<tnic> must be
	flagged as target profile entries if they are to be used as
	such.  This applies to the TYMNET network only.  (See section
	12.)

    (4) Several passages have been rewritten for clarity.

TO ALL MINIMAC USERS

The 750 VAX system currently used for MINIMAC will become TYMIX in 
approximately 30 days (mid July) for functional purposes only.  The
system will be set-up to handle all the functions both TYMIX and MINIMAC 
did, and will not be available for users.

It will be necessary for any of the present valid users of MINIMAC who still 
require a unix system to be revalidated on one of the SUN servers.  Some of 
the users have already been validated, and merely need to move any of their 
files that they wish to keep from MINIMAC to an alternate system.  
I will be on vacation from June 29 til July 13, and would like to have all
the validations completed before that time.  The sooner I know who all will
require new validations and where, the sooner they can be done.  

Please let me know either by electronic mail or interoffice mail all your 
specific validation information (such as user name, department and which 
SUN server if known), hopefully during the next week.

TO ALL TYMIX USERS

The 780 VAX system currently used for TYMIX will be converted to a VMS
system in approximately 30 days (mid July).  It will be necessary for
any of the present valid users of TYMIX who still require a unix system to 
be revalidated on one of the SUN servers.  Some of the users have already
been validated, and merely need to move any of their files that they wish
to keep from TYMIX to an alternate system.  To make this more interesting,
I will be on vacation from June 29 til July 13, and would like to have all
the validations completed before that time.  The sooner I know who all will
require new validations and where, the sooner they can be done.  Please let
me know either by electronic mail or interoffice mail all your specific 
validation information, hopefully during the next week.

Thank-you

did, and will not be available for users.

SUN server if known), hopefully during the next week.

would it be possible for me to access your tnc through bubbnet?
(is it on an interesting frequency?)  i'm probably going to buy a cheap
one real soon, when i get a 2 meter radio.  mfj makes a tnc2 clone which
i've seen discounted to about $120, so that's the one i'll probably go
for unless i hear of a better one.

also, how long does a battery typically last in your ht?
and finally, have you got a favorite place to buy equipment?

Battery usually lasts all day if you don't talk too much and use low power.
If you mostly listen, it may last a couple days, but you can't count on it.
There are two battery sizes available.  You get more power and longer life
on the bigger (which I have).

I buy some stuff at Quements (the Bascom Bandit) because I live nearby.  I
usually shop around for radios and sometimes end up at HRO (Ham Radio Outlet)
which is in Redwood City or somewhere up  the peninsula.  Mail order is
often the best way to go, although I never have.

I can switch it to 145.07 when I get home.  Give me a call if I forget.
I've never been pleased with ICOM's as regards their selectivity.  If you
get the leather cover, the 709 is pretty rugged.

Talk to N6BRD on our channel about the dual bander.  I think I heard him
talking about it the other night.  His name is Rick.  He said something
negative about the battery only lasting for 3 or 4 seconds.

let me know Bill ASAP if you are going to implement this IPCF timeout
feature. also I wanted an assurance from you that if message gets

IPCF_TIMEOUT won't happen. right? mike j.

BIOYA = bye-oh-yah
and it doesn't stand for anthing, but the previous owner of the system
used to think it stood for "blow it out your ass" but I don't like to
tell people that since I think its in rather poor taste.  We tried to
come up with a new name when we bought it, but ended up deciding to keep
the name and drop the acronym just like SRI.  -Bill

I'm sorry about disappearing into a black hole.  I'm presently stuck in the
ISIS meetings from 0900 to 1800 and so it will be very hard to get together
before Thursday.  No doubt this is holding you up and I feel bad about leaving
you "hang" the other day.  People keep usurping large chunks of my time
without even enough notice to cancel prior appointments.

To minimize the damage to your schedule I can either
  1. come by after ISIS meeting tomorrow (probably 1800 but no promise)
  2. call you tomorrow night at home
  3. you call me tomorrow night at home
  4. meet Thursday afternoon
I'd have done this today but I had personal plans up to 2300.  Let me
know which you prefer.

anytime up to 18:30. If this does not work you can call me tonight
absolutely ANYTIME after 20:00 at 415-6524119. Or if you prefer that I

without disturbing your home privacy.

Bill, obviously one more question. about k_wait. what if k_wait is
pending and the cause never comes and I decide to do something 
completely different. I simply want to forget about this k_wait.
Theoretically it could happen in the boot if I decided to use k_wait
rather than k_sprout. - let say a certain message never arrives
so I have no intention to do k_cause despite a k_wait waiting for it.
I understand that you keep track in Rodney of all those pending
_waits so I am afraid you may not be able to fully reset to the
original position because of 'hanging' _waits. what do you think?
I start to like this k_wait but want to know of unexpected
surprises. Mike J.

You have to define all the conditions you want to cause a wait to wake up.
These should include exceptions like when something is wrong - usually a
timeout using k_alarm().  If you notice something is wrong in another
process, you can either do a k_cause to wake it up, or a k_terminate to
blow it away.  Of course you can also crash (which isn't that bad since
you must already be in the boot).  Does this answer?  -Bill

Bill, your answer is not what I had in mind. I wasn't thinking about
something going wrong. I simply wanted to know if it is 'legal' never
to wake-up some pending k_wait. During the flow of the program I may
want to forget about this k_wait and do something else. I was afraid
that could screw things up in Rodney that will permanently hold that
k_wait in its queue never restting it.
As soon as you have the new draft let me know how I can have a look
at it on my home terminal (I am home).
thanks

A process which is waiting (k_wait) does not consume any CPU resources, but
it does take a considerable amount of memory - primarily for its stack.  On
the IOCP, this could be a problem.  I suggest some kind of cleanup, probably
using k_terminate to keep the carcases from accumulating.  The draft is
ready and I'll bring one by in a while.  -Bill

If a process is waiting, you can cause it to resume from k_wait by doing
a cause, or you can cause it to disappear using k_terminate.  That covers
all the possible cases.  The file names are
	~wrs/red/ipcf.mm
	~wrs/red/kernel.mm
Do...
	cd ~wrs/red
	make ipcf.m
if you want it on your CRT.  Or...
	cd ~wrs/red
	make ipcf.doc
if you want it in a file.  Same for kernel.

  can you suggest any particular modems, or direct me to the information.

sorry Bill we are again on different freq. My question was how one
can use k_terminate(pid) to cancel k_wait if *pid is clearly the pointer
to k_process and not k_Event. In other words from the definition of
k_terminate it follows you can use it to cancel k_sprout() only.
am I missing something?
thanks for the information on the manual. i will try to get to it.

Bill, if I can suugest something in case you did not think about it.
k_terminate should be able to terminate a process that was never
sprouted by simply returning 0 (number of processes terminated).

When a process is destroyed (terminated), all of its state information is
deleted and it is removed from any queues it is on.  Therefore there is
no need to worry about what a process is doing (e.g. k_wait) at the time
another process issues a k_terminate() -- it will all be cleaned up.  -Bill

Bill, if I can suugest something in case you did not think about it.
k_terminate should be able to terminate a process that was never
sprouted by simply returning 0 (number of processes terminated).

It will.

I'll be in San Francisco during the day tomorrow.  I'll call if I get a
break around noon, or if not, when I get home, probably about 6:00 PM.
Also, you can also call me at home between noon and midnight - no need to
make an appointment.  If I'm busy, I'll just say so, but it won't bother me.

Subject: Rodney Internal Scheduler 


Bill,

Eric Buell and I would like the following changes made to the scheduler.

1. A key, similar to the concept of TSAP_key, should be passed 
to the scheduler with k_sprout, and returned to the task with
any wakeup calls.

2. k_wait should not have an event passed to the scheduler. Rather the
task will wait for  any of a number of events. The event, along with the 
key will be returned to the task upon return from k_wait.

My extension is 6700, home telephone is 286-2514. Please let me know
if these requests are acceptable - I need to use the scheduler in 
my current design.

Thankx,
Jonathan Davar

Bill,
  I've been asked to reccommend what kind of modems/line-drivers to
get for our 2 synch lines that will be run from South Bay Center to
our lab (1.5 mi north) at Nicholson lane.

  Since we're using DUP-11 or DUV-11 hardware which can't really run
faster than 9600 that is all I need...

  can you suggest any particular modems, or direct me to the information.

Subject: "It occurs to me that when Rodney"... 

It occurs to me that when Rodney calls you after initialization, you
are really taking the place of a patron as far as Rodney is concerned.
Perhaps Rodney would call you after initialization at a routine "bootInit()".
It might look like this:

	bool noStartAddress;
	void (*patronStartAddress)();

	void
	bootInit();
	{
		noStartAddress = TRUE;		/* set flag */
		k_sprout( bt_main, 0, 2048 );	/* sprout boot program */
		while( noStartAddress )		/* wait for start address */
			rbgRun();		/* let Rodney run background */
		(*patronStartAddress)();	/* call patron */
		k_warmStart();			/* patron should never rtn */
	}

Then somewhere is function bt_main() you would discover what the patron
start address is and store it in patronStartAddress, then set noStartAddress
to FALSE to indicate to the above code that you are ready to start the
patron, then return.

SUBJECT>   FCC - NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULE MAKING


-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 
On June 10,  1987, the FCC announced a decision to issue a Notice 
of  Proposed  Rule  Making (NPRM) re-addressing  access  charges.  
Press  reports of this announcement have commented on the  impact 
the decision will have on Tymnet and others.   Since the text  of 
the  NPRM  has  not been released,  no one can fully  assess  the 
potential impact of the proposed ruling in any degree of  detail.  
It appears, however, that the FCC is considering action that may
have an impact on our customers and our costs and prices.
 
In 1983, the FCC made a similar announcement.  Tymnet and other
participants   successfully   educated  the   Commissioners   and 
established  that  the proposal was not in the  public  interest.  
Tymnet  is gratified that even though the Commissioners voted  to 
issue the NPRM, each expressed continued concern about the issues 
Tymnet raised in 1983.
 
The NRPM will be issued approximately July 1.  Interested parties 
will  have 30-45 days to comment on various concerns such as  the 
scope, amount, mechanism and effect of access charges as proposed 
in  the  NRPM.   Tymnet will file official comments with the  FCC

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



 
 
On June 10,  1987, the FCC announced a decision to issue a Notice 
of  Proposed  Rule  Making (NPRM) re-addressing  access  charges.  
Press  reports of this announcement have commented on the  impact 
the decision will have on Tymnet and others.   Since the text  of 
the  NPRM  has  not been released,  no one can fully  assess  the 
potential impact of the proposed ruling in any degree of  detail.  
It appears, however, that the FCC is considering action that may
have an impact on our customers and our costs and prices.
 
In 1983, the FCC made a similar announcement.  Tymnet and other
participants   successfully   educated  the   Commissioners   and 
established  that  the proposal was not in the  public  interest.  
Tymnet  is gratified that even though the Commissioners voted  to 
issue the NPRM, each expressed continued concern about the issues 
Tymnet raised in 1983.
 
The NRPM will be issued approximately July 1.  Interested parties 
will  have 30-45 days to comment on various concerns such as  the 
scope, amount, mechanism and effect of access charges as proposed 
in  the  NRPM.   Tymnet will file official comments with the  FCC 
through this process.   We believe that,  as in the past, we will 
be successful with our comments.

After we have had time to evaluate the NPRM,  we will communicate 
further.   If you have any questions or comments,  please  contact

======================================================================

I have prepared a report on TYMNET's numbering plan...what I perceived
are its implementation and its problems.  Please review it since I
probably misinterpreted some of the details.  You may considered it as a
preliminary analysis for the project (PIR #2432) to define the numbering
plan for the public net.  I think that it is important to gather the
interested parties together and discuss the issues.  I understand that
Jeff (703-356-6995 will be in town next week (June 24-26).  Perhaps it
would be a good idea to set up a meeting.  Gary, would you be interested
in arranging it?  We need minimally yourself, Dennis, Jeff, Bill Soley,
and myself.  All other interested parties would be welcome.

NOTE:  PIR #2432 is directed to marketing...does that mean you, Gary?

........................................................................

(DCHANG:39)NUMBER.RPT

created 6/18/87


This report discusses the TYMNET Numbering Plan...its current
implementation, its possible problems, and its future.  


BACKGROUND

Tymnet's Numbering Plan follows the CCITT Recommendations X.121 in
defining the international data number for data terminals.  The
recommendations state that the X.121 address is a decimal number
composed of a 4-digit DNIC and a 1-10 digit NTN.  Hence, this number can
be from 5 to 14 digits long, with the DNIC identifying the specific
network.  The first digit of the DNIC is specified as follows:

	0 - reserved
	1 - reserved, but DNIC 111x is used for maritime mobile service

	2 - used for DNICs
	3 -      "
	4 -      "
	5 -      "
	6 -      "
	7 -      "

	8 - may be used for interworking with telex networks
	9 - may be used for interworking with telephone networks

To address a terminal in another network, the full address with the DNIC
is necessary.  However, it may be desirable that to address a terminal
within the same network with only the NTN (abbreviated addressing).

There are two ways (perhaps more) to support abbreviated addressing.
One way is to define the numbering plan of the network in such a way that
one can always distinguish between the full address and an abbreviated
address.  This would usually entail the detection of a valid DNIC by
examining the first digit.  For example, if the first digit of the NTN
is always 0 and if no DNIC ever begins with a 0, then the full and
abbreviated addresses can be easily distinguished.

A second way to support abbreviated addressing is to use an
international prefix which is defined locally for the network.  This
prefix is not part of the address, but is used to distinguish between a
full and abbreviated address.  For example, if an NTN never begins with
a 0, then the 0 may be used to prefix a full address.

Note that a 0 is used as examples for the two methods because a 0 is
reserved and undefined as a first digit of a DNIC.  SWB is planning to
use a prefix of 1 in method 2 to support abbreviated addressing.  TYMNET
is using a form of method 1 in its numbering plan.

TYMNET'S NUMBERING PLAN

Currently, TYMNET is using a numbering plan which was conceived with the
notion that DNICs will never begin with 0, 8, or 9.  According to the
document (TECHREF:56)X121.TYM by Jeff Oliveto or someone in his
organization, TYMNET internal addressing standard has the following
format:
			DNIC + d + xxxxxxxxx
where
	DNIC is 3106 (TYMNET's data network identification code)
	d is the determining digit, with the following meaning:
		0 - specifies a 5-digit host number with optional 1-4 digit
		    subhost number
			3106 + 0 + hhhhh + ssss
		    Currently, the X.25 interface detects the 0 and converts
		    to a login string "username:hhhhh.ssss".
		1 - reserved, undefined.
		2 -	"
		3 - 	"
		4 - 	"
		5 - 	"
		6 - 	"
		7 - specifies the 5-digit host number of the originating
		    interface
			3106 + 7 + hhhhh
		    This is probably used as the calling address.
		8 - specifies a 5-digit host number with a 1-4 digit
		    subhost number which should not be optional
			3106 + 8 + hhhhh + ssss
		    Currently, the X.25 interface detects the 8 and converts
		    it to a login string "8hhhhh:.ssss".  "8hhhhh" should be
		    a MUD entry with the destination host hhhhh.  NOTE:  THE 
		    DOCUMENT INDICATES THE SUBHOST AS OPTIONAL WHICH DEFEATS
		    THE PURPOSE OF THIS DETERMINING DIGIT, WHICH IS TO
		    DEFINE ONLY ONE MUD ENTRY FOR THE VARIOUS SUBHOST NUMBERS.
		9 - specifies a 5-digit host number with optional 1-4 digits
		    subhost number
		    	3106 + 9 + hhhhh + ssss
		    Currently, the X.25 interface detects the 9 and converts
		    it to a login string with username "9hhhhhssss".
		    "9hhhhhssss" should have a MUD entry indicating hhhhh as 
		    the destination host.  This means that for each
		    subhost number there would be a MUD entry, hence the
		    introduction of determining digit 8.  NOTE:  THE
		    DOCUMENT INDICATES THAT "hhhhh + ssss" IS ACTUALLY A 
		    5-9 DIGIT NUN "nnnnnnnnn".
	xxxxxxxxx specifies the 0 to 9 digits based on the determining digit

Note that the 5-digit host number "hhhhh" in the above definitions is of
fixed length.  However, it is not clear whether this host number is always
necessarily padded by zeroes to form the 5 digits.  According to Dennis
Ernst, at least for the case of determining digit 9, the 5-9 digit NUN
may actually be less that 5 digits.

THE PROBLEM

Currently, the X.121 Numbering Plan project for SWB is in progress.
This project, defined by the GEDs for LOG2, ADR2 (formally Hostnames),
and MUD2 (formally MUD Reformat), is attempting to provide a fundamental
mechanism to support a general X.121 addressing scheme.  A goal of
this project is to remove the support of a numbering plan from the local
interface, eg. XCOM, to the Supervisor, thereby centralizing the
analysis of an address.  At the conclusion of this project, the
Supervisor will support not only the host number in the destination
field but also symbolic hostname and X.121 address.  The X.121 address
is designated with a prefix "-", which is used to distinguish between a
number and a full address.  Each legal hostname and X.121 address will
have an associated MUD entry for validations.

This project will provide support for abbreviated addressing for SWB.
Since SWB uses a prefix of 1 to indicate international calling and no
local NTN ever begins with a 1, there is no problem.  Furthermore, since
the NTN is guaranteed to be 6 digits or greater, then there is no
problem distinguishing between the local NTN and a real 1-5 digit host
number in the destination field.

This project had not been designed to support abbreviated addressing for
TYMNET.  This means that all addresses must be specified with the DNIC.
All internal representation of the X.121 addresses are of the form
		- DNIC NTN
If the XCOM interface receives an address, it must determine whether or
not the DNIC is there.  However, that defeats the goal of removing
the address analysis from the local interfaces to the Supervisor.
As currently defined, the "-" indicates a full X.121 address, ie. the DNIC
follows the "-".  In order that the local interfaces not check for the DNIC,
they could just insert the "-" before all addresses, full or abbreviated,
during the login process.  Then it would be up to the Supervisor to
determine the appropriate action, relieving the local interfaces from
this task.  In essence, the Supervisor in TYMNET's public network would
be supporting abbreviated addressing.

It would be fine and dandy to implement this simple design change of
redefining the meaning of the "-" (ie. in the login message to the
Supervisor, "-" defines a full or abbreviated address, and in all other
instances, "-" defines a full address)...EXCEPT for the possibility of
locking ourselves to the current numbering plan.  Note that 0, 7, 8, and
9 are legal first digits for an NTN in TYMNET's numbering plan.  Supporting
abbreviated addressing with the current numbering plan means that the
Supervisor may receive a full or abbreviated address of the form
		- DNIC NTN    or    - NTN
Suppose the first digit after the "-" is a 7, is this the beginning of a
DNIC or NTN?  Suppose we wish to support telex and telephone networks in
the future, how do we interpret the 8 or 9 after the "-"?

THE QUESTIONS

* Is the current numbering plan adequate and expandable for the public
net?
* Should we devise another numbering plan that will address current and
future needs?
* Can we formalize TYMNET's numbering plan in a document with not only
details on definition but also usage?  [For example, the usage of the
0, 8, and 9 in the current plan is very similar...specifying a host
number and a subhost number.  There should be a more efficient way of
doing this.]
* Can we dispense with the current one, ie. how dependent are the
current customers on the current numbering plan?  Perhaps, we can devise
a way of migrating to a new one, once we come up with a new plan.
* Does TYMNET expect to plan to support telex and telephone networks in
the future?  maritime mobile services?
* How should the addresses be assigned, by whom, and via what mechanism?
* Does the public net wish to support abbreviated addressing at the
Supervisor level?

These questions should be addressed ASAP.  There is a project, PIR #2432
"Public Net Numbering Plan", which is directed to marketing, but which is
not yet scheduled.  It is probably desirable to begin this project now
and answer the aforementioned questions.

Until the above questions are addressed, the X.121 Addressing project
will proceed as specified in the GEDs (MUD2, ADR2, and LOG2).  In other
words, the Supervisor will support the current numbering plan and not
support abbreviated addressing for the public net.  That means that the
XCOM interface and perhaps other interfaces must analyze the address and
insert a default DNIC whenever appropriate.

Bill,
  I was trying to send mail from OPUS to system 65 as a test, and
noticed that OPUS was changing the address of name@65.Tymnet to
name@65.Tymnet.com, and 65 was sending the message on to Augment,
apparently because of the .com extension.  Is this true of many
of the PDP-10s, and can it be fixed?  It isn't very important,
but I am curious.

Thanks,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

David;

     I would first like to clarify on the contents of your Ontyme I49602
dtd 19 June, Subj: Numbering Plan for Tymnet.  Then I will address your
questions, and finally put forward some matters for discussion.

CLARIFICATION:

1)  You comment that Tymnet's current INP was conceived with the
notion that DNIC's will never begin with 0, 8 or 9.  This is not
quite correct.  Actually, Tymnet's INP design did not consider
abbreviated X.121 addressing as a necessity since the Tymnet
interface would assure that a proper address-to-username mapping
would always be performed prior to sending a username to the
Supervisor.  

  2)  For PNIC's you state that a subhost number should NOT be
optional.  On Tymnet, where the intent is to allow the customer as much
flexibility as possible, a null address (similar to 31069) should be
allowed.

  3)  For NUN's, there is NO required format as you state.  NUN's
310690000 thru 310699999 are reserved for internal use (although little
have been assigned).  



TYMNET - ExNet Tech Services                           Page - 02

  4)  Whats "good" for SW Bell is not necessarily "good" for Tymnet.
Remember, SW Bell has to "share" their DNIC 3146 with other networks
and must allow identification of a LATA within the first 6 digits of
NTN.  Requiring NTN's to be 6 digits so that an NTN can be
distinguished from a host number has two flaws, first it assumes that
true abbreviated X.121 addressing is of no use (911, 611, or 411),
second it assumes that a Tymnet network will NEVER have more that
99,999 hosts.

  5)  You imply that it is undesirable for a local interface to perform
any X.121 address analysis.  I'm not sure I agree on this.  One of
our greatest attributes as a VAN is our flexibility at the interface
level.  This should be open for discussion.


YOUR QUESTIONS:

  1)  NO, the current INP is not adequate for Public Tymnet!

  2)  We should MODIFY the current INP to correct its deficiencies and
to allow additional inter-networking capabilities.

  3)  Yes, such a document would be desirable.  See my comments for
additional input.

  4)  We CAN NOT simply "dispense" with our current INP.  Changing an
address can be a traumatic experience for a host and Tymnet.  

   .  There will be front software to be regen'ed (many hosts
don't gen their FE software and might incur a cost in doing so).

   .  There is a user community to be notified.  If the user
community is international, this could be a formidable task.  It
could be particularly disastrous for Tymnet since most high volume
hosts have interfaces on Tymnet & Telenet.  If the foreign subscriber
could not get connected via Tymnet, they would simply start using
Telenet.  Returning customers to Tymnet might be an impossible
task.

   .  Of course there are Tymnet interfaces to be regen'ed.

  5)  Yes, Tymnet does plan to support packet switch to low speed
data circuit switch (Telex) addressing.  We currently have 3 Telex
DNIC's loaded in Target Profiles).  Yes, we plan to support packet
switch to voice (telco) circuit switching to multiple devices e.g.
aync, X.25/X.32, RJE?, SDLC? Fax?.  We also plan to support packet
switching to ISDN.



TYMNET - ExNet Tech Services                           Page - 03

  6)  Currently addresses are assigned and tracked via a separate
automated system (DTE).  There are plans to integrate INP assignments
into the new Network Profile Data Base and OER system under control
of Network Operations.  

  7)  I think this is your REAL question, Does Public Tymnet want to
support abbreviated addressing on the sup or as it currently does in
the interface?  A decision on this should not be reached until all
viewpoints have been discussed.


FOR DISCUSSION:

A.  Reassignment of X.121 Addresses -  As mentioned above, this can not
be done arbitrarily.  The only real restriction in reassignment is that
the NUA's... addresses where the d digit equals 0 (zero) are the only
addresses that CANNOT be reassigned.  Tymnet could always retarget an
NUN (d = 9) or PNIC (d = 8) to an "operator intercept" providing the
correct number.  This would be a simple program on a PC connected to
the network via X.25.

B.  In reality, most functions of Tymnet's NUA's, PNIC's & NUN's could be
provided by a single numeric "hostname only!" NUA.  Example:

        Host 2356 Tymnet Address = 3106002356ssss

                where hostname -3106002356 

Benefits:

        .  Multi/Priority targeting (NUN & PNIC features)

        .  10,000 Sub-host capability (NUA & PNIC features)

        .  Password protection (PNIC & NUN features)

        .  Overall Tymnet INP simplification

Limitations:

        .  only 99,999 Tymnet addressable hosts available

        .  7 origination only addresses not considered (is this a problem?)

        .  Some form of NUN's would still be required for international
inbound calls allowing separate "User Numbers" for individual user group
authentication, although the number required would be greatly reduced.



TYMNET - ExNet Tech Services                           Page - 04

Questions:

        1.  Is the "-" (dash) required as a part of the hostname?

        2.  Can the "-" or some other special character be used to
identify a particular traffic class at the specified destination.  

        3.  Can a "- " (dash/space) indicate an abbreviated address?

C.  What about DNIC's that begin with 9 indicating a PSTN address
request?  Example:

   X.121 Address -914089808100 (Tymnet San Jose Vadic rotary)

Would probably map to hostname -91408980.  But how does the
subscriber select their class of service.  Does the user want:

        .  public async outdial?  private?

        .  X.25/X.32 sync outdial?

        .  X780 sync outdial?

        .  Teletex? Fax? etc...

   X.121 Address -94418475915  (Tymnet/Mercury London V.21 rotary)

        .  Same questions apply

To just address the PSTN we would have to support such addresses as:

        91 + 3 digit NPA + 3 digit DCO for U.S & North America

        944 to identify U.K.

        933 to identify France

        9852 to identify Hong Kong

D.  For ISDN, X.121 numbering does not apply.  But, a question that
needs to be asked now is; How does Tymnet intend to map ISDN
numbering into its X.121 INP.

E.  CMTI and 3270 HIF still perform sub-addressing via the first 2
(two) digits of the username forcing many hosts to use an NUN verses
the desired NUA.  PIR's are required to force these interfaces to
conform to the long establish last 2 digit format of sub-addressing.


I would like to propose a meeting between Public Tymnet and NTD the
week of 27 July.  In the meantime Tymnet can research this topic
further and put together a proposal for NTD's review.  Gary, David,
is this acceptable?

and likewise you could have your opus mail forwarded to the PDP-10 by
creating a .forward file on opus containing:

Bill,
  Could you please install the newer TUMS on system 33 as well?  I
converse with people on 65, and use 33 (presently) as my home mail
system, so may want both.
  By the way, do you know if one can autobcc with unix mail to a remote
host?  I know the record option will work with a local file, but don't
know about remote hosts.

Thanks,
Paul

red is now sccsified.  All you need to do is connect to the red
directory and do the command
	sccs edit aaa.mm bbb.mm ccc.mm ... zzz.mm
where aaa.mm, etc. are the names of the files you are responsible for
maintaining.  This will make them appear in the directory as if by
magic and you can edit and make just as before.  When it comes time
to do another release, there is a special feature that we can use to
track comments, but until then...  -Bill

Bill, Dave tried to restore your file, but on the backup of the last
two days he could find no file of that name.  Either it was
modified before that time or it didn't have that exact name.  If it
is highly urgent, either mail to me or leave me an aspen.

I am not automatically on the aspen system, so to do it you would have
to call 446-6550 and then put in 6311 (my extension).  Dave did find
a file called skylog1.mm in that directory on the system.   ?????????

Bill,

I received a call from Bill Soley today.  He says that office-1 has not been 
accepting SMTP connections "very well" in the last month and things are getting
worse.  He says he connects and as soon as he stuffs a SMTP command in the 
circuit is zapped.  He said he had a complaint from someone in St. Louis and he
said the problem is gettingw worse.  He asked if we could look into it...can we
(you)?  Thanks,  --Bi//

In-reply-to: MDC-WBD-BP3GE

There is not much really to look into in specific cases, since the design of 
the tymnet interface as a whole makes it difficult to learn anything.  Anyhow, 
I changed around some more code and this may help.  There are some problems 
inherent in the implementation of the tymbase interface driver in Tenex which 
make it impossible to really do the right thing in all cases when circuits zap.
 The reason it is a problem is that the handling of zaps is asynchronous with 
respect to the process using the circuit and circuit ownership (or more 
specifically, the ownership of the tty that is the process's handle on it) 
exists at the job level, not the process level; besides which the ownership is 
"stolen" by job 0 when the zap arrives.

It is all rather complicated to explain (or think about) but the bottom line of
it is that tenex can only tell a job that one of its circuits doesn't exist any
more, and that there is some play in the timing of this, so in some conditions 
the interrupts will get referred to the wrong places or arrive at inappropriate
times.

My latest code change is to change the timing of the clearing of the 
dead-connection flag and to deassign the interrupt channel before clearing it. 
The theory of this is that any mis-referred interrupts are less likely to 
result in a flag being set in a place that becomes visible when that receiver 
process is next activated.  In effect, I am hypothesizing that the problem 
currently in question results from a receiver fork seeing the zap-interrupt 
flag set as soon as it wakes up, due to an interrupt actually generated as a 
result of the zap at the end of a prior session, which may have been either 
mis-referred or (in effect) delayed by a race condition at the end of a prior 
session in this fork.

I'm not really sure, but I suspect that if this happened once to a receiver 
fork, the flag may never have gotten cleared and thus it would get seen again 
on the next activation, etc.  This code to check for zaps very early in a 
wakeup is pretty new; I put it in back in April in great haste to try to cure a
major problem of SMTP stealing input from other jobs when this occurred and 
SMTP didn't know it because the TTY was reassigned to someone else logging into
the system before SMTP got to the point of checking the connection state.

The right thing to do is to change the way Tenex originates the interrupts (and
maybe how it handles the terminal ownership) so that the behavior is more 
consistent from the process's point of view.  I am not exactly sure how to do 
this, but I have thought about it a little before, and probably will some more.

I think that the way I have re-ordered some of the flag setting, clearing, and 
checking ought to eliminate the problem for the situation of having only one 
TYMNET SMTP session in existence at a time.  Presumably this is the most common
case.  I don't think it is possible with the current tenex to protect against 
misdirected interrupts if one connection should zap while another one is open, 
though there is a check in the code which will protect against part of that 
problem part of the time.

This is really Ron Murphy's problem (skylog1.mm?) so I forwarded your
reply to him and he can let you know.  There is no file called skylog1.mm
in that directory
/usr.MC68020/calvin3/rodney/doc/red
Did you mean to say that skylog1.mm was on the tape?  In which case, that
might be the file that Ron needs.  Thanks -Bill

Subject: Re: maximum file size 

i guess it depends on how you count levels.  i was planning having
the "inode-equivalent" have pointers to n blocks of pointers to
data blocks.  i also just realized that my arithmetic was wrong,
and i could get 128*256*1K = 32Mb of data in a file if i reserve half
the file header block for the indirect pointers (n = 512/4 = 128).
that should be a reasonable restriction for phase 1.  i could reserve
a pointer to a block to be the root of a tree for double indirection
in case it's ever required.

   In the next few weeks, Ken Jones and I plan to interview several customers
   on network management.  Our agenda for the customer meetings is listed
   below.  Based on the agenda (Parts 3 and 4), we plan to ask leading
   questions that will ascertain their interest in our possible next
   generation network management system.  I would greatly appreciate your
   reviewing the questions, especially those that pertain to your area.  If
   you have any questions of burning interest, please let me know so that I
   can add them to the list.  I must have a response by Monday, June 29,
   since I will be travelling to customer sites starting on July 1.
   
   Also, for those who have not yet commented on my paper on the next
   generation management system, I would appreciate your comments as soon as
   possible.
   
   Thanks,
   
   Brant

The manual is correct, the problem is that ^S is eaten by the network.
The key "DEL" is the same as RUBOUT.  I suggest either rebinding another key
(keys) to the two commands, or typeing ^S^S^Q wherever the manual says to
type ^S.  I use escape-S for ^S, like peak.  -Bill

It counts on LOGOUT ON DISCONNECT and SMTP screws with it.
Thanks - I'll fix SMTP.  -Bill  (that won't be a problem
with other user names than MAIL).

Subject: SETOP should clear input buffer if no DRWSPR.EPO file. 

There is a very small window between the time that PJ copies the new oper
password file to SYS and the time that it sets WC license on it.  If an MHX
job just happens to try to use "O$" during that time, SETOP complains that
there is "NO PASSWORD FILE" and exits without clearing the input buffer.
When this happenned to me today, my oper password showed up on the command
line where anyone looking over my shoulder could see.  Because of MEXEC, it
tried to run a program matching the first word of my oper password.  This
word was then made available to SYSTAT for the world to see.

This is not good.

   In the next few weeks, Ken Jones and I plan to interview several customers
   on network management.  Our agenda for the customer meetings is listed
   below.  Based on the agenda (Parts 3 and 4), we plan to ask leading
   questions that will ascertain their interest in our possible next
   generation network management system.  I would greatly appreciate your
   reviewing the questions, especially those that pertain to your area.  If
   you have any questions of burning interest, please let me know so that I
   can add them to the list.  I must have a response by Monday, June 29,
   since I will be travelling to customer sites starting on July 1.
   
   Also, for those who have not yet commented on my paper on the next
   generation management system, I would appreciate your comments as soon as
   possible.
   
   Thanks,

The 10th should be ok.  I could read your TUMS ok.  They are now in your TUMS file
and should be read with the "READ UNREAD" command.  I know this bug is real,
but I just can't reproduce it at will and so I can't really fix it except to
try and guess.  SIGH  If you ever get to a state where you can make it happen
then call me, even in the morning.  Thanks -Bill

Bill, I count very much on the feature you promised in your document
about clearing all the pending children processes :alarms, waits, sprouts
and sleeps. As a matter of fact it would get quite hairy for me if you
were to take it away from me. It simplifies my task a lot. We can talk
it over but in case you were to go ahead with your intentions I would
have to redesign the whole thing and you would have to provide me with
tools to cancel every type of pending process.(right now the way I see
it is that only alarms and sprouts can be canceled.)

Subject: RDIST program (finally) 

I've finally written RDIST as promised.  It updates files on multiple systems.
I've attached the manual page for it.  Locations are:
  source:  (XEXEC:29)RDIST.SAI
  document:(XEXEC:39)RDIST.PUB
I'll be putting it on XEXEC everywhere soon.  Advise of suggestions.  Please
consider fixing TELECOPY to allow the TALK command in a command file and to
not always update existing file (i.e. supercede).  -Bill
   (XEXEC)RDIST                    Tymcom-X                     (XEXEC)RDIST


   SYNOPSIS

           Remote file distribution.

   SYNTAX

           RDIST outfile=f1,f2,...,fn/USER:u/HOST:h/CHECK/LIST/TRACE/VERBOSE

   DESCRIPTION

           RDIST maintains  duplicate copies of  selected files  on multiple
           systems.   This is  accomplished by  building a  circuit  to each
           system  and running  the (SPL)FINDIT  program to  obtain creation
           date, checksum, protection and license data on the  files.  RDIST
           then  builds a  TELECOPY command  file and  executes  TELECOPY to
           update those files which have incorrect checksums.

           The parameters are as follows:

             outfile=      output file for status log; default is no log

             f1,f2,...,fn  files to be updated, each may contain user name
                           and wild cards; if no user name is given the
                           one given by /USER:u is assumed; default is *.*

             /USER:u       login name to build circuit under (requires AC
                           license); default is current user

             /HOST:h       list of host numbers to update; default is all

             /CHECK        do everything but run TELECOPY

             /LIST         generate list only; does not compare files or
                           run TELECOPY; replaces running FINDIT via MHX

             /TRACE        show circuit traffic on terminal for debugging

             /VERBOSE      show status of each file, even if its current;

Hi Bill, I'm getting all my mail now, have no fear.  Your message of Sun 
3pm: this method of flushing looks ok.  This makes it very simple for
the logger; even interrupt disabling is already done for me.  I assume
we're still calling it slgFlush because the patron can call it too.

I haven't edited skylog1.mmx yet (the copy restored was the most recent).

Your sprout code and duplicate enters don't affect me.  I guess your IpcfRemove
will always have to loop through the whole symbol table though, won't it?
(Otherwise remove can't be trusted to remove a symbol once and for all.)

lib now appearss to be out of date (has no rodney.h or sfs.h).  What will be
the future of this directory?

Thanks for taking care of that.  58 went down in the middle of the
distribution.  I think we will continue to see these problems until
somebody fixes TELECOPY, in specific, TELECOPY always does both a
LOOKUP and ENTER on the file and thus runs in UPDATE mode, even when
NO UPDATE is specified.  This is clearly a bug.

Ok, but lib is still dangling there (and ipcf.h is still linked into it).
According to lint I still need definitions for the following in Rodney.h:
MAXFNAME, enum Status, MAXCARDS, and IPCF_MAGIC (and a rodney product name).

Of course PJ should be fixed to specify the license in the enter rather
than doing a rename after the fact.  Aside from that, OPER should also
always take a password, regardless of weather there is an oper password
file or if its bad or if the name specified does not exist.  This is the
same strategy we'll be releasing in the network as soon as we get a round
tuit.  [it also makes guessing harder]  -Bill

Subject: Problem with duplicate messages thru TUMSGATE 

Bill,
  A user is distributing a note (really a PROFS document which I imbed into a
note) using a PROFS distribution list of 13 names. I checked his distribution
list and his nickname file and everything seems ok there. The OTCDOC routine I
created sends a separate spool file to TUMSGATE and I verified that the
TUMSGATE NETLOG shows he receives and sends on 13 files. But ONTYME users are
getting three copies of the note each with a different Message number.
  I have tested and can't repeat the problem, but I am just using a
distribution list of about 3 to 4 names. One strange thing that did surprise
me, each of the users on my list received one note but they each received the
same message number, ie A75331. I would have thought if I sent three spool
files to TUMSGATE he would send three separate message numbers associated with
the note.
  Have you any ideas on why users are getting multiple copies of these things?
The TUMSGATE NETLOG seems ok to me, beyond that I haven't the ability to trace
activity of the data.
  Thanks for looking into this for me, I am getting a lot of &*%^$ over this
one.
Thankyou,
Carol

Subject: Making a DCS print station for Bubbnet Spool requests.

 Hi Bill,
 
 I haven't had the chance to meet you yet but there is somethting that
I need to talk with you about. Sandy has hired me for operations support
for the NTD dedicated systems in buildings D, F and H. One of my
first projects is to implement a DCS print station for Bubbnet spool
requests, which I understand have been mounting. I spoke with Sue Pal
from building C (where I was an operator for the past year and a half),
and she told me that the station was possible provided we had a full
case printer, an interface cable, a slot off an engine and the necessary
software to run the thing. She also told me that the software was available.
While I know tjh/that Bubbnet S & O, ( our motto unofficially, just say no.),
has all the necessary hardware, I am going to need some help setting this
thing up. Sandy has mentioned your name and I thought that if you had some
time between your Skywalker project and your other dutie/work we might
talk over this idea. My telephone extention is 7062 and my ontyme name
is d/hopkins. I am validated on all UNIX systems as FOIL, a strange 
name I know but one I can explain later.

                                     Thanks for your time,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Answers are urgently needed by the NCC task force in evaluating the remaining
open TRFs for possible solutions.

Do you have an idea of difficulties caused by:

1) reporting the node kernel host with a MXP number and SLOT number
   from the MXP node.  A patch has been tried in the test network
   to initialize HSTKEY for the kernel host on node startup,
   with the expected result that PROBE now gives a MXP # SLOT #
   for the kernel host.
   Normally the reported SLOT number is zero, indicating a non-MXP
   machine. It is not known whether this is an oversight in the MXP
   development, or an intentional omission due to PRODUCT ID checks
   and special handling of the kernel host in PROBE and NCC software.

2) reporting the same node number (with a different kernel host)
   from the MXP node.

   the primary/backup nodes are operating in a 1 for 1 mode with
   all lines switched by the PSM.  This is possible in the MXP
   because the LAN is used for loading. Only one node can be active
   at once; if both or the wrong one is active due to a fault in
   the APSS system the PSM will connect the network lines to only
   one of the node slots.

   If the system is misconfigured with unswitched lines instead of
   switched ones an imposter node situation could result if there
   were also an APSS system fault.

   When the PSM switches modes the links are completely disconnected
   (HDLC idle state) for a minimum of 20 seconds, then the new node
   code slot sends a T.201 reset frame to the neighbors.

   I don't see any technical difficulty in the MXP having the same
   node number assigned to the primary and backup machines.  This
   change is desired by the customer, and may help to solve a
   problem with the alarm system.  

For both changes 1 and 2, the TMCS developer must also evaluate the
extent of changes and/or additional difficulties posed to NCC software.

A response is desired by Thursday evening, if possible, or by Friday,
as the task force will be working over the week-end and we should
prioritize the work.

Hi Chuck!

I have no comment on item 1.  Item 2 concerns me because (if I understand
what you've suggested) it will rely on the link timeout to notice that the
link has gone down and is back up to a different node with the same node
number.  Timeouts are usually subject to change and are not intended for
that kind of use.  The decision to require different node numbers was made
to insure high reliability.  If you decide to do it, anyway, I think you
will need to change the port switch (?) to guarentee the links to be down
for significantly more than 20 seconds - more like 45-60 I would think.
This might give you reasonable assurance of detecting the switch in the
neighbors.  Let me know if I've misunderstood.

-Bill

Subject: Tech. question number 2.

Thanks for your quick response to question 2.

Let us suppose that the switchover is instantaneous,
so that the links to the neighbor nodes do not 'time out'

The new node code initializes and sends a T.201 reset frame
on each link as part of the normal link start-up
procedure.  This causes the neighbors to reset their
links to the new node.

This scenario happens very often in Tymnet today as
a result of power fluctuations and software crashes.  I
doubt that any of these events respect a lengthy timeout
in order for the neighbors to detect that the neighbor has 'gone' 
and then reappeared.

Subject: sources for the MCAUTO program 

Here is the source code for the MCAUTO program as per our conversation.
It is written in the SAIL language on the decSystem-10.  It builds a circuit
to SLVMCL1 and logs in as TUMSGATE.  Every three minutes it checks the queue
file on the PDP-10 (MCAUTO.Q) to see if there is any mail to be sent to the
PROFS system and if so runs SNDMSG exec on SLVMCL1.  It also runs the
RCVMSG exec to see if there is any mail in the TUMSGATE reader on SLVMCL1
and if so runs TYPMSG exec to read it.  It then parses the PROFS headers
in the reader file and translates them to SMTP format for delivery to any
other TUMS system, including Ontyme.  So, here it is...

Subject: Bootstrap 

Bill,

  There's no way specified to request Rodney to run the bootstrap
without supplying the requestBits.  This could be solved by
eliminating the requestBits, tsap, etc. from the rkBoot
and RODNEY_BOOT_REQ ipcf messages and letting this function
invoke the current strategy.  There's still the possibility
of forcing a bootstrap strategy by first using rkSetBoot
before rkBoot.  Comments?

Also, have you had a chance to look over the memo from Dave Smith
regarding identifier naming conventions?  Dan would like to get
comments and publish an update soon.

The function "boot with current strategy" is really implemented by
the reset board function (i.e. warm start) so I think there is no
problem.

I like Dave's suggestion on the extension to the IH Style sheet except I
think acronyms shold be capitalized as if they were a word, otherwise
some strange things happen.  For example:
	ipcfSend();
	goIpcf();
The strangeness occurs when it appears anywhere but in the last position
in the identifier.  Rather than being inconsistent, I think it is better
to handle acronyms always the same no matter where they appear in the id
which sort of leaves us with the concept of treating it like a word.

I'd also like to add to the list that identifiers which would normally be
mixed case must be more than one character.  This is sort of obvious, but
I think it should be said.

I'd also like to relax the remarks about underscore to make it a suggestion
rather than a rule.  As long as they are local, there can't be any conflict.
Maybe the rule should be to never use them as globals.

Finally, not related to Dave's comments, I'd like to delete the change
about curly braces and do them as stated in the original IH Style sheet.
My principal reason for this is that it makes the code's aspect ratio too
tall so it is very difficult to view any useful amount of code on your
screen.  It is just as easy to match curly braces with proper indented
parent statements:

There are a number of papers published in SIGPLAN about this kind of thing
and it amounts to the braces being redundant - that is the indentation is
enough for both the human and the compiler to tell what is going on, but
'C' requires them, so lets put them in as inobtrusively as possible.  I
can go on more about this if I have to, but I'll stop here and see what
your response is.  Oh yes - its also the way Kernigham and Ritchie suggest
since 1978 and is also the way Unix programs are written.  To me these
are the biggest authorities on 'C' programming.  Plum is just a radical.

There is not much really to look into in specific cases, since the design of 
the tymnet interface as a whole makes it difficult to learn anything.  Anyhow, 
I changed around some more code and this may help.  There are some problems 
inherent in the implementation of the tymbase interface driver in Tenex which 
make it impossible to really do the right thing in all cases when circuits zap.
 The reason it is a problem is that the handling of zaps is asynchronous with 
respect to the process using the circuit and circuit ownership (or more 
specifically, the ownership of the tty that is the process's handle on it) 
exists at the job level, not the process level; besides which the ownership is 
"stolen" by job 0 when the zap arrives.

It is all rather complicated to explain (or think about) but the bottom line of
it is that tenex can only tell a job that one of its circuits doesn't exist any
more, and that there is some play in the timing of this, so in some conditions 
the interrupts will get referred to the wrong places or arrive at inappropriate
times.

My latest code change is to change the timing of the clearing of the 
dead-connection flag and to deassign the interrupt channel before clearing it. 
The theory of this is that any mis-referred interrupts are less likely to 
result in a flag being set in a place that becomes visible when that receiver 
process is next activated.  In effect, I am hypothesizing that the problem 
currently in question results from a receiver fork seeing the zap-interrupt 
flag set as soon as it wakes up, due to an interrupt actually generated as a 
result of the zap at the end of a prior session, which may have been either 
mis-referred or (in effect) delayed by a race condition at the end of a prior 
session in this fork.

I'm not really sure, but I suspect that if this happened once to a receiver 
fork, the flag may never have gotten cleared and thus it would get seen again 
on the next activation, etc.  This code to check for zaps very early in a 
wakeup is pretty new; I put it in back in April in great haste to try to cure a
major problem of SMTP stealing input from other jobs when this occurred and 
SMTP didn't know it because the TTY was reassigned to someone else logging into
the system before SMTP got to the point of checking the connection state.

The right thing to do is to change the way Tenex originates the interrupts (and
maybe how it handles the terminal ownership) so that the behavior is more 
consistent from the process's point of view.  I am not exactly sure how to do 
this, but I have thought about it a little before, and probably will some more.

I think that the way I have re-ordered some of the flag setting, clearing, and 
checking ought to eliminate the problem for the situation of having only one 
TYMNET SMTP session in existence at a time.  Presumably this is the most common
case.  I don't think it is possible with the current tenex to protect against 
misdirected interrupts if one connection should zap while another one is open, 
though there is a check in the code which will protect against part of that 
problem part of the time.

Well, it seems to be a little better now.  The last failure was on
  25 Jun 87 9:17 PDT
and has been fine since.  I'll let you know if there are any
more recuring problems.  Thanks very much for the prompt attention.

do you think a maximum file size of 8 megabytes would be ok for a skywalker
local file system?  that's about as big as i can get with only one level
of indirection.

8 MB8 MB may be a problem.  Plessey plans to have 8MB of RAM on their next board
and a dump would then be bigger given the X.409 overhead and a space to save
hardware registers and such.  I would think that it would be acceptable for
phase I provided that you define things for two levels and just not
implement it until later.  In the long run, the only safe size limit is 4GB.

Isn't 8MB big for one level, anyway?  Do you have huge clusters or huge
inodes or what?  -Bill

i guess it depends on how you count levels.  i was planning having
the "inode-equivalent" have pointers to n blocks of pointers to
data blocks.  i also just realized that my arithmetic was wrong,
and i could get 128*256*1K = 32Mb of data in a file if i reserve half
the file header block for the indirect pointers (n = 512/4 = 128).
that should be a reasonable restriction for phase 1.  i could reserve
a pointer to a block to be the root of a tree for double indirection
in case it's ever required.

Subject: Process trees 


Bill,

I am planning to use the process tree facility.  My concern is if a Session
Services user "goes away" while there are session resources allocated, I
want to be aware of this and be able to deallocate the resources.  If there
is some other way to accomplish this, that would be fine with me.

The simulation is done.  The equasions for e0 and e1 were wrong, but I
liked the way they came out better so I changed the function table to
match the equasions.  It also occured to me that you need an output
enable for the RAM.  I added that at the expense of /MTX.  You can use
an external inverter for that and since the /CPU signal (/CP) is based
on /BR and /IO then there will be enough time for the drivers to go to
high impedance.  I had to take out alow of white space and make the names
of some of the signals shorter to get it to assembler (gross).  Oh well.

There will really be a serious problem with glitches.  I don't know the
solution.  I looked at the register pals and that may or may not work.
The problem with that is that some things will not go through the latch
because they won't go throughthe pal.  I think it needs a synchronous
counter.  Only the low order 4 bits need to be synchronous.  If you used
two 74HC163 for the counters, you wouldn't need a latch and two 163's
cost half as much as one 393 and a latch.

Well, here it is:   -Bill

Got Becky's letter.  Please thank her for me.  

I never managed to make it thru to BITNET by way of the gateway in
wisconsin.  I have succeded though by going thru
...ihnp4!psuvax1!host.bitnet!user.  It is also possible to go the
other way thru psuvax1 'cause I just got a response back.  Too bad I
was just learning how to get around in VM/CMS and XEDIT...  Yucch!  

I'm a little bummed because the competition for fellowships to the
LSA Institute this summer at Stanford was too stiff for me.  We
still plan to come but I'm not sure if I can afford to take any
classes.  I will go to the Association for Computational Linguistics
meetings at least.  Since Melinda is not currently working on a
degree she qualifies as a "Professional Affiliate" and can audit
classes for a more reasonable fee.  I'm currently looking for some
loophole that will allow me to take classes for no-credit too.

better close for now.  See ya.

	Subject: Sun Pricing News
	
	from the S. F. Chronicle, 4/7/87:
	
	Sun Cuts Computer Price
	
	Sun Microsystems Inc. yesterday cut the price of its low-end computer
	workstation by 36 percent, a move partly intended to counter new
	personal computers from IBM Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
	
	The Mountain View-based company reduced the price of its Sun 3/50M
	model from $7900 to $4995.  For that amount, the company offers the
	32-bit workstation with a 19-inch monochrome monitor and four megabytes
	of memory but no disk drives.
	
	Sun said the new price was about one-half of the cost of competing
	products from Digital Equipment Corp. and Apollo.  It is in the same
	range as new 32-bit personal computers such as IBM's Personal System/2
	Model 80 and Apple's new Macintosh 2, observers noted, if the cost of
	disk drives are subtracted from those systems.
	
	Bernie Lacroute, a Sun executive vice president, said the reductions
	were made possible by greater manufacturing efficiencies and lower
	component costs.  But he confirmed that Sun waited until new product
	announcements from Apple and IBM, which unveiled the Personal System/2
	last week.
	
	Lacroute predicted the new machines will significantly increase the
	company's market share in sales to corporations.  The Sun units are
	designed to be used in networks and communicate better than most of the
	new high-end personal computers, he said.
	
	In over-the-counter trading, Sun's stock closed at 32, down 2 3/8.
	
	Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said investors
	apparently expected Sun's profits might fall as a result of the price
	cut.  But Herwick praised the move and said profits should remain
	stable, in part because the low-end workstations only account for
	one-quarter of Sun's revenues.

   on Austpac.  How about sometime next week?  Also, I have not been able to

Actually, as of 19-Dec-86, the public net MUD had 98,572 entries.  I also
don't understand why two entries are required per port.

They could use the NCUD1 protocol, perhaps with minor changes.

If so, no problem, just validate 10 names each.

I think all this means is that we have to present the actual port address
in accounting records regardless of what method was used to address it.
This would be available with the "symbolic address in access profile" project.

There is also an address table necessary in each interface to know which port
to route to on various addresses.  This is probably statically allocated in
the TYM file, but not sure.

Its not clear how this would work since we have not defined the behavoir of
multiple transits, yet.  I think it would only be on the basis of the origin
and destination rather than the neighbor networks.

----

We need "symbolic address in access profile" for this, I think.

----

I'm confused about NUA/NUI processing, as well.

----

I think this might be able to be done without any customization by careful
planning of the access profiles.  I need to understand NUI/NUA stuff better
to be sure, though.

----

In general: very nicely done - stated plainly and accurately.  I should have
comments on Omar's response soon.  Probably Wednesday evening.

Subject: email from EcoNet I to EcoNet II
Status: RO

It used to be possible to send email to EcoNet I.  I just
augmented the mail delivery system a bit to enable everyone,
experimental and normal system, to send mail via:

	name@econet1

Christian Stalberg used to know how to send mail to users on PN
also.

Such messages go through a gateway that didn't seem to work for a
while, so you should experiment with it if you want to use it.
But it might be useful to some people during the transition, and
it might be useful with the people who stay on EcoNet I due to
cost reasons (e.g. they're in one of the 10 freebie foreign
countries).

Subject: CT-61 software version 

I wonder what version of software your CT-61 has.  The current version is
"201".  The easiest way to tell is to set the exit delay to an odd number
of minutes.  If it then ceases to beep durring the exit delay after arming
then its version 201.  It seems the panel I bought for my father is the
old version.  It also fixes a couple of other bugs.  I have a chip with
the new version that the factory rep gave me.  I'll probably send it to
my father, but I might be able to get another if you are interested in
turning off that infernal beeping!  -Bill

Recent documentation on the Rodney Internal Scheduler indicates that
it will keep track of a process tree so that any process which did a
k_sprout of another process would be considered the new process'
parent, and the new process it's child.  The distinction becomes
important when you terminate the parent.  The document states that in
such a case, all the children would be terminated as well (recursively).

If nobody is planning to use this feature, I would like to delete it
as a matter of simplification.  If anyone is planning on using it,
please talk to me and perhaps we can work out a simpler method to

Is anyone counting on ipcfEnter() to fail if the symbol already exists

always add to the beginning of the data base which avoids a linear
search.  If the symbol is added several times it will appear in the
list several times, but only the most recent will be accessible via
ipcfLookup() (but ipcfScan can see them all).  Comments?  -Bill

What do you think, Pat, if they're going to use this feature it can be left in
without any great problem.  In fact the code is already there, but I'm always
looking for ways to reduce ROM and make execution faster.  Its not documented
under ipcfEnter how it should handle duplicates, so the GED has to be updated
either way.  -Bill
