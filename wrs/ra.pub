Since there seems to be some misunderstanding about the hours for which 
I am available for work,
please note my schedule as shown below.
As you will see, 
with minor exceptions,
I am available for most of the hours the store is open.
In regard to the amount of hours,
I would prefer to work about 15-25 hours a week.
I am asking for whatever consideration possible,
as I realize that business fluctuates.
