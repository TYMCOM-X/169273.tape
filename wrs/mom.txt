HI MIKE,
I FOUND YOUR MESSAGE BOTH ON THIS SYSTEM & ON CMS.
FOR A REPLY TO YOUR QUESTION READ YOUR MAIL
(I HAD SOME TROUBLE & COULDN'T COMPLETE IT)
THE CUNY MANUALS ARE PRETTY MUCH INTRODUCTORY, BUT
THE REFERENCE MANUAL IS PRETTY USEFUL. THE IBM MANUALS ARE
MUCH BETTER. VM WYLBUR IS MUCH EASIER TO USE FOR
CREATING MESSAGES, BUT OCCASIONALLY THE BLKSIZE & RECFM
OF THE WYLBUR FILE WILL CAUSE IT TO LOOK STRANGE
WHEN YOU ACCESS IT FROM CMS.

        For a year now, COMMUNIQUE-80 has been one of the
fastest and easiest to use bulletin board systems in the
country.  Well folks, we have now gone to 300/1200 BAUD.
This means that the one of the fastest boards is now 4 times
faster!  
        If you have 1200 baud capabilities (or even if you
don't!).  Give COMMUNIQUE-80 a call at:
              @  >>>>> (201) 992-4847 <<<<<
                  24 hours daily!  
                        300/1200 baud!  
See you there!

Dear Bill;
If you are getting a "Destination" recording on SPRINT,
it has nothing to do with the code you have or the access
port you're using.  It is simply that SPRINT doesn't have 
the trunking to go there.  Therefore, I have listed below a
WATS extender that should work for you.  The quality is nowhere
near as good as SPRINT, but it should serve the purpose.
1(800)553-8432<tone>6181<tone>85<tone>(000)+7d.
That is, you wait for a tone, dial the first sequence of
numbers, wait for the next tone, etc.  When you dial your
destination number, you may or may not have to dial a
one before the area code, I just don't remember.  Try it
both ways.   
Happy Phreaking!!
Susan.

many thanks for your caution. i got a lot of advice, much of
it contradictory. yours appears to make the most sense, part-
icularly for an amateur who does not own a soldering iron!
plenty of plain erasers, though. one suggestions was to
use gorham's silver polcish, of which i am leery. it nb not
only contains an abrasive, but also chemicals which i don't
think i would want too close to my boards. one person
suggested vaseline rather than the light lube you suggest.
what is your opinion on that?
taken altogether, it seems to me that a good cleaning
with a plain soft erasewr followed by a light coating
of vaseline is the best solution. would you agree?

I'm researching new applications for microcomputers in
the home.  We all know micro's are great in the office and
the classroom, but what can we do with them at home besides
the usual trivial functions?  I teach a nontechnical adult
education class called "Meet the Home Computer" for Wash-
ington, DC-based Open University, a nonprofit corporation.
The question people most commonly ask is, "What good are
these machines, anyway?"  Some answers are obvious: infor-
mation management, education, entertainment, device control
and telecommunications.  But it's clear that many poten-
tial applications have not yet been developed or even
discovered.  If you are developing or know someone who is
working on innovative, leading-edge uses, I'd like to hear
about it in the interest of promoting microcomputer aware-
newss among the general public.
