Don't you ever sleep?

I never got a call. I'm sure we could work out some deal but it might be a 
little shaky trying to honor our claim of 2 hour response time on service
calls for major problems.

I hope my modem comes back soon. I grow old and gray waiting for messages to
print. Well, we're moving this week into our house and I haven't even started
packing. We have to be out of our old apartment by Saturday. Oh well, things are
more fun when you wait 'til the last minute.
For info, my new phone number will be (313) 481-1344 (Crossbar #5).
I'm going to lose Call Waiting and 3-way calling. How Rude!
They say they have no immediate plans to change this CO. So much for 
Ameritech being the communications company of the future.
Well, at least my local service will be about $6.50 cheaper.

Back to work. Gotta SELL,Received: From EMSII.Ontyme.Tymnet by 39.Tymnet; Fri, 24 Aug 84 16:08:55 UT
