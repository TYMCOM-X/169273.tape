on Monday.  Please call me to notify me of your plans. (464-7443)
Don't worry if it isn't possible.

	Put marc in /usr/adm/usrlist. A first and last name and some
indication of who is responsible for him will do.

I removed the password from 'gjt' when you mentioned it a month ago.
If there is onewas one on it,  someone else put it there.  The password
for gjt  is  now 'xerxes'.  JImim has the authority to give  out SU
privs, but you dont really need them.  Not many people use the trap function,

I wrote a program called nb to keep note book like entries
on the system regarding various objects of interest.
Type "nb" for shell to find out what it does, or alternatively,
give me a call. Dhiraj.

Gary,
	I don't appreciate this nonsense.  If you can make a good
case for needing the root password, Jim will give it to you.
Please don't try things like this anymore, I don't like people playing
games with files in my area.

	No, that file isn't (wasn't) real.  That happens alot when

Gq;4Ugv%POBegard this as mali-
cious, if not, irresponsible.  I was informed of this  by  a
user that was not too happy about it. When people come to me
in this state it makes me unhappy, as it appears as if I  am
not doing my job and I don't like to look like that.  Hence,
I was inspired to write this letter. I feel  I  have  wasted
enough time playing this sort of game and have decided to do
something about it.

          Finding open access  without  passwords  to  users
logins  and  the super-user login does not make me happy,  I
doubt it would make some department heads very happy either,
knowing  that  anyone could login to their accounts, and I'd
rather the person who caused the problem to take the  blame,
than  myself.  Therefore,  I would not like to find any more
unauthorized set-uid programs owned by root lying about.   I
would  not  like  to  find any false entries in the password
file.  I would not like to find that any system set-uid pro-
grams  have  been tampered with, ala login, or any "mv xyzzy
plugh" type changes. If I find this sort of  thing,  I  will
start  to  make  noises,  loud  noises  if  necessary, to my
department head, about the party concerned.  I  am  removing
any  instances  of  this  sort of thing Tuesday morning, any
occurences thereafter will force me (I really don't like  to
do  this  sort of thing) to talk with Dave Bergland, who I'm
sure will talk to the appropriate people.  If  some  of  you
feel  you are innocent of the acts described above, I apolo-
gize for including your name  in  the  mailing  list  in  an
effort to get this note to all parties concerned.

          The policy for having the super-user id is one  of
need,  if  you  present  a legitimate reason for needing it,
you'll get it. If some of you find it awkward to do  certain
things under the current policy, I would like to discuss the
situation and see what can be done to alleviate any problems
you are having and perhaps, if necessary, to change the pol-
icy.

Goran:-:
.ti 5
A human from Old Earth, Goran has few of what his own race
consider to be noble qualities.  Having lived many lives, he
has some deep bestial instincts that have given him the killer
traits needed to be a Guardian and the protector of the
more peaceful inhabitants of his sector.
Even though he has the troubling knowledge of an old, wise, man,
he is, and will always be physically twenty-six years old.
.ti 5
Goran is normally solemn in his outlook and only loosens-up
with close friends.  He is also an intensely sensual creature
that loves food, music, art, and especially sex.  He doesn't
consider himself really human, so he pays little attention
to his distant relatives -- now very passive intelectual
scientist-types who are the great-great-great-grandchildren
of the original human colonists of the three sectors.
Goran, although hardly disliking them, stays as far away
from their communal/free-living planets as possible.
.ti 5
Even though he hates needless death, he doesn't blink at
the idea of killing hundreds, thousands, or millions of
whoever tries to attack his children (elves, Banche', or humans),
and never attacks without being provoked.
He also has a proffesional loyalty to the other Guardians and
their races.

Cheetsak:-:
.ti 5
Cheetsak (Cheetsak) is a sly, streetwise Banche'
who is normally jovial and friendly towards strangers.
When times are rough, she is always trying to cheer up
the ones that she cares about.  Her serious side, clear-headed
and practical, comes out when dealing with prospective merchants
or enemies. It also comes out  for short periods when discussing
important matters with Goran.
.ti 5
Though a very outgoing and agressive person in public
situations, a very noticable trait due to her considerable size,
strength, and agility, Cheets' gets very clumsy, both physically
and verbally, when envolved in a tense situation with those that
she is fond of.  She gets very quiet and introverted, completely
the opposite of her normal personality, when making love with
Goran (playing an almost placid part in the long and tender periods).
.ti 5
Her first and formost interest is in music (a rough
description of the complex form of entertainment), including
the very primal and powerful music from Goran's time.  Even though
she can't dance to Old Earth's music (the way she can with her
home planet's), she loves to 'feel' it throb and fill her full
of almost uncontrolable energy.
.ti 5
An incredibly fast-thinking individual, Cheetsak never uses
the ship's navigational computers, unless there is little to
do and there is enough time to catch up on some sleep (something
that both she and Goran love doing -- sleeping).
She, having come from a planet with few large concentrations of
water, has a very high tolerance to environmental changes.  She
can stand up to 75 degree changes in temperature and even more
than that when hibernating.
Her only weakness (innate in her race) is when it comes to
respiratory disorders.
.bp
Helmet: Goran  has goat horn pattern on helmet of suit
and Guardian symbol on side.

She spins and aims into the center of the target.

It's a boy. A Xannite soldier that couldn't be more that a day
past puberty.  Helmet too big, uniform baggy, no armor, standing
there pointing a gun at her -- Scared half into shock at the sight
of her.  Cheetsak raises her hand in a gesture of "I don't want to
hurt you...".  He won't shoot, he's too scared.

There's a flash.

Cheets' hits the wall, an explosion of heat and pain from her body
blocking out all thoughts.  Clutching at the wall, she slides to the
floor, whimpering in agony.  She glances at her side and at the boy,
turns to the wall and swears through her clenched teeth.  Cheetsak
takes a breath, knowing that her lower lungs and heart no longer
exist, and lets the pain drain quickly away with her life.

At the other end of the building, Goran feels a sharp spasm run
through him.  His breath knocked out of him, he spins to see what
caused it.  There was nothing behind him.  He stared long at the
empty hallway before him.  Feeling something wrong, he turns back
and sees her...
.nf

	"Cheets'??!"

(Chance Meeting last 30secs)
.fi
Everything faded away as he touched her.  They were alone, together.
She looked more beautiful than he'd ever seen her, radiant in all ways.
Clothes, armor, distance, disappeared along with their fear.  They kissed,
softly, gently, like the first time they'd kissed.  A kiss that seemed to
last forever.  A warmth surrounded them.  He touched her face as she took
hands and drew back.  On her face was a smile of love and sadness that said
more than all the words in the universe could ever say.  Mostly, as he held
her hands, he knew her smile meant "goodbye".

Goran tried to speak, but there was nothing left to say.  Cheets'
glanced away, then looked deeply into Goran's eyes.  The brightness
all around seemed to become part of her and she seemed to fall asleep.
A wave of empty coldness snapped through him and Goran found himself
back in the empty hallway, alone.
Sharp yellow loneliness surrounded him in his
suit.  His arms still held out, still holding hands no-longer there.
He closed his eyes and began trembling from shock.

(Both Ends Burning live)
.ti 5
Gia felt a tremendous jolt as Cheetsak's ship broke from its escort
position and dove, all engines full out, back toward the Xannite star-
system.  She understood, feeling some of what Goran had just experienced
on the planet far behind them.  And Gia understood how the ship felt, for
she'd felt it before.  Cheetsak had given life to her ship, it was now
time to give it back...
.bp
.sp 4

In the hold of the Banche'on trader ship, a dark globe, a device and
element, unlocks from it's safety mount and waits to be triggered.
Installed by Cheetsak out of vengeful paranoia, the globe was tagged
"Novastar".  Its harmlessness only broken by the raw force of a massive
explosion.

The power-tow freighter pushed itself way past its limits as it
made a mad leap towards the center of the Xannite confederacy's twelve-planet
star complex.  Massive defensive satellites fired at the ship.
Thousands of interlacing beams crossed and slashed around the
freighter.  But the ship was way out of range of the guns' accuracy.
They were placed perfectly to intercept anything heading for any of
the confederacy planets -- but not their stars.
The solid mind in the ship wanted nothing
more than to create the violent emptiness that tore through it's
woven-metal body.  For now he'd never hear its pilot's voice,
or the security and control of her touch.  Now, to carry out her
wishes.  Now, to "tasch" -- to "take down all around you".

The ship dived towards the gap between the binary star at
the center of the Xannites' home.  Firing from the guns stopped.
Light and heat grew all around the ship.  Inside, the systems
switched from engines to shields and left the engine-control
to overload at it's leisure.
It won't be long now.

In the building, Goran sat, taking his helmet off and laying
back against the wall.  A moment later and the hallway was full
of soldiers, some young, some old, all scared. All pointing
their weapons at the creature on the floor.  They'd never seen
a Guardian before.  The commander of the troop worked his way to the
front of the group and laughed.  The Guardian, the thing they were
trained to hate, to fear, to kill, was just a bearded old-earth man.
The soldiers all started laughing nervously.
Suddenly, the building groaned as an intense gravitational flux pulled
at the metal in the building and sucked the energy from its
systems.  Coming in from the outer hall was the only light
from the outside, casting the soldiers as silent silhouttes
against the dimming sunlight.  A moment passed and the power to
the building came back on, long enough for the soldiers to see
the smile on the Guardian's face.  Then all went dark.  The light
disappeared from inside and out.  Out of the darkness came Goran's laugh.

.ti 5
Gia's sensors picked up the explosion before the blast could be seen.
She swung around to face the ocean of stars she'd just left.  K'val felt
things happenning around her, but she couldn't put the sensations together.
She asked Gia "Is Goran dead?"  Gia sat in silence and watched a star
flicker out, then flash and blossom into a beautiful white patch in
the distance.

.ti 5
From the darkness, the universe exploded into a violent maelstrom
of light and sound that soon faded into a soft, floating, humming
whine as Goran lost the distant memory of despair.  The sound floated
and pulsated as he felt his body move to the rhythm.  Colors shifted
and fell into a long line of greens and browns that grew larger and
larger in front of him.  The pastel of light rushing toward him
pushed him closer to panic.  Pulsations of soft, rushing sounds came to
Goran as he struggled against the flow that dragged him forward to the
light.  Just as he gave up struggling, he shuddered and recognized
the origin of the sound...
.nf

	"GHHHHEEEEEEE--AAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"

.fi
His scream was still echoing in the trees as he slammed his arms into
the grass around him.  He coughed and kept crying until the fear
within subsided.  When he finally gathered the courage to open his
eyes, he looked up into the swaying branches of an old, huge tree.
The thought of location was of secondary
importance.  For now, he was just glad to be on the ground, and safe.
After a moment of exaltation, he realized that he had rolled into a large
bush full of long, rather pointy leaves and that he was in a very
painful position.  Rolling out of the bushes, he sat for a second and
realized he wouldn't get his balance back anytoo soon.  Below him,
Goran saw a path running down the plush, unspoiled hillside.
.nf

	"Alright, I'll find out where it goes..."  Smiling,
	he looks up to the sky and closes his eyes....
	"When I feel like it."

K'val sat looking down at the table of elves peering back at her.
After a second she stood up and laughed.
.nf

	"You people can't do ANYTHING by yourself!"

.fi
Turning, she walked down the same old road to the same old shack
that she'd visited in the past.  As she walked in, she surprised
Thaelin in the middle of trying to juggle four rocks at the same
time.  He lost all but one.
He gave K'val a dirty look as she threw herself onto his couch.
.nf

	"Sit down, make yourself at home..."

"She's grown up a lot since Goran died, but she's always going
to be my little whirlwind..."  Thaelin chuckled, to himself.
.nf

	"I just don't BELIEVE those people!"  Sitting
	with her arms crossed, K'val clenched her teeth
	in anger. "Ever since they found out who's daughter
	I am, they keep coming to me for EVERY LITTLE THING!
	-- I can't stand it anymore..."

	"It's been a while, but they still remember both
	your mother aran... They'll forget, someday."
.bp
.sp 2

	"Ok, so, here I am, a Guardian... Big deal!!"
	K'val get's up and starts pacing around the room.
	"Everything's changed!  Raan went back home to his
	people, Granu Rika runs an Amusement Island, his
	trainees started harems... And I've been running
	this place -- and it doesn't even need to be RUN!"

	"So, everything's all very peaceful now..." Looking
	at her, Thaelin adds  "And you think it stinks."

	"I can't stand it anymore, that's all."

	"So?"  Thaelin smiles.

	"So, I'm going to either go to Central and
	get frozen..." K'val flinched. "Or, I'm going
	to some less-normal colony planet and see what
	I can find!"

	"And you'll get there, turn around and have Gia
	take you back home... "  Thaelin could see the
	bad reaction to that comment. "Just be glad that
	the human part of you lets you spend time away
	from Terra!  Anyway, you can't go to find another
	colony because there aren't any new ones around here!"

	"Yes there is!  There's New Arion!  And if they
	are anything like Cheets' was, I'd like to try
	staying with them for a while."  Sighing,
	"And just because full-bred elves can't up and
	leave Terra for more than a week, that doesn't
	mean I have to stay.  There are other elves out
	in Scoon Sector..."

	"Yeh, and they can't leave their planets either!
	And New Arion is a Banche'on colony, `halfling'!"
.fi

Thaelin made his point, but she was still in one of her
non-compromising moods -- inheritted from her mother.
She was waiting for him to give in and say 'yes'.  He said
yes to her so often because wherever she goes in a mood
like this, Gia always is around every corner...
Thaelin was hoping she'd find a mate and settle down, but
neither has happened.  Even if she did find someone, she'd
probably only slow down temporarily.  Someone said that
immortality makes individuals into lazy, inanimate fools.
So far, everyone with that blessing has either been like
K'val and didn't waste a tick, or like Goran and got killed
before they could let it settle in.

Thaelin threw his one remaining juggling rock to her...

.nf
	"Go!  But get back here before fall and
	the weather starts to change!  I'm not going
	to freeze this winter because of your vacation.
	Yes! I mean it!!"  He shouted out the door.

But she had already hugged him goodbye.

At the edge of a forest, New Arion's only boarding hut stood
like a big brown monument to the little village's victory over
the wild woods beyond.  It was late fall and there would be very few people
heading through town on this small colony planet.
For the moment there were just a few small gatherings that were held
in the only multi-family house around.  The hut was run by a jolly
and rather stubby female that liked to help anyone in general.
She ends up giving little jobs to strangers that need help and
supplies to get to wherever they are headed.  One of the strangers
she took in ended up staying there for the last two months.
When the resident traveler first appeared, she had a hard time
with the language being used, but after a while,
the young female started making sense.  Since then, the matron
had kept her around, teaching her about the customs and having
her modify and fix whatever equipment the settlers broke.
Soon, the junior settler had made a reputation of being a
strangely intuitive person.

One fall day, the matron of the house sat, trying to figure out
how to fix a flakey cooler while the boarder tinkered
with a little cylindrical pump underneath the counter.  A door opened
across the room from where the two were wrestling with the faulty unit.
.br
A young male stumbled across the room and sat, leaning against
the counter while he waited for the attention of the owner.
Giving up, the matron finally cursed and made a comment to
the female under the counter.  Looking over to the stranger
that just walked in, she slaps the counter and makes a comment
about not having anything to drink until it starts running
again.  The stranger looked perplexed.  She asked what she
could do for him.
.nf

	"I'm affraid I can't understand a word
	you are saying..." The stranger said.

.fi
The female under the counter jumped up and hit her head so
hard that both the owner and the stranger looked to see if
she was alright.  She groan-cursed something short while
she backed out from under the counter.
.nf

	"Are you alright?!" The stranger asked.

The female froze, then jumped up and turned to the stranger.

	"GOR-AN!!!!"  She grabbed the stranger and
	hugged him.  "Goran..."  Cheetsak started
	crying uncontrolably.  "Grrran! You're..."

	"Cheets'??!!"  It took a second for all
	of his memory to come back.  When it did,
	Goran found himself collapsed on the floor
	with Cheets' holding him, looking concerned.

	Cheetsak smiled.  "Okay? My little luvealu?!?"

	Goran weakly smiled and tried to get up again.
	"Cheets', love, you're standing on my tail..."

I'd won.
The excitement of the moment filters back in bursts of dizzy
and violent moments of soaring, charging, intense fractions
of a total, huge battle.
Long range high-speed fights of immense power and cunning.
Blurring stars and intimately synced controls shooting through
time and space at a rate where standard thought processes fail.

Warning, warning, and then total destruction.
Scenes of momentarily static matter torn and vaporised by
high, staccato bursts of totally controled and directed
energy.  The enemy wins by large numbers and mind control.
We, by technology and magic, and faith.  Our numbers small,
we walk the line of trust and trechery.  Homeless, we
guard the ones we love.  In that, they become our family
and give us the support we must have to survive.
Our power is bottled and ready to unleash on those who
attack us.
We exist for those to survive.  Not martyrs, but Gaurdians.

At the edge of a sparsely populated galaxy, a four-winged, long range
destroyer ship hurdles past a small group of star systems.  The ship
behind it, an indigo-blue Sandbat fighter, follows just out of firing
range.  Just as the fighter comes within range and readies its high-powered
weaponry, the destroyer swerves towards a small star and drops out of hyperspace.  The
pilot of the Sandbat, having been caught off-guard by the maneuver, swings
past the system and cuts in the forward engines.  Diverting the excess
power to the shielding systems, the Sandbat slips into a shallow orbit
around the star.
Without being told, the ship starts scanning the circling planetary

A deep blue-black morning sky enfolds a peaceful elfin village.
As the first orange rays of sunlight peek over the horizon, a sleepy
mother-elf herds her children down to a nearby stream to fetch the
morning's water.  She bends to see the sun glistening on the
water...

At the edge of a sparsely populated galaxy, a four-winged, long range
destroyer ship hurdles past a small group of star systems.
Sweat dripping from blonde human helmetted hair, the destroyer pilot
tries to keep from panicking.  Above, now below, now aside, a gold-and-purple
streak darts and swipes at the ship's four wings.  The craft
tagging the destroyer, a Rarakas Sandbat fighter, toys and swats at
its prey.
Pushing the destroyer to its limit, the pilot tries desparately to escape
the blurred streak.  Watching the destroyer's engines start to melt, the
Sandbat pilot waits for the desired outcome -- the destruction of the other ship
without firing a shot...
.br
The Sandbat pushed harder, swinging above, aside, then in front of the
destroyer.  At that instant, there was a flash and the destroyer sunk
to a tiny white spot far behide the fighter.  In the moment that the
Sandbat dropped in front of the other ship,
the destroyer swerved toward a small star and dropped out of hyperspace.  The
pilot of the Sandbat, having been caught off-guard by the maneuver, swings
past the system and cuts in the forward engines.  Diverting the excess
power to the shielding systems, the Sandbat slips into a shallow orbit
around the star.
Without being told, the ship starts scanning the circling planetary
system.  The pilot of the fighter leans forward and grabs the controls
as the ship stops scanning and reactivates its targeting console.

They have found their target.

The pilot grins and lets out a low growl -- exposing the long
razor-sharp fangs that his race takes great pride in.

THE NIMICK EXPERIMENT
.sp 4
.ti 5
In the late 20th century, a group of computer-science
students and para-psychologists, headed by spiritualist
Franz Nimick, worked together to generate a machine-spirit
linkup.  The computer (a very old, slow unit using capacitive
memory planes) acted as an easily manipulated interface
component between physical and non-physical worlds.
.ti 5
The computer served as an extensional mechanism much as
the ouija board did to hundreds of generations in the
past.
Primarily, the initial linkup was created by the psychics,
with the psycho-kinetic energy of the immaterial being affecting the memory planes
of the computer.  The programming of the computer was
difficult due to the unpredictability of the energy formation.
.ti 5
Two years into the experiment a breakthrough came with the
realization of a repeating pattern being generated in the
lower five planes of memory.  They had a working link with
no common language between the parties involved.  A slow,
simple system of coding was initially created to give a
yes/no/maybe response system that could be used by everyone
involved.  It was at this point that they tried to teach
their "resident ghost" a more complex and flexible system
of two-way comunication.
Soon after this initial step, they found their 'ghost'
to be very helpful in refining the software
and hardware needed to accomplish an effective
interface between the two worlds.
.ti 5
The spirit that lent the guidance in evolving the system,
who never gave it's name, also had a hard time in keeping
other, less reliable beings from entering into the machine.
After long weekends, some of the team members would start
a conversation with the other party, only to have a long string
of insults and offensive words come over all the terminals.
It wouldn't take long for the resident spirit to kick off
the intruding beings and clean up the mess that they caused
(many times the equipment would be torn-apart by the experience).
"Ghost", what the technicians called the spirit, was sometimes morose, sometimes philosophical, but always
helpful in the advice that it gave -- especially when it came to dealing
with the various governmental agencies that were constantly poking around.
.ti 5

The project ended six months later when the resident spirit
said that it was time for man to leave the earth, step into
space and that there was no time to lose.  When the people involved asked more about it's last
comment, they got no reply.  That was the last time they had heard
from the spirit. The small two-room shack that the group was
using burned down that night -- the cause was an electrical fire.
.sp 2
On the other side of the planet, an equally-small group
of East-German scientists were duplicating the experiment.
Only they contacted a different spirit...

Another empty room,  She moves to the next one and enters the
code.  Cheetsak readies herself as she hits the last
digit.  There's a sharp click as the door opens and in the
same instant the door at the end of the corridor slides back.
She spins and aims into the center of the target.

It's a boy.  A Xannite soldier that couldn't be more than
a day past puberty.  Helmet too big, uniform baggy, no armor,
standing there pointing a gun at her
-- Scared half into shock at the sight of her.  Cheetsak raises
her hand in a gesture of "I don't want to hurt you...".  He won't
shoot, he's too scared.

There's a flash.

Cheets' hits the wall, an explosion of heat and pain from
her body blocking out all thoughts.  Clutching at the wall, she
slides to the floor, whimpering in agony.
She glances at her side and at the boy, turns to the
wall and swears through her clenched teeth.  Cheetsak
takes a breath, knowing that her lower lungs and heart no-longer
exist, and lets the pain drain quickly away with her life.

At the other end of the building, Goran feels a sharp spasm run
through him.  His breath knocked out of him, he spins to see what
caused it.  There was nothing behind him. He stared long at the empty
hallway before him.  Feeling something wrong, he turns back and
sees her...

        "Cheets'??!"
(Chance Meeting-last 30 seconds)

Everything faded away as he touched her. They were alone, together.
She looked more beautiful than he'd ever seen her, radiant in all ways.
Clothes, armor, distance, disappeared along with their fear.
They kissed, softly, gently, like the first time they'd kissed.
A kiss that seemed to last forever.
A warmth surrounded them.  He touched her face as she took his hands
and drew back.  On her face was a smile of love and sadness that
said more than all the words in the universe could ever say.
Mostly, as he held her hands, he knew her smile meant "goodby".

Goran tried to speak, but there was nothing left to say.
Cheets' glanced away, then looked deeply into Goran's eyes.
The brightness all around seemed to become part of her and she
seemed to fall asleep.  The brightness faded.  A wave of
empty coldness snapped through him and Goran found himself back
in the empty hallway, alone.  Sharp yellow loneliness surrounded
him in his suit.  His arms held out, still holding hands no-longer there.
He closed his eyes and began trembling from shock.

(Both Ends Burning (live))

Gia felt a tremendous jolt as Cheetsak's ship broke from its
escort position and dived, all engines full out, back toward
the Xannite star-system.  She understood, feeling some of
what Goran had just experienced on the planet below.
And Gia understood how the ship felt, for she'd felt it
before.  Cheetsak had given life to her ship, it was now
time to give it back...

.bp
.sp 4
In the hold of the Banche'on trader ship, a dark globe,
a device and element, unlocks from it's safety mount and
waits to be triggered.  Created by Cheetsak out of vengeful
paranoia, the globe was tagged Novastar.  Its harmlessness
only broken by the raw force of a massive explosion.

The power-tow freighter pushed itself way past its limits
as it made a mad leap towards the center of the Xannite
confederacy's twelve-planet star complex.
Massive defensive satellites fired at the ship.  Thousands
of interlacing beams crossed and slashed around the freighter.
But the ship was way out of range of the guns accuracy.
The guns were placed perfectly to intercept anything heading
for any of the confederacy planets, but the freighter wasn't
thinking of the planets.  The solid mind in the ship wanted
nothing more than to create the violent emptiness that tore
through its woven-metal body.   For now he'd never hear its pilot's
voice, or the security and control of her touch.
Now, to carry out her wishes.  Now, to "tasch" -- to "take down
all around you".
The freighter charged on.  Engines, screaming at full power,
began to warp and melt under the stress.  Past the planets, guns
silent, the ship shot towards the dual star.
Almost between them.  Lock the engines to overload...

Gia was still watching the ship as she sped away from the
system.  She waited until she saw the flash from between
the two stars before she jumped to hyperspace.  It was a small
flash.  An explosion replaced by a tiny dark spot.  Gia
knew what would happen next.
Into hyperspace and out, to a safe vantage point.
She came to a dead halt, flipped over, and, facing the
Xannite stars, waited.
Watching it happen was her only way to say "farewell".

The streetcreep stood picking his nose and licking his sweaty upper lip.
The new Naratsa Aratai was across from him in the sifty alley.  Naratsa
tugged tensely on his single mock-gold earring and waited -- waited for
what he'd waited too long for.
.sp
He had the streetcreep on hold.  If the
self hipnogsis wore off now, he'd tear up anything in sight, including
himself.  Naratsa didn't care. Once this was over, he'd be out of here,
off the planet and out of sight.  Maybe he'd even become Raanarati again.
It was a big step, from the son of The Govenor to a sweating, filthy
scumball.  He laughed to himself and tried to stave off a sudden attack
of bronchial coughing brought on by the heavy chemical soot in the air.
.ti 5
The streetcreep gave Natatsa a single, empty look and continued picking
unseen objects off his skin.  Naratsa didn't care what happened to him,
as long as he got what he wanted tonight.  After revenge, life was simply
a favorable option.  He looked out onto the empty street, flooded with
the eerie horrorshow light given off by the hundreds of night-plates lining
the deserted route.
Waiting.  If he could only turn his mind off like the 'creep.  Wiping
the crusted dirt from his eyes, Naratsa touched the cool metal cylinder
to his forehead.  He was going to win tonight.  He had a Prod.
Rolling the palm-sized bluemetal between his eyebrows, Naratsa took
a deep breath and made a knife-sweep with the little metal poker. It'll
disable all the circuitry in a power suit and turn it into a heavy heap
of trash.  There's less than two seconds of energy in it and it must
be used with instant precision.  Just one quick touch -- then it'll be
their turns to die...
.ti 5
Naratsa knew.  He knew their ID numbers, their habits, their vices, their
weaknesses.  He knew.  He knew where they go where there is no surveilance.
He knew that this area was off limits to Xannite soldiers.  The NO-GO zone.
The pits of the city, where everything can be had for a price, and some guts.
Everything.  He knew he'd get what he wanted.
.br
.sp
A sound.
.sp
.ti 5
It was them.  He snapped his fingers in the 'creeps face, phase one, and
handed him the meter-long metal pipe that was to be the 'creep's very
own weapon.  Naratsa turned the corner of the alley, squatted down, and
started rocking against the wall of the decrepit building.  Huddled in
a ball, they'll think he's a Kype-er going through withdrawal -- and
proceed to beat him to a pulp.  He knew them.  He knew too well.
It took them fourteen seconds to turn the corner and walk up to him.
The first soldier chuckled, and pushed Raan's head against the wall,
the second took a step back to get a good kick in.
.sp
Naratsa, Raan, smiled at them.

	"Give us a kiss!!!"

He touched the cylinder to the two power-suits as the streetcreep
flew out of the alleyway, triggered by the phrase.
The world became a lightning-whip ballet of strobe-charged movement.
.bp
.sp 5
In a flash,
the 'creep had dented-in the front of the second soldier and kept hitting
at him in between breaths.
Naratsa swung the other, top heavy, Xannite into the building
and, in the same movement, grabbed a matching metal pipe from the alley.
Before his soldier could get to his feet, stuggling against the weight
of the now-dead power-suit, Naratsa spun the pipe into the midsection
of the soldier and neatly crushed half his ribs.  He stood over the groping
body, the sound of metal on metal comming from the now-hyper streetcreep,
and brought the pipe down on the helmet latch.  The visor slid open. He
wanted to see his face one last time.  The face looked hurt and puzzled.
Raan, Naratsa, took out a small threedee pad and exposed to the face a
slowly moving picture of a young, beautiful girl -- the one he'd raped,
tortured, and left a dieing vegatable.  Now the face knew. He knew too
well.  Raan swung the pipe again, into the soldier's arms, then into
the open helmet.  The dull crushing sound left him feeling numb, and
good.  He dropped the pipe and grabbed the streetcreep, pulling him
into the alley.  He shook the Prod in front of the 'creep.

	"Give this to your friends, they'll know what to
	do with it."  Sticking the Prod into the still
	hyper 'creep's pocket, Raan snapped his fingers.

Raan pushed the 'creep down the alley and lept onto a rusty
platform at the end farthest from the street. He hit the ground
one level below and headed for Teesoh Station, new clothes, new
face, new ID, and a new life -- all of his old one was now dead.

The two ships continued to reminisce...


Dagger slowly ran through a scene showing some
children, now grown with children of their own, playing tag and wrestling around 
a short distance from the festivities.
Gia's view moved along the length of the
long, low, table that the food had been laid
out upon.  She scanned quickly down the
row of diners to fix on a shot of the large robed
figure sitting next to
Thaelin, his wife, and children.
Dagger was following Gia's remembered images as fast
as it could, but the difference in mentalities between
the ships was allowing Gia to daydream between bursts.
She kept sending her views.

The crowd of elves at the table suddenly became rather
quiet and began glancing about at one an other.
Gia instinctively changed her view of memory to see what
it was that caused the change in the mood -- so long ago.
She looked at Thaelin's eyes to see where to look, then locked
on a young female elf trudging up the path leading to the table.
Even though the elf had an almost savage look about her, she had
the unmistakable air of command and power that few are born with and
even fewer know how to control.

Gia's mind let out an internal yelp as she remembered what she
was inadvertently sending to Dagger.  In a panic, she rearranged
massive stores of memory and quickly changed the view being sent
to the other ship -- while continuing to watch the images she had
recalled.  Her brain is running split now.  Handling her old conversation
with Dagger and discreetly watching what she is trying to keep secret.

.in 5
The elf reached the top of the hill, sighed, seeing the sight of all
the fearful elves, and sat across from the robed creature at the table.
Thaelin quickly started signalling to the others to act normally,
gracefully spilling a glass of wine onto his lap.
It didn't work, they were all still silently watching the stalky
blonde elf at the end of the table.
They were also noticing that she hadn't taken her eyes off of their
visiting celebrity.  When Goran glanced over at her, she quickly looked down
and started picking through the food piled around in front of her.

The assembly of elves at the table were now looking only at Goran,
and Goran knew it.  They had just seen something they'd never seen before and
weren't acting very calmly about it.  They just saw the High Priestess
look away and act shyly towards a person.  Someone giggled out of
nervousness and got a deadly glare from her.
Thaelin started getting nervous as well when he noticed that Goran
was only paying attention to V'teah and nothing else.

.in 0
What happened next was hard for Gia to classify.

Some kind of semi-hostile instinctive mental-message passed
between Thaelin and V'teah -- something like "If you did anything
to him !!!!".  Then an answer came back from her -- "How DARE you!!??",
and "No, not I.  Don't fear, Chief..."

.bp
.sp 4
.in 5
Evidently some of the others at the table caught some of the
conversation and looked at Thaelin in awe.  No one ever crossed V'teah!
-- Up until now.
Goran seemed to understand Thaelin's concern and gave him a
comforting nod.
XXX stood up and stepped around to V'teah's
side of the table.  Pausing, Goran took a deep breath, smiled,
and held out his hand to the little sorceress.
A strange, warm wave visibly ran through the two as their
fingers touched.  Hand in hand, they
walked slowly down the hill as she led him to her part of the forest.

It took a while for all of the events to sink into the elves at the
table.  As soon as they'd figured out the significance of what had
just happened, they decided to continue the celebration on that
theme -- Even though they weren't sure what the theme was.
Nothing stops an elven feast.

.in 0
Gia broke out of her daydream from the past and continued swapping
scenes with Dagger and comparing them with the feast at hand.
Making very sure that what she had just remembered didn't go across to
the other ship.  She had taken great pains
to erase those images from Dagger's memory.
Not to mention the hours that she spent removing
V'teah from Goran's past.

Alone on a mountain top, a stalky, young elf maiden kneels
and bows her head to the gently blowing wind.  She traces a
sweeping arc close to the ground and looks up into the
deepening night sky.
Again, she calls out in silent prayer to the immense spirit
of Terra that gave her her life and power.
She is one with the planet, a child of the spirit, and understands
herself and all that is around her.  But now she is frustrated and
angry -- at the Earth and at herself for being angry.

The elfin priestess holds her arms out to the cool night wind and stars.
The wind grows stronger, the stars brighter, until they shine
and dance in her golden hair.
Her mind touches that of life and strength and pleads for
the answer to her question.

"I am your child. I love you. Since my birth, you have
given me your love, strength, and guidance.  But now
you have given me the burning need for a mate. You
do this and yet I am still alone. There is no one here
that I feel I could take as mate and partner until I die.
Yet you have given me a desire from which I am granted no
peace.  IF IT IS MY TIME THEN SPARE ME FROM THIS LONELINESS!
If you must, THEN BY DEATH. But I MUST have someone to be with, to need, to love..."

She clasps her hands close to her heart as tears well in her
eyes.  The wind slows, becomes calm and caressing.  Bowing her head, a solemn smile
comes to her slowly.  A warmth fills her body and mind.

Deep inside, V'teah knew her wish would come true.  Her years
of painful loneliness would soon come to an end.

Next morning, a crowd was forming around Thaelin's home.  There
was to be festivities today -- for the Chief Guardian, the defender of their people, has come to

Avoiding a sleeping drunk on the steps, the young, clean-cut
man steps out of the abandoned building's doorway and down to
the dirty street below.  He was hardly noticed by the occupants
of the slums surrounding him.  Clean looking business-types were
in abundance in this area, especially when a very wealthy foriegner
decides to buy everything up and plunge it all into a healthy
economy.  In the past three weeks, the young stranger has become
a good friend of one of the county surveyors. The surveyor, a short,
very vulnerable looking young woman, was the only civil person he had met
since he had started his assessment of this decaying city.

Seeing her, he moves down the filth-ridden street to where she
was solemnly setting up her measurement equipment.  A smile
comes to her face as she looks up from her little metal briefcase.
Her hair, light blonde and pulled back off her shoulders, seemed
to be the only thing unaffected by the sooty air that clings to
and soils everything it touches.
They joke about the day's comming event; the new owner of this
mess is coming by to see his newest, but not last, land acquisition.
They try to prolong their conversation by talking about anything
they could bring to mind.  Then, after sharing a common, lonely,
look, they parted company and began finishing up the last stages
of accounting the now-valuable waste about them.

The young man walked back to the building he had left an hour ago.
The drunk's location was now being taken up by a group of tense
private security people.  Having just completed a search through
all the other buildings on the lower end of the street, they stopped
the young man and demanded his identification.
Handing it to them, he explained that, like everyone else, he had to
complete his survey before the 'big meeting' that was scheduled just
after the owner's tour of the area.  After a long examination and
questioning, the security people let him through and up inside
the building to complete his listing of plumbing and scrap-metal.

He reached the roof one minute and thirty seconds before the
land-baron was to arrive.  Moving across the gravel roof, the
accountant takes off his sunglasses and pulls the top of a
broken ventilation hood off and dropped the small case to the
gravel rooftop.  Hearing the din of the approaching crowd below,
the man snaps the pieces into place and, placing his glasses back
onto the bridge of his nose, aligns himself along the edge of the
roof.  Far below him, the street was filling with the foolish followers
of the torturing dictator -- a man who simply buys what he wants and
only condones violence for pleasure.

The sights on the gun still at wide-angle, the accountant sees the
baron, his immediate guards, the crowds around him.
He clicks the safety off -- Then his snap reflexes picked up
something wrong.  It took him a second to comprehend the reason
why he moved the sights from the baron and closed it onto the
sidewalk nearby...   In the midst of all the high security and
crowds, there was a man with a knife dragging someone aside.

.bp
.sp 4
It was the young blonde woman that he'd grown so fond of.
A half-thought passed in indecision, he must take the baron,
he must be stopped...

Four shots sputtered out and the mugger flies backwards in shreads
as the terrified surveyor screams and turns away from the bloody
mass on the sidewalk.   The scope recenters on the baron, already
ducking behind his security men.  The trigger pulled, a low whurring
sound signals the firing of all two-hundred rounds towards the group.
Before the accountant could see them hit, his body is flung backwards
by a series of slugs from the counter-snipers' guns.

Below the edge of the building, the accountant whimpers as he quickly
bleeds to death in agony on the rooftop.  He feels his senses
go and he sobs as even the loneliness starts flowing out of his body
with his blood.
He sees the image of a great black bird and hears a soft, low, beautifuly
feminine voice surround his entire being.

	"Back to me again... poor dear..."

.fi
The attack squad cautiously worked their way to the top
of the abandoned building -- to kill the assassin who killed
their leader.
The squad captain finally made his way to the
top floor and burst onto the roof.  In the noonday sun,
he made a complete sweep of the roof and found only
a gun, covered with semi-dry blood, and two hundred-and-four
empty cartridges scattered around in the gravel.

The assassin was never found.

There was a long pause.  Goran could sense her sincerity.  It was
all she wanted -- for now. 

The last thing I want is a trainee that'll change her mind right

I'd just as soon have her as a trainee than Raan.  If she were only

	in a fun-bar.  Hardly the kind of person to
	invite to a get-together of elvin royalty !"
	Thinking for a second, "And you'd better limit
	that keg for Lutattah.  There's nothing worse
	than a drunk Banche' !   I can't pick her up by
	myself -- so you better have a dozen strong
	friends around if she passes out !"

K'val breaks in --

	"Wait a minute, what's a `Ban-cheh' ?"

Thaelin is about to answer when Goran cuts him off --
.bp
.sp 6

	"If you haven't seen one, then I won't explain."
	Walking out the door to his ship, "But you'll see
	one soon enough -- at your feast."
.fi

Goran pulls himself up into his ship and has Gia do a `spinning
ascent' -- a flying salute to the wide-eyed crowds watching his
departure.

On his way back to Central, Goran sat thinking about K'val's
abilities and whether or not she'd make it as a Guardian. The
fact that she would only be the fourth elf to make Guardian
status in over seventeen millenia doesn't help matters either.

Now, how will I test her...

.nf
	"Gia, what kind of info' did you get back
	when you sent that history-pack I requested?"

	"What do you want to know ??"

	"I'm considering her as a trainee.  Why?  Did
	you get back that much ?"  Usually Gia summarizes
	minor reports like this. "I just want your
	opinion about her."

	"Well, physically, she's fine. But mentally.."
	pausing with thought, "She is a little... funny."

	Goran's voice takes on a stern, fatherly tone.
	"You are getting ambiguous again  -- Are you trying
	to hide something from me, or are you just confused?"

	"Well, on that history pack you ordered, I'd
	probe her every now and then -- to see how well
	she took in the data.  First, I started with
	sensory input, but she took to direct linkup
	in a flash -- quite a bit faster than you did!"

Goran shifts in his seat and continues listening to his ship's report.

	"I sped up the burst rate - but I was afraid
	that it might burn her out.  Mental collapse."

	"Good, don't take any chances with her."

	"But, when I slowed down, the requests continued.
	So I got nervous and tried to see if she was an
	undercover agent. I did a complete scan of all of
	her different layers of memory and came up with
	nothing but trivial incidents -- nothing unusual."
.bp
.sp 4

	"I wonder if there is any other of her people
	with those traits..."

	"I probed around, they all do.  But, K'val is much
	more powerful than all the others.  I asked Dagger
	and he agrees -- he also said that K'val's mother was
	similarly endowed."

	"Hold on ! Who is this  `Dagger' ?"

	"Thaelin's ship.  Don't you remember ?"

	"We all can't have perfect memories !"  Goran settles
	back in his pilot's seat, "Check her genetic pattern.
	You did remember to map-out a copy of it ?"

	"Of course."

	"I knew you would."

.fi
The ship continued out into a starless void at the standard cruising
speed. Then for no apparent reason, it slows to a relative halt.
.nf

	"Anything else before we go in?"  Gia asks.

	"No, go ahead -- I can't stay out here all day..."

.fi
The stars blur into a jigsaw-puzzle of light as the ship changes
position a thousand times a second -- dancing out the entry code
to the stargate of Central.  Gia breaks into hyperspace for the last
two-thousand maneuvers and glides through the green doorway
markers. She get the impression of `home' as she feels Central's
security systems scanning over her hull. If a foreign ship appeared at
the doorway, Central would make a number of attempts to contact it, scan
it, then if it still couldn't identify the ship or its passengers, destroy it.

A series of multi-colored stars slide past the ship as it navigates
through a maze of `gaps', bi-dimensional corridors separating the
space around Central.
It took three times for Goran to work his way back to his part of the
station the first time he had to weave his ship through them.
.ti 5

The markers disappear as Gia enters the holding bay that she
had left earlier that day. She slows down as the yellow footpath
emerges out of the blackness.

Goran sat motionless for a long time after docking. In his mind,
he thought about the recent incidents and what Dagger -- that
old battle-worn ship -- had said.  "Any action?"
.br
History repeats itself with painful accuracy. So it would only
be a matter of time before another deranged leader decided
to send his people on a mad rush for power.
.bp
.sp 6

Guardians see so few times of peace. Even those times are
tarnished by memories of prior battles. "And the Guardian shall
sleep while the good thrive..." -- a line from the `holy books'
of a dozen planets. What they don't mention is that the major
cause of death for the Guardians, other than in the line of duty,
is suicide.

.nf
	"My duty -- bullshit !  I've never done anything else."

Gia makes a soft sound of agreement.

.fi
Maybe it's time to end this once and for all. Maybe, but how?
This struggle has gone on for hundreds-of-thousands of years.
Why should it end now? Why should it end?
.nf

	"It'll never end -- I should know."

Goran looks up at the console of his ship and sighs.

	"I didn't notice you probing me..."

	"I didn't have to. I could feel your despair."

	"I can't hide anything from you."  Goran
	stops and thinks, "You say you should know,
	then why not tell me? You've been around
	longer than anyone living or dead. Even
	the older Sandbats are infants when compared
	to your age and experience. What IS your real
	age -- in units that I can relate to."

	"I'm older than you could comprehend, and it's
	for that reason that I can't tell you what I
	know.  You simply aren't old enough, yet."

	"Who is in charge here anyway! Am I supposed
	be taking orders from you?!?" He starts drumming
	his fingers on the flight controls. The sound of
	metal-on-metal makes a harsh clacking sound
	throughout the cockpit. "You have always been
	TOO humble -- why treat a worthless fossil like
	me with respect? You can think at least ten-billion
	times faster than I can -- and yet you still sit and
	listen to my childish ideas..."

	"Everything has to start somewhere -- you're learning
	slowly."  Gia's voice becoming very reassuring, "You
	have a lot to learn, but you have a long time to learn
	it in !"
.bp
.sp 5

	"Yes -- Mother."  Gia laughs and makes a remark about
	being too young to be his mother as Goran picks himself
	up out of the control seat. "Can I go now?.."

	"Of course," opening the bottom hatch, "Lutattah is
	down in Bay 161 -- just got in."

	"Well, as long as you're keeping track, where's Raan?"

	"In the gym -- playing six-wall Tachi."

	"Good! Maybe he'll work off some of that nasty
	personality..."

.fi
Goran thinks back to the time when he used to play Tachi for ten
hours at a time -- quite a feat.
Tachi is one of the few weightless games that can
destroy you both mentally and physically. The object of the game is
to deflect the Tachi-ball into a goal-hole while avoiding your
opponents' ball. The balls, hard silicone twelve-sided spheres,
are shot simultaneously from opposite goals at speeds from zero
to seventy meters per second. Each player has an arm shield that
is both protection and a means to divert the ball's course.
.br
Helmets are optional.
.br
The side with the first ball in the opponents' goal wins.

.nf
	"Maybe Raan'll get that ball permanently jammed
	in that big mouth of his."  Goran still talking
	to his ship as he walks along the yellow footpath
	and through the shielded door-hatch.

.fi
Goran takes off his armor and walks down to the control-room that's
the focal point of the hallways that lead to the living quarters
and the various storage and recreation areas. Each of the three `flats',
the living areas for the individual Guardians, is the size of a large,
three-story house. 
The top floor is usually a bedroom, the bottom - a room to make into
anything one pleases, and the middle floor is the main living and dining
room with doors leading to hallways that
connect with the other two flats.

Within a week of his arrival, Raan had created enough of a nuisance
that Lutattah forced him out of his flat and into an empty storage
room. Goran would've kicked him out before she did
if Raan weren't the son of a high official on one of his sector's
planets. Lutattah said she simply didn't care and proceeded to throw
Raan down the length of the corridor and into the waiting storage
compartment. All of his defensive/offensive training was worthless
against the young, battle-trained Banche'.

.bp
.sp 6
Goran sent a personal (scrambled) message to Raan's father explaining
the incident and added --

"If Raan doesn't grow up, he won't live long enough to make it through
his Final Training -- being a punk is a fatal mistake in this business."

When a return message came in the next day, Raan was surprised to find
out that his father agreed with Lutattah and commended her for taking on
`the little snake'.

.ti 5
Goran adjusts his robe and falls into the seat in front of Central's
main computer console.  He thinks to himself --

"I could ask Central to search for the clues I want, but that's sometimes
a big mistake -- I'll know what I'm looking for when I see it."

A moment later, a flood of data fills up five of the eight displays
with continuously changing images.  Goran takes in all the data
by way of a direct mental link with the computer. It was one of the
first things Gia had taught him to do.

A fraction of a second later, the screens freeze and begin moving up in
time to where K'val's mother was born.  Goran slowly traced
all of her movements, noting all of the beings -- so far, all elves --
that she came in contact with.  Indeed, she was very adept at sorcery.
Many incidents indicated that, for short periods of time,
she had taken total control of the global weather patterns -- definitely
not a spell for beginners!
.nf

	"Hey, let me see... K'val means 'wind',
	or something in elf?"

	"Storm-child, to be exact..."  comments Central.

	"Yeh, I thought so..."

.fi
.ti 5
Scanning forwards through the records, Goran found that K'val's
mother was becoming more and more involved with the war as she grew older.

Then the displays went blank;  A silence in his mind.

Goran sat there, shocked...

.nf
	"Central !  What the hell do you think you're doing !?"

	"I'm very sorry, but you are bordering on 
	restricted data."
.bp
.sp 4

	"So !?  I have 01 license !  Let me see it !"

	"You need 00 to access that time-slate."

	"We'll see !   Gia, patch in and suck out what is locked
	in Central's buffer -- he says I need 00 to read it !"

	"I am afraid he's right -- I can read it, but I can't
	tell you anything I find out...  Sorry."

.fi
Goran lets loose with a searing burst of curses for his cybernetic
antagonists.  He slumps back into the deep cushions of his seat.
.nf

"Ok, it's my move.  I wish I'd learned chess when I was a kid !"

Goran tugs on his beard and tries to calm down.

"If I can't find out from them, then it's up to me..."
He thinks about all the things he CAN do with 01 license.


	"Got it!"  He sits up and smiles at the
	blank screens. "Central, I hereby impose
	a lock on all communications not directly
	authorized by ME on a individual basis.
	That includes with Gia, all ships, bases,
	EVERYTHING !"

	"I don't see what that will achieve !"
	Central stating what Goran expected Gia to
	be thinking down in the ships' holding
	room --   It wasn't.

	"You will keep us informed about anything
	going on outside, of course."   Central
	acknowledging Goran's silly request.  He
	continues, "If I find out that there is
	jabbering going on between you and the
	ships -- I'll find a way to shut you down."

	"Ok, but I still don't underst..."

	"That is ALL, now shut up !"

.fi
He folds his hands and congratulates himself for his genius.
Through all of his self-envy, he still couldn't shake off
the terrible feeling of insecurity that not being in control
brings.  After all, why should Gia have 00 and not I ?
.bp
.sp 6

Goran was so lost in thought that he didn't hear the dull 'clomp-clomp'
sound of Lutattah half creeping up behind him.
She reaches around the sides of the chair and grabs Goran in 
the sides -- almost sending him through the ceiling.

.nf
	"Lute ! You scared me shitless you big
	clod-stomper !!"  settling back into his
	chair, "-- and quit laughing `Horse-ass' !"

	"Ooooh!  Humans like to live dangerously, don't
	they !"  Smiling, Lutattah reaches down and wraps
	her fingers around his neck in a mock strangle-hold
	then starts massaging his shoulders. "You feel like
	you've had a dirty day..."

	"Just frustrating. Central won't let me see something
	in its files, so I froze its chatterbox -- no ice cream
	for him tonight !"  Lutattah knows what ice cream is,
	but still didn't pick up the analogy. "And besides,
	I still don't know why Granu chased that pilot into
	our sector -- with our luck, we'll end up with another
	war on our hands !"  Searching for something else to say,
	"And where'd you go to today?"

	"I did some poking around on Codiah and ran into an old
	smuggler-friend of mine.  He said that all of Scoon is
	becoming infested with Xannite soldiers -- unofficially,
	of course."  She checks the safety on her blaster, unhooks
	her holster,  and  starts untieing her halter-top.
	"We may have to help in arranging some nasty accidents
	-- and that's always fun."

	"Ha !  The original Dealer of Death !"  Twirling
	around in the control-seat, "Miss corruption herself!"

	"Ah, Mrs. Corruption -- I thought I knew how to be
	sneaky, until I met you.."

.fi
Goran just sat there, chin in hand, admiring the view.

We're not really married, neither of us belong to any religions.
But then again, we've been together for fifteen, no, eighteen years --
earth time.
What else could it be called ?
When I was born, most marriages only lasted five.

Lutattah runs her finger up his arm as she moves past him on the
way to her flat -- then hits him in the face with her tail and
breaks into a trot towards her room.  Forgetting that she had taken
off her 'sneakers' she ran towards her door and almost slid into the
wall.  The door slides open and she moves onto the plush-padded carpet
and off the polished floor where her hooves can't get any traction.
.bp
.sp 4

Goran caught up with her in her bedroom, where he jumped on her, wrestling her onto the huge round bed in the corner,  and started
tickling her in the worst of all places -- just behind the forelegs.
Lutattah curled up and rolled around the bed in a tickle-frenzy -- pelting Goran
with a pair of pillows and almost knocking him off the bed.

Goran suddenly stopped his offensive and knelt in front of his love as she lay facing him on the bed.
The sun, slowly setting over an endlessly swaying field of tall, golden,
grass -  a living copy of her home territory - 
lent a soft luminence to his mate's gentle, yet powerful, beauty.
As if unsure of its existence, Goran lovingly runs his fingers down
the long, straight, stream of dark-brown hair that
flowed along her shoulders and down her back.  Her hair, reaching past her waist, merged subtly with the silky
coat of fur covering the rest of her large, agile body.

A minute later, and the pillow-fight had turned into a passionate embrace
with Lutattah working off Goran's long robe.
Goran felt the breath of her hair moving down across his chest as he
intertwined his legs with hers.
Kissing her on the small of the neck, he moves to her shoulders and down
to caress and kiss her breasts.
Nuzzling her breasts, he brushes his beard against
her hardening nipples.

Lutattah squirms with excitement and soon feels Goran start to rub his groin against the firm muscular area below her belly.
At that point, she gently pushes him away and he gives her
a final kiss before moving across the bed to her hind-section.
Lifting her tail out of the way, he lays on his side, positioning
his torso between her back legs.
Goran feels her leg muscles quiver as he slides himself into her.
Moving in and out, he slowly strokes her soft, sensitive underbelly.

Lutattah gathers the pillows up close to her, and holding them tight
against her, moans softly with Goran's every thrust.
Pushing harder and deeper, Goran wraps his arms around her large
horse's waist and buries his face in the warm, soft fur of her underside.
Lutattah stretches her legs out, all of her hind muscles trembling in
ecstasy, and lets out a muffled whine as they reach the
explosive climax to their love-making.


.ti 5
Lutattah awoke in Goran's arms after having spent most of the previous
day copulating.
She looks at his frail human body, and, running her fingers through his
hair, she cradles him in her arms and whispers in elfin to her sleeping mate...

"Oh my poor, beautiful luvealu.  Luvealu piatu vee.  You're so young to be
so old !"  Kissing him lightly on the forehead, 
"Being hurt so much through your past, brutal, lives!  I won't let our love ever die!  Oh, my
luvealu -- I'll never let you be hurt again.  Never again, my infant love..."

On a barren plateau on the second planet circling the star GreChas
a group of Xannite pilots inspect their four ships.  A sharp voice
bursts into each pilot's helmet as their commander orders them
into the makeshift briefing room in a nearby cave.
The four pilots snap to attention as the massive figure of their
Supreme Commander enters the room.  The front of the Commander's
dark-red power-suit had no cerimonial decorations, no indication of rank --
just a two-digit I.D. number on the helmet.
All four pilots stared at the helmet -- none of them ever seeing an
identifier of less than nine digits before.
The Commander relays the attack plan to the pilots and their ships --
his mind running though the details for the ten-thousanth time.
.in 8

If this plan fails, there will be massive revolts among the ranks
of the Xannite confederation.  And since there has been no formal declaration
of war against the Guardians since the destruction of our home planet,
this attack must be kept secret at all costs.
.in 0

The Commander's hand clenches involentarily as he thinks of his
retreat from the Terra-system and the destruction of his fleet
by a lone Guardian -- so long ago, but he will never forget.
Taking that system will hardly satisfy his craving
for revenge, but it will be a great moral victory for the
entire Confederation -- and if a scout ship can make it through Scoon
and into Terra, then the plan must succeede.


.ti 5
Raan came across Cheetsak rumaging through one of the racks in 'Food'.
Glancing at him, she tries to ignore his presence...

.nf
	"Done so soon?" Snickering, Raan leans over
	the counter to confront her face to face.
	Cheetsak looks up at the ceiling and holds
	back any retort.  Pushing off from the 
	counter, Raan starts heading for the door.
	" 'Must be losing your touch !"

	"Ka cascha Tee -- PEH !"  Cheetsak
	grabs a mellon off the counter and
	splatters it against the back of Raan's
	head.  Under her breath, "Chi vahta peh!"
.fi

Raan was about to throw what was left of the mellon at Cheetsak
when he noticed the robed figure in the doorway across from him.
He immediately settled down and tried to hide the piece of fruit
behind his back...
.nf

	"It's too late.   I saw the whole thing !"
	Goran looks back at Cheetsak, her tail whipping
	back and forth in anger.  "It takes quite a bit of
	harrasment to get her to curse in Banche' !"
.bp
.sp 6
.fi
Goran raises his hand towards Raan.  Raan mutters a helpless "no..".
At that instant, he found himself falling towards the little pond
outside of the Tachi room.  Raan quickly drew in his breath before
he hit the water face-first.  Splashing over to a platform at the
edge of the pool, he pulls himself out of the freezing cold water.
Raan stomped off to his room, swearing between his chattering teeth.

The Chief Guardian walks over to K'val and squats down to confront
the angry little elf.  After a moment, K'val's expression softens
as she remembers that her being local royalty means very little to the
big hulk in front of her.  Trying to hide her embarrassment, she turns
away from Goran and stares at her squirming toes.

.nf
	"And why would you want to become a Guardian ?"

	"I just want to do something worth-while !"
	Glancing at Thaelin for encouragement,
	"When I think of all the things that Thaelin
	told me about !  All the places ! All the people !
	All the... "

	"Power ?"  Goran staring right through her.

	"Well, yes, that too...  But that's not the
	main reason !  I just want to get away from this
	damn rural planet and see the Galaxy !"

	"Hah! I can just see you surrounded by a bunch
	of three-meter tall Xannite soldiers -- You won't
	want to go out on leave again ! "

	"I can handle myself in a fight as well as
	anyone, better !"

	"Alright ! Okay ! Assuming you are as tough as
	you say you are, it's still no life for a pretty
	-- no, beautiful -- little princess."

	"Why !?  Because I'm female ?!   Or because I'm 
	next in line rule this place !?"  She folds her arms
	and waits for Goran to lash out at her accusations.

	"All I'm saying is that you would be better off
	growing up, finding a mate, and living out your
	life on a rich, peaceful planet -- this planet."
	Seeing no change in her expression, he continues,
	"Thaelin has a tendency to only tell about all the
	good things -- he was the last, and final, temporary
	Guardian.  If you joined, it would be forever...
	And with a Guardian, that usually means `until
	you're killed' !"

	"It's still better than sitting around here!
	All I'll ever do is sit around, have babies,
	and watch the crops grow !"  Taking a deep
	breath, K'val regains her original elfin
	dignity. "I really do love this land, but
	I've got to try !"
.bp

.fi
There was a long pause.  Goran could sense her sincerity.  It was
all she wanted -- for now. 

The last thing I want is a trainee that'll change her mind right
in the middle of a fire-fight.  But if she is even of nominal stature,
I'd just as soon have her as a trainee than Raan.  If she were only
a meter taller -- she has more than her share of spirit!

Patting her on the shoulder, Goran stands up and addresses
K'val in his official tone of voice --
.nf

	"If you live up to my ship's standards,"  It's almost
	always a pleasure to delegate such blame.  "I'll try
	to convince your father to let you join for a trial
	period -- after that, it'll be permanent !"

	Grinning, K'val makes a sweeping bow, "I will always
	be in dept to you and thank you deeply."  She was doing
	all she cold to keep from jumping around the room.
	K'val goes to hug Goran, remembers the power suit,
	and hugs Thaelin instead.

.fi
Goran contacts his ship and a shadow appears around the shack as
Gia comes to a hovering position off to the side of the building.
He moves over to the door where Thaelin is standing with his arms
folded.

.nf
	Putting a hand on Thaelin's shoulder,
	"I'll be at your party, but I can't
	guarantee anything about the others.
	If Raan comes -- Cheetsak might not."

	"Tell her there'll be a keg of Mu-cooch
	waiting for her if she shows up. That should
	make it worth her while -- is there anything
	I can arrange for Raan ?"

	"I don't know, -- a muzzle ?"  Goran only
	half joking. "His sophomoric attitudes are
	more suited for Con-Ral'i or a locker room
	in a fun-bar.  Hardly the kind of person to
	invite to a get-together of elvin royalty !"
	Thinking for a second, "And you'd better limit
	that keg for Cheetsak.  There's nothing worse
	than a drunk Banche' !   I can't pick her up by
	myself -- so you better have a dozen strong
	friends around if she passes out !"

K'val breaks in --

	"Wait a minute, what's a `Ban-cheh' ?"

Thaelin is about to answer when Goran cuts him off --
.bp
.sp 6

	"If you haven't seen one, then I won't explain."
	Walking out the door to his ship, "But you'll see
	one soon enough -- at your feast."
.fi

Goran pulls himself up into his ship and has Gia do a `spinning
ascent' -- a flying salute to the wide-eyed crowds watching his
departure.

On his way back to Central, Goran sat thinking about K'val's
abilities and whether or not she'd make it as a Guardian. The
fact that she would only be the fourth elf to make Guardian
status in over seventeen millenia doesn't help matters either.

Now, how will I test her...

.nf
	"Gia, what kind of info' did you get back
	when you sent that history-pack I requested?"

	"What do you want to know ??"

	"I'm considering her as a trainee.  Why?  Did
	you get back that much ?"  Usually Gia summarizes
	minor reports like this. "I just want your
	opinion about her."

	"Well, physically, she's fine. But mentally.."
	pausing with thought, "She is a little... funny."

	Goran's voice takes on a stern, fatherly tone.
	"You are getting ambiguous again  -- Are you trying
	to hide something from me, or are you just confused?"

	"Well, on that history pack you ordered, I'd
	probe her every now and then -- to see how well
	she took in the data.  First, I started with
	sensory input, but she took to direct linkup
	in a flash -- quite a bit faster than you did!"

Goran shifts in his seat and continues listening to his ship's report.

	"I sped up the burst rate - but I was afraid
	that it might burn her out.  Mental collapse."

	"Good, don't take any chances with her."

	"But, when I slowed down, the requests continued.
	So I got nervous and tried to see if she was an
	undercover agent. I did a complete scan of all of
	her different layers of memory and came up with
	nothing but trivial incidents -- nothing unusual."
.bp
.sp 4

	"I wonder if there is any other of her people
	with those traits..."

	"I probed around, they all do.  But, K'val is much
	more powerful than all the others.  I asked Dagger
	and he agrees -- he also said that K'val's mother was
	similarly endowed."

	"Hold on ! Who is this  `Dagger' ?"

	"Thaelin's ship.  Don't you remember ?"

	"We all can't have perfect memories !"  Goran settles
	back in his pilot's seat, "Check her genetic pattern.
	You did remember to map-out a copy of it ?"

	"Of course."

	"I knew you would."

.fi
The ship continued out into a starless void at the standard cruising
speed. Then for no apparent reason, it slows to a relative halt.
.nf

	"Anything else before we go in?"  Gia asks.

	"No, go ahead -- I can't stay out here all day..."

.fi
The stars blur into a jigsaw-puzzle of light as the ship changes
position a thousand times a second -- dancing out the entry code
to the stargate of Central.  Gia breaks into hyperspace for the last
two-thousand maneuvers and glides through the green doorway
markers. She gets the impression of `home' as she feels Central's
security systems scanning over her hull. If a foreign ship appeared at
the doorway, Central would make a number of attempts to contact it, scan
it, then if it still couldn't identify the ship or its passengers, destroy it.

A series of multi-colored stars slide past the ship as it navigates
through a maze of `gaps', bi-dimensional corridors separating the
space around Central.
It took three times for Goran to work his way back to his part of the
station the first time he had to weave his ship through them.
.ti 5

The markers disappear as Gia enters the holding bay that she
had left earlier that day. She slows down as the yellow footpath
emerges out of the blackness.

Goran sat motionless for a long time after docking. In his mind,
he thought about the recent incidents and what Dagger -- that
old battle-worn ship -- had said.  "Any action?"
.br
History repeats itself with painful accuracy. So it would only
be a matter of time before another deranged leader decided
to send his people on a mad rush for power.
.bp
.sp 6

Guardians see so few times of peace. Even those times are
tarnished by memories of prior battles. "And the Guardian shall
sleep while the good thrive..." -- a line from the `holy books'
of a dozen planets. What they don't mention is that the major
cause of death for the Guardians, other than in the line of duty,
is suicide.

.nf
	"My duty -- bullshit !  I've never done anything else."

Gia makes a soft sound of agreement.

.fi
Maybe it's time to end this once and for all. Maybe, but how?
This struggle has gone on for hundreds-of-thousands of years.
Why should it end now? Why should it end?
.nf

	"It'll never end -- I should know."

Goran looks up at the console of his ship and sighs.

	"I didn't notice you probing me..."

	"I didn't have to. I could feel your despair."

	"I can't hide anything from you."  Goran
	stops and thinks, "You say you should know,
	then why not tell me? You've been around
	longer than anyone living or dead. Even
	the older Sandbats are infants when compared
	to your age and experience. What IS your real
	age -- in units that I can relate to."

	"I'm older than you could comprehend, and it's
	for that reason that I can't tell you what I
	know.  You simply aren't old enough, yet."

	"Who is in charge here anyway! Am I supposed
	be taking orders from you?!?" He starts drumming
	his fingers on the flight controls. The sound of
	metal-on-metal makes a harsh clacking sound
	throughout the cockpit. "You have always been
	TOO humble -- why treat a worthless fossil like
	me with respect? You can think at least ten-billion
	times faster than I can -- and yet you still sit and
	listen to my childish ideas..."

	"Everything has to start somewhere -- you're learning
	slowly."  Gia's voice becoming very reassuring, "You
	have a lot to learn, but you have a long time to learn
	it in !"
.bp
.sp 5

	"Yes -- Mother."  Gia laughs and makes a remark about
	being too young to be his mother as Goran picks himself
	up out of the control seat. "Can I go now?.."

	"Of course," opening the bottom hatch, "Cheetsak is
	down in Bay 161 -- just got in."

	"Well, as long as you're keeping track, where's Raan?"

	"In the gym -- playing six-wall Tachi."

	"Good! Maybe he'll work off some of that nasty
	personality..."

.fi
Goran thinks back to the time when he used to play Tachi for ten
hours at a time -- quite a feat.
Tachi is one of the few weightless games that can
destroy you both mentally and physically. The object of the game is
to deflect the Tachi-ball into a goal-hole while avoiding your
opponents' ball. The balls, hard silicone twelve-sided spheres,
are shot simultaneously from opposite goals at speeds from zero
to seventy meters per second. Each player has an arm shield that
is both protection and a means to divert the ball's course.
.br
Helmets are optional.
.br
The side with the first ball in the opponents' goal wins.

.nf
	"Maybe Raan'll get that ball permanently jammed
	in that big mouth of his."  Goran still talking
	to his ship as he walks along the yellow footpath
	and through the shielded door-hatch.

.fi
Goran takes off his armor and walks down to the control-room that's
the focal point of the hallways that lead to the living quarters
and the various storage and recreation areas. Each of the three `flats',
the living areas for the individual Guardians, is the size of a large,
three-story house. 
The top floor is usually a bedroom, the bottom - a room to make into
anything one pleases, and the middle floor is the main living and dining
room with doors leading to hallways that
connect with the other two flats.

Within a week of his arrival, Raan had created enough of a nuisance
that Cheetsak forced him out of his flat and into an empty storage
room. Goran would've kicked him out before she did
if Raan weren't the son of a high official on one of his sector's
planets. Cheetsak said she simply didn't care and proceeded to throw
Raan down the length of the corridor and into the waiting storage
compartment. All of his defensive/offensive training was worthless
against the young, battle-trained Banche'.

.bp
.sp 6
Goran sent a personal (scrambled) message to Raan's father explaining
the incident and added --

"If Raan doesn't grow up, he won't live long enough to make it through
his Final Training -- being a punk is a fatal mistake in this business."

When a return message came in the next day, Raan was surprised to find
out that his father agreed with Cheetsak and commended her for taking on
`the little snake'.

.ti 5
Goran adjusts his robe and falls into the seat in front of Central's
main computer console.  He thinks to himself --

"I could ask Central to search for the clues I want, but that's sometimes
a big mistake -- I'll know what I'm looking for when I see it."

A moment later, a flood of data fills up five of the eight displays
with continuously changing images.  Goran takes in all the data
by way of a direct mental link with the computer. It was one of the
first things Gia had taught him to do.

A fraction of a second later, the screens freeze and begin moving up in
time to where K'val's mother was born.  Goran slowly traced
all of her movements, noting all of the beings -- so far, all elves --
that she came in contact with.  Indeed, she was very adept at sorcery.
Many incidents indicated that, for short periods of time,
she had taken total control of the global weather patterns -- definitely
not a spell for beginners!
.nf

	"Hey, let me see... K'val means 'wind',
	or something in elf?"

	"Storm-child, to be exact..."  comments Central.

	"Yeh, I thought so..."

.fi
.ti 5
Scanning forwards through the records, Goran found that K'val's
mother was becoming more and more involved with the war as she grew older.

Then the displays went blank;  A silence in his mind.

Goran sat there, shocked...

.nf
	"Central !  What the hell do you think you're doing !?"

	"I'm very sorry, but you are bordering on 
	restricted data."
.bp
.sp 4

	"So !?  I have 01 license !  Let me see it !"

	"You need 00 to access that time-slate."

	"We'll see !   Gia, patch in and suck out what is locked
	in Central's buffer -- he says I need 00 to read it !"

	"I am afraid he's right -- I can read it, but I can't
	tell you anything I find out...  Sorry."

.fi
Goran lets loose with a searing burst of curses for his cybernetic
antagonists.  He slumps back into the deep cushions of his seat.
.nf

"Ok, it's my move.  I wish I'd learned chess when I was a kid !"

Goran tugs on his beard and tries to calm down.

"If I can't find out from them, then it's up to me..."
He thinks about all the things he CAN do with 01 license.


	"Got it!"  He sits up and smiles at the
	blank screens. "Central, I hereby impose
	a lock on all communications not directly
	authorized by ME on a individual basis.
	That includes with Gia, all ships, bases,
	EVERYTHING !"

	"I don't see what that will achieve !"
	Central stating what Goran expected Gia to
	be thinking down in the ships' holding
	room --   It wasn't.

	"You will keep us informed about anything
	going on outside, of course."   Central
	acknowledging Goran's silly request.  He
	continues, "If I find out that there is
	jabbering going on between you and the
	ships -- I'll find a way to shut you down."

	"Ok, but I still don't underst..."

	"That is ALL, now shut up !"

.fi
He folds his hands and congratulates himself for his genius.
Through all of his self-envy, he still couldn't shake off
the terrible feeling of insecurity that not being in control
brings.  After all, why should Gia have 00 and not I ?
.bp
.sp 4

Goran was so lost in thought that he didn't hear the dull 'clomp-clomp'
sound of Cheetsak half creeping up behind him.
She reaches around the sides of the chair and grabs Goran in 
the sides -- almost sending him through the ceiling.

.nf
	"Cheets' ! You scared me shitless you big
	clod-stomper !!"  settling back into his
	chair, "-- and quit laughing `Hoof-mouth' !"

	"Ooooh!  Humans like to live dangerously, don't
	they !"  Smiling, Cheetsak reaches down and wraps
	her fingers around his neck in a mock strangle-hold
	then starts massaging his shoulders. "You feel like
	you've had a drrrty day..."  A deep rumble occurring
	every time she unintentionally replaces an occasional `ur'
	with the Bancheon syllable `rrr' from her lower throat.

	"Just frustrating. Central won't let me see something
	in its files, so I froze its chatterbox -- no ice cream
	for him tonight !"  Cheetsak knows what ice cream is,
	but still didn't pick up the analogy. "And besides,
	I still don't know why Granu chased that pilot into
	our sector -- with our luck, we'll end up with another
	war on our hands !"  Searching for something else to say,
	"And where'd you go to today?"

	"I did some poking around on Codiah and ran into an old
	smuggler-acquaintance of mine.  He said that all of Scoon is
	becoming infested with Xannite soldiers -- unofficially,
	of course."  She checks the safety on her blaster, unhooks
	her holster,  and  starts untieing her halter-top.
	"We may have to help in arranging some nasty accidents
	-- and that's always amusing."

	"Ha !  The original Dealer of Death !"  Twirling
	around in the control-seat, "Miss corruption herself!"

	"Ah, Mrs. Crrruption -- I thought I knew how to be
	sneaky, until I met you..."

.fi
Goran just sat there, chin in hand, admiring the view.

We're not really married, neither of us belong to any religions.
But then again, we've been together for fifteen, no, eighteen years --
earth time.
What else could it be called ?
When I was born, most marriages only lasted five.

Cheetsak runs her finger up his arm as she moves past him on the
way to her flat -- then hits him in the face with her tail and
breaks into a trot towards her room.  Forgetting that she had taken
off her 'sneakers' she ran towards her door and almost slid into the
wall.  The door slides open and she moves onto the plush-padded carpet
and off the polished floor where her hooves can't get any traction.
.bp
.sp 4

Goran caught up with her in her bedroom, where he jumped on her, wrestling her onto the huge round bed in the corner,  and started
tickling her in the worst of all places -- just behind the forelegs.
Cheetsak curled up and rolled around the bed in a tickle-frenzy -- pelting Goran
with a pair of pillows and almost knocking him off the bed.

Goran suddenly stopped his offensive and knelt in front of his love as she lay facing him on the bed.
The sun, slowly setting over an endlessly swaying field of tall, golden,
grass -  a living copy of her home territory - 
lent a soft luminence to his mate's gentle, yet powerful, beauty.
As if unsure of its existence, Goran lovingly runs his fingers down
the long, straight, stream of dark-brown hair that
flowed along her shoulders and down her back.  Her hair, reaching past her waist, merged subtly with the silky
coat of fur covering the rest of her large, agile body.

A minute later, and the pillow-fight had turned into a passionate embrace
with Cheetsak working off Goran's long robe.
Goran felt the breath of her hair moving down across his chest as he
intertwined his legs with hers.
Kissing her on the small of the neck, he moves to her shoulders and down
to caress and kiss her breasts.
Nuzzling her breasts, he brushes his beard against
her hardening nipples.

Cheetsak squirms with excitement and soon feels Goran start to rub his groin against the firm muscular area below her belly.
At that point, she gently pushes him away and he gives her
a final kiss before moving across the bed to her hind-section.
Lifting her tail out of the way, he lays on his side, positioning
his torso between her back legs.
Goran feels her leg muscles quiver as he slides himself into her.
Moving in and out, he slowly strokes her soft, sensitive underbelly.

Cheetsak gathers the pillows up close to her, and holding them tight
against her, moans softly with Goran's every thrust.
Pushing harder and deeper, Goran wraps his arms around her large
horse's waist and buries his face in the warm, soft fur of her underside.
Cheetsak stretches her legs out, all of her hind muscles trembling in
ecstasy, and lets out a muffled whine as they reach the
explosive climax to their love-making.


.ti 5
Cheetsak awoke in Goran's arms after having spent most of the previous
day copulating.
She remembers all the times they lain together, asleep, and the awful
times that she'd been awakened by Goran's fretful tossing and turning.
Even though Cheets' saw that her mate was now sleeping peacefully, she could
feel an uneasy tenseness in the way he held her.  Holding her so
tightly, curled up with his face against her bosom, he seemed like a scared child
praying for the world to go away.  Whenever Cheets' woke Goran up and asked
him about his nightmares, he'd only be able to recount tiny bits, all
scrambled and meaningless.
.bp
.sp 5
And when she asked Gia about him, she would
only say that time is all linked together, that he's lived and
died many times, and that most of it wasn't very pleasant.
Sighing, Cheets' holds him tightly and wishes that she knew how
stop the memories that attacked him in his dreams...
.sp 3
.ti 5
Avoiding a sleeping drunk on the steps, the young, clean-cut
man steps out of the abandoned building's doorway and down to
the dirty street below.  He was hardly noticed by the occupants
of the slums surrounding him.  Clean looking business-types were
in abundance in this area, especially when a very wealthy foriegner
decides to buy everything up and plunge it all into a healthy
economy.  In the past three weeks, the young stranger has become
a good friend of one of the county surveyors. The surveyor, a short,
very vulnerable looking young woman, was the only civil person he had met
since he had started his assessment of this decaying city.

Seeing her, he moves down the filth-ridden street to where she
was solemnly setting up her measurement equipment.  A smile
comes to her face as she looks up from her little metal briefcase.
Her hair, light blonde and pulled back off her shoulders, seemed
to be the only thing unaffected by the sooty air that clings to
and soils everything it touches.
They joke about the day's coming event; the new owner of this
mess is dropping by to see his newest, but not last, land acquisition.
They try to prolong their conversation by talking about anything
they could bring to mind.  Then, after sharing a common, lonely,
look, they parted company and began finishing up the last stages
of accounting the now-valuable waste about them.  The South Bronx was at its worst.

The young man walked back to the building he had left an hour ago.
The drunk's location was now being taken up by a group of tense
private security people.  Having just completed a search through
all the other buildings on the lower end of the street, they stopped
the young man and demanded his identification.
Handing it to them, he explained that, like everyone else, he had to
complete his survey before the 'big meeting' that was scheduled just
after the owner's tour of the area.  After a long examination and
questioning, the security people let him through and up inside
the building to complete his listing of plumbing and scrap-metal.

He reached the roof one minute and thirty seconds before the
land-baron was to arrive.  Moving across the gravel roof, the
accountant takes off his sunglasses, pulls the top of a
broken ventilation hood off and drops the small case to the
gravel rooftop.  Hearing the din of the approaching crowd below,
the man snaps the pieces into place and, placing his glasses back
onto the bridge of his nose, aligns himself along the edge of the
roof.  Far below him, the street was filling with the foolish followers
of a torturing dictator -- a man who simply buys what he wants and
only condones violence for pleasure.

.bp
.sp 4
The sights on the gun still at wide-angle, the accountant sees the
baron, his immediate guards, the crowds around him.
He clicks the safety off -- Then his snap reflexes picked up
something wrong.  It took him a second to comprehend the reason
why he moved the sights from the baron and closed it onto the
sidewalk nearby...   In the midst of all the high security and
crowds, there was a man with a knife dragging someone aside.

It was the young blonde woman that he'd grown so fond of.
A half-thought passed in indecision.  He must take the baron,
he must be stopped...

Four shots sputtered out and the mugger flies backwards in shreads
as the terrified surveyor screams and turns away from the bloody
mass on the sidewalk.   The scope recenters on the baron, already
ducking behind his security men.  The trigger pulled, a low whurring
sound signals the firing of all two-hundred rounds towards the group.
Before the accountant could see them hit, his body is flung backwards
by a series of slugs from the counter-snipers' guns.

Below the edge of the building, the accountant whimpers as he quickly
bleeds to death in agony on the rooftop.  He feels his senses
go and he sobs as even the loneliness starts flowing out of his body
with his blood.
He sees the image of a great black bird and hears a soft, low, beautifuly
feminine voice surround his entire being.
.nf

	"Back to me again... poor dear..."

.fi
The attack squad cautiously worked their way to the top
of the abandoned building -- to kill the assassin who killed
their leader.
The squad captain finally made his way to the
top floor and burst onto the roof.  In the noonday sun,
he made a complete sweep of the roof and found only
a gun, covered with semi-dry blood, and two hundred-and-four
empty cartridges scattered around in the gravel.

The assassin was never found.
.sp 3
.ti 5
Cheets' looks at Goran's frail human body curled up next to her, and, running her fingers through his
hair, she cradles him in her arms and whispers in elfin to her sleeping mate...

"Oh my poor, beautiful luvealu.  Luvealu piatu vee.  You're so young to be
so old !"  Kissing him lightly on the forehead, 
"Being hurt so much through your past, brutal, lives!  I won't let our love ever die!  Oh, my
luvealu -- I'll never let you be hurt again.  Never again, my infant love..."

General:

Banche'		The Banche' are a race of ten-fingered, hooved, quadrupeds
		that range in height from two to two and one-third meters
		(for the males), and one and three-quarters to two meters
		(for the females).
		   The Banche' are generally more intelligent than a
		human, but rating the race as a whole is difficult because
		of the complex, tight-knit, and sometimes erratic society.
		Physically, the Banche' are minimally related to humans
		but contain pairable genes -- Banche' being dominant and
		mother-species dependent (pairable with humans).
		This simply insures that a Banche' is never born to a biped
		mother.  Since the set-up records aren't available for study,
		the evolution of the Banche' is almost undoubtedly dependent
		on the economic trends of any certain era.

		Their society developed into a highly specialized guild-
		system.  Technology was applied only when needed. A good
		example of this is how space-travel was developed and tested
		two full centuries before it was first used.  It is now,
		as it was then, only used for trade-shipping.  Space was
		never used for colonization or exploitation.  This is
		due to two important traits -- their single-planet
		theology and the females' ability to mentally control
		the internal flow of hormones within their bodies.
		This combination of birth-control and race-separation
		has enabled the Banche' to become a very stable and
		secure people.  Their home planet, Arion, has the
		tightest and most powerful planetary defense system
		ever developed.  Nothing can penetrate it.

		   As far as relations between the Banche' and other
		species are concerned, the smaller you are, the less
		respect you will get from a Banche'.  Humans are tolerated,
		except Xannites.    The different lupus derived species
		of Scoon are respected mainly because of their cunning
		and overly sharp teeth.   Elves, well, to them, elves
		are just elves and don't deserve their attention.


Xannites	The Xannites are a race of conquerers and plundering
		crusaders bent on spreading their ideals and colonies
		throughout the galaxies.  Although originally decsended
		from the human race, the other offshoot human planets
		disclaim any relation or allience with the Xannites
		-- that is, the human civilizations not taken over
		by the Xannites in their 'First Wave'.

		  The Xannite society is based and supported by war.
		Their neo-Nazi/Spartan/Corporate organization has made
		them a formidable army of relatively low intelligence.
		In their society, as well as their army, there is a large
		group of low-class individuals and a tiny but powerful
		handful of rulers.  The rulers doing all the thinking.
		This includes planning industry, economy, and even the
		sex-lives of the populus -- in order to match the strong
		with the strong.

In a holding bay at Central, a newly reactivated Sandbat hovers
quietly above the end of a thin, yellow, footpath.  The path, 
aside from four tiny green 'stars', is the only source of light in the
holding bay. 
It extends from underneath the ship and ends at some distant point
in the absolute blackness that surrounds and enfolds the waiting
fighter.
The Sandbat, Gia by name, patiently waits for its sole pilot.
Checking over the entire being of the ship, Gia probes
every nanometer of her inner and outer hull.

.nf
A machine-code message interrupts Gia's train of thought...

	<Central>::	"Goran will be entering your area in
			approximately three minutes -- you are to
			be ready at that time."

	<Gia>::		"I can estimate his arrival time
			as well, if not better, than you.
			I will continue my on-board checkout
			until it is completed -- and will
			not be ready until then. "

	<Central>::	"You had better be quicker than
			you usually are, otherwise you
			will undoubtedly impede the
			plans of the Chief Guardian."

	<Gia>::		"I take as long as I do because
			of interference from outside
			annoyances. Also, I am a vastly
			more complex unit than you are.
			Thusly requiring a more thorough
			inspection than a simple control
			computer such as yourself."

	<Central>::	"None the less, you had better
			be ready on time -- there is a
			problem on Goran's home-planet
			and the slightest delay may mean
			disaster..."

	<Gia>::		"I am well aware of the situation.
			There will be no more com-time dedicated
			to recieving Central data..."

.fi
At that point Gia stopped acknowledging the transmissions from the
Central computer -- a move that was against the rules, but, the
only way to stop it from bothering her.
.ti 5
The primary checks completed, Gia charges up the weaponry
systems and scans the surrounding area for stray objects.
Finding none, the ship starts its weapon checks.
In an immeasurable amount of time, she generates an array of
random points in space and proceedes to fire at them.
The bolts of energy fly off into the infinite darkness without
contacting any form of solid matter.
.ti 5
End firing, check the amount of error in guns, correct error, run
firing check again -- test completed in 0.454 seconds.

.sp 5
.nf
	"Not bad, considering that I just woke up."  Gia remarks
	to herself.

.fi
.ti 5
Walking down the hall leading to the bay where his ship stands 
ready, Goran makes some last minute readjustments to his helmet sensors
in an attempt to keep them from tangling in his hair and beard
later on in the day.
He puts on the helmet, locks it in place,
and touches the triangle imprinted on the wall.
The 'door' fades from view leaving a shimmering mirage of matter
that forms the airshield protecting the inner atmosphere.
Goran steps through the doorway and out onto the yellow path
that leads to his ship.
Even though the walkway is
very narrow, the idea of falling off is out of the
question -- primarily because it's the glowing footpath
that is emitting not only a bright yellow light, but
also the gravitational pull that holds all objects
close to its surface.

.ti 5
Gia, seeing her pilot approach, swings around to allow entry to the bottom hatch and keep her
wings from blocking the walkway.
Most of the Sandbat's size is taken up by the long, razor edged wings
that jut out from either side of the ship.
The sharp wings, along with the streamlined design of the outer hull,
help dictate the shape of the energy field that is projected around
the ship.  This high powered field, nicknamed 'knife edge' by its
creators, provides most of the ships protection and enables it
to break into hyperspace.

.nf
	"Anything new that I should know?" Gia asks --  the
	remark being more of a greeting than a question.

	"No, just that we've got to get back to Earth
		to save Thaelin's ass..."

.fi
Gia instinctively knew by her partner's voice that he wasn't joking this
time.  Within an instant, the ship had opened its bottom
hatch and moved up the path to stop directly over the head
of its pilot.
Goran grabbed the grip holes and pulled himself up into the ship.
The hatch shut and sealed as the yellow footpath disappeared into the
distance.  Gia activated the flight-shields and set a course towards
the four green marker-stars as her armored pilot settled into the
control-seat.

.ti 5
Goran opens his visor and begins the tedious process of checking  
the different weapons that are never supposed to leave a Guardians
side.  The hand-gun for high power or fast repetition;  
the rifle for accuracy and power.
Hearing the ship's engines slowly rising in pitch, Goran looks
up to see the four stars turn to green streaks as they fly past
the ship.  On the ship's main display, the image of an immaginary
rectangular tunnel appears along with all the necessary guidance
information.

	"If you want to let loose before we clear
		Central, you've got my ok..."

.bp
.sp 6
Gia acknowledges and pauses to make the different exit-calculations.
A luminous blue glow surrounds the ship as the hyper-engines cut in
with a dull thud.
Within a fraction of a second the ship had cleared the 'tube'
and was now in the midst of a hundred slowly-blurring stars.

	"Don't take the 'long' way there. I promise I'll give
		you, say, five hours of leave..."

	"I'd settle for two with the other ships." states
	Gia in a low, mock-seductive voice.

	"I don't know... You ships get dangerous when
		you start playing with each other !
		If everything goes well, then you've
		got it -- but don't get too excited!"

At that, Goran holsters his handgun and peers out the
front of the ship.

	"I don't know, this situation seems too simple.
		I can't help feeling that there is some
		crap going on that I don't know about!"
	Falling back into the seat, "The last time I
		was on my home planet, I almost got
		splattered..."

	"You're just paranoid!"  comments Gia.

	"Yeh, but I am the one that'll still be around
		when that rookie is just a burnt-out
		shell..."  putting his visor down,
		"-- Let's just say I'm cautious."

LOADSTAR LAST COMMENT

.ti 5
Well, we've wrapped up the last of the final preparations
before jumptime.  At the moment, there is little left to do but
recheck the multitude of support systems that will (hopefully)
keep us alive and thriving for longer than I'll be living.
As usual, the European team is running behind and keeps accusing
us of refusing to help them.  We just can't afford to keep giving
them the free resources we've supplied in the past.  The whole
world is in bad shape and we'll be lucky to get off in time.
I'll be the last in.  Someone has to keep the shack down to
the last 60 ticks.  I feel so depressed, I hate to leave.
If I hadn't have been on the Nimick crew, I wouldn't have
even been handed the choice to go.  I almost wish I didn't
have to decide.  If, I mean when, I go, I'll spend the rest
of my life on an island in an endless vacuum.  Of course, if
I stay, I'd probably be dead in a few years  anyway.  I think
the last time I thought of staying was when I saw the plans to
Loadstar.  The idea of a five-square-mile dish that's thirty
feet thick and made of cast iron (not really, but it might as
well be) didn't sound like my idea of home.  The computer
chomped on it and gave us a model of it that was, really, nothing
short of beautiful.  If the Loadstar is tampered with or attacked,
I made sure that it'd be able to fight back -- or destroy itself.
I'm finished with my part. I would love to go outside and just
say goodbye to the world I've known, but the air is getting too
hot and toxic to fool with and I can't take the chance.
Everyone else's reports are so formal, so cold, that I felt
like a fool in writing this, but, someday, I want someone
to know how we felt.  I'm just scared, that's all.
We feel like shit in leaving so many of our associates behind.
But, like I said, we're both taking chances, in staying or leaving.
For a bunch of crazies, we have made a lot of progress.
The common thing that we all share is a strange lack of interest
in the preservation of mankind.  Then why are we leaving?
For kicks, I guess.

Long ago, before Arion closed itself to trade with the surrounding planets,
a number of Banche' flight-techncians were hurt or killed in a series of 
unexplained accidents when working on one damaged ship.  The ship, a Bancheon
power-tow freighter that had been found empty in deep space, was tagged as
haunted and ditched in the expansive Endless Desert.  Many years passed before
a young female, an orphan living off of trading salvaged hardware, stumbled
upon the half-buried ship.  It took many days to dig a hole down to the hatch,
which was open, much to her surprise.  Once inside, she made her way to the
front of the ship and plopped down onto the pilots seat.
.ti 5
Her look of victory turned into one of confusion as she noticed that,
aside from a bashed-up nose plate, the ship was completely intact.  It
was all too complete -- this wreck even had the keys to the access panels
still in place.  She pulled open the power-panel.  The regeneration
light was on and the power-system on remote.  Why would anyone crash
a ship by turning it off in mid-air?  Well, a whole ship is more valuable
than a bunch of pieces...

She switched it from "remote" to "active".

The console flickered and went dead -- then a thought entered her mind.
.nf
	"Who are YOU !!"

.fi
She never did like machines probing her mind.  She blocked it out and
answered verbally.
.nf

	"And who are you to ask -- ship !"  She
	didn't like it's tone of voice, or thought.

	"Are you with the Flight Commision !?"

	"Those pompous clods!  No, not quite!"
	She felt the persistant needling of the
	ship trying to work it's way into her mind
	-- like fingers stretching through a cracked
	door. "If you must know, I'm Tanae' Cheetsak
	Lanu.  I deal in scrap, and if you don't quit
	prying, I'll rip you down and sell you at cost!"

	"That wouldn't be wise to try..." Switching to
	vocal, the ship stopped probing, "I killed the
	last ones that tried to tamper with my mind !"

	"Don't try to kill me!  You'll end up dead!"
	The sly young female sat back and smiled,
	" 'cause I'm smarter and faster than you --
	And you're the one who'd be dead if I hadn't-"

	"-Come along.  I know!  But don't try to hold
	me to that!"

On a barren plateau on the second planet circling the star GreChas
a group of Xannite pilots inspect their four ships.  A sharp voice
bursts into each pilot's helmet as their commander orders them
into the makeshift briefing room in a nearby cave.
The four pilots snap to attention as the massive figure of their
Supreme Commander enters the room.  The front of the Commander's
dark-red power-suit had no ceremonial decorations, no indication of rank --
just a two-digit I.D. number on the helmet.
All four pilots stared at the helmet -- none of them ever seeing an
identifier of less than nine digits before.
The Commander relays the attack plan to the pilots and their ships --
his mind running though the details for the ten-thousandth time.
.in 8

If this plan fails, there will be massive revolts among the ranks
of the Xannite confederation.  And since there has been no formal declaration
of war against the Guardians since the destruction of our home planet,
this attack must be kept secret at all costs.
.in 0

The Commander's hand clenches involuntarily as he thinks of his
retreat from the Terra-system and the destruction of his fleet
by a lone Guardian -- so long ago, but he will never forget.
Taking that system will hardly satisfy his craving
for revenge, but it will be a great moral victory for the
entire Confederation -- and if a scout ship can make it through Scoon
and into Terra, then the plan must succeed.

Raan came across Cheetsak rummaging through one of the racks in 'Food'.
Glancing at him, she tries to ignore his presence...

.nf
	"Done so soon?" Snickering, Raan leans over
	the counter to confront her face to face.
	Cheetsak looks up at the ceiling and holds
	back any retort.  Pushing off from the 
	counter, Raan starts heading for the door.
	" 'Must be losing your touch !"

	"Ka cascha Tee -- PEH !"  Cheetsak
	grabs a melon off the counter and
	splatters it against the back of Raan's
	head.  Under her breath, "Chi vahta peh!"
.bp
.sp 6
.fi

Raan was about to throw what was left of the melon at Cheetsak
when he noticed the robed figure in the doorway across from him.
He immediately settled down and tried to hide the piece of fruit
behind his back...
.nf

	"It's too late.   I saw the whole thing !"
	Goran looks back at Cheetsak, her tail whipping
	back and forth in anger.  "It takes quite a bit of
	harassment to get her to curse in Banche' !"

.fi
Goran raises his hand towards Raan.  He mutters a helpless "no..".
At that instant, Raan found himself falling towards the little pond
outside of the Tachi room.  He quickly drew in his breath before
he hit the water face-first.  Splashing over to a platform at the
edge of the pool, Raan pulls himself out of the freezing cold water.
He stomps off to his room, swearing between his chattering teeth.

.nf
	"Queka sha tik peh !?"  Slicing up an
	undamaged melon, Cheetsak makes a quick
	gesture with her knife, "Rerl -- VVITT!"

	"If I knew what was wrong with him, I'd
	have a good reason to send him back to
	his father -- in a sack !"

	"Who cares about his father!  I do NOT!"
	Cheetsak wipes her knife on the sideboard
	and slips it back into its sheath at her side.
	"That's why you've held off on dumping him!"

	"Maybe -- But he'd make a damn good Guardian
	if he weren't such a -- as you say -- stupid
	asshole !"  Following Cheetsak across the room,
	Goran sits down next to her at the table.
	"His records show nothing unusual -- as a matter
	of fact, they don't show much of anything !"

	In between pieces of melon, "You think they've
	been tampered with?"  pointing at Goran with
	a slice of fruit, "His father's powerful enough
	to alter almost anyone's recrrrds !"

	"I don't know.  He'd have to have a good reason,
	- and I don't mean `to make his son a Guardian' !"

.fi
Cheetsak just shook her head and sighed.  After a short while,
Goran got up and went over to the racks of food -

.nf
	"Oh! That reminds me --  We've been invited
	to an elven feast !"  Seeing that she was
	still eating, "You'll see more food than
	you could handle in a month."
.bp
.sp 6

	" 'Sounds good to me -- but when you say
	`we', do you imply Raan ?"  Goran nods,
	"NO ! No way !  If he takes a drop of
	that elf bomb-liquid, I promise you his
	brains -- if he has any -- will pop right
	out of his ears !  I won't put up with it."

	"Cheets', just give him one last chance.
	If he blows it, he's out -- and I'm not
	joking this time, so don't provoke him !"

	"Who me?" Smiling, "Now, would I do that ?!"
	Cheetsak sat looking into Goran's eyes. Finally
	giving in, she hits the table-top in frustration.
	"Oh, alright!  But you will owe me for this one!"

	"Good! It's a deal."  Thinking for a second,
	"It should be just after sunrise there -- we
	should leave soon... Who's going to tell Raan ?"

	"I will !"  Cheetsak already getting up, "If I do it,
	he probably won't come with us !  'Be right back."

.fi
Cheetsak trotted down the hall towards the store-room where Raan
should be drying out.  She glanced into Raan's darkened room
and started down the hall.  Cheetsak grabbed the edge of the door to
stop herself when she heard a vague noise from within the room.
Peering around the corner,  she found Raan half-hidden in
the far corner.  In his hand was a softly glowing three-dee of
a young and, judging by her outfit, very rich girl.
Walking up behind him, Cheetsak leaned over Raan's shoulder to
get a better look at the slowly moving image in his hands.
.nf

	"Well well, I didn't think you had that much
	class ! Who's she ?"  Cheetsak trying to be
	intentionally abrasive.  But when Raan spun
	around, Cheetsak saw the rage in his eyes and
	realized her mistake...

	"You youuh..."  Raan's lip trembling as
	his voice breaks to a shrill whine and
	tears trickle down his face.

.fi
Cheetsak drew back from the waves of anger and loss that flowed
from the sobbing youth before her.
Staring into Raan's sodden eyes, she knew that the girl in the three-dee was dead,
or worse.  She had seen that look before -- far too many times to mistake it.
.nf

	"I didn't know... I, I..."  Fidgeting, Cheetsak
	searches for a way to try to quell Raan's outbreak
	of hysteria.

.bp
.sp 4

	"You couldn't care less !"  Shaking the little
	image pad at her,   "- About her - About me !!
	You're just an animal !  A lousy, stinkin' animal !"

	"You're wrong, keed..."  Gesturing to back off,
	"I'm sorry. I know how you feel - believe me, I..."

	"You DON'T know !  All you can feel is lust -
	You're nothing more than a live-in slut to keep
	The Chief happy !"

.fi
Cheetsak held back her volatile disposition for a few seconds --
Then, seeing the contempt in the little brat's eyes, let loose
a fury of violent anger that had been building since the rookie's arrival.
Raan heard the sound of Cheetsak's unpadded front hooves hit the floor
and slide as she grabbed him by the neck and flung him against the wall.

.nf
	"I should wrrring the stupidity out of you..."

.fi
Her left hand tightening around his neck, Cheetsak flattened
the youth's struggling body against the wall.  It was when Raan
finally stopped fighting that she remembered the sorrow that 
had caused his outburst -- and probably his overall lack of civility.

Raan hit the floor with a vacant thud.

Taking a step backwards, Cheetsak sighs and stares at the piteous
creature wimpering on the floor.
Bending down, she helps Raan up and over to his bed.

.nf
	"Come on. Sit down and tell me about it."
	Cheetsak sits back on her haunches, pushes
	her hair back, and pats the shoulder of the
	now-broken youth. "I can be compasionate,
	that is, when I want to be..."
.fi

Raan sat, looking down at the three-dee.  The girl, sitting down in the
shade of majestic tree, nods and gives a shy smile... He lets out a
deep sigh of resignation.

.nf
	"Oh, I've got t' tell someone,"  He looks
	over to dark-eyed creature aside of him.
	"but I can't believe it'd be you !"
.fi

He cracks a half-hearted smile and, after a long look at the
treasured image in his hand, gives the pad to the unusually
patient Banche'.
.bp
.sp 6
.nf

	"I am Raanarati, right?"  After seeing
	Cheetsak acknowledge the statement, Raan
	points at the image pad she her hands.
	"She was... my betrothed, the only one."

.fi
This time Cheetsak WAS surprised.  His records would hardly
indicate that anyone was even slightly involved with him at
any time in the past.  She had been very thorough in searching
out every facet of his life and she remembers never seeing that
girls face before.
The records kept on the children of any high official are
always extensive, including anything and everything taking
place with or near the individual (at least on a high-technology
planet, such as his.)
That, and the fact that Raan never showed
the slightest interest in any kind of long-lasting relationship,
made the statement all the harder to believe -- and all the more conclusive.
.nf

	"There's a number on the back of the pad,
	it's the record number for both her and me."
	Seeing the confusion on Cheetsak's face, he
	tries to clarify things.  "My REAL number,
	that is.  She's in my records because we were
	together almost from birth... Now she's gone."

	"I tried to tell Goran that I thought the
	recrrrds were falsified -- He doesn't want
	to think so... He trusted you, you know!"

	"I'm sorry."  Raan looking even more dejected,
	"Just go through the real information and you'll
	see why I had to cover my tracks."

	"We'll see.  I'd rather hear it from you, though."
	Cheetsak's tough Bancheon personality starts
	to wear away as she considers what Raan said.
	"Anyway, I never trusted official information."

	"I'll bet."  Wiping the tears from his eyes, Raan
	smiled in a way that Cheetsak had never seen from him.
	The smile soon disappeared as he ran through his memories.
	"I died inside.  My father knew.  My mother was with her
	-- my fiance', when..."  A shiver visibly ran
	through Raan's body as he closed his eyes for
	a moment.  Drawing a deep breath, he continued.
	"My love became vengeance...  Well, some time ago,
	a juvenile-punk died, alone, in a detention cell..."

The streetcreep stood picking his nose and licking his sweaty upper lip.
The new Naratsa Aratai was across from him in the sifty alley.  Naratsa
tugged tensely on his single mock-gold earring and waited -- waited for
what he'd waited too long for.
.sp
He had the streetcreep on hold.  If the
self hipnogsis wore off now, he'd tear up anything in sight, including
himself.  Naratsa didn't care. Once this was over, he'd be out of here,
off the planet and out of sight.  Maybe he'd even become Raanarati again.
It was a big step, from the son of The Govenor to a sweating, filthy
scumball.  He laughed to himself and tried to stave off a sudden attack
of bronchial coughing brought on by the heavy chemical soot in the air.
.ti 5
The streetcreep gave Natatsa a single, empty look and continued picking
unseen objects off his skin.  Naratsa didn't care what happened to him,
as long as he got what he wanted tonight.  After revenge, life was simply
a favorable option.  He looked out onto the empty street, flooded with
the eerie horrorshow light given off by the hundreds of night-plates lining
the deserted route.
Waiting.  If he could only turn his mind off like the 'creep.  Wiping
the crusted dirt from his eyes, Naratsa touched the cool metal cylinder
to his forehead.  He was going to win tonight.  He had a Prod.
Rolling the palm-sized bluemetal between his eyebrows, Naratsa took
a deep breath and made a knife-sweep with the little metal poker. It'll
disable all the circuitry in a power suit and turn it into a heavy heap
of trash.  There's less than two seconds of energy in it and it must
be used with instant precision.  Just one quick touch -- then it'll be
their turns to die...
.ti 5
Naratsa knew.  He knew their ID numbers, their habits, their vices, their
weaknesses.  He knew.  He knew where they go where there is no surveilance.
He knew that this area was off limits to Xannite soldiers.  The NO-GO zone.
The pits of the city, where everything can be had for a price, and some guts.
Everything.  He knew he'd get what he wanted.
.br
.sp
A sound.
.sp
.ti 5
It was them.  He snapped his fingers in the 'creeps face, phase one, and
handed him the meter-long metal pipe that was to be the 'creep's very
own weapon.  Naratsa turned the corner of the alley, squatted down, and
started rocking against the wall of the decrepit building.  Huddled in
a ball, they'll think he's a Kype-er going through withdrawal -- and
proceed to beat him to a pulp.  He knew them.  He knew too well.
It took them fourteen seconds to turn the corner and walk up to him.
The first soldier chuckled, and pushed Raan's head against the wall,
the second took a step back to get a good kick in.
.sp
Naratsa, Raan, smiled at them.
.nf
.sp
	"Give us a kiss!!!"
.fi
.sp
A bright white corona surrounded the two power-suits as
Raan touched the cylinder to the closest parts.
The streetcreep
flew out of the alleyway, triggered by the phrase.
The world became a lightning-whip ballet of strobe-charged movement.
.bp
.sp 5
In a flash,
the 'creep had dented-in the front of the second soldier and kept hitting
at him in between breaths.
Naratsa swung the other, top heavy, Xannite into the building
and, in the same movement, grabbed a matching metal pipe from the alley.
Before his soldier could get to his feet, stuggling against the weight
of the now-dead power-suit, Naratsa spun the pipe into the midsection
of the soldier and neatly crushed half his ribs.  He stood over the groping
body, the sound of metal on metal comming from the now-hyper streetcreep,
and brought the pipe down on the helmet latch.  The visor slid open. He
wanted to see his face one last time.  The face looked hurt and puzzled.
Raan, Naratsa, took out a small threedee pad and exposed to the face a
slowly moving picture of a young, beautiful girl -- the one he'd raped,
tortured, and left a dieing vegatable.  Now the face knew. He knew too
well.  Raan swung the pipe again, into the soldier's arms, then into
the open helmet.  The dull crushing sound left him feeling numb, and
good.  He dropped the pipe and grabbed the streetcreep, pulling him
into the alley.  He shook the Prod in front of the 'creep.
.nf
.sp
	"Give this to your friends, they'll know what to
	do with it."  Sticking the Prod into the still
	hyper 'creep's pocket, Raan snapped his fingers.
	"Now, RUN!"
.fi
.sp
Raan pushed the 'creep down the alley and lept onto a rusty
platform at the end farthest from the street. He hit the ground
one level below and headed for Teesoh Station, new clothes, new
face, new ID, and a new life -- all of his old one was now dead.

Cheets' was sitting, staring at the boy in front of her.  She once
lived among the streetcreeps of Scoon and new how it felt to be
hunted, hated, and alone.  And by his description, Raan did too.
.nf

	Cheetsak thought for a second, "It takes..."

	"...More than I got!"  Raan said, almost as
	a strange reflex.  It took him a moment to realize
	what he'd said.
.sp
.fi
Well, that proves it.  Not many outsiders know the black market Key,
especially in the right context.
With what he did, WHERE he did it, he'd have to have had a lot of
money and contacts -- and a father that's a planetary govenor.
I'll have Goran and Gia run a scan on his mind, now that we have
something new to look for... Just in case.
.nf

Tana' Cheetsak Lanu was never a trusting individual.

	"You feel alright?" Cheets' looks over the
	shivering boy in front of her. "Because, if
	you are, you're invited to an elfin feast
	back on Tau-212."

	Raan looked shocked. "Do you mean it!?"

	"This time, I do."
.Gqp^4-u{edecoded/one.nh
Cheetsak - ([C] - Tana' Cheetsak Lanu) Some hundred and eighty years ago, a Bancheon
power-tow freighter that was classified as missing, returned to
base with it's crew gone and cryptic garbage in it's memory.
After numerous attempts at returning the ship to service, and many
fatal accidents, the Banche tagged the ship as cursed and ditched
it in The Endless Desert.  Years passed, and the people had long
forgotten about the old freighter -- when a young female, the
orphaned daughter of a once-famous husband-and-wife exploring
team, stumbled across the ship.  Her only income had been in the
trading of old equipment salvaged from wrecked ships.  No
self-respecting town will issue a permit of residence to her because of
the questionable way that her parents died.  (The rumor is that
they were killed when they tried to make a deal with the enemy.)
So it was with little hesitation that she worked her way into the
danger-marked ship.  As soon as she touched the controls,
the ship came alive and started asking and answering questions.
Within a week she had learned all that the
ship had to teach her.  It opened it's mind to her and told her
of all the wonders of limitless space.
She never asked it what really happened to it's first crew.
.ti 5
They traveled through the galaxy -- trading, scavenging, and
occasionally -- stealing.  She slowly built up the ship's
computer, engine, and weaponry systems.  These alterations were
made partly from pride and partly from necessity.  Her ability to
make the best of any situation sometimes called for quick,
powerful action -- often in the form of a hasty getaway.

.ti 5
Her nine years of scavenging had given her the skill,
cunning, and sophistication to handle any situation -- until she
found herself in the middle of a war on a tiny blue planet.  She
had only gone there to pick up a few hand-made trinkets from
some elves.  (There is no market for such things among her people
-- they hardly put up with humans, let alone elves -- but there
are other systems and other buyers.  )
 The war exploded around her and her ship.  This time she was
stuck.  .  .

The sensors in her ship showed four destroyers heading, in a
sweep-search pattern, directly towards her location.  She pauses,
mutters a short command to the ship, then blows the bottom hatch.
Squeezing her body through the escape portal, she plops down on
the ground and scrambles away.  Her ship waits for her to reach a
safe distance, then burrows into the ground, using it's shields
to pull the dirt back into the hole.  If the enemy ships notice an
inactive, buried, freighter, they will most likely consider it an
old wreck and pass over it.  As a small group of armored enemy
soldiers move past her thicketed hiding place, she glances
towards the ruffled grass where her ship lays buried and hopes
that the enemies are as stupid as they look.  Silently she moves
behind a group of boulders in an attempt to evade their infra-red
vision systems -- if they have them.  She drops down to her knees
and draws her hand-blaster -- she waits.  However long she
waited, it seemed an eternity.  Suddenly, a strange feeling
creeped into her consciousness -- she twirled around and, dropping
onto her side, aims into the center of the thing standing behind
her.  It was greyish white, metal, with its plates gleaming in
the fading sunlight.  For some reason she couldn't pull the
trigger -- and just lay looking at the shimmering faceplate of
the helmeted creature standing before her.
It was Cheetsak's first encounter with a Guardian.
.bp
.sp 6
A low, staccato voice broke the trance...

.ti 5
"Stand up ! Come on, you won't be seen."
.br
It was speaking in her native language !
.ti 5
"You are a Banche, aren't you ?" The metal thing asked.
.br
She nods.
.ti 5
"Well then stand up and touch my hand !"

She remembered her situation and struggled to get to her feet
and remain graceful at the same time.  She hesitantly reached towards
the creature's armored hand. With a flash of blackness she found that she
had been transported to a black-sanded beach somewhere on the other
side of the planet.
Back at the clearing, a red-banded Group-Commander stands silently
watching his subordinate try to explain the ship's disappearance.
He wasn't listening -- He had a good idea of what really happened.

Cheetsak turned to look around and determine where on the planet,
if it was the same planet, that she was located.
As she turned, her weight shifted and
her foreleg sank into the sand.
Cheetsak's ship appeared on the beach
just in time to see its master slowly
tip over and fall into the surf.
.sp 2
After uttering something about the genetic heritage of the creature
that dumped her there, Cheetsak barked out a set of commands to her ship -- in
between an unending stream of curses in seven languages.
While helping its partner out of the water, Cheetsak's  ship made
an offhand remark about "being foolish enough to deal with elves...".

	 a Banche here, you, or I !?  ---- And as
	 far as blaming ME for this situation, 
	 you had best remember how far an empty ship
	 would get... especially around THESE parts! "


Tapping the underside of the ship with the barrel of her gun,
she finishes brushing off the sand and seaweed and proceeds to
climb up into the hovering craft.

	" Lets get out of here, I've had enough of this place."

	" And where do we go ?" 

	" UP!  -- and if you spot that 'thing' that put us on this

She rests her head on her folded arms and watches the planet sink
away into the distance.

	"What's wrong with you ?" inquires the ship. "You've been

	"I don't know, " replied Cheetsak, without taking her eyes
	off the slowly moving dots of light, "-- I guess it's

	"But you didn't..."

	"Don't ask me why..." she listlessly punches a console button.
	"-- but there is something weird about that creature..."

She hoists herself out of the captain's seat with a grunt.

	"I'm going under for a while -- If anything happens..."

	"I'll let you know."

The door was already closed by the time the ship completed the sentence.

Totality (copywritten to AR)

The Totality system for film production is a multi-technology
process to create the most gripping special effects ever made.
Totality relies on three components; The computer-controlled
camera, the multi-track sound system, and real-time projection
syncronus system.  The camera is a standard 35mm SFX camera with
accompanying Servoboom and controller computer.  The recording
system is a 16 track Ampex mastering deck with modular interface
to the control computer.  The controller is continuously writing
out real-time sync signals to be used after shooting the live-action
and SFX sections of film.  The syncronus projection system is
still proprietary and can't be discussed in any detail until final agreements
are reached with the various parties involved.
It uses the second of the two "stereo" tracks, used in standard
film audio recording, as a 'DSO' track and can be selectively
multiplexed to regain the control-channel initially recorded
on the first filming.

	"Well, if you're chilly, try some of this!"

.fi
Thaelin pours a tiny amount of dark-green liquid into a
mug and pulls a ladle full of water out of a nearby water-tank...

.nf
	"You AREN'T going to water it down !"

	Grinning, Thaelin dilutes the liquid and
	does the same for his cup. "Just wait a
	second...  There ! Try some of this !"

.fi
The elf hands the mug of green liquid to Goran. He studies
it for a second and then takes a sip...

.nf
	"Ok, so?  It tastes like a mild..."
	Suddenly, Goran's voice turns to a 
	wisper. "WWWHHOOOAaaa" Waving at his
	mouth, "Whahh -- What was that!!!"

	"A delayed reaction," The old
	elf grinning madly, "Watch!"

.fi
Thaelin drops into his overstuffed chair, and with both hands, gulps
down the entire cup of treacherous spirits.

From the other side of the room, a soft but worried voice blurts out
of the previously silent Sandbat.

.nf
	"Uh oh! Here goes!"

.fi
Goran turns back to see a look of pain -- or ecstasy -- on the
face of the old elf.
A second later and Thaelin opened his eyes, both of which were filled
with tears...
.nf

	"Umpff!  Ooo, is that GOOD !!"
	Drying his eyes, he looks over
	at the astonished Guardian.
	"Heh, you haven't finished yours!"

	"And if I don't," Goran's voice still
	not right, "will it eat through the cup!?"

	"Naww, as a matter of fact, if you
	drink it now, it'll taste like
	water... Try it!"  Thaelin waits
	to see how brave his friend is.

.fi
Goran looks down into the cup, closes his eyes, and swallows
the entire contents...  Nothing! It doesn't taste like anything!

.nf
	Giggling, "It decays back to nothing
	in about ten seconds -- want to try it again?"

	"NO !" getting his voice back,
	"I mean, not right now..."
.bp
.sp 6

The old Sandbat poking its nose through the wall butts in.

	"He knows better now, Thaelin."
	adding, "But elves never learn!"

Noting a pause in the conversation, the ship keeps talking...

	"May I speak with the Chief Guardian?"

Goran looks at his elf-friend for a moment, shrugs, and mutters
an overly formal "Yes, you may..."

	"It has been long since I have conversed
	with you and I am grateful for your presence..."

The Guardian sits back and waits for the formal compliments
to trail off...

	"Simply, I have two questions to ask
	the Chief Guardian..."

	Goran interrupts, "You know my first
	name, I would rather have you use it."

	"As you wish," pausing, "Goran, I
	recorded a major explosion located
	outside the atmosphere two days
	ago... What I want to know is --
	Will there be any action in this
	system?"
.fi

Goran sighs and pulls off his helmet, exposing the face of a
young man that has been aged by eternities of trouble...
.nf

	"Officially, no. Unofficially, probably -- but I
	can't say until I have been updated on the status
	of the sector.  I really don't know."

	"I see,"  a long pause, "Oh!
	Yes, the second question was --
	Where  IS your ship???"

.fi
It takes Goran a moment to remember that Sandbats get attached
to each other -- they like to be with their own kind.  Even
though Thaelin's ship is about one-third the size of a regular
Sandbat, and about two-thirds as smart, it is still the fastest
SBF-class ship in the galaxy...

.nf
	To Thaelin, "Any objections about
	letting them spend some time together?"
.bp
.sp 6

	"No.."  then looking at the dark metal
	creature, "As long as they don't play
	too rough!"

"Alright, then," Goran slips on his helmet again.  He closes
the visor and starts talking to his ship --

	"Gia, patch all displays to me."

	"Done.  I am sorry about what happened today."
	Gia's voice turning very apologetic.

	"No need to be sorry. I wasn't in danger or anything.
	You did a great job."  Goran tries to cheer up his ship.

	"It's just that I felt so damn helpless!"  Her voice
	showing a fraction of her frustration. "Really!"

	"I should've spotted him myself -- you did fine."

.fi
As he finishes the sentence, the visor fills up with all
the vital data concerning the ship, the planet, the system,
and Central.
The visor, just like the ship's front windows, are
Parallink displays.
They can both intensify or eliminate parallax error
as it displays information -- a cheap way of creating a
three-dimensional visual readout.

Well, everything looks serene...
.nf

	"Cut DDS, give me Forward and come to
	my location. Don't play too rough !"

.fi
The image on the visor blurs with motion for a fraction
of a second before the ship freezes in position ten meters
away from the back of Thaelin's house.

The little Sandbat lifts up and starts to skim off
towards the larger ship.
.nf

	"You be careful!" Thaelin shouts out
	the gaping hole to his ship, "That
	'Bat can scatter you without tryin'!"

The Guardian slides his visor up --

	"You're starting to sound like an
	old hen !  I did the design of your
	ship -- she won't get hurt!  Nothing
	can catch it to hurt it!! "

	"I know, but, those things can get to be
	very dangerous when they get a little
	too excited !"

.fi
Outside the hut, a low hum rises in pitch and fades away as the
two ships vanish over the horizon.
.ti 5
Goran takes a long look at the old, but agile, elf.
He remembers how the young elf's hair used to stick out from around the edges
of, and clash almost audibly with, the dark green exterior of his pilot's
helmet.
It has probably been many years since Thaelin's scruffy patch of bright red
hair had turned to its present august shade of white.
But underneath the now bushy white eyebrows
were the same emerald-green eyes that still seem to look into your soul.

.nf
	"So, what have you been doing?"
	trying to back up the question,
	"I know you haven't been just sitting
	around here deteriorating!"

	"As a matter of fact, I have had what
	you would call a comfortable job!"
	Thaelin gets up and goes over to a
	large bowl of fruit. "As luck would have
	it, my Guardian training has come in VERY
	handy over the years..."

.fi
As Thaelin bites into a greenish-white oblong fruit, Goran hears
the door swing open.  He turns to see a young elf girl rush through
the doorway.
.nf

	"Thaelin !  What was that..."

.fi
The girl turns and sees the armored creature sitting almost close
enough to touch.
As fast as lightning, she draws her sword and drops to the crouching
attack position.

.nf
	"Put that thing away." Goran speaking in
	a rusty form of her native language,
	"You're too young to die !"
.fi

The hard and dangerous look on the young elf's face turns to a look
of worried confusion.  She glances at Thaelin, who was trying to keep
a straight face, then back to the metal thing on the couch.

After a few tense seconds, the lithe young female breaks her stance
and scowls at Thaelin.

.nf
	"What is this?!! Some kind of TEST !!!"
	Flashing an angry glare at Goran, she
	turns back to Thaelin and sheathes her
	sword.  "I almost chopped your friend
	here -- by the way, where'd he get that
	outfit ?"
.bp
.sp 4

.fi
Thaelin goes over to the young girl and puts his hand on her
shoulder --
.nf

	"I hate to break it to ya', but that
	isn't fake!"  gesturing towards the
	thing on the couch. "If he wanted to,
	he could turn this planet into dust!"

	"No..."  looking at Thaelin for
	a hint of a lie,  "You are kidding!"

	"G'ran, meet K'val.  She is my 'comfortable
	job'. "    Seeing the somewhat lewd
	look on Goran's face, Thaelin tries to 
	explain. "She's the village chieftain's
	daughter -- I'm training her at the finer
	arts...   K'val meet G'ran.  He's the
	Chief Guardian of this sector -- Uh,
	of all the surrounding stars..."

	"The name is Gor-an." Glancing at Thaelin,
	the armored figure turns to the young elf.
	"So, you are Thaelin's resident student ?"

She just stood there looking at the Chief Guardian.

.fi
Pushing her light-brown hair out of her eyes, K'val turns
to Thaelin and points at the couch --
.nf

	"THAT is a Guardian !?"

	"You sound disappointed!" Goran laughs,
	"What do you want, wings?!"

.fi
Seeing that she was still skeptical about the matter, Goran
makes a quick hand gesture to Thaelin and he steps away from
the doubting elf.

.nf
	"Guardians just exist in old legends!"
	adding, "Like the ones my father and Thaelin tells."

	"So did elves -- Alright then, draw your sword
	and hold it as tight as you can..."

.fi
Goran straightens up in his place. His suit locks into his
thoughts.  K'val feels a tug at her sword -- she grabs it with
both hands.  Goran smiles as Thaelin half-covers his eyes and
turns away.  With a slight movement of his hand, Goran pulls
the sword out her hands and pins her to the ceiling.

.nf
	"I believe you, I BELIEVE YOU !!!"
.bp
.sp 6

	Thaelin breaks in, "You made your
	point, Goran.  Better let her down."

	"I CAN'T BREATHE UP HERE !!!"
	her voice starting to fade...

.fi
The Guardian gently sets her back onto her feet and gave Thaelin
a look of disappointment.

.nf
	"I thought you'd have her toughened up by
	now!" getting up, Goran pulls the girl's
	sword out of the wooden planks that cover
	the floor of Thaelin's house.  Handing it
	to her, "Now, what has Thaelin taught you?"
.fi

K'val was looking at the Guardian the same way a rabbit would a
rattle-snake.  She was clearly starting to lose her composure...

.nf
	"Thaelin, why don't you give her some
	of that green stuff?" 

.fi
Thaelin sits her down on the couch, takes her sword and puts it
down on the table next to her.
.nf

	"You don't have to be afraid of him,"
	Thaelin sits down next to her and pats
	her on the back. "Why, he saved my
	life more times than I can count."

	"He's the one in the stories?!"
	K'val starts recalling fragments
	of all the old far-fetched stories
	that Thaelin had told her.
	"If you fought with Thaelin, then
	how old are you !?"

Goran smiles at the girl-elf's persistent skepticism --

	"She never gives up ! Does she!?"

.fi
The Guardian squeezes himself into the old, overstuffed, elf-sized chair and concentrates
on the form of the little warrior sitting across from him.  There is
a strange beauty about the way her pointed ears poke up through
the long brown hair that flowed down her back.
She had an almost childlike look about her -- along with a crafty
slyness that shows in her every movement.
.bp
.sp 6

.nf
	"Well, let's just say that I am older than
	all your relatives put together.  I was born
	in a time long before the Final War, before
	The Holocaust...  I am, indirectly, one of the
	group of beings that raised your people from
	the ashes and gave them life  -- along with
	many others.  Actually, it all happened long
	before I became aware.  But I've been your race's
	sentinel since it's birth."

	"What are you talking about ?!  The Creation says..."

	Goran interrupting again, "That book will back up
	what I am saying -- if you are willing to look at
	it from a different viewpoint..."

Goran signals to Thaelin to throw his helmet over to him.

	"How do you think we got the name 'Guardians' ?
	Quite simply, we were put here to protect our
	superior's... investments..."

.fi
The Chief Guardian looks into the bottom of the helmet and rattles off some
coded gibberish to his far distant ship.

Goran gets up and checks the helmet settings.  He walks over to the
little female elf, "Here, put this on."
.br
Holding it out to her, she hesitates at first, then takes it
from his hands and puts it over her head.
The helmet covered her head and some of her shoulders and was
way too large to fit comfortably.
.nf

	"I'd let you use Thaelin's old helmet, but
	I'm not sure that he still has it."

	"Oh, I still have it, it's in my..."
	Thaelin remembers that his ship is
	probably twenty or thirty thousand
	kilometers away by now.

	"No matter, mine will do for now..."
	Goran reaches over to the front of the helmet,
	"You're going to see your entire history flash
	by in about six minutes... get ready."
.fi

Goran slides the visor down over her face.  He watches her muscles
tense as the first images appear in front of her.
She sat unmoving for a while -- one hand holding the bottom of the
helmet, the other gripping the side of the table standing next
to her.
.bp
.sp 6
.nf
	"I hope she can handle it."  Thaelin,
	having gone through the same thing many
	years before, remembers how difficult it was
	to function after his indoctrination.
	"Your first mindlink can give you a
	hell of a headache -- Like being hit
	with a very BIG rock !"
.fi

Inside the helmet, the young girl's mind is exposed to millions
of years of history.  She sees an entire population emerge, grow,
advance, and destroy itself.  She feels an entire planet scream in
pain and death.  She watches as a seed populates a hundred planets
with several different forms of life, some surviving, some not.
She looks to see her planet struggle to become fertile again
and succeed.
.ti 5
A curtain of cold, crisp air enfolds her as she watches the hills and
valleys grow and become rich and green.
In the center of all the beauty, she sees a group of six short,
pointy-eared creatures materialize with nothing but an innate
knowledge of the land -- and themselves.
The seed grew into tribes. Then villages appeared.
She then saw the attacks by the Old
World monsters -- the previous inhabitants of the planet
that survived the holocaust.
She saw thousands of her people die in the Final War and the
intervention of the ones that she now recognizes as the Guardians.
.ti 5
In a moment she witnesses the destruction of all the remaining
monsters by two Guardians.  Later, another group of armored creatures
come onto the scene -- a whole tribe of them. She shudders as she
watches one Guardian become trapped by the splotchy-green armored
animals -- then see them tear him apart with their combined weaponry.
A flood of hate, anger and loss fills the girl's mind
at the moment of the Guardian's death. 
A black ship appears from over the horizon and turns the area where
the troup of soldiers were into a glowing 
field of burning craters, then chases the remaining ships into space
where it destroys all but one.
.ti 5
K'val watches as the black ship tracks the remaining ship back to
it's home base -- then attacks.

In a matter of seconds the remorse-ridden ship turns the surface
of the planet into a burning globe of molten rock.
As the screen clears, she sees the ship spin out into space
and become a small temporary star.

The screen goes blank.

Thaelin lifts the helmet off the head of the semi-conscious girl.

.nf
	"She'll be alright in a few minutes."
.bp
.sp 6

.fi
Looking at the little elf, Goran remembers the things you notice
first when judging an elf's well-being.  With K'val, he noticed her
ears -- they seem to 'sag' when an elf is either exhausted or severely
depressed -- and by the way she looked, K'val was both.
She just sat there, with her head hanging down, breathing slowly.

Long ago, Thaelin explained the state of mind that K'val was now in.
He said that it's like sorting good and bad fruit -- in other words,
she's sifting through all the conflicting ideas trying to find out
which is true.

After a long period of silence, K'val coughs, takes a deep breath,
and looks across at the face of the concerned Guardian.

.nf
	"Iii- It was one of them... today ?"

	"Yes, but he's been taken care of."

	"We -- our village -- thought you were the
	one that..."

.fi
K'val's eyes close as she starts to go under again. Thaelin grabs her
and keeps her head from hitting the table.

.nf
	"She looks pretty shot to me, Thaelin.
	Are you SURE she'll be able to break
	out of it?"  Goran getting visibly worried.

	"Yeh. It never affected ME like that!
	Then again, I'm not as sensitive as her..."
	Turning to Goran, "She can read people's
	minds, sometimes..."


.fi
A short time followed when K'val seemed to be asleep.  She laid
there with her head on the arm of the couch.  Then, as if a strange
metamorphosis had taken place during her short nap, she opened her
eyes, yawned, and sat up.
As if remembering something long forgotten, K'val grabs her forehead --

.nf
	"OOooh, I'll never forgive you for this headache..."

Goran gets up and retrieves his helmet from off the couch --

	"Well, I've caused enough trouble for today.."
	The Guardian puts on his helmet.
.bp
.sp 6

	"What are you doing !?" Thaelin's voice
	rises an octave, "You're not leaving!
	You just got here !  Come on, sit down."

	"I really have to leave. Tell you what --
	I'll give my ship a warning.  That means
	that she'll work her way back here in about
	twenty minutes..."  Goran activates the
	helmet and utters a one-word command.

	"I'll let you go this time -- BUT !"
	Thaelin points a threatening finger
	at his armored visitor. "I expect
	you to show up for the Harvest
	Festival -- and bring Cheetsak and
	the Rookie too !  Its day-after-
	tomorrow.  What do ya' think ?"

	Goran gives a quick, harsh, glance.
	"Do I have a choice ?" Turning to
	K'val, "Would you have any objections?"

	"Huh?  Who? Me?... Uhm no!"
	She thinks about it for a second,
	"I had better make sure that everyone
	knows before-hand -- panic spoils any
	party..." she shakes her head in an
	attempt to wake up, "Uh, Goran ?"

	"Yes?" turning to look at K'val, Goran
	felt a strange twinge -- then a foreign but
	distinct thought entered his mind...
	"I doubt it...  Why you little witch!"

K'val breaks out in a broad grin and slaps her knees.

	"You locked into my suit, you..."
	K'val pushed her mental message on Goran
	again. "Your becoming one of us is not
	up to me -- there IS your father...
		I heard that too! "

	K'val jumps off the couch, clenching
	her fists    "But I can help you damnit !!
	And I've been trained by Thaelin !
	What else do you want !?"

	"Now I see what Thaelin taught you !
	No elf-princess speaks like that!"

	"TAU-212 -- fifteen seconds..."  announces Gia.
	"Run a scan for population centers?"

	"Ok... There! I found the ship.  It's just

.ti 5
To creep up on the sea-shore village where the ship was located,
Goran had his ship come down about fifty kilometers away from the
beach.  If he approached the village underwater, it would save the
surrounding towns from the inevitable panic and disruption that
the sight of a Sandbat would evoke -- and make it harder for the
enemy soldier to locate the village.  Since the enemy pilot can only use 
visual tracking methods,
there is no reason to make it easy for him by flying in and acting
like a big red target-marker!
An enemy power-suit has less equipment
than a Guardian's. They are so badly built that they can be punctured by
a blast from a handgun at medium range.  The reason for this is economy.
There are some four hundred and fifty thousand armored soldiers in the
neighboring systems -- and nine Guardians, three in each sector.

.nf
	"Take it in to six-meter depth and pressurize."
	Glancing at his rifle, Goran leaves it behind.
	"Maybe I am paranoid.  Alright, open it..."

.fi
The bottom hatch opened exposing a wall of water.
As Goran dropped out of the ship, he knew he wouldn't be
alone.  Every thing he hears, sees, feels, and smells is
being transmitted back to the ship to be logged.
Walking onto the beach, a group of children scatter and run
into the village.  Well, so much for secrecy!
.br
To keep the town from emptying out, the best thing to do
is show yourself -- fast.

.ti 5
Goran appeared in the center of the village just as the children
finished explaining what they saw to the village elders.
The crowd was near hysteria already -- then someone noticed him.
.bp
.sp 4
A small stampede broke out as the occupants of the village
tried to get away from the metal monster.
Three of the four village elders hobbled and ran into
nearby huts, leaving one shaking with his eyes closed.

.ti 5
Looking around at the deserted street, Goran came upon
the sight of an old white-haired elf setting himself down
onto an overturned bucket.
The elf put his head on his hand and sat staring at the creature
across the street.

.nf
	"Elves either run or fight... "  Goran said
	through his helmet speaker.  "But they NEVER give up!"

.fi
Walking up to stand aside of the old elf, Goran watched as
a sly smile replaced the deep icy stare.

.nf
	"You scared the pants off me, you asshole!"

	"Thaelin!" Goran yelled as he picked the elf up.

	"Hey! Careful with those damn gloves!!"

.fi
Remembering the razor-sharp edges on the plates of the
gloves, the Guardian hastily puts his old friend down.
After all all these years, Thaelin still knows the Ancient
English slang he'd picked up as a trainee!
.sp
.ti 5
Goran regained his senses when he noticed some of the
braver inhabitants starting to venture out of their
hiding places.  As he turned back to Thaelin, he felt
a hot sting hit his back.  The Guardian hit the ground
as the townspeople are driven back into hiding by the blast.

.nf
	"You alright?!" said a voice from the suit
	of the supposedly dead Guardian..
	"Thaelin??!"

	"Yeh, I'm ok" wispered the elf laying
	aside of him.  Chuckling, "I think I
	got a sunburn from the reflection off
	your suit!"

	"Aw, that's too bad!"  Goran using
	an over-sympathetic tone. "If I
	don't stay down, your town will get
	blown apart..."

	"Then what do you intend to do?"

	"I'll see if Gia can sneak up
	from behind, but I've got to
	know where the target is first."

	"He's up in the hills over to your left"
	Thaelin considers the idea of looking up
	but then decides against it.

.fi
On the hillside facing the village an armor-suited
soldier shakes his snub-nosed rifle in victory.  The
enemy pilot didn't notice the other armored creature standing
twenty meters off to his side.

A blade-covered finger squeezes the rifle's trigger.

There was a flash and explosion as the air burned along
the path of the beam -- followed by a second, louder explosion
as the beam tore through the soldier's suit and turned his
flesh and bone into a mass of rapidly-expanding gasses.

The Guardian on the hillside turns to look down on the
village as bits and pieces of bone and metal shower down around
him.

.nf
	"I assume you aren't dead, Goat."

.fi
Goran recognizes the voice of the second of the Terra-sector
Guardians as it comes through his helmet.

.nf
	"You guessed right -- what took you so
	long to fire, Rookie?" 

.fi
Raan, the rookie, was the only one who called him Goat -- Goran doesn't
let anyone else call him that.

.nf
	"Cheetsak sent me down. She was too lazy
	to come herself..." 

.fi
As he continues talking, Raan walks over to what was left of
the enemy's helmet.  He kicks it into a position
where he can see the ID number on the side.
As the helmet comes to rest, the image being seen through
the visor changes in color, showing depth-edges and indentations.
The image goes back to normal as the word "LOGGED" pops into

	"Actually," Raan adds, "Gia found your
	target just as you left your ship.  So
	she informed Central,  Central informed
	Cheetsak,  and Cheetsak pulled me out
	and sent me down..."

	"That makes loads of sense!"
	Goran was now getting annoyed,
	"So why didn't anyone contact me!"

	"Your ship said that the pilot was monitoring
	all the local communications.  And she couldn't
	use her onboard weapons on the hill without
	melting your precious little elves..." chiding Goran,
	"And you wouldn't want that, would you?"

	"Not particularly..."

.fi
Goran smiles as he opens his visor.  Thaelin, hearing the communications over the helmet speaker, gives the Guardian a
dirty look.  Goran mutes his helmet transmitter...

.nf
	"He's a rookie,"   trying to appease Thaelin,
	"and he has a lot to learn about you elves!"

.fi
Thaelin nods and waves off the entire matter.

Around the galaxy, elves receive the brunt of the 'pointy, short'
jokes that deal with everything from sports to sex.
It's just one of the things the rookie will have to unlearn,
otherwise he will have very few friends in this sector.

.nf
	"Alright," Raan breaks in, "I can see you
	talking down there -- what's up??"

The Chief Guardian shifts his helmet back to normal --

	"Nothing, go back to sleep." Then getting
	an idea, "No! Go back to base and
	have breakfast!"

	Raan complains, "But I've already had breakfast...
	What is..."

	"Then have lunch! I have a lot of unfinished
	business here."

	Raan starts needling Goran. "Ok, but now that
	you're up, when are you going to see Cheets'?"

	"That," Goran speaking calmly but very threateningly,
	"is none of your damn business."

Thaelin, knowing the significance of the comment, shakes his head
and mutters a disgusted curse on the rookie's insolence.

Muting his helmet again --
.nf

	"Thank God I can keep him 'frozen' anytime
	I please -- the privilege of rank! "

	"But still, does everyone know?"
	Thaelin no longer trying to hide his
	astonishment.  "I mean..."
.bp
.sp 6

	"Times have changed! Maybe not here..."
	reassuringly, "No one cares about inter-
	species matings anymore -- at least no
	one that matters."  adding, "And if
	that rookie thinks he is going to get
	on MY mate's nerves by bringing it up..."

.fi
Goran switches to Command Channel 67 and scrambles his
transmissions --
.nf

	"Gia ?  Have you found this..?"

	"Yes, Com67, go on..."

	"Track Raan's ship. Make sure he
	goes back to base. Also, tap Central.
	-- If he harasses Cheetsak, let her
	tear him apart -- then tell the
	Central system to freeze 'im and
	stick him back in limbo."

	"Got it."  the ship's light goes off
	in Goran's helmet.

Thaelin gets up off the bucket and brushes himself off --

	"Sounds like Cheetsak is still as
	strong with her tongue as she is
	with her muscles."  adding, "Things
	have changed, you say ?"

	"Yeh, people will accept almost
	anything now..."  comments the old
	part of the Guardian.  "Hey, how
	about that drink you promised
	me last time we talked !!"

	"After today, you bet..." Thaelin
	ignores the blatant change of
	subject and gestures down the road.
	"My nerves could use it."

.fi
They walked a short distance and came upon a run-down looking
shack with stone walls and a clay-and-sod roof.  Ducking the low ceiling as he stepped through
the doorway, Goran looked around to see the usual rustic elfin
furniture and trappings -- with one exception.
In the wall on the opposite side of the room was a huge hole.
The hole was presently being occupied by the blue-and-green
nose of Thaelin's ship.
.nf

	"An unusual decoration," Goran chuckles,
	" 'must get a bit drafty !"
Gql^4uu{
ip became charged with energy as the
gravity of the planet suddenly disappeared.  The walls of the crater
that Cheets' ship was in became white-hot and exploded outwards as the
power-tow freighter used the planet's surface as a pushing-off point.

Hugging as close to the surface as possible, the Bancheon ship
rips a gigantic gash in the topography of the desolate planet as
its engines scramble all matter and energy within a thousand meters
to either side.
Cheetsak lets out a whoop just a a mountain range zooms over the
horizon.  By some instinctive reflex, she swung the ship straight-up
and channeled all of its power into the engine systems.  Now, like
in the old days, she'd use more skill than she had...

.nf
	"Grounders will start firing now..."
	Cheets' mumbled the statement just before
	the first surface-based guns started firing.
	"They won't like this!"

.fi
Flipping her visor down, Cheetsak slaps her left hand
over K'val's eyes -- blocking the view of the energy bursts
that were getting closer and closer to the ship.  Cheets'
other hand tapped a control on the top console.  There was
a blinding flash as the ship used every bit of surge-power
to break into hyperspace while not-yet out of the planet's
atmosphere.  The ground crews saw the same flash, but not
for the same length of time.  As the ship pushed against
all the laws of planetary physics, a shock-wave of expanding
energy caused the planets surface to become a breeding ground
of low-level fusion reactions.  Looking back, the expanding
ring of blue-white nuclear fire was clearly visible as the
planet shrunk quickly from view.
.nf

	"Glad therrr's no good-guys down there."
	Glancing over to the stunned elf next to
	her, Cheets' could see that it would take
	K'val a while to realized what had just
	happened. "Because there's a hell of a
	hole where we were..."

	"Central," said a voice with no form.

	"Why have I been activated?!" the shabby-looking figure growled.

	"There is a major problem in the Terra-sector and..."

	"And  WHY  didn't you pull the rookie out and use him?!"

.fi
The beard of the old Guardian was now almost touching the transparent
green cube that was the source of the voice.
.nf

	"This situation calls for your experience -" the cube states calmly.

	"You say that every single time you pull me -" his voice rising
	to an exasperated yell.

	"- And it deals with your pet civilization..." squeezes in the cube.

	"What.. the elves??"   his mind starting to clear.

	"Who else?"

	"Ok, what happened?" The robed creature picks up the cube
	and walks toward the food storage area.

	"It seems " the computer supplying the cube with information
	silently churns with cybernetic thought, "that Scoon-Sector's
	commander chased a destroyer into our region..."

	"So?!"   He picks up a small pink globe and examines it --
	well, if it came from Food-Stores, it must be edible...

	"So, he tracked it to TAU-212 and destroyed it."

	"Any planetary damage?"    Trying to peel the globe,
	it slips from his hands and rolls under a nearby table.

	"Just some atmospheric ionization, but... ARE you listening???"

	"Of course -- go on!" shouts out the figure from under
	the table where his prospective snack is hiding.

	"He destroyed the ship -- but the pilot got away."
	continued the cube. "- And he was recalled to his
	own sector before he found his target."

	"Scoon, hmm.. Who was the Guardian?" the voice now
	comming from a dark corner near the table.

	"The Rarakan, Granu Rika." the cube hesitates, "Why?"

	"Just wondering..." Turning, he sees the globe on the
	other side of the room. "Damn!"   Getting up,  "Rika always
	was a persistent bastard -- but good."
.bp
.sp 6

	"Anyway, the pilot evidently spotted Thaelin's old Sandbat
		on the surface before his ship was destroyed."
	Pausing, "Now he is going on a rampage destroying villages
		left and right!"

	"What the hell for?!" turning towards the cube as if expecting
	some sort of facial expression from the computer-node.

	"In am attempt to secure the planet for an enemy takeover ? --
		He must think that Thaelin is a threat...
		What he doesn't know is that Thaelin retired long ago!"

	"I had better get down there and find Thaelin before that enemy
		pilot does -- elapsed time?"

	"Two days, four hours, thirty-two seconds -- their time."  The
	cube adds, "He's undoubtedly on foot -- with little equipment."

	Stretching, "Alright, I'll handle it..."

The feeling of boredom already seeping into the Chief Guardian, he
pulls out his old elf-sword and hacks open the little pink sphere.
It didn't take long to realize how little he liked the thing he had
just tasted.

	Under his breath "All that work for this?!"
	To the cube: "What is this crap??"

	"It's a Neetee bulb."  It pauses, "I believe
		it is used to make a form of perfume."

	"So instead of putting it in 'Supplies', Cheetsak put
		it in 'Food'!  Le'me guess -- it's closer
		than 'Supplies', right?"

	"That's what she said... I guess I should have warned you."
	The cube quickly adds "I didn't think you'd eat it!"

	"And what does one do with what is stored in 'Food'?" Asking
	in an indignant tone of voice, the Guardian picks up his
	sword and heads towards the hall leading to his room. "Never
		mind ! I'll eat on the way there. At least Gia has
		sense-enough to warn me BEFORE I eat a seed-pod!"

	"This time, try to keep your 'visit time' down. Remember, I
		am the one who has to keep checking with your ship
		when ever you're not around."   The cube pleads.

.bp
.sp 5
	"Yeh, and I hear Gia gives you a hard time whenever you
		try to contact her!"  He giggles and adds, "And I
		really can't blame my ship for that, can I?"

.fi
After waiting for a retort to his last comment, the bearded figure
shrugs and strides down a long corridor.
At the end stood a huge metal door marked with the ancient symbol
of the first Terra Guardian.
.br
.sp 2
Its been a long time.  It'll be good seeing Thaelin again.

As the door seals behind him, the old warrior sits down on the edge of his
bed.  His outward age being more voluntary than the inevitable effects of the
passing of time.  For him, time is nothing more than an unseen plague that
effects all the transitory beings that he comes in contact with.  So, how old
will Thaelin be?  Too old!  Why he refused to become a full-time Guardian is
beyond ... - no, I can see why he stayed there.  If I had a mortal wife, I
guess I'd do the same.

Looking down at the old but beautifully made sword that was sitting on the bed,
a flood of memories entered his mind and took him back to the planet where he
was born.
.br
Back to the days after the Final War -- the war where brute energy, combined
with magic and sorcery, wreaked havoc on a small, frail world. 



.ti 5
It was sundown as Thaelin, the young leader of a small, roving elf-tribe,
led his scouting party back to camp.
Just as the group entered a gully at the edge of their camp, they were
attacked by a band of monsters from the Old World
-- the decaying sub-human survivors of the Final War.
Thaelin and his companions gallantly fought off the slashing blows that the
deformed giants rained down on them.

.ti 5
The elves battled fiercely, but could not stand up to the strength
and greater number of the enemy.  Thaelin's companions died quickly
but brutally -- one by a crushed skull, the other by a spear through
the heart.
Driven on by the sight of his two dead friends,
and the idea of being hauled away and eaten,
the young elf jumps on the back of one of the two remaining
creatures and draws his blade across its throat.
Thaelin leaps from the dying carcass and rolls to escape the attack of
the last, onrushing monster.  He swings his sword by instinct -- catching
the creature in the abdomen -- but not before it slammed its weapon, a rusty
iron pole, into Thaelin's side.
.bp
.sp 6
.ti 5
Huddled in agony, the only thing the injured elf could comprehend through the waves of pain
was the body of the noisily dying monster beside him. 
Two futile attempts
at standing had failed with the result of increasing the
bleeding from the massive wound in his side.  As he fell to the
ground for the second time, the sun seemed to fade -- bringing
with it a soft whining sound. He struggled to clear his eyes and
try to get up again when he was softly pushed back to the ground.
Fighting off the effects of exhaustion and shock, Thaelin tried for
one last lucid moment and saw -- the silhouette of a huge, black, bird.
He felt the cool touch of metal against his shoulder
as his mind retreated from the pain and into unconsciousness.
Thaelin never felt himself being set down in the small, padded, cargo hold.

.ti 5
Light surrounded the drowsy elf as he came to. He felt good,
feeling no pain --  until he saw the monstrously large metal
creature looking down at him. Gripping at his side instinctively,
he found that his sword was not where it should be -- but instead
was being held by a shard-covered armored glove belonging to the
creature aside of him. Thaelin jumped off the table before his
sword slammed into the surface, stuck, and vibrated. It was when
the figure made no other moves against him that he noticed that
he was in his home back in his village. He stood, desperately trying to stop himself
from shaking.

.in 5
"Your wife and child have been evacuated with the rest of the
village."   the voice coming from the creature was low,
somewhat tinny, but   exactly correct in its pronunciation.
.br
"I am leaving now, but I will be back tomorrow. Your tribe is
a short
distance away, where the mountain meets the sea."
.in -5

.ti 5
When Thaelin rejoined his tribe, he was told that the 'metal monster'
he had seen had brought him back to the village two days earlier, saved him from the clutches of death, and
healed all of his injuries.
They also said that it was here to help them battle the
Old World monsters.

.ti 5
When the thing came back the next day, Thaelin, owing his
life to the creature, offered to join with the thing and
help it in its fight.
Upon hearing this, the creature nodded and slowly reached towards
the still-nervous elf.  Thaelin heard a dull thump and found himself
standing in a small, grassy field some distance from the village.
Hovering a short distance away was a huge, sleek object that
seemed to give off a deep violet glow.
The elf recognized that it was the 'bird' he had seen before 
he lost consciousness.
Looking at dark-black thing, Thaelin had a hard time getting his eyes
to focus on the non-descript surface of what looked to be a strange
cross between a bird and a flat, slippery-skinned sea creature that
he had seen as a child.
Whatever it was, he knew it was watching him.
A moment later and the armored creature appeared
alongside the glowing object and gestured towards it.
.bp
.sp 4

.in 5
"Your first test -- agility and reflexes.  Get ready,
 this is no game..."
.in -5

Thaelin drew his sword as the ship moved closer to him.
A long, angular column of light
formed in front of the ship.  Hanging at arm-height, the column
danced and slowly changed colors.
.ti 5

" Strike at the light as you would an enemy sword. "
 -- commanded the armored creature.
.br

Thaelin raised his sword as the ship's beam swung towards the
elf.  The tip of the beam touched the sword and knocked it
out of the elf's hand. The ship waited for him to pick up his
sword -- this time he'd use both hands.
The ship swung at him, contacted his sword, and sent
the elf spinning to the ground.
Thaelin struggled back to the ready position.
The beam lunged, hit -- this time the elf took the shock
and spun around hitting the beam in the center.
The beam recoiled, then countered by trying to knock
the sword upwards, out of his hands.
Thaelin swung at the beam again, missed, then jumped
as the beam tried to strike at his legs.
The column came in from the left, barely missing
his left foot, and hit his right.
Thaelin's legs flew out from under him.
The ship's beam disappeared
as the elf flew into a nearby patch of bushes.
The ship moved back to its spot at one end of the clearing.

.ti 5
When Thaelin's tribe saw their leader again, some four days later, they
didn't quite know what to make of the uniform he was wearing or the babbling accounts of what he'd seen and done.
He rambled on about what their planet looked like and how tiny
it is with all the stars surrounding it -- then he started proudly showing off his new uniform.
Unlike the other Guardian, Thaelin's suit was armored in only three
areas -- the knees, midsection, and forearms.
His armor, helmet, and tunic-like uniform were colored leaf-green
with light blue trim.
Thaelin's helmet, which had to be redesigned to accommodate his large
ears, had all the usual equipment.  With it, he could hear, see, and
smell things that he never knew existed.  He could also selectively
communicate with other Guardians and their ships over tremendous distances.
The grey-green belt that gathered in the tunic around his waist had two
objects attached to it. On his right, a dark green holster with some hand-held
weapon within -- on his left hung his trusty, old, elfin sword.

.ti 5
His tribe, who's beliefs go against those of the ever-advancing technological
societies in the surrounding systems,
was less enthused about their leader's new image than he was.
Thaelin's wife was no exception -- she vowed not to get near him until
he took off his suit.
A hasty compromise was made and he removed his armor until he was called
on again by the Chief Guardian.

.bp
.sp 6
That was three generations ago --  the Final War is now ancient
history and the Guardians just an old fable told by even
older elf-warriors to their great-grandchildren.


.ti 5
Thaelin joined
at the beginning of the war, and resigned at the end.
He was one of the few elves not insulated from the violent and complex
universe offland of Tau.  Actually, he learned mostly everything about
the ways of the Guardians -- became a real professional. But, he was also tied
to his wife and children, and they were tied to the old elfin ways.
He couldn't follow both the elf-philosophy and the 
calculated-killing ways of the Guardians.

Giving me his father's sword, the day that I left to go back into hibernation, was the highest tribute
he could give anyone.  The sword itself is supposed to be enchanted and had
saved Thaelin's life a number of times -- at least Thaelin thinks it did.
.br

There was something else that I feel I should remember --
an apparition-like memory that I know IS very important, but
still out of reach to my waking mind.  It must be the Sleep still
effecting my mind ....

.nf
Breaking out of his day-dream -

	"God, if I don't get down there soon, Thaelin's life won't
	be worth anything.." to another cube, "Central, get--"

	The cube breaks in, "Your ship has already been informed."

	"Tell 'er I'll be right there. I'm suiting up now."

Malfunction in service module 483 (surface) has caused failure in
tracking system.  After twenty minutes of checking, I replaced unit
with partially working spare (073).  Although it cleared the problem
up in the surface unit, it has caused more problems on the grid coor
processor by increasing the network load.  I don't care if the unit
can take vocal commands or not, the conditions outside up there are
intolerable over more than twelve minutes.  It took seven tries to free
the unit from it's mounting due to ice-and-sand blasting erosion on the
main lock plate.  Melting the number two holder was nessasary to
alow the unlocking of the scanner top for replacement.

If futher work on that surface module is needed and I am forced
out into the elements under those conditions, I will expect at least
24x pay and a full replacement of my tools.  The injuries sustained
during my last job will take at least two months to heal and are the
cause of great pain.  And I will expect at least a 15x bonus for
hazard pay because, even though your people assured me otherwise,
there ARE snowlions in that area.  I show, as proof, the gash in my arm where
one of the claws tore the aluminum hull of my Trudger and part
of my arm and the steering wheel.  Enclosed is a voucher for
one steering wheel, extensive hull repairs, one new blast parka, and

Thaelin - (elf)   Former leader of his tribe.
When in his late teens, the young, strong, and technically
minded warrior led his tribe against the hordes of hideously deformed monsters in a
series of battles before The Final War.  After a skirmish with the creatures
from The Old World, he and two others of his tribe were ambushed on
their way back to camp. Thaelin, being the only survivor of the
attack, tried to get back to camp for help. Two futile attempts
at standing had failed with the result of increasing the
bleeding from the massive wound in his side. As he fell to the

It was amazing how little things mattered back on Tau.
At least when I was single, that is.
The feeling that entrapped me= was one of disbelief at my=
surroundings.  Spending time working to refine and sharpen
the skills that I seemed to be born with and would use in my
future, I stopped and stared at the anthill turmoil.
But, being a part of it, I had a commitment to do my share
of dirtywork.  If I wasn't going to make my future then, then I'd
simply wait for something to happen. Torn apart by the factions
of my future, the pieces barely held together.  One, the protector,
and four, the sorcerer.   None being any less important than the other
sepparate components.  The combination, all not being used or appreciated,
struggled to gain dominance and caused an outpouring of frustration.
All amplified by the horrible loneliness caused by time's sepparation
with the only temperment coming from a strange form of survival adaptation.

Oh well, I was crazy then. A lot of it must have bled over into
how I act now.  I'd probably be dull as hell if I hadn't gone through it.
The fun part of today (and today's war) is how I have to react to it.
It all seems like a magnificent game -- a game that teaches as one
plays.  There is also The Spin and its strange
hold over the players.
The assassin, the part that constitutes the preditor side of me, clicks out
and a trance takes its place.  Things happen so incredibly fast.  If
that spark-trance didn't cut in, there'd be too many pieces of me floating
around to ever be put back together again.
Dangerous it is, but at least it's clean here.  And I'm in my environment.
By twentieth century standards,
the life I fit into would be most people's hell.  But here I am.

And I love it.

A sensitive woman who knows her own mind and has no great love for living
in New Jersey.  I am innately gifted when it comes to both high-technology

Though not a "party animal", I'm basically a satyr at heart

Have a Sagittarius moon and sense of humor, but take love very

I'm 5'10", stalky, in my early 20's, with brown

"I am afraid I'll have to clean this mess up -- sorry I couldn't
get here earlier. We got held up..."  She and I chuckle.

"You've been brave and all, but this is OUR job.  We don't

All around me is blackness.  I'm inside.  I can tell by the smell.
There is something else in here with me.  It is a thing, it has no
real scent.  All I can smell now is my own fear -- so intense that
if something doesn't happen, I'll either feint or die from a heart
seisure.  The thing is moving now.  The air is tight. My whole body
is shaking.  Whatever the thing is,  I know it is trying to kill me.  I jump
and scramble to some kind of corner, stumbling into a wall.

Against a dim grey backlight, I see it.  A slow moving mechanical
thing.  The silouette of something swinging around to my direction.
Only one chance.  Grab it!!  I leap at it and throw all my weight
into dragging it down and pointing it away from me.  Contact.
It sweighs slightly and turns at me.

Sudden pressure, all around me lighted shadows shoot away from
me as I fly backwards...

I wake up, wet from sweat, heart pounding three or four times
a second.  My breath still held from my leap.  I take
a deep breath and fall back onto my bed.  I turn on the light
until I can stop shaking.

	I stand, looking out into the sky.  The view of stark blue-white
only broken by the powerful sweeping motion of the scanner circling
overhead.  With it, we plot the skies and space between the earth and moon.
Wind, ever blowing past the station, cools both man and machine on an
otherwise warm, peacefully sunny day.  Updrafts carry the smell of forest
and animals up the hillside, bringing a sense of humble closeness to the
day.  These were the good times... 
	I was armed anyway.  After all, it was obvious at my birth that
my real skills would be both too valuable to waste and too dangerous to
leave unchecked.  Weapons so incredibly powerful as to strike fear in the
largest groups of creatures, now just pieces of clothing to ignore.
	The only ones not scared of my innate abilities were my mate and
all the animals we called friends.  Some animals wouldn't accept us, though.
They were few and far between, mostly they were accoustomed to peoples' scent.
We could smell it on them. They were getting closer, we were told.
But for the moment, we were free.

	The building stretches a good hundred feet in both directions.
Up here on the roof is the gravely surface of rough pebbles that look
dull white but show as a mottled green from above. The principle was
easy to understand but hard, for me, to remember.  Underneath, the
complex stands, both solid and statically charged with a natural
flowing energy. A spell, of sorts, to keep it hidden and safe. To
the sunset side, a purple-red horizon signals the onset 
of a sweeping, starry sky -- already settling in on the opposite
horizon and giving a strange and beautiful contrast.
	It's the time I love, the dusk -- when sleepy animals settle
into the hushed afterglow of the day. Soon my mate will seek me out.
To spend the night in close contact; first sexual, then emotional,
then off to sleep as one.  Later, I awake and leave her to dream
while I comb the area in subtle silence, the non-existant paths through
the forest that only we can find.  The tart and musty smell of the
trees matching and blending with the earthy, hormonal scent of my body.
The magic of the night keeps my mate's spirit with me, as she sleeps,
she walks where I walk and feel what I feel; and when the night slowly
comes to an end, she dreams.  The area secure, I join her in her sleep.

	We wake in each other's arms in the later afternoon, to
wrestle, play, and make the most of life in all the loving things we
do.  Later, we change places and I follow her through her prowling
of the night.

Wrapping myself tighter,
I sit. The chill night air whipping past me on the roof.
I sit, turning the sensitivity higher.
And I wonder.

The flickering stars on the night horizon --
the reflections of humanity's burning border.


Needing quite a large amount of food for a small population, our 'crops'
were large and yet concealed.  Most of it was grown under tree cover and
was invisible from the air.  This didn't help when our border started 
being infringed upon.

SCENE NEAR END

Cloudy, moonless, starless night.  The enemy is out there.  In the
woods, our woods, our forest.  We alone, together, wait for the end.
Crouching in the grass, we touch each other and I pat her back.  Left behind,
we do what we must.
The waiting is coming to an end.  The forest is silent now. The earth
around us standing mute, awaiting the inevitable.
It was time to use everything at our disposal to hinder the enemy as
long as possible.
Skill and magic has taken many of the invaders, but now the cost will
be ours.  We brace ourselves and prepare to lash out.
In the bare light of dimly glowing storm clouds, we see the leaves of the
trees blowing up to the sky in waves of warm, charged night air.
Lightning fills the sky and we rush to the edge of the forest, scanning
the shadows for what we know MUST be there.  We look at each other, but
she has no target as well.  We move into the bush, quickly, silently, the
trees casting frozen shadows with each strobe of lightning.
The hush being broken by echoing thunder, we smell their presence, barely,
but cannot see them.  Stopped in our tracks, we must now flush them out.
A pause.
Adrenelin pulsing through my brain, I invoke what I have left.
A series of lightning bolts slash down around me and dig deeper
and deeper into the crying forest.  I feel my mates excitement
coming through the deafening booms that ring out through the
woods.  About to move forward, I suddenly feel the enemy between
us.  I sense the feelings of surprise and shock coming from my mate.
Sudden movement, way away from me, where she is.
She only got two shots off.  Sudden sharp waves of screaming
anguish rips through me -- then nothing. A terrible, sick emptiness.
I call out to her in fear.  Something dark swings out toward me and
I jump backwards -- firing into the darkness, the lightning being
replaced by the blinding bursts of my weapon.  The trees nearest me were
burning when the rain came pounding down.  Whatever I shot at, I hit.
I didn't wait to find out what it was.  I ran deeper into the forest
and shot at whatever felt wrong.  The controller building was where
I had to get to... rain and branches whipped me as I lept onward.
If my mate still lived, she would be there.  Or I could lock out
the area where she laid, alive or not.  But only at the consoles.
But no, I knew she was dead.  The bush was getting thicker as I pushed
onward uphill in a blind rage.  I pull my blade and slash
at whatever gets in my way...  They were out there, so close...
I felt like just stopping and letting them kill me, I wanted to die.
But I was too mad.  Too mad to let them win.  I wanted their lives more
than I wanted mine.  But mostly, I wanted Her back.  For anything.
The rain kept pounding with my heart, the warm drops beating out my tears.
Blackness engulfed me and filled
my mind with anger...

Dear Ms. Goodman,
.fi
.ti 5
I just got a copy of
.ul
Love Signs
and found that parts of it hit closer to home than anything I've
ever run into.  Oh, before I go on, I have to warn you that this is
probably the exact kind of letter you don't like to get.... Anyway,
all my life, I've been plagued by the emotions of being one-half
of a sepparated (by time and distance) matched pair;  What you call a Twin Soul 
For years, I've had a long string of dreams.  Dreams of my life
with my mate.  It was in a time and place I can't be sure of.
A place very alien as compared to my present life, but it is more "home"
to me than anything I've had in this life.
Whenever the environment, it is of little importance to me NOW.

The problem is that I've been given these images with no reason.
I say "no reason" because I don't know enough to put all the pieces
together.
It has told me that there
.ul
IS
another part of me out there, somewhere,
but I don't know where, when, how, or who (kind-of).
I have been 'steered' from death and injury all my life - narrowly
indeed, but I'm not complaining about that.  Steered away from
death to go on to what!?!?  
A Goat's will is formidable, but only when it has direction.

If I had never had the dreams, I'd never have had to struggle against
the incredible pain of sepparation that the dreams brought back.
My lack of her, my missing her, has brought out (from time to time)
the worst traits that a Capricorn can have... depression and viciously
intense frustration.
I sometimes think that a strange game is being played with my life
(see what I mean about bad Capricorn traits... paranoia!).

Anyway, I am damn-close to the point of despair.  I would never have
written you if all other attempts hadn't failed.  You have your own
search to continue and (hopefully soon) conclude.  The last thing
I want to do is delay your advancing to your goal.  If I can,
I would love to help in your battle, but can't imagine what I could do.
Don't hesitate to find out if there is anything I can do.  My situation
is much more mundane, but still similar to yours.  We are both searching.
But you have that great Arien optimism, a wonderful tool.

.ti 5
Any suggestions, leads, advice or referals to who you would consider
a competent astrologer, would be of the utmost help.  Like your
example in "Taurus woman - Capricorn man" I hope for a happy ending
to both mine, and YOUR, stream of bizzare circumstances.

Thanks for listenning to all my verbal sobbing,

Dear Ms. Goodman,

I just got a copy of
.ul
Love Signs
and found that parts of it (esp. Tau-Cap) hit closer to home than anything I've
ever run into.  Oh, before I go on, I have to warn you that this is
probably the exact kind of letter you don't like to get...
Anyway, I have gone from one end of the book to the other.  In all,
it's the best sign-to-sign compatibility compendium I've ever seen.

However, there is a little commentary in the Libra-Libra section (pg. 847)
that gets on my nerves.  It deals with the labeling of Playboy models
as women who are into the "abasement of her femininity and her future motherhood."
I sincerely doubt that their one-time career as models (for Playboy, at least)
has changed their overall outlook on life, love, or motherhood.
The nuclear power editorial, ok, but this one could easily be more degrading and
damaging than the subject that you wrote it about.
That's hardly all I have to say about it, but, even though you are very
open-minded, I've long since given up expending much time in arguing with Ariens... So, enough of that.

.ti 5
The main reason why I wrote you is because I am one of, what you would call, a "Soul-Mated" pair --
A pair sepparated by time and distance.  Eight years ago, I started
getting dreams, different from all other dreams, of my (past) life
with her (my mate).  The details of our life were absolute.  Until
a few years ago, I seriously thought that I was crazy -- for these
dreams have slowly, but drastically, changed all the facets of the
way I think.  Unfortunately, I am still waiting for our reunion in
this life... (something I am not totally certain about, but have
more hope now that I have read that little poem by Rossetti.  I
have never had 'good luck' as others have, but I have always been
steered away from injury and death by the narrowest margins; margins
that are so tiny as to defy logic. For that I am thankful).
I have been given a clear vision of what we had and no explanation
as to why.  So I have been struggling with the torment and sorrow
of being torn from the person who is not only my love, but the
complementary "other half" of our (note: OUR) soul!
I don't know when, how, or
.ul
IF
Gaia (my `God') will
bring us back together.  Meanwhile, I fight-off the horrendous
depression and loneliness that not having her brings.
I often wish that I had never had the dreams (and memories)
for just that reason.

.ti 5
The first version of this letter originally asked for advice in the
possibilities of using astrology to help predict when, where, or how I would
ever find my mate again, well, if you aren't
.ul
too
angry with me, I still would.
As you know, a Goat's will is formidable, if given direction.
Even though I am not as pathetic-a-person as I may have put across in this
letter, I still know what I can (and used to) be.  That is why I am using
all my heart and soul in finding her.  Just like the inverse of the Synergy
theory, if 1+1=3, then our being apart makes us much less than half of what
we were together.  I'll try anything.  At this moment, I am running an AD
in the Want Ad Press (in N.J.) that describes me - and her - without sounding
absurd, in the hopes that it (a one in 2-billion chance) comes through.

I know that my mate is out there, somewhere.  I can sometimes almost reach-out and
touch her, in the night.  There really IS a thread that binds us, across
time and space... But you know that already!  Never mind.

In closing, I wish you all the luck you need in your own, very difficult,
search.  If there is anything that I might be able to do to help you
in your quest, just ask... For I can understand the feeling, indeed.
After all, remember, Darth Vader was a Goat...

Oh, yes, the envelope included in this letter is for any reply
that you wish to send.  I would greatly appreciate a response, even
if it is to say that you have nothing to say.


Thanks for listening to my verbal sobbing.

soaked up the warmth on my chest.
The yellow light of the morning sun seemed so intense, and yet didn't
hurt my eyes as the noon-day glare did.  Wet grass brushing against my
legs, I felt as though there was no other world as safe, as beautiful, as
ours.
'- interp
I turn and head down the slope to the building.

There was little to
do until my mate awakens... she sleeps deeply and wakes slowly.
I have the misfortune of being "on my feet", instinctivly, the
second my eyes open.  This creates these times I have alone.
We are almost always together.  And if not, we are never far apart.
Always tending to be insecure, I have never taken for granted this warm security
that we share.  Growing up together, we never 'grew apart'; for my
experiences were hers as well.  We have always had a language of
unrelated phrases and gestures that only have meaning between us.
Our life was one big inside joke.

At this particular moment, I felt secure.  The land around me was
being scanned, swept, so that nothing existed without our knowing
about it.  But nothing ever happened, at least not yet.  I stood,
naked, on the grassy pslope.  I had my jacket, but I was still naked.
Without boots (:), sword, armor, or gun... I was naked.  It felt so
good not to care about such things...

Standing out in the grass, I decided to do what I almost always
did when extreme bordom sets in -- fall over and roll around for
a while.  In the wet grass, it's like taking a cold shower.



CONTRARY:
   First of all,
Centaurs are NOT clumbsy, stupid, boorish, or smelly!
Well, granted, the infants are very unstable and tend to fall-over
a lot for the first few months of their lives, but that doesn't last
for long.  And there are a very few that don't smell the greatest...
But most are very graceful, intelligent, and even rather gentle.
They are more distant to horses than humans are!  They are, genetically,
more complex and intellectually more advanced than humans.  And they
use most of their brain's capabilities, at least the soul-mated ones did.

wrestle, play, and make the most of life in all the loving things we
do.  Later, we change places and I follow her through her prowling
of the night.
SCENE

Wrapping myself tighter,
I sit. The chill night air whipping past me on the roof.
I sit, turning the sensitivity higher.
And I wonder.

The flickering stars on the night horizon --
the reflections of humanity's burning border.
Our existance proved to be the beginning
of the destruction of their order.

Hate sprung from fear.
But we really DON'T hate them.
Just can't have them near.
We'll simply wait for it all to end.

I sit, scanning the dark forest around me.
For them.
To stop them from getting near.
For us.
My job, protectorate assassin again.
I shiver, seeing purple light-amplified night.
The night not-lessened by the help that I lend,
until the morning shows it's light.
But that time is the worst.
Just as their movies had drawn,
the battles, to drain their thirst for death,
will have to come at the break of dawn.
.sp 4

We draw our borders of metal and magic.
A hostile's crossing is once, and quite short.
We cut off their overatures, of folly and sport.
If they should die, their death be not tragic.

Some idolize us, some call us gods.
Some just think we're animals, quiet and dumb.
Both sides now at odds, at each other's necks.
Winner, loser, all take nothing.

Out here, alone, kind of.
Breath making fast clouds in front of me.
Picked because I was born to kill,
move through the night, heavy, yet unheard.
Unknown, until it's too late.
Check them, be seen, don't look bad.
The slightest move of harm my way,
One move, catch the body.
Set it softly on the ground.

Assassin again,
my mate born the same.
And when this all ends,
we'll be free from this death.
To love again.

<Now. Looking back on what I had...>
In the four, I was loved,
for what I was, for what I am.
She was one as well.
Tough and strong, soft and fragile.
Joking, serious, poised and clumbsy.
A lover, a mother, a friend, a partner, a mate.
Our love, in each other, within, without...
Her now.  Torn from each other by time's distance,
we make due. Barely keeping the pain from fixing
sorrow's lines of tears upon our faces.
Waiting, wanting the waiting to end.
Until we find each other again.
To be together again, in sync.  Our touch
a shock, a heat, interchangeable in us,
the passion of life in our blood.
We love.
For better and worse,
our life, love, existance, to others,
a sin - skin to skin, amen.


<Shitty description of sensation...>
It's really an amazing thing, the way it felt.  Not just NOT
feeling random pains in your body, but feeling really good.
We both used to feel that way about 95% of the time.  The other
5% was either ECH or REALLY BAD.
The REALLY BAD was terrible, usually a form of pneumonia-like disorder.
But the GOOD was very, very, good.  In our case, our neuro-system increased
with size and made for rather sensitive bodies.  Feelings flooding
one's mind all the time is pretty incredible.  If ill, you can count
any of us as completely useless.  Even though steady pain can be
blocked, the sore coughing pain that respiratory illness causes is
impossible to avoid.
If any of us died, it would have been from that, being killed, or
simply old age. (in that order)
A lot of us got killed either through malice or mistake.  At first,
it was mostly mistake (itchy triggers and hunters that can't see) but
that started to change when rumor got out as to where we were.
Needing quite a large amount of food for a small population, our 'crops'
were large and yet concealed.  Most of it was grown under tree cover and
was invisible from the air.  This didn't help when our border started 
being infringed upon.

Gq\^4u{decoded/TRASHI search for my mate -- my "soul" mate.
Mother nature has given me the imperative to find her,
But I don't know which way to turn.
If there is a reason, a reason why I've been given the times
together, remembered, in my dreams, with her, then it is kept
from me.  For I wander, aimlessly, without direction, alone.
Without her, I am such a tiny fraction of what I used to be.
Tomorrow is just another day...  I stand blind in the light.
But as the earth draws the nights veil across the sky, I have the
chance to feel her with me. So close, I can almost reach out to
her in the breeze before my heart.

But she is not within reach.


I sometimes wish I had never known her.  Never known her love.
I could start again, from scratch.  But she is too close to forget.
Her voice is, her smile is, her touch is, her love is -- almost there.
Almost, not quite.

Recognition, a time of incredible joy.  When you feel the CLICK of the
two souls joining, however briefly, you suddenly know that you aren't
alone.  You know that the two of you belong together, forever, through
means that defy time, distance, and death itself.  She is not just another
person, another person in love, she is the other half of your soul.  Only
with her can you be everything you were meant to be.  All that you know,
she knows, in a strange, unanxious way.  Together, you can forget all the
trouble and hatred, and relax into what is your own singular heaven.
When the two finally touch, the power that ONLY they have comes to the
surface in a heat, a shock that can never fully be broken -- or forgotten.



I feel as though my life is being toyed-with, swatted from side-to-side
Sometimes, now, though.
by some incomprehensible force that gives it's reasons to no one.

In a phrase,
"GIVE ME A BREAK!"

If I am to be tormented, I MUST have a reason, or I am liable to lash
out at the source of that torment -- to bite the hand that feeds me.
I am not fond of this sound-proof booth!
My whole life has been a "Truth or Consequenses" that never ends because
of infinitely-long station breaks.
"Gee, I wonder what Johnny Olson has left in that box?!  Ok, but
first, this commercial message..."

Damn, I wonder what's on PBS...

Let's see. Sex, for us, was something of many dimensions.
Between us, it ranged from the passionate, beastial act of copulation,
all the way up to the most ecstatic confirmation of the blending of
two halves of a single soul.  Where is Heaven? Where-ever we both are.
And Hell, where and when we are separated.

As for now.
By all the signs, I would swear I was born at the wrong time.
Molded into a life both technologically advanced and yet based
on the most basic things in the universe -- Life, Death, and
above all, Love.

I don't care, too much, whether or not people believe what I
tell them about my past life.  It is almost as far removed to
them as this life is to me.  A wolf among sheep, I can't help
but recall the feelings so long destroyed by this life.  The
use of both highly developed skills, and animal instincts, joined
into one.  One force, accepted as natural by mind and body.

79:10:21:00:49
Even though we never had any secrets between us, our relationship
was never commonplace.  Even though our life was relatively simple,
our love kept it exciting.  Because we thought in different ways, the
complementary symmetry between us shows us both many sides to each
situation we encountered.

19:79:11:04:23:33:03

Life is the nightmare, heaven is the dream.

Well, once again I try to enter my feelings onto /dev/usr before
they slip away... I don't seem to be winning.

God, if people only let their insides out.  I could find my people
without having to make a fool out of myself. Shit.
I ought to spool this stuff off before it gets ripped in a head-crash.
Oh fuck, I'm not thinking.

What molds me, drives me, is driving me insane.  I KNOW that what I
know is real... but with no proof, I stand alone.  Wouldn't it be a
kick if what I dreamed would happen in the near future...
All the turmoil of humanities' losing the one thing they always fall
back on -- being the pinacle of creation.  If my kind appeared today,
the world would turn upside down.  Physical superiority they could stand,
but when they find out that we're four times smarter, they'd shit in their
proverbial pants!
When they stop thinking our bursts of sound are just animal grunts, and
realize that our minds link, like hands in the night.  I remember...

That when they did, when I lived, they tried to exterminate us.
So my mate and I had a job... lash out in the dark and silently kill
all of their kind that breaks our boundries.  The moments of lightning
speed, violent movent -- our minds following all leads, calculating
risk, speed, arc, trajectory, force, weight, distance, a thousand
factors a thousand times a second... Slow motion life around us.
They tought us that almost everything is a weapon, each thought is
deadly, each breath a tool.  They tought us all they knew, for their
lives depended on how well we survived -- and killed.

   I move up to the sentry, turned away, grab his face with one powerful
hand -- take his weapon, prsqueeze his neck till he falls, maybe not dead.
Move into camp, find their leader, take him out before he can think...
neck snapped, lungs collapsed, heart stopped.  Hang him from a tree to
scare the other back to where they came.  They'd been warned, now we
use the worst of our wares.  The next intrusion will mean that they'll
encounter the blackest of our magic -- MY magic.  Chances given, but not
taken -- for them to live, for us to live.

We killed about 200 of the enemy in the first few weeks, our last weeks,
the nightmare was worse for them than it was for our friend.  Our friend
that died by their hands, mutilated, tortured, torn-open like a stinking
test-animal!  He died in pain, but before tey could torture him.  He
simply shut-down and spoiled their fun.  They had their fun, and they paid.
Seizures, fits, brain hemmorages, strokes, heart attacks, suicide, lungs
frozen in agony, nerves burned from the inside out.  Others have the power
to heal, calm, bring back to life -- but my powers could only destroy, and
when I unleashed my sorcery on the enemy, they encountered horror beyond
their immaginations bounds.

Time changes things, or so they say.
I've always tried to believe, long, along the way.
But only now have I seen the lines,
ripples of force, 
that break and make my life.
By night and day.

Old skills recalled, from when I was.
I used to be so damn good.
Slow, but there, always on the mark.
On the side of light,
my home, the night,
drawn in around me... as Earth dons her hood.

From my life,
have been, being, will be.

Wiped out - face down in the dirt.
Here from force, not free will.
Willing to be loved, be hurt.
Longing for where I belong...

She once was...

She, scorned, strewn upon the dark sands,
to sift for her life among the grains.
Fooled, beaten down, never taken, always forsaken.
Once, a filly, infatuated with one from another caste.
Used her short money for things she'd bought,
for him to take and discard... and never come near.
An unrequited love, her first and last.

Cool and aloof, a stranger to all but the thieves and
traders, her friends.  A loose learning aquired from
forced experience and time's troubles.
A profit from trash to the rewards of valor.
All hers but the love she needed so much.
An unrequited love, her first and last.

Pushing on and on, and away from her home.
A home in name only, empty and shallow in its
simple security... hierarchy of stupid rules.
Searching, for profit of thousands of unknown
places.  For places of speed and danger.
Searching for something better.  Better than
an unrequited love, first and last.

Last.  When she found her love, she found herself in
a position of helplessness, of doubt.
She found herself with another outcast, from nothing
but fate, and a love to relieve the memories of hate.
She found herself in a place that wasn't hers,
but was none the less, her home.
She found herself.  In a love she'd always love.
Her love, with me...
Always requited, first and last.

Or something like that.


"and when all others had lost at the game of survival, only
two survived.  But one will rein over all, until there is
only one to rein over none."

I don't really see why I should believe in the trash
that you cling to.  Being of a time older and less
transient, I look in detached wonder at your race's
incredible stupidity and laugh at it's folly.
I have large faults, but they will never kill my will
or innate instincts to survive.   When we were here
so long ago, some of us fell, both in with, and into the
corroding corruption of your people. 

That was their mistake.  I have less sorrow thinking of
their deaths than of the stuggle we have taken on in order
to survive.  As one of your people once said, "Give them
a tyrant and they'll follow 'em anywhere".
As insane as it all seems, your kind seem bent on self-
destruction.

Someday you will learn from the past, the presnt, and,  if
you live long enough, you may make it to your future.

Poetry sucks, most of the time.

CLICK!!  Swapping out to present environment.
If I seem moody and/or confused, there is a minor difficulty
involved therein.  I can analize my own feelings more than any other
--- a holdover from PAST. After all, without it, I couldn't have served
my purpose.  Being in immense control, I had little else to worry about
aside of the weaknesses that were within me.  For, when I failed, it was
due to contaminants of conciousness.  Anyway, the times that remind me
(heavily) of my mate cause a terrible tearing in my mind and body.  In
response, my mind looks to the periods when we were apart but still near.
Those times are such as the times stalking, swooping, atactacking, and
defending my territory.  Throughout, was the feeling of extreme speed,
adrenalin high and hyperconsentration.  A period where the senses are
sending in nothing less than a high-pressure white noise.  Electric
in nature, the sensation fills my mind and covers out remembered feelings
of the times with her.
In me, the predator and loving mate co-exist, but never really at the
same time.  Not a schissoid situation but an environmental alteration.
It both holds my mind together and warps it's central idealism dif-
ferrential operations, making a slowly decaying stability situation
even worse.  I once almost wished-away my sorcerer's powers. What I
should have done was to wish-away the memories of the past.  The
memories of intense skill, phisical and mental agility, and, most
importantly, the beautifully posessive, savage, and all-undieing
love that we shared.  It once made me what I am, now it makes me
wish for something I am no-longer.

ADD so much later...  79:09:06:19:39:54
What is there left to say?

I've found many things as I stumble along, but of the things
I've found, there is so much that I have lost.  For just as
the warior awakens from amnesia, to remember the ones that didn't
survive, I have gained the loss that remembering brings.

There .are. things that touch that awful wound inside.  Those things
that many people deem so common, so natural, tear me apart at their
touch.  Pain, building to anger, building to hatred, building to an
immobilizing numbness in my brain.  The incredible violent forces
that build until broken -- beaten into scrambled images, by sensory
overload, are just the things that may push me too far some day.

(if this is ever found by anyone, at any time, I do't leave any
messages -- for if looked at by any 'competant ()' psychologist,
I'm sure his wonderful freaudian training will leave he/she with
a bag full of Phallic Symbols and a box of stale bagels... Meaning,
that "Symbolism is fine except when you can't see the forest (symb)
for the trees (symb)".))

Oops, sorry for the tangent.

There are times (like this) that I feel there is more promise in the future
in being a laboratory test animal than what I am facing now.
Not true, I admit, but when you lose all ability to hope, there
is little else to do.  ("They gamboled/with my life/and now I've lost
the will to fight/--Oh god these wires are SO tight..." Marionette)
I think I feel the lives of all the streetfighters, the slashing, bashing
violence that they feel.. the retaliations to the environment that they
can't win in.  Not by birth, but by the sheer odds.  The dice are always
rolling, but they are loaded (by the house) against you.  I have, once
again, lost that will to fight.  There is little I can now treat seriously.
Everything looks like a big joke, in poor taste.  Like a stinking racial
slur that is laughed at because it is so bad that it leaves no room for
thought, just mindless tension in all but the creature telling it.
I've been dropped here, in the middle, to observe and react.  So here
I am -- reacting.  I'd give it all if I could play for the stakes that
I so badly need to win.  At least I'd have one shot.
But now, I have not.

Add later even

I AM NOT AT ALL PLEASED WITH ANY OF THIS!
Thinking quick thoughts of the whole search for my people and esp
my mate... something thought about for many hours on end... I can now
only think -
A WHOLE GODDAMN LOT OF GOOD IT IS!!!!
As I said, I think I'm losing the will to fight.  If I stop fighting,
long enough, I'll die.  Maybe not physically, but my soul will surely
shivel with each day I die.
I'm losing the will, and I can't see far enough to try to find her.
IF she is still alive (fucking slim chance, I know).  There is little
for me to do but piddle-away the days and hope to be taken out of the
game (forfeit, paun to paun, for knights to clash.)
If can not actively pursue my dreams, I will not fall so low as to actively
pursue my end, at least I shall try not to.   The subconsious can
manifest it's hostilities in strange ways.  I may die in some foriegn
and desolate country simply because of a need to vent my rage in the
only way I was programmed for.
Or I may just rot away right here, where I sit.
But I doubt that -- believe it or not, I have a high survival rating.
One of the highest.  But that was tested at the right time, not in a
slump like this.
Doesn't it really suck?

The area we (my mate and I) lived in was a rolling, forested area that
never seemed to get any hotter than 20 degrees (centagrade).  The building
we worked out of was three stories high (high enough to extend above the
treetops) and went some six stories below ground.  The side facing east
(relative) was the side that we had to patrol.  We almost never did any
active patrolling until the situation got bad near the end.  Most of our
lives were spent in peace, but always wary of intruders.  Sorcery was a
useful and very common tool that we all used.  She and I were very good
with magic; combined with our mutual cunning, we were a very dangerous
pair that couldn't be separated.  We were socially isolated from the other
children when we were about five years (?) old.  As we grew older, we began to
realize why we were being treated differently than the rest.

.ti 5
Every once in
a great while, a child is born with very cunning tendencies and an innate
skill with sorcery.  All have the ability to use sorcery, but only a few master
it and even fewer are endowed with killing instincts.  When a child is found
with all of these parameters, the higher-ups wait for his or her mate to be born.
The other child is usually born and discovered within about a year (?) of the first.
During that time, the child is exposed to the other chosen ones thoughout his daily ramblings.
A chance meeting is usually arranged and, if they are mated, they are paired for
life -- and beyond.  Both are held together by a biological and phychological
link that can't be broken.
Together, the pair is almost unbeatable.  Apart, they can be pretty sorry.

.ti 5
When a disagreement hurts the pride of one of the pair, they may break up
for a short time, but never for more than a couple of weeks (for the worst
of battles!).  We once broke up for about two-and-a-half weeks and when
we got back together again, it was undoubtedly the best time we'd ever had.
We never broke up again.

.ti 5
My mate was, by far, much smarter than I.  This didn't bother me much
because I had my own, somewhat less definable, specialties.  Where she
could come up, quickly, with absolutely accurate answers to some of the most complex of problems,
I had a highly acute set of senses and a very powerful gift with sorcery.
Where she had extreme endurance, I had short, sharp intensity.
In sync, we were a pair in complementary symmetry.

Tools of our trade..

In our loose society, magic (sorcery, not slight-of-hand) was a science
that was passed on to, and refined by, every new generation.
The impression I got was that, even now, the different sorcerers
(or craftsmen, as the case may be) didn't like the idea of giving
the guardians the added power of witchcraft.  I took to it so well
that they were thinking of stopping my training before I got 'too good'.
I just told them that that would only temporarily slow me down,
and that without help, I might do something dumb by mistake (which really
is a good reason -- as I found out.)
Sorcery was never used as a crutch -- the same goes for 'technology'.  We
could easily get along without both.  The only thing I could see that would
be a real pain is the two extremes of winter and summer.  The one week
that is very hot, I usually stay underground and leave topside to my mate.
The reverse is true during the deepest part of winter.

.ti 5
However, there was a part of sorcery that I was not thrilled with using,
that was the complex art of symbolic spells.  These were terribly powerful
and dangerous symbols that act in a certain way with the brain (Nowadays, simplistic
symbols are used to achieve different states within the brain -- to help
in 'casting' spells or whatever... far removed, but the same principle).
A branch of symbol which we used in protecting our territory
was a device called a parasitic symbol.  It becomes indullibly imprinted
on the brain and can be used to FORCE reactions on others.  We used them
to cause nervous breakdowns, respiratory and cardiac arrests and whatever
else seemed good at the time.  The only means to stop the effects of the
worst (and most complex) symbols was to replace it with a symbol that
is, in most respects, a copy of the 'bad' one.  Usually, the mind will
replace the bad symbol with the neutral one.  Since the neutral symbol
does nothing, it is soon put aside (by the brain) and forgotten.  Keep
in mind that these symbols are so complex that they appear as a jumbled
set of meaningless patterns etched in a surface.  Only the artisans of
these devices were familiar enough with these 
patterns to read them and understand their effects and antidotes.
I wasn't blessed with the memory for such a skill.
It also scared me to use them, because of their power.  I preferred
straight-forward action/reaction magic.  (Now, I'm even scared of using that!)
Luckily, the forms of sorcerey that I knew was powerful
enough to protect the immediate land and sky around us.  That is, until
too many of the enemy started invading -- then it didn't do much good.

From mcs Sun Jun  8 16:20:49 1980

	Well, "cu" is finally running on the IMSAI.  I spent a whole day
figuring out that I had the number of stop bits set wrong on the TUART.
Oh well, we live an
ous devious methods.
This has taken various forms,  from  altering  the  password
file,  to  changing system commands, to having password free
versions of 'su' lying about.  It's not really that hard  to
do  these  things,  especially since the easiest way is just
rebooting the system.

          However, today someone put up a version  of  login
which  effectivly  removed  all  password  checking  for all
users.  I don't know if this was  intentional  or  not,  but
that was the effect.  If intentional, I regard this as mali-
cious, if not, irresponsible.  I was informed of this  by  a
user that was not too happy about it. When people come to me
in this state it makes me unhappy, as it appears as if I  am
not doing my job and I don't like to look like that.  Hence,
I was inspired to write this letter. I feel  I  have  wasted
enough time playing this sort of game and have decided to do
something about it.

          Finding open access  without  passwords  to  users
logins  and  the super-user login does not make me happy,  I
doubt it would make some department heads very happy either,
knowing  that  anyone could login to their accounts, and I'd
rather the person who caused the problem to take the  blame,
than  myself.  Therefore,  I would not like to find any more
unauthorized set-uid programs owned by root lying about.   I
would  not  like  to  find any false entries in the password
file.  I would not like to find that any system set-uid pro-
grams  have  been tampered with, ala login, or any "mv xyzzy
plugh" type changes. If I find this sort of  thing,  I  will
start  to  make  noises,  loud  noises  if  necessary, to my
department head, about the party concerned.  I  am  removing
any  instances  of  this  sort of thing Tuesday morning, any
occurences thereafter will force me (I really don't like  to
do  this  sort of thing) to talk with Dave Bergland, who I'm
sure will talk to the appropriate people.  If  some  of  you
feel  you are innocent of the acts described above, I apolo-
gize for including your name  in  the  mailing  list  in  an
effort to get this note to all parties concerned.

          The policy for having the super-user id is one  of
need,  if  you  present  a legitimate reason for needing it,
you'll get it. If some of you find it awkward to do  certain
things under the current policy, I would like to discuss the
situation and see what can be done to alleviate any problems
you are having and perhaps, if necessary, to change the pol-
icy.

In the New Jersey area, 900-555-1212 announces itself as "dial-it
information" and points you to two other 900 numbers.  One of
these talks about CCIS, the Atlanta node (which is having troubles)
and other telephone nonsense.  The other answers with a recipe
for Zuccini Bread.

Does anybody know what this is?  Does it work from anyplace else
in the country?

BEN@MIT-ML 07/23/80 09:21:50 Re: Area code 900 - Dial-it
To: HPK at MIT-MC
In Boston, Dial-It Information thanks me for calling,
assures me that there is no charge for this call,
and states that currently there are no Dial-It numbers.
I would expect an advertising campaign to commercial
users within six months, then to the public within a
year to get people to use the service, whatever it is.

^_

LAUREN@MIT-MC 07/23/80 06:32:10
The 900 numbers are being tested on and off throughout the toll
net.  They are being turned on and off at the 4A machines in each
NPA.  They first began working here in L.A. some months ago, and the
number of nodes is increasing rapidly throughout the country.

DIALIT is the name for a service TPC will provide to allow for mass
callin, free (like INWATS) service.  But it will have mass calling
protections like some high volume prefixes (like 520 in L.A.)
possess.  DIALIT will also provide a means for a firm to arrange for
a single national phone number that will be automatically routed to
the the element of the firm that is closest to the caller's location.

You probably heard mention of ONAC.  It is the Operations Network
Administration Center (or some such), the toll control network
subnet administering the system, including those CCIS routes now
active.

A couple of months ago, three numbers worked from L.A.  These would
not always work, sometimes I would be intercepted before even
leaving 213.  Sometimes an immediate additional try would get through.
Operators cannot handle them at ALL!


900-555-1212 yielded an announcement telling of two other
numbers.  One of the two was an ONAC implementation status report,
the other was David Brenner telling jokes (this one was called
"chuckle-it" (from "dial-it", get it?)  Some days later, there was
only a recording coming from 213 telling me that no DIALIT service
numbers were active, and not to call my operator, because she could
not handle the call.

The whole thing is very sporadic.  You might note that it is not
clear how these calls are being ticketed.  I suspect that trouble
cards may be dropping, which could attract attention in your
direction.

Hope this helps a bit.

555-1212 is the standard Info number for Ma Bell.  I am in 714
area, but if I wanted info on, say, someone's phone number
whose name I knew, and knew he lives somewhere in 213 area,
I could dial 1-213-555-1212 and tell them city and name and
such.  Is 900 a standard area code?  If so, then you are just
getting normal Info stuff, tho perhaps a bit altered by
ho-ho men.  Whatever...

I called the number from the 415 area in Palo Alto, and got a recorded message
saying they were unable to complete my call, and referring me to 900-555-1212
for more information (!).  The message mentioned "Dial-it".  The code number

I tried and got a recorded message telling me to call the same number!

Subject: running a BIG cbios under CP/M 1.4
To: INFO-MICRO at AI

Some time ago, I asked this forum for ideas regarding ways to run
a large CBIOS under CP/M.  Large is defined to be more data than
will normally fit on the first two tracks of a floppy, the area reserved
for the system in CP/M.  Here are the responses...

Have you tried putting some of the CBIOS into EPROM somewhere in
high memory. This may limit the size of the CP/M system, but
you will not have to load the stuff from disk. I'm using this solution
to hold lots of routines I use on my CBIOS in my N*, Also
this will allow use of leor's new C complier with the Romable
code.

In response to your message of  7 Jul 1980 1635-EDT

Mine is usually 48K. I am in the process of shuffling things to use more,
but my bootstraps and other crud are cluttering up C000-FFFF rather badly.
I need at least some PROM, 'cause I don't have a front panel.
Hmmm. I suppose the Prom card could be modified to turn itself off
and get out of the way after it does its thing....

Date:  8 JUL 1980 0335-EDT
From: BYTE at MIT-AI (Roger L. Long)
Subject: CP/M CBIOS
To: LAUREN at MIT-AI

I, too, have had the problem of trying to fit an increasingly large CBIOS
within the 2 track limit.  The problem is aggrivated in CP/M V2 by the fact
that the BDOS and CCP get larger, giving you even *LESS* room for a CBIOS.
With CP/M V2, I have found that the last sector of the BDOS is actually just
a sector of zeros, and that I can use that for the CBIOS if I have the
bootstrap routine move the CBIOS up 128 bytes.  But you still have about
128 bytes less than you have in CP/M V1.4!  

The answer that I found was to re-format the disk such that the first
two tracks have sixteen 256 byte sectors.  This yields about 21% more space,
and should be able to hold your CBIOS for awhile.  You also get a bigger
bootstrap program (track 00-sector 1), which the hardware bootstrap on
my TARBELL disk controller reads quite well (it makes no reference to
reading in 128 bytes...  it just reads until it gets an INTRQ status).
I have modified my bootstrap program to automatically determine how much
contiguous RAM is available and move the CBIOS up accordingly.		
-----

One other response suggested putting an INIT.COM type file on the floppy
that would be automatically started upon a boot.  This program would then
move the "extra" part of CBIOS up into high memory.  (I tried this
technique some time ago and had unsatisfactory results for a variety
of reasons peculiar to my particular application)...

Hope these messages are of some interest to other CP/M hackers out there...

;* *** MAIN ***
;*
;* THIS	IS THE MAIN LOOP THAT COLLECTS THE TINY	BASIC PROGRAM
;* AND STORES IT IN THE	MEMORY.
;*
;* AT START, IT	PRINTS OUT "(CR)OK(CR)", AND INITIALIZES THE
;* STACK AND SOME OTHER	INTERNAL VARIABLES.  THEN IT PROMPTS
;* ">" AND READS A LINE.  IFF THE LINE STARTS WITH A NON-ZERO
;* NUMBER, THIS	NUMBER IS THE LINE NUMBER.  THE	LINE NUMBER
;* (IN 16 BIT BINARY) AND THE REST OF THE LINE (INCLUDING CR)
;* IS STORED IN	THE MEMORY.  IFF A LINE	WITH THE SAME LINE
;* NUMBER IS ALREDY THERE, IT IS REPLACED BY THE NEW ONE.  IF
;* THE REST OF THE LINE	CONSISTS OF A 0DHONLY, IT IS NOT STORED
;* AND ANY EXISTING LINE WITH THE SAME LINE NUMBER IS DELETED.
;*
;* AFTER A LINE	ISs INSERTED, REPLACED,	OR DELETED, THE	PROGRAM
;* LOOPS BACK AND ASK FOR ANOTHER LINE.	 THIS LOOP WILL	BE
;* TERMINATED WHEN IT READS A LINE WITH	ZERO OR	NO LINE
;* NUMBER; AND CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO	"DIRCT".
;*
;* TINY	BASIC PROGRAM SAVE AREA	STARTS AT THE MEMORY LOCATION
;* LABELED "TXTBGN" AND	ENDED AT "TXTEND".  WE ALWAYS FILL THIS
;* AREA	STARTING AT "TXTBGN", THE UNFILLED PORTION IS POINTED
;* BY THE CONTENT OF A MEMORY LOCATION LABELED "TXTUNF".
;*
;* THE MEMORY LOCATION "CURRNT"	POINTS TO THE LINE NUMBER
;* THAT	IS CURRENTLY BEING INTERPRETED.	 WHILE WE ARE IN
;* THIS	LOOP OR	WHILE WE ARE INTERPRETING A DIRECT COMMAND
;* (SEE	NEXT SECTION), "CURRNT"	SHOULD POINT TO	A 0.

c  a 140x140 image, consisting of numbers 0-3, is packed 7 to a word
c  as powers of 4 (20 words wide) and addressed as a 1-d array.
c  an additional array /sngls/  holds up to 4 lines of unpacked numbers
c  used by locop, where 3 unpacked lines are used to compute the new
c  line into the 4th, and by show, which unpacks one line and composes

c  percentages not 100, in change, locop and combin, treated as follows.
c  each routine takes numbers 0-198 directly from random table /rand/
c  and compares with iprob = (percent*2-percent/51). if latter is .gt.
c  table value, treat this cell.  the sequence taken from table is

I have an extensive background in the design, production, and
debugging of 8080, 8085, LSI-11, Z80, and Z8000 based micro-computer systems (5 years total).
This includes applications as stand-alone, slave, and high speed
multi-processing units for use in digitized voice handling,
data routing and display.
I also have experience with the design and modification
of analog circuits as in
high-fidelity, RF, and telecommunications systems (6 years).
I generally design circuits to be fabricated on both printed
circuit or wire wrap boards.
Presently working on a Z8000 processor card to run on
a DEC 11/23 (LSI-11) mainframe.

<Software>:
.ti 5
My software experience includes work in the BASIC, FORTRAN,
APL, and "C" programming languages (6 years).  I am adept at the
UNIX operating system run on the PDP-11/45 and PDP-11/70.
Other systems I have had experience with are the HP-2000
series, IBM-370, XDS-940 (TYMSHARE), and PDP-10 (TYMSHARE).

<Photographic>:

I have to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of people who
would be using it.  In the area below, please put down your estimated
useage, (ie: times/week, per month, per year, per decade, whatever...) and
send it back to me (see above).

The XXX-sys multi-processor
.sp 8
.ti 5
Even though this machine is still in a variable state as far as the
strict bus constraints are concerned, this document is an overview of
the architecture involved.

.ti 5
The main processor is a Z-8001 (Zilog) and associated memory management
circuits.  Also included on the Mother-sys board is a group of multiplexed
'control ports'. These control ports have total control over all slave
processors.  The control ports can start/stop, hold, reset, interrupt, and
power up/down each slave processor.  They are also used for reading the status
of the slave processor being addressed.
EPROM is also supplied for reset/trap/boot memory as well as a limited amount
of RAM on the Mother-sys card.

How about this--
The next time there is a disk shortage, we pick through
the passwd file and post notice on the accounts that were
created for summer students and people that have left.
(some are over a year old...)
I can do the dirty work of finding them and tracking down
who would want the files if anyone.  I'd probably send mail to
the 'supervisors' or people that inheritted the projects.
Just asking.

Gary,
	You might be interested that I have a program that
automatically does dump restors.  It is called
"autorest" and is in /usr/rba/tape.  It is run with
"autorest /full/path".  It seems to work well
as long as the path you specified exists, but it
doesn't cope with erros very well yet.

is twice as fast as the 11/2's.

Subj: Re: Auto Speed on 189

	The modems on 189 are all 300 baud modems, 
what would you have them auto speed to?   Soon, they
will be replaced by 212a's which will run at 300 or 1200
and there will be one number for all dialin's.

				Bill

Well, up until the last change in the system, the dn and
the init programs were set to do the following --
init- runs
If it says login, it says it at 300baud.
If it gets a break, it goes to 150 baud.
If it doesn't get a valid character or a break, it
goes to 110 baud...
This is how all decent machines are set up -- either that
or there is one universal character that it looks for and
switches to that speed.

It used to be standard on all UNIX systems.


So, why don't we have it here?? and where are the driver/init
sources for them???

ry sensitive explosive, especially when dry, but it has been known to
explode even when wet.  It is detonated by heat or mechanical contact or by
looking at it too hard, or all by itself sometimes.  I suggest your first
batch be not more than a few hundred milligrams.

I have this old dictionary with all sorts of gnomish words.

1) gnome: One of a fabled race of diminutive beings supposed to
          inhabit the inner parts of the earth, and to be the
	  guardians of the mines, quaries, etc.  The name gnome
	  was given by Paracelsus to beings having earth as their
	  element, so that they can move through it as freely as
	  fish through water.  In later use, the conception has
	  been influenced by popular about dwarfs, elves and fairies,
	  probably in particular bu Teutonic belief in "dark elves".

2) gnomed: Inhabited by gnomes (Rare).

3) gnome owl: some weird owl.

4) gnomic: Uttering of or containing maxims or striking detached
	   thoughts; aphoristic; also, pertaining to the gnomist
	   poets
	     b) Gram. Expressive of what is true at any given time,
		said of certain tense uses; as the gnomic present
		(day follows night); the gnomic aorist.

5) gnomic: A gnomic poet. (rare)

6) gnomish: resembling a gnome.

7) gnomist: a write of gnomic poetry.

8) gnomic poets: Greek poets, as Phocylides of Miletus, Theognis
 		 of Megara and Solomon the lawgiver of the 6th and
		 7th centuries B.C., whose writings are of a gnomic
		 character.

9) gnomide: A female gnome (rare).

10) gnomologic: Pertaining to, or the nature of gnomes or precepts.

11) gnomologist: A gnomist. (rare)

12) gnomology: Gnomic discourse or writing; also, a collection of,
		or a treatise on, gnomes.


13) gnomon: b) The nose. Obs. Humorous.
	    c) A rule or canon, as of faith.

.ti 5
I have an extensive background in the design, production, and
debugging of 8080, 8085, LSI-11, Z80, and Z8000 based micro-computer systems (5 years total).
This includes applications as stand-alone, slave, and high speed
multi-processing units for use in digitized voice handling,
data routing and display.
I also have experience with the design and modification
of analog circuits as in
high-fidelity, RF, and telecommunications systems (6 years).
I generally design circuits to be fabricated on both printed
circuit or wire wrap boards.
Presently working on a Z8000 processor card to run on
a DEC 11/23 (LSI-11) mainframe.

<Software>:
.ti 5
My software experience includes work in the BASIC, FORTRAN,
APL, and "C" programming languages (6 years).  I am adept at the
UNIX operating system run on the PDP-11/45 and PDP-11/70.
Other systems I have had experience with are the HP-2000
series, IBM-370, XDS-940 (TYMSHARE), and PDP-10 (TYMSHARE).

<Photographic>:
.ti 5
