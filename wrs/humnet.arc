It seems that some people go through life just parsing the input and
never bothering to generate code based on that input; they're just
filters who trigger on key signals.  (Then again, maybe that's what we
all are, maybe I'm just commenting on the simplicity of some filters.)

Hank,
        A somewhat suprising result. I rather expected them to find no
connection with radiation-induced hazards even if there are any, so
that's no big suprise. [The problem with threshold mutation comes up
in all experiments I have seen -- it may be there, but you can't
separate it from background]

        I did expect to hear of significent problems in the areas of
eyestrain, headaches &c. and am therefore somewhat suspicious of their
results.  Not that they are necessarly "real" but that enough people
would perceive them as to make them show up in the statistics.  Could
you provide a pointer for me?

Subject: Sound -- A VDT Annoyance, if not a Hazard
From: nomdenet at RAND-UNIX

   Does anyone know whether the FTC report on terminals' health
hazards dis- cusses their audible noise?  Though not necessarily a
hazard, noise is often a great nuisance.  A 33-year-old male, my
hearing extends beyond 18 kHz., which is a curse around most terminals
and television sets because of the noise generated by components
(flyback transformers, or the transformers in some switching power
supplies) vibrating at the horizontal-retrace rate.  For standard TV
sets this is 15,734 or 15,750 Hz.; terminals I've worked with have had
horizontal-retrace rates up to 17,200 Hz.

   About one year ago Rand began buying an updated version of our
standard terminal.  These new terminals' horizontal-retrace rate was
15,600 Hz.  The first lot had linear power supplies; succeeding lots
had power supplies switching at the same 15,600-Hz. frequency -- a
World-War II fighter pilot turned EE, of Scottish ancestry, must have
designed this power supply.  Slated to get a new terminal, I had to
select from the first lot one that I could tolerate.  It's annoyingly
loud, but bearable.  Walking down hallways, I can tell at a distance
(30-40 feet) when I'm approaching one of the new terminals.  It's
rather unconfortable for me to be near groups of them shrieking in
unison.

   Once I had complained, a few other people here voiced similar
complaints.  We're few in number: About four out of a staff of 500-600
(of about 1100 employees total) who work with these terminals.  Rand
told the manufacturer, whose intial response was "Gee, we put several
terminals into one room, listen to them, and weed out the noisy ones."
But soon they admitted to us that some of their own staff, mostly
secretaries, mostly women [their words] had been bothered as well, but
hadn't complained.

   Twice the manufacturer has shipped us single terminals which have
been modified to be less noisy, and each time fewer here have been
able to hear them.  In February we received a new model, which I was
still able to hear singing along at 18,600 Hz.  I don't expect further
efforts from the manufacturer; probably only 5-10 people out of 1000
can hear above that frequency.

   Ideally manufacturers would design terminals to operate above, say,
21,000 Hz.; then they would bother only dogs & bats.

Subject: Help the Eyes

  Don, the following mail was sent to me to forward to the Human Nets
Digest.

The following is a translation of "Help the Eyes", a brochure
published by the Swedish Industrial Safety Board in 1968.

        Help the Eye

Information on the Swedish Industrial Safety Board's rules for work
with display terminals.

    Minor Eye Problems Make Themselves Known When One Works
    at a Display Terminal.

You cannot damage your eyes by working at a display terminal.  But,
for many, it is very trying and and difficult -- especially for people
with eye problems and eyeglasses that are not suitable for the work.
Minor problems that otherwise cause no difficulty can make themselves
known when you start to work at a display terminal.

The Industrial Safety Board has published rules called "Reading
Display Terminals" (number 136).  These deal with the way in which
work with, for example, computer terminals and microfilm readers shall
be arrainged in order to minimize eyestrain.

Lighting shall generally be dimmer than in an ordinary office.
Additional lighting shall be provided for work areas around the
terminal.  The worker must be able to adjust the additional light
where he or she wants it and it shall be glarefree.

AVOID REFLECTIONS

The background should be quite dark.  The person who sits at a video
terminal shall not have a window or other strong light source in his
or her field of vision.  Light reflections in the terminal screen
shall be avoided.

The display screen should be adjustable so that each and every person
can maintain the right visual distance and angle of the screen.  This
is important not only for the eye but also for seating comfort.  If
forced to sit poorly, the worker will become tired and can get a back
or neckache.

Adjustment of the terminal screen is especially important for older
persons who wear eyeglasses to correct their vision.  Reading glasses
are ground to give a sharp picture at normal reading distances, but
the distance to the display screen is often greater.

Ordinary bifocals (eyeglasses with two corrections) are often
unsatisfactory.  The reading correction is positioned so that you must
lean your head back to see the screen.  Furthermore, you must lean
forward to get the right distance and see the display sharply.

THE RULES

The Industrial Safety Board's rules say that persons using eyeglasses
primarily shall be able to move the display screen so that the visual
distance is satisfactory.  If the terminal operator cannot move the
screen so it is suitable for his or her ordinary glasses, the employer
must provide special work glasses.

Such glasses must be adjusted by an optician who carefully takes into
account the type of work being performed.  The optician must, for
example, know the distance from the eye to the display screen and to
the papers and notebooks the worker looks at beside the screen.

The rules say also that if someone who works at a display screen
begins to feel eye strain [tired in the eyes] or gets other eye
problems, pauses or other work must be arrainged to rest the eyes.

This brochure summarizes the Industrial Safety Board's Directive 136,
"Reading Display Terminals." The brochure does not replace the
directive.

The directive may be ordered [in Swedish] from Liber Publishers, S-162
89 VAELLINGBY, Sweden.  Telephone 08/89 01 20.  Additional copies of
this brochure (order number ADI 153) may be ordered free from
Arbetarskyddsstyrelsen, Publikationsservice, S-174 84 SOLNA.
Telephone 08/730 90 00.

[Picture text: the photograph shows an older woman working at a
microfilm terminal.  She is holding her bifocals up with one finger to
be able to view the screen.]

Ordinary eyeglasses are often completely unsuitable for work at a
display terminal.  This is especially true for older persons.  If the
display terminal cannot be adjusted so that ordinary glasses are
suitable, the employer must provide special work eyeglasses.  It is
important that work glasses are carefully adjusted by an optician.

[Sketchs on the last page restate the above.]

-----

The Swedish Industrial Safety Board did not find any radiation-caused
eye damage from use of video terminals.  They did find a considerable
amount of eye- and muscle-strain, and general stress among terminal
workers.  They have published a large amount of material for use by
office workers, management, and unions in improving work environments.
Unfortunately, it's all in Swedish.

Persons interested in privacy (banks microfilming checks, for example)
would do well to read Kerstin Aner's contribution to the IFIP report
"Human Choice and Computers, 2" North-Holland Publishing Co.  1980.
Dr.  Aner was one of the authors of the Swedish Data Law and she gives
a good overview of its social and political background.  (She is
currently Under-Secretary of State in Sweden.)

BC-XEROX
Xerox's Offers Simplified VDT for Corporate Professionals
BizDay
By ANDREW POLLACK
c. 1981 N.Y. Times News Service
    NEW YORK - The Xerox Corp. Monday introduced a product intended to
overcome a major obstacle in the path toward the automated office -
the reluctance of white-collar workers with no computer experience to
use electronic terminals.
    Using the 8010 Star Information System, a video display terminal,
Xerox says, engineers or financial analysts, for example, could easily
create and edit documents, as is done on a word-processor, create
graphs and charts, retrieve documents stored in electronic files and
send and receive electronic messages.
    Analysts said the product would help terminals penetrate the
corporate levels above secretaries who are trained to use word-
processors and would be a vital complement to other Xerox office
products. The new work station, they said, is ahead of the field in
providing many functions in one terminal and in being simple to use.
    ''That capability will be important to both office automation and
to Xerox,'' said Sanford J. Garrett of Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins.
''The whole trend in office automation for the next 10 years will be
to make products easier and easier to use.''
    Rather than having to type commands and code words, as is required
on existing terminals, the user can move a little pointer on the
screen to symbols representing various functions by sliding a
palm-sized device, called a ''mouse,'' along the top of the desk.
    To retrieve a particular file, for instance, the user moves the
pointer to a picture of a filing cabinet and presses one key. To print
a document the pointer is moved to a little picture of a printer.
    ''We're dealing with professionals, people who prefer pointing and
selecting to typing explicit commands,'' said David E. Liddle, vice
president of Xerox's Office Products division, at a New York news
conference. Managers and top-level executives would need yet simpler
terminals, Xerox officials said.
    Xerox has invested roughly $50 million in developing the work
station since 1972, Donald J. Massaro, president of the Office
Products division, said. It will be available starting in the fall for
a single unit price of $16,500 with volume discounts available..
    The Star work station would increase the productivity of such
professional workers as engineers and analysts, Xerox officials said,
by speeding their ability to gather information and to compile it into
reports and memos.
    ''We've already seen some things that indicate that the
professional wants help,'' Massaro said. He pointed to the growing use
of personal computers by engineers and analysts.
    For Xerox the Star work station also fills in a vital gap in its
product line. It is designed to be used with other products introduced
by Xerox over the last three years, including an electronic filing
system, a printer that can print out what appears on the work station
screen, a communications device linking various machines, and
Ethernet, a communications network to tie the office machinery
together.
    But what Xerox sees as strong points could hinder sales of the
Star work station, some analysts believe.
    Harvey L. Poppel, senior vice president of Booz Allen & Hamilton,
a consulting firm, said that productivity of professional and
managerial office workers was less well defined and more difficult to
measure than it was for typists or factory workers. Unless companies
can be convinced of the savings, he added, they will be reluctant to
spend the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars needed
to buy the terminals.
    In addition, the Star work station is really useful only when tied
in with the electronic file, the printer and the Ethernet network.
Few companies have made commitments so far to buy the whole package,
which might retard sales of the work station.

Subject:  3D displays

I have seen (a few years ago) marketing literature for a very
interesting 3D display. This used a half-circular shutter that
permitted one eye at a time to see a TV monitor. This was spun by a
motor 30 times/sec so that the eye seeing the screen was switched at
that rate. The monitor displayed one of two different images in sync
with the shutter, so that the driving computer had independant control
of the image each eye sees. The hardware required was only a second
frame buffer.

Another approach was used by (I believe) the Architecture school at
Georgia Tech. They used the heads-up viewer from a fighter plane.
This device is a miniture CRT with an eyepiece that overlayed the
image over what was seen through it, so the the image appears at
infinity over whatever the background is. Georgia mounted two of these
on a helmet and had them driven by computer. I am told they had this
combined with a remote head position sensor to provide feedback to
make a system that allowed you to take a walk through a model
building.

Subject: More on Holograms - and Telepresence

Since most holographic research is done assuming that film is required
(which is really the case, for the reasons that I gave in my last
message), I don't think that anyone has actually tried to see just
what the "minimum" resolution you need to get a "good" hologram.  You
could estimate this from the math (I'll see if this looks feasible
with my mathematical tools tonight), but I would expect that the only
real way to determining a minimum of "good"ness is to do experiments.

REM@MC suggested what he called 2.1 dimensions: no vertical parallax,
and horizontal only in ~1" strips.  This is, in essence, how the full-
circle bands of film (holographs) work.  They look like the object is
in the center of the band of film (it's quite a shock to look over the
thing, and see that there really isn't anything there).  The diff is
that each strip is a little hologram.  What I think REM's comment
(excuse the pun) implies, is that regular, 2-d pictures are used.  I'm
convinced that this won't work.  The best way of describing what you
see in a flat hologram, is to say that you have a "window" on the
image.  As you move, you can see around it, insofar as it is present
in the window.  This is clearly different from, say, a picture on the
wall.  If you have a lot of little strips of 2-D images, you'll get a
collage, but you won't approach 3-d (because, as you move around, each
of them will still "look" straight ahead).  If you have little
holograms, you'll get lot's of little, apparently contiguous windows.
And everone knows that that looks like a big window.

A hologram "window" can not be told from the real window (i.e., with
the real object on the other side) by ANY form of optical analysis
(withouking around the window, of course).  In this way, a
hologram is by nature a one-sense realization of Minsky's tele-
presence.  This is further enforced by the way in which holograms are
used in the USSR (where research for them is in advance of ours,
mostly because they have a finer grain film available).  Rather than
take valuable art treasures from the safety of Moscow museums, they
are holographed in their display cases (5 ft long reflective (look
down on them) holograms).  Many sets of holograms can be made this
way.  The holograms are easily shipped around the Soviet Union, to
small villages and towns, where they are set up in local halls for all
to see.  Since the lighting in the hall is controled (but not laser),
the viewing is rather good.  And seeing the hologram is COMPLETELY the
same (for displaycase items) as being there.

But they don't move, you say.  Mais oui, mon ami!  A russian H. expert
has recently unveiled holographic movies.  They apparently do work,
and are outside of our technology (film limitations, I think) - a
hologram gap!  How they work was explained to me, but I never really
understood it.

Subject: More data on Leavitt's first law.

Leavitt's first law of technology utilization:
   "Most people will learn no more about a new technology than is
    necessary to get the most commonly performed task accomplished."

I work in a lab containing people who are designing computer hardware
and software.  They are very "computer literate" though in differing
ways.  They are quite interested in technology development too.  Even
given this environment I have noticed the same lack of interest in
"utilities".  They are interested in service and generally don't want
to know anything more than "how to make it go".

I have an explanation of Leavitt's Law.  Everyone has command of
enormous quantity detailed information about their specialties.  If
you doubt this ask Lauren a question about video technology (or
telecommunication or satelite communication or..) or ask a grad
student about his thesis topic.  The maintenance of this information
in a comprehensive and up-to-date fashion is very time consuming.  To
adopt another specialty (in this case word processing/text editor
systems) is a major comitment.  One that most people won't make unless
they see a good reason to.

This law explains a good deal of what is commonly called laziness or
conservatism that you can see all around you.  Try applying this
explanation at you office, at home and at school.  It is applicability
is surprisingly general.

A couple more interesting corrolaries: Some very sucessful people I
know have developed a curious dual behavior.  They rapaciously devour
information from a huge variety of sources on any topic that relates
to their specialties.  At the same time they are unwilling to delve
into other topics to any depth at all.  In fact they seem to have
developed a kind of filter which prevents them from remembering
details outside their specialty.

Another "type" of person is extremely interesting to know.  They
always seem to be aquiring new specialties.  They will spend a week or
a month giving themselves a mini course in some new topic of interest.
Then they will, seemingly by osmosis, pick up all kinds of details
about this new specialty.  Needless, to say these people make
fasinating conversationalist.  They are the fabled walking
encyclopedists.  They can answer the most arcane questions about the
most unlikely subjects.

Final question: When can I expect a computer artifically intelligent
enough and with access to enough information that it can function in
the above role?

        Verbosely yours,

Minimal set of powerful commands for word-processor (what I randomly
came up with spontaneously):

(1) Hardware -- Computer, keyboard&CRT, mass-storage, automatic-modem,
phone.

(2) Structures -- Archive of messages and documents with multi-keyword
index, paged access method to allow editing large documents without
manually breaking them into small files before editing and patching
them back together after editing.

(3) Commands -- ISR in the archive (something at least half as
powerful as Lockheed's DIALOG) to fetch a set of messages etc. for
perusing or moving to the active buffer, editing the active buffer,
storing file back to archive as update of old file or as new file,
creating indexes of the files in the archive, queueing a message in
the active buffer to be FTP'd (electronically mailed) to another
system via some protocol that uses phone lines, automatic receipt of
incoming messages whenever the modem isn't busy with an outgoing
message (it should be possible for this to timeshare with editing and
other operations, anything that doesn't require the modem itself),
printing all or part of the active buffer on any available hardcopy
device (also accepting print-orders automatically from incoming
electronic mail).

Subject: What hath Technology wrought?

        I will soon be working at a place called SCI (or SysCon, take
your pick...) which is a system-consulting/micro-computer hacking
outfit... They will supposedly have me working on a word-processing
system. Apparently, they looked around, and saw nothing that they
liked (or that was cost-effective), , so they will make their own.
        It's gonna be done in two parts:

        1) Set up a bunch of stand-alone micros working as WP stations
           all by their lonesomes.
        2) Hook them into a network (with a central machine handling
           all I/O etc... I think...)

        Yeah, I suppose that there is a lot of fast-talking and not a
lot of good product, but what do you expect from capitalists?  At any
rate, I think that it will be much more fun making a WP system than
having some smooth-talker sell us one...

        -- Attila --

P.S. BTW, the old WP system was a WANG. All the stuff on it currently
     will have to be re-typed in cuz WANG has this bizarre, cryptic, 
     disgusting, in-comprehensible (and, I might add, un-decodable)
     encryption scheme that they use in all their software, thus the
     old files are useless... funny, no? Does anyone out there know
     a de-encryption scheme for WANG-made files? <sigh>...

The message commenting on "sexism" regarding my statement in the

is common among our friends. The original request message, asking for
worthwhile uses of a micro at home, was from someone (whose name I
forget) who was trying to specifically convince his wife of the value
of a micro. That comment at the tail of my message was directed
obviously at him. I never dreamed that Human-Nets readers would so
soon forget the origin of the discussion, and take the phrase out of
context! Do I have to reiterate the obvious in any continuing

  I'm sure others will pick up on some of the questions Bill asks but
one point - BAUD is a signalling rate, the speed at which the modem
samples the line.  The sample it gets may be 1, 2, or 4 bits.  So a
9600 bit per second (BPS) modem runs at 2400 BAUD, and at each BAUD
time gets 4 bits for a bit rate of 9600.  BAUD and BPS are usually
only the same at low speeds, for instance 300 BPS 103-like modems do
run at 300 BAUD.  9600 BPS modems do not run at 9600 BAUD.

  Also, Codex and another manufacturer (don't remember who it is) are
producing a 14.4 KBPS modem for use over voice grade telephone lines.
Don't know exactly how they do it tho.

Reply to WMACGREGOR at BBND

There are three problems here:

First, there are modems that run at >2400 baud over dial up lines.
there are some on the market that work at 4800. I can supply the
manufacturers if you wish.

Second, Yes, Virginia, there is that much difference in quality
between leased and dial-up lines. Remember that the dial network may
do things like route a New York to Philadelphia call via St.Louis.
Thus, the quality of a connection is very undependable, unlike the
"guaranteed" quality of a leased line. Manufacturers of dial-up modems
tend to design for the worst case so that you have a high probability
of dialing up a lousy connection and still being able to use it.

Third, signal to noise ratio is not a complete description of what a
telephone line can do to a signal. For instance, on some circuits not
all frequencies have the same propagation velocity and thus not the
same transit time. This can really foul up a modem. The theoretical
limit would be a lot lower than 30kB if you factored all of this in.

In trying this out on my phone, I soon found myself talking to my
mother.  The 11<n> sequence seems to trigger the speed-dial ESS
feature, which is useful to know if you occasionally use a dial phone
- no more waiting for the exchange to figure out that you only dialed
one number, and thus want to speed-dial.

Gee whiz.  I didn't mean that the number readback systems were telling
untruths on purpose!  I just used "lied" as a slangy sort of term to
indicate errors!  Indeed, step by step number ID systems in particular
are extremely frail.

One interesting example of the impact of network communication, even
today on THIS net, comes immediately to mind.  When I asked members of
this list to contact Federal Screw Works and complain about the
pricing policy on their voice synthesizer chips, they were immediately
DELUGED with calls from all over the country.  It appears very likely
that this event precipitated their change of mind on this issue.

I submit that we do indeed have a "mass-media-like" entity here, but
one which is much more "specialized" than most of the others we are
familiar with.

This is the first time I have heard anyone suggest that the lingo we
use in this environment may have been partially borrowed from the
homosexual community.  One would suppose that this is either
coincidental, or, well, one can only speculate.  I'd be curious as to
what other examples of this exist (as well as crossovers to other
subcultures) -- my personal mental dictionary of "gay" terminology is
formed totally from seeing a few Eyewitness News reports over the
years ... which probably are not terribly representative...

Subject:   Computers and Language

There are several instances where computer science (or at least data
processing) has left an impact on ordinary language.  To name just a
few off the top of my head:

  In the '60's, the Swedish word for computer was "datamaskin".
  This was felt to be clumsy and a language professor invented
  "dator" (data motor).  [In Swedish, "dator" rhymes with "potter".]
  Linguistically, this is an interesting word as it uses plural and
  definite forms that not been productive since the 1700's.

  In English, one might mention the general use of "software"
  (and I have heard both "liveware" and "courseware") and I am
  sure you could find a number of other terms in general use.
  (Swedish computer people do refer to "haardvara" (hardware)
  and "mjukvara", although what we would call a "hardware store"
  they would call a "jarnhandel" (ironmonger).

----

Can't resist adding my two favorite computer errors, both from Sweden:

In the '60's, the personal ID number was extended to add a check
digit.  Thus, 401106-963 became 401106-9632.  When the State Pension
Board went on-line, the personnel would enter an ID number and the
computer would occasionally reply "checksum error".  The terminal
operators were careful, consciencious workers and would take out paper
and pencil and recompute the checksum to enter it correctly.  Moral:
check your error messages carefully.

Simple data input errors may have far reaching results.  A year or two
ago, a resident of Botkyrka (a suburb of Stockholm) received an
estimated tax bill based on an income of some 20 Million Kronor.  It
turned out that a digit dropped and the last digit of his ID number
became the leftmost digit of his estimated income.  He took it to the
authorities who laughed and told him not to worry.  He didn't.  But...
towns in Sweden have local taxing authority and set the tax rate on
the basis of the preliminary tax bills.  Suddenly, Botkyrka, one of
the poorest towns in Sweden had a large (estimated) surplus, causing
the tax rate to be set several percent too low.  Turned out that the
state had to pick up the tab.

I think it may partly be a function of historical perspective.  Look

Subject: Information and World Events

It may be debatable that written words have altered the course of
humankind (not by me but, perhaps, by others), but it is indisputable
that information has controlled the ebb and flow of the human tide
just as surely as have the forces of the environment.  However, I
believe some examples of some written work that I believe has provided
powerful impetus for grand human action are appropriate: (1)
Federalist Papers and (2) Uncle Tom's Cabin.  I am sure that there are
others but I am not a historian (even amateur).

Nevertheless, the topic that I wanted to approach is information and
human society.  Certainly information plays an important part in human
activity (read human social activity to imply groups of people).
Recent demonstrations of this importance abound in mass media
mediation of social events.  Look at the effect information had on the
American public during the latter years of the Viet Nam exchange.
Information had a more obscure effect in early history because the
whims of a single individual could have such a large effect.  This
information is encoded in the form of human thought and memory.  After
all the generals of ancient disputes had little physical involvement
in the conflict and, yet, their decisions (reached through some
"information processing") determined the course of the battle.  Major
outcomes were determined by information alone (not all battles or wars
mind you but many).  As our capability in information handling
increases the effect of information alone will play a more major role
in grand events (perhaps, the devastation of the earth though I hope
not).  This may seem like a diversion from the initiating theme but
simple unadorned (with emotion) words are very powerful forms of
information.  Love and warmth aside the driving forces of humanity are
highly dependent upon information.  Some of that information is in the
form of the written word.

For while the number in Palo Alto was 830 and 640 in Berkeley.  Then
it stopped working at night and if you dialed it, you'd get a real
live operator who answered simply "Security."  I was reminded of a
science fiction show where a person was excised from societal
existence because he happened to dial the right "wrong number" which
was interpreted to mean he knew too much.  Luckily, I was on a pay

Subject: Display of Calling Party Number

I just read an update on "Dial-a-Confession" which I remember hearing
about last year but didn't think about in context with the discussions
going on in HN.

For over a year, a fellow in NYC has been publicizing a # that you can
call to get things off your chest.  It plays a taped message asking
you not to identify yourself because what you say will be replayed for
the public.

He is an artist (who remains anonymous cause of death threats) wants
enough calls "to create a work of art" that will be displayed in a
museum!  He suggests that there are benefits both to the confessors
and to the airing of their confessions.  Some of the calls: "I feel
like killing.  Who?  My loved one?  Who?  One day I might explode."
"I'm a rapist," another says.  "Society considers that wrong.  That's
society's problem."  And someone else: "I'm just sorry that I didn't
kick all the people who gave me grief."  "You're a fantastic person,"
says one man.  "And you're going to make me very happy when I kill
you."

A lot of the calls sound like put-ons, and some are as calm as
business calls: "Well, I don't know how to say this, but I should
apologize for killing someone.  Actually I haven't been able to live
with myself since."

He has recorded over 1000 phone calls already.  I wonder who is
recording the numbers?

PS: For all you human-nuts out there, the number is (212) 255-2748.

Subject: Checks (response) & Precedent for mailing lists.

        RE: Checks.  I am under the impression (a 60 minutes show a
while back) that US law requires banks to maintain and catalogue all
checks for a period of seven (or five - not sure) years.  And the
banks own these copies, and are allowed to give them out to anyone who
asks for them without telling you.  Most banks don't do that to any
Joe off the street, and some will tell you when the give out your
checks.  There are, however, many thousand federal officials who have
the legal RIGHT to be given copies of your checks.

        RE: Computerized Mailing Lists.  I've been thinking of
WORLD-NET applications of mailing lists.  It strikes me as rather like
Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park, London (Eng.  - you know, net site 42).
This place has operated under the same rules for several hundred
years: its a little (now) paved corner of the park in downtown London,
where anyone is permitted to walk up and give any speach he/she
pleases as long as it is not obscene or treasonous (which means
slander of the monarch (not the prime minister, etc) or incitement to
violence).  I've been there, and people really do make use of the
facility, in a similar (if noisier) way to what I'm doing right now.

   On the issue of check photography, I stand corrected.  As a matter
of fact, judging by the amount of mail recieved, I also walk, sit, and
type corrected.
   My objections to the 'cashless society' remain unanswered, however.
At present, we have a system whereby the government provides a
physical artifact the value of which is guaranteed by said government.
(I am ignoring the smattering of court cases in which it has been
decided, post-gold-standard, that the money is in fact only so much
embroidered toilet paper.) The anonymity of cash has allowed the
existence of a large 'underground economy' which supports organized
crime, indigent artists, and honest citizens everywhere (these classes
are not necessarily mutually exclusive). The IRS asserts that the
'underground economy', if disinterred, would mean the end of the
deficit (proving that, despite all claims to the contrary, the IRS
does indeed have a sense of humor).
   I can't believe the banks will allow anonymous transactions to
occur.  Records will be kept. Employees will have access to them, and
at some time or another, the wrong people will have access to the
employees.  Scrip is worse, for obvious reasons.  'Underground EFT'
would be ok- if you ran it. Blackmail your 'clients', or turn Federal
witness.

   Any ideas?

Subject: The Uses of Home Computers

Actually, many of us may be missing the point.  Most of the people who
will buy home computers in the near future are *not* people like us,
who have more-than-adequate timesharing facilities at our disposal.

There are many things I would do with a home computer (cross-indexing
my rather large library, keeping my budget file up to date (at the
beginning of each year I sit down and work out all my projectable
expenses for the following 52 weeks - not at all trivial to keep
updated), and programing to name three); however I do most of them on
my "big" computer because it's available and because it's "where I
live" - anything a non-timesharing-user would keep in his/her desk
drawer I keep in my computer files in exactly the same natural way.

Back before I had this kind of access, however, I would cheerfully
have gone deeply in hock to get something like a TRS-80 or APPLE - I
would have done most of my programing on it, if there was some way to
get files to the IBM 360 I worked on at the time.  There must be many,
many, other programers out there who would do (are doing, as a matter
of fact) the same.  For non-ADP types, everything applies but the
programing (at least professional programing).  For the technical
writing I used to have to do, I would have killed for a microcomputer
with *any* kind of text editor.  How about the zillions of authors and
would-be authors out there? Even for family letter-writing, you can't
beat a text-editor...for writings of any kind of length, a computer
can't be beat (unless you don't like typing, of course) because it
lets you copy-edit the hell out of even the roughest of drafts,
partial notes, etc.

If you want a comprehensive list of things-to-do-with-a-home-computer,
take a close look at your own time-sharing use; how much of your
current use would be frowned on by your schools/firms/governments
auditors if they knew about it?

From:  Mike Leavitt <LEAVITT at USC-ISI>

     The question of why good editors/text processors don't
seem to make it commerically, while schlock packaged systems
do, has been bothering me for a while.  I've informally managed
a DEC word processing shop for three years: growing it from a
single-station, $20,000 PDP8-based system to an 8-station,
$50,000 shared processor system.  I work with government
secretaries and Ph.D/Lawyer bureaucrats, (nearly) all of whom
use the system.

     This experience has led me to Leavitt's first law of
technology utilization: "Most people will learn no more about
a new technology than is necessary to get the most commonly
performed task accomplished." Super-grade or secretary, this
seems to hold.  There are two (of twelve) professionals and one
(of five) secretaries who are interested in the technology.  The
rest are not, and consequently know very little about a machine
that they have been using for three years!

     DEC doesn't realize this; Wang doesn't realize it; IBM
seems to have a glimmering.  I find it very hard to believe
that Vector Graphics has solved the problem, either.  If my law
is correct, it means that elegance is the only thing that will
permit most people to get the most out of technology. 
Elegance means a minimal set of very powerful commands, that is
both fool-proof and wizard-susceptible.  Does anyone know of
such a system for word processing? (Or anything else, so that we
can apply the lessons of success?)

Talking Heads is part of an ARPA sponsored project in Telecon-

project is called "Transmission of Presence" and includes many
innovative and unusual uses of video and sound.

In the demo they have been showing recently, the actual talking head
is a transluscent plastic mask molded in the shape of a specific
person.  A Super-8 sound film was shot of that same person holding a
conversation with two other people.  A 3-D position sensor was taped
(!) to the back of that person's head, allowing head motion to be
recorded on the sound track of the film.  The film is projected from
behind the mask, with the position information driving a servo
controlled turntable.  In the live demonstration, two live
participants sit in the room with the head, carrying on their part of
the conversation.  The effect is quite realistic (or unreal depending
on your point of view).

Subject: Voice-Grade Line Bandwidth

     The fundamental result of Shannon tells us that a voice-grade
information channel (about 3000 Hz bandwidth, 30 db S/N) has a maximum
information carrying capacity of about 30000 Baud.  In practice, it is
extremely difficult to approach this capacity because complex
encoding/decoding schemes are required as the actual Baud rate nears
the channel capacity.  Commercial modems are available that operate
over voice-grade channels at 9600 Baud, and this is considered to be
at the limits of technology at this time.

     Does someone in the Human-nets readership understand why modems
for use on circuit-switched (dial-up) telephone networks seem to be
limited to 2400 Baud?  The manufacturers catalogs I have seen describe
2400 Baud modems for circuit-switched networks, but at higher rates up
to 9600 Baud the modems are for use on "leased" and/or "conditioned"
lines only.

     I understand that conditioning may decrease the error rate on a
channel somewhat, but this does not seem sufficient to explain the
difference between 2400 Baud and 9600 Baud channel capacties by
itself.

    (Note: when I refer to 2400 Baud modems for circuit switched
networks, this capacity may be achieved by full duplex modems such as
Bell 212A with 1200 Baud in each direction, or by 2400 Baud
transmission in one direction and an associated line turnaround
protocol, for which I have forgotten Ma Bell's designation(s)).

        Holography looks neat, but its a little above us (technology-

consists of a ring of film stretched ring-world-style around a light
source.  These are created by an ad-hoc technique of creating a series
of holograms on verticle strips of the film, while rotating the object
being holographed a corresponding number of radians between each
"exposure."  The effect is nice, but only at a considerable expense.
        Holograms look so nice because they completely reproduce the
wavefronts that were there when they were made.  Conventional
photography only preserves the magnitude of the waves; holograms
preserve the angle of the wavefronts in relation to the user (or so
I'm led to believe - I'm far from being a physicist).  The math to
synthesize a hologram on a CRT or graphics device is well understood
(its a convolution or two), and could probably be managed in real time
by a pipelined array processor for normal resolutions.  But that's the
catch.  "Normal resolution" for a hologram is on the order of 10000
points per inch - the resolution of low ASA film, and is thus 100
times that of the best computer output device I've seen (UPI's
laserphoto equipment).  I onced asked a Polaroid expert about
producing holograms by computers.  He said that he'd seen some done on
the likes of a Versatec plotter.  The 3-D image could barely be
discerned if you really stared at it.  If you didn't, you got a lot of
pretty lines.
        The reason that holograms require such high resolution is that
they create wave fronts in a weird manner, making use of interference
patterns with rings spaced at around the wavelength of light.  If your
grain is too large (in computersprach, your resolution too low), the
interference patterns just aren't there.
        Of course, solving the resolution problem would only give us a
screen that takes hours to refresh.  However, techniques of holography
have been developed to get brighter results by needing less
information.  For example, Polaroid's "rainbow holography" allows
color (!)  holograms to be generated that can be viewed under normal
lighting conditions, and are VERY bright.  The technique used to
compress the amount of information in the hologram (which is what
interests us hackers) is to use "2.5 dimensions": you can look around
(right or left) an object, but not above or below it.  Since people's
eyes seem to be best at picking out objects from side to side rather
than up and down, this fools most people (some swear that they see
above things - I would too, if I hadn't seen the math first and not
wanted to look the fool).
        In short, holograms would be really nifty if we could get
them.  There are some clever people out there, and maybe one of them
will think of an other than brute-force method of putting holograms on
a computer controlled screen.  But until then, I think that it will
never be worth the cost, even once it is do-able.

1) That solar power is feasible and ecologically attractive.  I shall
tear down all my panels and heat only with clean cheap electricity.

2) That conservation is necessary to a continuing American life style.
I will have someone remove all the insulation in my house and toss my

3) That recycling of metal, glass, and paper is beneficial to both
industry and enviroment.  I shall throw my newspapers into the street
and leave my beer cans in the woods where I drive my Chrysler (I shall
not hike nor X-C ski).

        Nor shall I car-pool, take public transportation, nor ride my

and that "atomic poison power" song came on, and we remarked on how
many thousands of well-meaning Americans who knew nothing about
nuclear power were against it just because Jackson Browne (or whoever)
says it's bad.  What the nuclear power companies need is to hire Linda
Ronstadt to plug their product.  I don't think shooting people's heads
off with shotguns is the answer, and furthermore if they want to
protest nuclear power, it's their right--if you don't like it, try and
re-educate them.

Subject: Gordon Liddy speaks at U.C. Berkeley

Yep, that's right! G. Gordon Liddy will make his appearance on
Berkeley on April 28 next week. Liddy has been making campus
appearances for some time now, and 60 Minutes even did a story on his
lecture tour.  What is amazing about this appearance is the political
mess it created for the student government here, the ASUC.

A branch of the ASUC, called SUPERB, which handles, among other
things, people on the lecture tour, signed a contract with Liddy for
$3000.  When the contract came into the hands of the person
responsible for carrying it out, she tore it up, which she had
absolutely no authority to do.  The reason for doing this was that
student money should not go to such a crook, and claimed that this was
not a denial of free speech. (Berkeley, of course, is known for its
"free speech" movement.)  She said that she would carry out the
contract only if the ASUC Senate said it was OK.  Well, after a lot of
argument, they did approve it, and the ASUC President promptly vetoed
it.  The Senate was not able to override the veto.  The President,
Marc Litchman, again claimed that this was not a mockery of free
speech, it was simply keeping student money out of the hands of that
crook.

Then how, you might ask, is he appearing here?  Well, after the veto,
some students formed a student organization called Berkeley Students
for Liddy, and the Political Science department backed them up in an
attempt to get him on campus.  Not that the students who formed this
organization agrees with what Liddy represents, but they do believe
that he has a right to speak here at Berkeley, and they were sickened
by what the student government was doing.

It is amazing how the phrase "free speech" can be interpreted.
Radicals and communists freely speak on the steps of Sproul Hall, but
if anyone of a more conservative ilk decides to do the same, the
aforementioned groups do their best to drown out the speakers. As far
as Liddy goes, one can justify the ASUC's action by claiming that
Liddy was not asking for "free" speech, but rather a speech worth
$3000. Still, Liddy usually speaks to sell-out crowds, and Berkeley
appears to be no different.  If this is any indication, the students
wouldn't mind paying him with student money, since they are so willing
to go to his lectures.

What seems to be called for is an arpanet-wide "who knows what"
directory which users could create and modify their own "whois"
entries in and which would permit access via the contexts of the
individual "whois" listings. Thus if one is looking for an expert on
computer services for the handicapped, content analysis, pattern
recognition of maps, or whatever, one could query the database by
topic and see what came back. Existing "whois" type systems could be
modified to include a line clearly indicating that topics entered
there would be used for the net-wide advising system.. so you wouldn't
have to fill anything in if you didn't want to be bothered with
outside calls. The Network Information Center could periodically
receive and update such data in a net-wide "human knowledge" resources
list. They do things like this for software... and while the net is a
wonderful software exchange medium it has proved even MORE important
as an information exchange medium.

Subject: Home computer use
From: WMartin at Office-3 (Will Martin)

I, too, have often wondered what REAL use a home computer would be to
me.  What mainly comes to mind is using the power of the machine for
automatic INDEXING and SEARCHING tasks.  For example, one thing often
mentioned about home computer use is keeping recipes online.  Now, as
a practical matter, an ordinary cookbook is much more useful than a
computer terminal in a kitchen environment, from utility and safety
standpoints.  And, if you use a printout, you might as well have the
thing on an index card in the first place and bypass the computer
stage.  The common computer-modification of filed recipes is to adjust
quantities, but that is extremely rare in cooking, on the whole.
About all I ever do in this area is to halve a recipe down from a
larger size to a one or two person size.  You don't need computers to
do that, and you often adjust mentally without exact numeric
equivalents (2 small eggs vs half of 3 regular eggs, say).  I find
this sort of computerization useless, or at least of limited value.

Where i see a crying need, though, is in using the machine to FIND the
recipe I want.  The main problem will be either data entry, to get all
this stuff keyed in from your own records, or access to some
publishers' databases of electronically-stored versions.  We have a
couple hundred cookbooks, say.  (My wife collects them, and also runs
a cooking school.)  What we need is something, either with the entire
recipe online, or just the ingredients and a pointer to the book and
page or index card or other hardcopy of the entire recipe, which will
allow a search/retrieval based on various parameters.  The most common
situation is that you have a limited number of ingredients, and want
to make something new or different from the usual.  What recipes could
you use?

The best way I've conceived of this is to assign some ingredients to
the category of "staples".  You assume that you always have some group
of things, such as flour, sugar, baking soda, water, milk, etc.
Another category is "flavoring agents", which are susceptible to
individual variations and exchanges.  Most spices fall into this
group, as do liquors used to flavor, and the like.  The rest of things
are variables -- tomatos, pork chops, lamb kidneys, whatever.

The index program looks at recipe ingredient lists.  It discards from
its search any staples, and any flavoring agents.  Then, when you key
in that you have, say, eggs, chicken stock, spinach, and beans, the
program finds all recipes which have just those ingredients, plus any
number of staples and flavoring agents.  If you don't see something
you want, you ask it to find recipes with one other unspecified
variable, so it finds those which also have one extra ingredient.  You
may have that thing, and forgot to key it in, or it might be worth it
to you to experimentally substitute or omit that item.  Then recipes
with TWO extra unspecified variables, and so on.

As I said, the hard part in this will be data entry.  Anyone want to
keyboard even just the ingredient lists and a lookup key from 200 plus
cookbooks and innumerable leaflets, booklets, and recipe cards?  Plus
there will be many duplicates, of course.  What would make this
feasible would be WORLD-NET access to publishers' data bases, with ALL
cookbooks online, where the search could scan them all.  (Or a library
database instead of the publishers'.)

Anyone who likes to cook would go crazy over getting ahold of such a
tool.  Anyone who likes to eat should get their cook such a tool.

Bring this concept to your wife's attention, and see what she says.

Subject:  Getting your phone number

Well, in Boston and Detroit (actually, only parts of both) you can get
your phone number read back by dialing 1-200-555-1212.  I don't know
if anything is indicated by the fact that these two geographically

In the Boston area, dial 1-200-555-1212 to get the number you are
calling from read back to you by an automatic intercept machine
splicing together prerecorded one digit speech segments each .5
seconds long.

Of course, this doesn't work from everywhere, but it should work from
most places because it is implemented as part of the TOLL network, NOT
on a per-exchange basis.  At the moment, the last 7 digits are
ignored, but this could change.  In this area, you now get telephone
repair by dialing 1-555-1611 instead of just 611.  At one time, the
last four digits after 555 were ignored too.

The system doesn't lie.  Sometimes it drops digits and only plays
maybe five, but it doesn't lie.  Wrong number readbacks that you might
have gotten are due to the fact that those horrid sleeve detectors
often screw up and return the wrong information to the ANI machine.
Also, for those who don't already know, it is possible on bell system
step systems to 'keep your number from operator'.  I won't bother
going into the details; simply mentioning it as an example of the
lousy step number recovery system.

Subject: phone solicitation

The automatic dialer units such as that which delivered the "pitch",
reported in a recent digest, are really quite un-intelligent.

Some units simply wait for any response, record it, then continue on
their predetermined course.  No response "forking" occurs.  However,
many units are designed to be monitored by humans.  A live person sits
there listening to the responses.  The human controls the actions of
the machine based on the callee's responses.  For example, in some
cases, given a certain response, the caller would press a key
designating a "thank you and goodbye" recording.

The whole idea of this is to provide "standarized" sales pitches and
similar statements, and to avoid "smalltalk".

By the way, in parts of California, at least, FULLY automatic dialer
units are no longer legal.  Legislation banning them was passed after
many people found their phones completely tied up by these machines.
(Especially with step by step exchanges, the machines had the
capability to entangle the victims phone even if they hung up.  With
Crossbar and ESS exchanges, the call would clear IF the callee stayed
hung up long enough.)  So if you get a call from a machine in
California, you are probably dealing either with an illegal operation
or else there's a real live person listening.  Have fun.

Subject: telewarmth (and beyond)

   My recent missive on the power of the epistle provoked this
response from Jerry Pournelle:

     OH COME ON.  letters (epistles) being persuasive? Name one case
     where a series of epistles had any real influence over history.
     I mean it isn't as if St. Paul had any real influence...

...my first reaction to which was to deny any implication of historical 
influence by letters.  But then, you start to think...funny things
about historical force and personal influence, cultural communication
and computer networks.
   It's true.  I can't name a single case of a revolutionary urging
the masses to revolt by waving a well-composed dispatch from home, or
a ruler opting for war at the urging of some far-flung correspondent
(at least, not so's they'd admit).  Clearly, the best an exemplifier
can hope for is to find some place where some Post-bourne information
was the basis for such a decision.  But isn't that the point, both for
hand-generated and electronic media?  Information.
   Two points, actually.  The first is that, while information may not
make the world go round, it can certainly make it tilt a little bit
now and again, enough to make a subtle (invisible?) difference.
   The second is that information in general (and personal
communications, network newsletters et al in particular) are much too
subtle, insidious and even subversive to be THE CAUSE of anything.
This is a question that might be a good forking-off point from the
telewarmth debate: How much is the flow of history a function of
'causes', initiated by the kinds of things historians can nail down as
'events' like assassinations, esoteric politics, the personal
magnetism of leaders, and state initiatives; and how much is due, how
much are those other causes made potent by, the movement of ideas, the
flow of culture, not only among the elite but in the formation of the
worldviews of whole populations?
   Need I add that this is a critical question in the age of
information which we represent?  That if the former is true then the
course of the world is pretty much independent of we punks, whereas
the second implies that we, and everybody else who tries to affect the
views of circles of people arbitrarily wide, are making history, and
that (this is the important part, so wake up) as instant, detailed,
casual, TWO-WAY information transiting becomes more and more a mass
phenomenon, the first will become less and less relevant.
   I'm not talking phone calls and parlor debates among friends here,
you know.  What human-nets and its ilk represents is a new animal, if
not in kind, but only in massive degree, from plain old mass media.
The capability to influence a wide group of total strangers (that is,
to inform, incite and stimulate them) no longer requires a substantial
amount of capital, or even effort, or even time.  What we have here is
a journal of Letters to the Editor among people with something in
common.  What I want to know is: what difference is this going to
make?  Which is it, folks?  What makes history?  Ideas, or Big Men?

Information Center that gave you the ARPANET DIRECTORY.

Now, the problem might be that this was produced at one time and is no
longer produced (it is an enormous update task, after all); the latest
copy in our office is dated Dec 76, and we are on the mailing list for
ARPANET Directories and get the latest ones of those.  I have a
message in inquiring about the status, and will send the digest info
as I get it.

I guess the main problem with such guides is that, even with TIP
login, many host's operational organizations don't want anyone else
using their resources.  In fact, such use of resources (no matter how
unrewarding or superficial, like a "systat" command or its equivalent)
is considered a security violation and grounds for failing inspections
or ADP security reviews in many circumstances.  This sort of thing is
probably totally incomprehensible to people used to MIT-like open
environments; nonetheless, that's why many hosts are practically
invisible to net people.  Many other hosts, of course, simply have
nothing to offer.

A lot of what you want is precisely what the NIC is for.  You can
connect to the NIC host (currently SRI-KL) and run the NIC/Query
system by typing "nic" and a carriage-return, then following
instructions.

The NIC (Network Information Center) publishes two softcover books
every year.  One is the ARPANET Directory you mentioned, and everyone
listed in the NIC database as a user is listed in it (and gets a free
copy by US Mail).  If you are not listed in the Directory (therefore
not in the NIC database), you should act through your site Liaison to
get added.  If you don't know who your Liaison is, you can use the
NIC/Query program to find out, or look in the other book the NIC
publishes, the ARPANET Resource Handbook.  This sucker is a couple of
inches think and has all kinds of goodies - the only real problem is
information overload (all the information in the book is, again,
available via the NIC/Query program on SRI-KL).  One copy of the
Resource Handbook is sent to the Liaison at each site, so there should
be a current one somewhere around PARC (probably more than one).  I
have a 2-year-old copy here at home and it lists Edward Taft as your
Liaison.

For those who don't know how to browse through the MIT filesystem, I
have an incomplete (and easier to make use of) list of special-
interest mailing lists at [OFFICE-3]<ALMSA>INTEREST-GROUPS.TXT.  You
can FTP it using the standard ANONYMOUS FTP Login convention and any

Subject: Privacy of Phone Numbers

        I recently worked at UCLA, where we developed a PDP-11-based
system for Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI).  One of
CATI's primary functions was generating and maintaining the lists of
phone numbers which the (human) interviewers call.  This is usually
done by entering a list of seed numbers ("randomly" generated, or
sampled from phone books), identifying those numbers that lead to
residences, and ("randomly") generating more numbers in the same
"bank" (taking advantage of clustering in the way the Phone Companies
allocate numbers).  When each interview is over, the phone number used
is stripped out of the data that we send on to analysis.  The only
permanent copy of the phone numbers is the original interview
"protocols" (either paper questionnaires, or transaction files on
archival media), which are kept locked in a special area in order to
comply with privacy policies.

        There were, however, occasional problems.  Some respondents
would become very upset when we called them, and demand that we tell
them how we got their number (especially when it was "unlisted").  I'm
afraid that explaining our process did very little good; the bottom
line is that the interviewer was "given the number by a computer",
which is the last thing that people want to hear.  Sometimes they
would demand that we take their number off the computer, and never
call them again.  Now, we had set up a system to prevent calling such
people in any of our future surveys (to avoid charges of harassment),
but this involved retaining their phone numbers online indefinately
(so we could reject those numbers if they were ever again generated by
our "random" processes)!

        Alas, I fear that of our society isn't yet ready for the Great
Information Revolution.  (Alternative explanation: we aren't yet ready
to begin implementing the Great Information Revolution, we don't
understand the user requirements well enough).  So it goes.

        By the way, although I worked at UCLA, it was not at the same
dapartment that houses LAUREN (apologies).

?Huh?? New Haven, CT has a very good Step office that has the 703
kludge implemented via its Crossbar toll center. "Back in 'dem olden
days" (>10 years ago) before ESS was ever out and Crossbar was
installed in one exchange in a very rural area whose Step system
croaked because of a major flood, our Step office handled alot of
kludges by going through as a toll call (in fact, DA is 1+411!).

Anyway, most installers call the operator, since it's infinitely
easier than remembering what the new code is in the local area
(changed because the circuit was always tied up with random hackers
trying to see what number *THEY* were plugging in to with their
ameteur test sets).

.... But you would <Expect> kludges in Connecticut; They were the
first Phone Co. to go all switching (when the other ones were still
hacking operators and plugs). Then Toll switching came in in about
1968 (Gee, you could actually call cross state without going through
an operator - I can't wait for interstate Toll Calling to come in!!).

... Well, that was back in 1969 or so...

Subject: 113 kludge

I only said that "113" would only work in some Crossbar and ESS
exchanges.  I didn't mean to imply anything about numbers in other
areas.  There are various numbers implemented in many Bell and General
Step by Step exchanges, though, as you mentioned, they tend to vary
quite widely.  In many areas, they are turned off at night and only
work during business hours!

Back when I was doing telecommunications work dealing with an OLD Step
by Step exchange, I was always amused by the fact that you could
actually HEAR the number identification taking place.  After the third
or fourth digit, you'd hear a low tone for a second and a half or so
-- the actual "trace" tone leaking through from the sleeve.  This was
apparently pretty standard in Bell Step offices.  Of course, you only
heard this if you were dialing a call that required a number ID --
such as a toll or intertoll call -- or the subscriber number readback
system, of course.

Knowing these readback numbers was pretty helpful when faced with rows
of DAA's on phone lines which had lost their number stickers!  I did
find one amusing fact though -- sometimes the number readback systems
would LIE -- they'd toss in a couple of wrong digits.  This sure
didn't make my job any easier...

the disembodied talking heads used in the "Haunted Mansion" at

Subject:  Computer Crime in the News

The cover story in the April 20th issue of Business Week is "Computer
Crime." The major premise is that businesses are becoming more
vulnerable to computer based ripoffs due to two trends.  The first is
the proliferating use of dial-up systems by these businesses.  The
article points out some of the better known (and more primitive)
threats to such systems.

The second threatening trend is the major increase in computer
literacy due to the expanding use of personal computers.  (This
appears to be based on the premise that if more people know how to
talk to computers, more people will learn how to abuse them.  This
doesn't say much for human nature, does it?)

The article mostly ignores the advantage of using your own computer as
the attacking agent, which seems to be a bigger threat than teaching
people about computers.

If you're interested in the commercial world's opinion of computer
technology and security, the article is worth reading.  There are,
however, no startling revelations and the examples used are only
remotely computer-based ripoffs (e.g. Equity Funding and the recent
Wells Fargo embezzlement case).

some engineer didn't believe the claim that the bumblebee couldn't
fly, so he went and designed one of the really huge cargo planes
(predecessor to the C5A, I think) that the same math said wouldn't
fly, either.  And of course, it flew.  Anyone remember this story and

The Penn BULL System actually has an equivalent amount of interesting
discussion.  It has been referenced in two papers out of Penn and one
dissertation.  Non-violent discussions have included such diverse
topics as:
           a mini-version of the TESB discussion from SF-Lovers
           Penn engineering's recent change of primary computing power
           commenting in programming languages
           the shuttle details

[This is a microscopic list since there have been over 10,000 entries
in under 1.5 years!]

I think that the most prevalent non-violent topic is coined
"meta-bull" in which the form, function, etc of the bull system itself
is discussed.  When it was actively under developement more than 50%
of the messages were meta bull.

We have thought off and on about publishing a BEST OF collection
locally.

BTW: Anyone know what the 2500th digit from the end of 10000! is?
     This was one of the earliest bull system queries and sparked a
     reasonable amount of debate at the time [entry #200 or so -- real
     early].  It is yet to be resolved [we are now up to entry
     10,900].  (No fair writing a program to calculate it (or
     Macsyma)).

        A Short Sad Story

 Living, as I do, on a 30 cps hardcopy terminal, I was very pleased to
hear that another group in the office was paying for a communications
package for our word processor.  I quickly advised them to be sure
that it would:
  (a) accomodate ASCII transmissions; and,
  (b) have a modem capable of 300 to 1200 baud transmission.  (1200 is
about as fast as our TIP can handle.)

Well, they just installed the hardware and software changes and I
discovered that:

On the advice of the company, we got a modem capabale of 300-1200 baud
transmissions -- but only between the word processor and modem.  All
transmissions from the modem outbound are only at 1200 baud.  (And
it's incompatible with the Bell 212A modems at the TIP to boot!)

The comm protocol is SIMPLEX, i.e., it must be manually switched from
transmit to receive and back.  These people apparently believe that
the ultimate in communications technology is batch file transfer from
point A to point B!!  No other option (such as talking to an
interactive system or another human) is currently available or planned
<sob!  sob!>.

(In case you're interested, the word processor is the CPT 8000 by
Systems Technology, Inc.)

I hope that the folks selling Office Automation and electronic mail
systems have progressed beyond the 1950s.

n552  0450  15 Apr 81
BC-ADA-2takes-04-15
    By Ronald Rosenberg
     (c) 1981 Boston Globe (Field News Service)
    Imagine the Department of Defense (DOD), which depends on acronyms
as much as on bullets, borrowing from ''The Wizard of Oz,'' Lord
Byron's daughter and a Frenchman in coming up with new computer
software language.
    Moreover, the language's three-letter name is not an abreviation.
    And equally surprising is that the Army, Navy, Air Force and
several defense agencies could agree on anything, let alone a standard
computer language.
    But, their having gone the next step and developing it, this new
software could translate into savings for taxpayers of millions, and
possibly billions, of dollars. The military already spends some $7
billion for computer software, twice the amount it spent eight years
ago.
    The new military software is called Ada and it is named after
August Ada Byron, who was the Countess of Lovelace (1816-1852). Her
dad was Lord Byron, the English man of letters whose romantic poetry
(Don Juan, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage) made him a symbol for the
greatest lovers. Centuries before computer languages, he wrote:
    ''I love the language, that soft bastard Latin
    Which melts like kisses from a female mouth.''
    He might have winced if he knew that some 160 years after he wrote
those lines his daughter's name would stand for a very different kind
of language. But, then, he believed people are free to choose their
own courses. ''Fame is the thirst of youth,'' he wrote.
    Last month the Army's Communications Research and Development
Command in Fort Monmouth, N.J., issued a policy statement that Ada is
the official computer language for all new software development or
major modifications to its computer automated battlefield systems -
from tanks to unmanned machine guns.
    That means any type of computer, from an IBM mainframe to a
minicomputer or a microprocessor ''embedded'' in a weapon, airplane or
missile, that is not used for data processing must be programmed in
Ada. More than half the computer systems in military use are
''embedded'' in a host of weapons systems, communications, training
simulators, and on-board flight-control systems.
    For the Army, selecting a single computer language was no trivial
matter. It uses 43 computer languages on 58 computers from 29
manufacturers.
    Still, the Pentagon did not romantically name a computer language
after a great English poet's daughter. Ada Byron is better known as
the first programmer, having been assistant to George Babbage,
inventor of the first primitive ''computer.'' Known as the Difference
Machine, it was designed to calculate entries in logarithm tables.
    So Ada, unlike Fortran (Formula Translation), COBOL (Common
Business Oriented Language), PL1 (A Programming Language 1), or BASIC
(Beginner's All-purpose Instruction Code), is one of the few military
names that is not an abbreviation. Still, one wag at UCLA maintains
Ada could stand for Another Damm Acronym.
    There is great relief in the military that Ada is one less
acronym.  The Air Force, which initially was reluctant to take Ada to
its bosom, preferred its own computer language: JOVIAL, a
well-respected computer language that has gone through several
enhancements and modifications.
    JOVIAL?
    Jules' Own Version of the International Algebraic Language.
    And Jules?
    Jules Schwartz, the computer systems analyst who, under contract,
designed the software that is used in Air Force weapons systems and
jets.
    Interestingly, Ada, the language, can trace its roots to Paris,
where a French computer systems analyst working for CII-Honeywell
Bull, completed writing the language, based on specifications from the
DOD.
    Following the American tradition of seizing an opportunity, he has
left Honeywell and formed a consulting firm that helps military
contractors use Ada. He shouldn't have any problem finding clients,
since Ada also has been accepted as the offical computer language of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
    The software is so promising it could even surpass Fortran, the
widely accepted scientific language in military applications, in 15
years.
    Still, it took the Pentagon more than three years to agree on Ada.
That meant comments from 74 branches and sub-branches of the Defense
Department, 66 individuals and 43 companies.
    Each series of draft specifications had a name, borrowed and
embellished from ''The Wizard of Oz.'' The first preliminary, in
April, 1975, was a list of language specifications labeled Strawman.
Woodenman, next, was based on Strawman comments. Then came Tinman in
1976, which the Air Force, Army, Navy and several other military
agencies agreed was pretty much what they wanted in a computer
language.
    So when those requirements were organized into a descriptive form
the next year they were labled Ironman. Finally, in 1978, after some
2,000 pages of comment came Steelman, which remains the final
statement of what Ada should be all about.
    Last week, 20 representatives from some of the leading military
contractors, including General Electric, Bendix, IBM, Digital
Equipment Corp, Computervision, and the Electronic Systems Division of
the Air Force Systems Command at Hanscom Air Force Base attended a
day-long briefing on Ada put on by the Institute for Advanced
Professional Studies of Newton.
    Besides learning a lot about Ada, which will not be embedded into
any military gear until 1983, they were told that the Air Force, Army
and Navy are trying to follow their software agreements with standards
on hardware. But each is doing its own thing and no one is tying these
standards to Ada.
    As for Ada, the Pentagon found they just couldn't let her exist as
a computer language without an acronym. She already has a younger
sister, Diana: Discriptive Intermediate Attributed Notation for Ada.

 by L.A. Belady, C.J. Evangelisti, and L.R. Power [do IBM employees
 have first names?]

Abstract:

 To improve the redability of programs over existing techniques,
 a new program representation termed GREENPRINT has been developed
 and is discussed in this paper.  GREENPRINTs (the name taken
 from the phosphor floresence of certain display terminals and
 paralleling the term blueprints) are tree structured diagrams
 together with source code statements that represent the control
 structure of programs.  Discussed in this paper are the diagramming
 conventions, control flow methodology, presentation graphics, and
 pratical experience with GREENPRINTs.

The paper shows how to convert standard flowcharts and NSD to
GREENPRINTs.  The idea seems to be the same as the Unix structural
diagram generator [whose name I have forgotten] but the GPs are
prettier (to me).  I would try to draw in a sample greenprint but
would undoubtedly make a hopeless mess.

Subject:  home computers

I have done a lot of thinking about using computers at home. I have
one, and I mostly use it for hacking. My wife doesn't get too upset,
and the kids play games on it (but won't learn to program - I guess
it's too much like what Mommy and Daddy do - couldn't be worthwhile
for kids.)

Anyhow, the only answer I could come up with was mucho dissatisfying.
That is: home control. I mean a vanilla process control system doing
energy management. Given that you could do that, you could add on
bells and whistles like hooking up to the phone to make it smarter,
etc; but the process control system is the only one that will pay its
cost back.

To use a control system, you can't just have any old house. On a lot
of houses, the retrofit is too big a task. You also would like to have
sympathetic utility companies who will give you off-peak rates and
things.

Here's what you want to do. (1) balance your electric load. (2) handle
a zoned heating system, using multivariable control.  (The most
interesting process variables are temperature and humidity; you can
save money optimizing comfort-factor rather than temperature, but you
can't do it without a computer.) (3) water the lawn. (This is
ridiculous unless you live somewhere that water is rationed - New
Jersey? California?)

Did you ever notice how hot it gets in the kitchen when you're fixing
dinner? Sure would be nice to sense that fact and move the heat
elsewhere.

Anyhow, all the computer you need is a lousy 8748 or so - you never
see it, you never get to hack code on it, and the process control
program is such a pain in the wazoo that you either buy it (God
forbid) from somebody else, or you do it yourself and keep waking up
at 2:00 AM to a house that's 140 degrees in the shade.  Not fun at
all.

Subject: "Telewarmth"

   Well, personally, I have two problems with sending personal
messages on the Net, which aren't present in postal mail.  The first
is the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that the Net is really a
DOD research tool, and while stuff like SF-Lovers can be considered as
"enhancing the research environment", my ability to rationalize can't
make the leap comfortably to using the net for very personal missives.

   The other problem is that I don't really consider messages sent on
the net to be particularly secure.  Even if things technically permit
me to be confident that a personal message isn't going to be
accidentaly or deliberately read by someone other than the recipient
(and I don't believe that for a second), I still have no guarantee
that the message won't go up on someone's screen while someone else is
in the office reading over the recipients' shoulder, etc, etc

   By the way, I consider "telewarmth" to be an excellent coinage.
Images of future technology spring to mind.  "Dial a Hug"?

I haven't reread my message, but I really can't recall any reference
to 'influence' (on a wider-than-personal basis) by letters.  In fact I
wouldn't claim that.  I WOULD claim that letters are a very useful
thing between people and even to the person writing.
    Actually, come to think of it, I wouldn't underestimate the cap-
ability of missives from complete strangers to have a certain effect
on the reader.  Again, speaking from personal experience, your
thoughts on gun control were as ennervating and blood-curdling an
experience as I've had in some time.

Subject: Lectures and attendance
From: BEB via <Ecg.Rich@DEC-MARLBORO>

   In regards to the thought forwarded by JMC @SU-AI that people in
general do not attend lectures where they know they are going to
disagree with the speaker, I would like to express the following
opinion.
   One of the most stimulating aspects of human existence is the
ability to disagree.  But in order to disagree with someone (other
than saying "no it isn't - yes it is") you must understand his/her
point of view.  One of the best ways to get a clear understanding of
an opposing point of view is to hear it from the person who holds it
true.  I would hope that people in this society who have strong ideas
and ideals (not to the point of fanaticism) would be willing and are
in fact listening to opposing view points.  It may be that they
aren't, and I feel sorry for these people, for if there was only one
way of thinking, I don't think much progress could be made.
   It may just be that there are many people at a lecture who know
they will disagree with the speaker, but these people are not
'hecklers'.  They are intelligent people who have come to a room
to hear an opposing view to theirs and maybe to try and understand
'those idiots' who disagree with them that much better.

Subject: Radio rises once again  

By ANDREW FEINBERG
c.1981 N.Y. Times News Service
    NEW YORK - Somewhere back in the murky days of yesteryear, decades
before the advent of Laverne and Shirley and Archie and Edith, network
radio ruled the air waves. Now, while much of the media world stands
agog at the upheavals to be wrought by new video technologies, a
curious radio revolution is occurring. The old radio networks are
storming back, and new ones are being formed at an astonishing pace.
    Within just the last two weeks, four new networks were announced,
two each by the RKO Radio Network and the Satellite Music Network.
Last November, the Wall Street Journal's 50-city radio network went on
the air and in January a sports network called Enterprise Radio began.
The impetus? Advertising. Network radio is one of the fastest-growing
large advertising media, having increased its billings 23 percent in
1980, to $157 million, and in the first quarter this by more than 25
percent.
    As yet, such spending isn't much of a threat to competing media -
the advertising bill in the United States last year was $54.75
billion. But the amount of programming that radio networks offer their
affiliates has grown enormously since the 1960s when the four existing
networks - ABC, CBS, NBC and the Mutual Broadcasting System - were
primarily news services. By the end of this year there should be 19
national radio networks, many of them feeding programming such as
concerts, sports events, talk shows and dramas.
    Generally, radio networks send their affiliates programming that
contains national commercials and free time to be sold to local
advertisers. Networks usually pay affiliates ''compensation'' - an
average 17 percent of billings - for airing their shows and
commercials.
    ''Network radio is exploding,'' says Ira Berger, network
supervisor at the Needham, Harper & Steers ad agency in Chicago.
''Much of its increased billing is coming directly out of network TV
because the price of TV has gotten so high that many advertisers are
looking for ways to spend more efficiently. Network radio can be a
very good, fairly cheap way of covering the whole country.''
    There is something resembling irony here. Three of the radio
networks luring dollars away from network television have initials
that most television viewers would recognize.
    The new radio networks are appealing to advertisers much as
magazines and cable television do, by cultivating particular
demographic groups, which are hard to target through network
television. Two radio networks cater to blacks and one is aimed at
physicians.
    ''In 1960 we were a terrible medium,'' says Robert M. Chambers,
general manager of the ABC Radio Networks. ''In recent years we've put
more emphasis on programming because the advertisers want it and the
affiliates demand it. Stations want something from us - concerts,
lifestyle features, etc., that will distinguish them from the guy
across the street who's playing the same records.''
    Indeed, the RKO Radio Networks' president, Thomas F. Burchill,
contends that increased competition between radio stations has helped
spur the resurgence of radio networks.
    ''In 1968,'' he says, ''there were 4,000 radio stations. Ten years
later there were almost 8,000, mostly because of the growth of FM.
Now stations need additional resources to compete effectively, and
many things they can't afford to produce themselves.''
    These days ''instant'' radio networks are often formed by program
syndicaters in conjunction with advertising agencies. (Satellite
transmission is making this much simpler.) These networks transmit
programming only infrequently and their ''affiliates'' can vary
extensively from week to week. Regional networks, such as what Phil
Rizzuto, the sports broadcaster, calls ''the New York Yankees baseball
network'' are also popular. Finally, many radio sales concerns will
put together an unwired national network for advertisers willing to
sponsor different shows in dozens of cities.
    Network executives have learned from the success of radio
syndicators that concert specials invariably improve ratings. This
year, RKO will present at least 12 of them and ABC, which aired just
one in 1978, will broadcast 100.
    There's a special reason for RKO's entry into network radio.
Birchill says the company feared that Federal Communications
Commission rulings might prevent it from growing in the
station-operating business. In the late 70s, RKO General was worried
that the FCC might strip it of all its television and radio stations
as retribution for filing false financial reports with the commission
and, more importantly, because its parent, General Tire & Rubber, had
confessed to making many improper payoffs at home and abroad and had
been accused by the FCC of forcing its customers to buy commercial
time from RKO. In January 1980, the commission refused to renew three
RKO television station licenses. The case is now in the courts.
    Profits can flow very fast in the network business. Burchill says
RKO I became profitable after just 10 months. Bill Rasmussen, creator
of the Enterprise sports network and the ESPN Cable TV sports network,
says his radio operation, featuring a daily sports talk show that
lasts an astounding 13 hours, will be in the black by the end of this
year. Industry sources say that most networks yield returns of 20 to
25 percent per year, which helps explain the new interest.  Burchill
projects network revenues of at least $330 million by 1985, and
perhaps as much as $500 million.

It seems to me that dynamic holography is a neat solution to this
problem.  I have seen 3-D holographic images that were simply wound
around a very bright light source.  They were very impressive. You
walked around the image to the rear and were looking at the back of
the object with all the different angles all around.  I doubt that
there exists a technology for dynamic (high speed change) holography.
Has the scientific community given up on the hologram as a useful
tool?  I haven't seen them used for very much in recent years other
than art.  There used to be a lot of talk [and demonstration] of
holograms in medicine.  I can imagine reconstructing a CAT scan into
the entire image of the body (of course having to irradiate the entire
body to do so).

Subject: 3-D display

   I saw an item in print a few years back about a 3d display. It was
supposed to consist of a tank filled with gel. Apparently the gel
would floresce if zapped above a certain threshold.  The thing had two
mechanicly scanned lasers on two sides of the tank.In theory either
one of the lasers output was insufficient to have an effect, but where
the two beams intersected you got a glowing point. They were having
problems with the scanning system, and the fact that it used up an
entire 360 to run the thing. I havent heard any more in 5 years so I
guess they died.

Subject: 3D displays.

        According to the ancient lore and rumors among the inodes,
once in the not so distant past, a Berkeley undergrad unit designed a
3d display system.  Micro-spheres were fired from a gun at a x-y
deflection plate, which is located at the focal point of a parabolic
reflector, thus the hapless micro-sphere would move through the
viewing chamber on a selectable line parallel to the z axis.  Coloured
strobe light illuminated the sphere at programmed points along its
path.  Several such spheres were shot per frame.  He actually
constructed the ballistic accelerator which was used to smash m & m's
around the berkeley physics labs.
        He is currently rumoured to be creating computerized guide
dogs.

Subject: Onyx systems

The Onyx system isn't too bad... but there are problems.  I know
one of their software people pretty well, and he has told me some
interesting stories.

One of the main limitations is the Winchester disk being used.  The
system apparently becomes disk bound very quickly when multiple users
start working.  With single users, it apparently works OK, but I
personally would consider not having sources to be a major negative
factor.

There is alot more I could say about the Onyx system (and the other 16
bit Unix implementations), but it would fill a book.

As for the "standard" 16 bit chip.  I don't think there will be one.
All of the current breed have design misfeatures of varying
seriousness, and OEM's seem to be hopping onto whichever happens to be
available in quantity the soonest.  This has tended to put the Z8000
at a disadvantage, though I personally prefer it from an architectual
standpoint.  However, with the 32 bitters coming along soon, and the
massive fragmentation of the marketplace, I still suggest that people
who want a "standard" stick with the Z80.  Really.

Subject: Home Computer: A Testimonial

  When it comes right down to it, there aren't many good reasons for
getting a home computer.  I bought one last year and used all sorts of
vague arguments to justify it.  The ultimate argument against buying
one is always "How does it pay you back?" and I was pretty well
resigned to purchasing an expensive toy.

  Then I tried doing my taxes in BASIC.

  I have always hated doing all of those tax computations.  So, every
year I would sit down and "do my taxes" in one evening, performing all
of the computations only once or twice.  The only problem is that in
order to optimize your tax return you really have to do the computa-
tions several times and try different approaches.

  This year I coded all of the relevant data into BASIC program
statements (BASIC is the only non-assembler I have) and have run
through my tax return dozens of times.  By combining programming
(which I like) with tax computation (which I loathe) I manage to enjoy
spending time on my taxes.

  I also ended up saving several hundred dollars.

  Note, of course, that BASIC is quite adequate for simple math and
accounting problems and that taxes are about the only accounting that
most people do.  It is also a place where a bit of extra figuring can
really turn a profit (or, rather, limit a loss).

  I've also been interested/perplexed about this business.  From

   HBO has been known to broadcast a caveat stipulating that
"unlawfull" reception of their signal is a criminal offense.  Since
there is no "unlawfull" reception of signals, I believe they are just
trying to confuse us.

   Concerning radar detection devices: The state of Conn.  has signs
all over their highways telling us that use of radar detection devices

Subject: Insidiously is certainly the word for it...

although I can't understand why anyone would use the words "quickly"
and "insidiously" as if they were synonymous.  I always thought that
insidious plots were those that took a long time to brew and that lay
in wait for years before striking.  I would say that "flame" is not a
very good example.  That is one of those words with a perfectly
reasonable English counterpart, i.e., "rave".  There are many such
perverted terms in the "hacker" vocabulary -- mine included.  I would
not be so quick to conclude that computer science is such a major
force simply because it is producing its own vocabulary.  Perhaps
those who work in it are simply illiterate to the point that they
cannot use the words that are available to express themselves. [Please
do not get all upset about this entry.  I mean it primarily in fun.

   Before horizontal sweep was invented, 2D images were generated
by placing a rotating mirror in front of a CRT. 
   Now we have 3D from a 2D CRT image. 
   Gee, maybe next we can go after the general case.

Subject: Arpa access

Many of us are not aware of and so do not fully exploit the resources
available on the Arpanet.  The recent msg regarding availability of
abstracts of Rutgers TR's was a good example.  How about one of you
wizards writing a paper of around 30 printed pages called "Hacking the
Arpanet", which would be available for FTP, and would describe the
databases, computing resources, and guest accounts, and wizards at
each site, along with a quick overview of how to use the most common
OS execs (Tenex, ITS, ...).  It may be that some of this information
is available in the printed Arpanet directory, but (1) I'm sure it
gets outdated quickly, and (2) the only such directories here at Xerox
are at least five years old and were smuggled in by former RAND, III,
or ISI people.  We need a single on-line document to be able to point
people to as a starting point.  Are our facilities really so close to
overload that we couldn't handle it if all the people with net access
made optimal use of the resources available to them?  It doesn't do
much good to tell someone to "ask a wizard" if neither he nor the
wizard knows what's out there, or if there aren't any real wizards at
the site (I've noticed, to my surprise, that a lot of sites have never
or only rarely contributed to Human-nets.  Do they know we exist?
Surely a list of the special-interest mailing lists based at AI and MC
would be one of the first things for such a document to include.)

The one qualification I would make is that I certainly would be
receptive to arguments of the form "wait until TIP logon is
implemented", if it is the case that dozens of random teenie-boppers
are dialing in and tying up expensive resources.  But the
implementation/ maintenance of such a document must begin now if it is
to be available a few months down the pike.

People interested in coordinating/ contributing to such an effort
should probably respond to me <Hamilton.ES @ PARC-MAXC> directly; msgs
on more global/ related topics should respond directly to <Human-nets
@ AI>

Subject: Human communication via an electronic medium   

The following is an excerpt from the April 7 issue of ELECTRONICS
magazine article on the schedule for the Society for Information
Display's International Seminar and Symposium (Apr 27 - May 1 in New
York) pp 104-106

Talking Heads.
        One of the more unusual presentations, a talking head display,
will come from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass.  It involves a three-dimensional surface in the shape of a
persons's face on which facial expressions are imaged in real time.
The purpose of the display is to accurately represent the nuances of
face-to-face conversation in teleconferencing.

Subject: Emotions and Electronic mail

Shade and Sweet water to you,
        This has bothered me for a while, so <<<FLAME ON!>>>

        I hack at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (when I
don't hack AI) which runs a Cyber series 70 megacomputer. NOS has no
intrinsic mailer so a user wrote a fairly good one a few years ago.
What is disturbing is the manner the the community uses the program.
They play games!
        To clearify, they use 'funny' names (KINNISON, CEREBUS,
SNOWMAN) and have fun playing 'public masturbation' putting grafitti
on the BBOARD facility. One of the big trends is chain mail, and when
I tried to introduce a mailer that was better (and conformed to RFC
733 to boot), the general attitude was "go screw".
        The problem that electronic mail may face will be that while
the 'techie' people can deal maturely with it, and be creative with
their messages, the majority of the users may create another incidence
of the 'CBBS syndrome', a gross waste of an incrediblyp useful
resource.

        A facility is only as good as the median of it's users skills.

                                                        <<<FLAME OFF>>>

Subject: Tracing fone

I think that the minimum time required to trace a call is not that
typified by the television/movie releases!  I think that the system is
capable of "locking" up the subsystem that indicates the call path.
With CCIS this kinda of stuff easy.

Lauren is a system??

2.  I could't send this note to melohn at USC-ECLB-IPI because our

Subject: telco number "tracing"

Since the subjects relating to call tracing and number identification
have appeared in HUMAN-NETS, I have started receiving mail from people
who express concern over the telco knowing their phone number!  C'mon
now.  How else could you get those nice itemized bills every month
without having an operator request your number every time you make a
toll call?  (Actually, that still goes on in some areas, and even in
metro areas when an ANI [automatic number identification] fails).  I
guess alot of people just never thought about it too much.  It really
is NOT some kind of horrible threat, but is simply a necessary aspect
of telecommunications operations.  If someone is THAT concerned, they
should use a payphone!

By the way, that 113 number quoted for number readback is for use by
technicians faced with 1000 pair cables and such who need to figure
out what the hell they're connecting to what!  It will only work in
some Crossbar and ESS exchanges.

Subject: SPACE SHUTTLE LANDING

From the official letter from NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center:

"We are issuing car passes for at least 30,000 vehicles to this site
and traffic will be limited to back roads.  The State of California
traffic department estimates that it will be only able to move 1,000
vehicles per hour so a massive traffice jam could occur."

They have a 24-hour telephone information number:

"A 24-hour telephone information service will be operated from
Lancaster, California, and Washington, D.C., to provide recorded
Shuttle flight status and hours of operation for the Guest Center.
The number in Lancaster is (805) 945 6776.  The number in Washington
is (202) 755 8363."

I haven't tried the phone numbers.  I hope this is of to use to some
readers.

From: nomdenet at RAND-UNIX

   The following two items are from the March, 1981 issue of
"Broadcast Engineering" magazine.

   At the recent SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television
Engineers) conference in San Francisco there was the first showing in
North America of NHK Research Laboratories' high-definition television
system.  The Labs agreed to bring over from Japan the complete color
camera and display equipment they had developed for their 1125-line
color television system.  This included a special broadband color
camera with 2" diameter pick-up tubes; and a large-screen, direct-
view color picture tube with a high-resolution faceplace.  The
equipment was in operation during the conference.

   April 12-15 the National Association of Broadcasters is holding its
annual conference in Las Vegas.  One of the sessions will cover
satellites for radio.  A review of the progress toward satellite use
for high-quality audio trans- mission, some of the topics included
are: Stereo; noise-reduction techniques; lower costs; smaller dish
antennas; sharing of earth stations; installations; maintenance; and
testing of radio earth stations.

Subject: Cheap Portable Terminal

        I had a chance to try out the Lexicon terminal in Houston.  It
is in fact very portable and nicely priced.  However, the keyboard is
just a little too small; you can't touch-type on it because the keys
are too small and closely spaced to get your fingers on all the home
keys at the same time.  This was the case both for me (average size)
and a smaller-than-average-female colleague.  Also, the keyboard has
no discernable "feel."
        Thus, if you do a lot of input with your portable terminal,
the Lexicon couldn't be considered to compete with TI.  If hunt &
pecking is OK, the Lex is very nice, but there are others that are
smaller and/or cheaper, thought not necessarily with all the Lex's
features.

From the Los Angeles Times, 7 April 1981:

- Peter Arndt

(I've used "(R)" in lieu of a symbol for registered.)

                  ALL THE PROGRAMS YOU'LL EVER NEED.

                              FOR $600.

Say goodbye to the costs and frustrations associated with writing
software: The Last One (R) will be available very soon.

More comprehensive and advanced than anything else in existence, The
Last One (R) is a computer program that writes computer programs.
Programs that work first time, every time.

By asking you questions in genuinely plain English about what you want
your program to do, The Last One (R) uses those answers to generate a
totally bug-free program in BASIC, ready to put to immediate use.

What's more, with The Last One (R), you can change or modify your
programs as often as you wish.  Without effort, fuss, or any
additional cost.  So as your requirements change, your programs can
too.

In fact, it's the end of programming as you know it.

And if, because of the difficulties and costs of buying, writing and
customising software, you've put off purchasing a computer system up
to now, you need delay no longer.

The Last One (R) will be available very soon from better computer
outlets.  To place your order, take this ad into your local dealer and
ask him for further details.  Or in case of difficulty, please write
to us direct.


THE LAST ONE (R)

YOU'LL NEVER NEED BUY ANOTHER PROGRAM.
