  ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SYSTEMS (EMS) ARE BEGINNING TO PROLIFERATE.
NEARLY TWO DOZEN COMMERCIAL MESSAGE SYSTEMS ALREADY  EXIST.   AT
LEAST  TWO PRIVATE MESSAGE SYSTEMS ALREADY CARRY SEVERAL MILLION
MESSAGES ANNUALLY. THERE WILL SOON BE DOZENS OF EMS COMMUNITIES,
EACH  WITH  THOUSANDS  OF  USERS.   HOWEVER,   UNLESS   DRAMATIC
BREAKTHROUGHS  IN  STANDARDS  ARE  MADE  SOON,   EACH  OF  THESE
COMMUNITIES WILL BE ISOLATED,  UNABLE TO EXCHANGE MESSAGES.  THE
AUTHOR DESCRIBES THE MAJOR STANDARDIZATION ISSUES RAISED BY EMS:
MESSAGE   STRUCTURE  STANDARDS;   DELIVERY  STANDARDS;   ADDRESS
IDENTIFICATION STANDARDS;  AND USER  INTERFACE  STANDARDS.   THE
PROBLEM OF HOW TO SET EMS STANDARDS IS ALSO DISCUSSED

  THE PAPER STARTS WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE  PRESENT  SITUATION
OF  THE  TELEGRAPH  ORGANIZATION  IN  THE WORLD.  MANY COUNTRIES
OPERATE THE TELEGRAPH SERVICE ON A FULLY  AUTOMATIC  BASIS,   BY
USING THE GENTEX AND MESSAGE SWITCHING SERVICES.  SOME COUNTRIES
USE FACSIMILE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF MESSAGES.   HOWEVER,   THE
VOLUME  OF  THE  TELEGRAPH  TRAFFIC IS DECLINING.  THE AUTOMATIC
ORGANIZATION OF THE  TELEGRAPH  SERVICE  CAN  BE  USED  FOR  THE
ELECTRONIC  MESSAGE SERVICE,  WHICH IS THE SERVICE OBTAINED WHEN
DOCUMENT FACSIMILE ARE INTERCONNECTED OR  WHEN  TELEPRINTERS  OR
WORD  PROCESSORS  ARE  LINKED  TOGETHER  OR  THROUGH A MAINFRAME
COMPUTER. IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE,  A 'TELETEX'  SERVICE WILL BE
INTRODUCED.   AT  THE  SAME  TIME IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENVISAGE THE
NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF MESSAGES  FROM  TELEX
AND TELETEX SUBSCRIBERS TO MESSAGE SWITCHING CENTRES, WHICH WILL
ACCEPT  THE  MESSAGES  AND ROUTE THEM TO THE POSTAL OR TELEGRAPH
OFFICE NEAREST TO THE ADDRESSEE FOR DELIVERY.  IN  THIS  WAY  AN
ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SERVICE WILL BE STARTED IN MANY COUNTRIES. AT
THE  SAME  TIME  THE  NEW  STANDARD OF FACSIMILE WILL PERMIT THE
EXPANSION OF THE OTHER FORM OF ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SERVICE

  GILT IS THE NAME OF A  COLLABORATIVE  RESEARCH  PROJECT  WHERE
SEVERAL  EUROPEAN INSTITUTES CO-OPERATE IN DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES
AND PROTOCOLS TO INTERCONNECT  COMPUTER  BASED  MESSAGE  SYSTEMS
(CBMS) VIA PUBLIC DATA NETWORKS. GILT PROTOCOLS ARE DEVELOPED IN
ACCORDANCE  WITH  THE  PRINCIPLES OF OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION
(OSI), AND FULL USE IS MADE OF EXISTING RELEVANT STANDARDS:  X25
AND TELETEX. THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF A REAL CBMS ARE EXPRESSED
BY AN ABSTRACT MODEL CALLED AN 'OPEN CBMS' (OCBMS), WHICH IS THE
MANIFESTATION OF THE REAL CBMS WITHIN THE OSI ENVIRONMENT.  GILT
PROTOCOLS ARE SPECIFIED IN TERMS OF OCBMS.  THE GILT  CBMSS  ARE
INTERCONNECTED  IN  AN  'OPEN'   MANNER,   AND EACH CBMS OBTAINS
SERVICES FROM OTHER CBMSS ON BEHALF OF  ITS  LOCAL  USERS.   THE
RESULTS  OF  THE  GILT  WORK  WILL  INCREASE  THE  USEFULNESS OF
EXISTING (BUT ISOLATED) CBMSS, LEAD TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF
THE UPPER 3 OSI LAYERS,  AND DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF  TELETEX  IN
APPLICATIONS MORE GENERAL THAN DOCUMENT TRANSFER

EQUIPMENT OF NORTHERN TELECOM OF CANADA (DUE MID-1982),  TELETEX
IS A HARD COPY TEXT TRANSMISSION SERVICE EXPERIMENTALLY  SET  UP
IN SEPTEMBER 1981 AND DUE TO BE IN GENERAL USE IN 1983, VIDEOTEX
WILL  PERMIT  TEXT  TRANSMISSION  OVER  THE  PUBLIC  NETWORK FOR
DISPLAY ON TELEVISION RECEIVERS (DUE IN 1985)  AND DATEX  300  A
SERVICE  USING  A  SPECIAL  PRINTER AND A DATA TRANSMISSION RATE
FOUR TIMES AS FAST AS THAT OF TELEX,  WILL  BEGIN  OPERATION  IN
1983. SAM, AN AUTOMATIC MESSAGE SYSTEM, AND A PAGING SERVICE ARE
ALREADY AVAILABLE.  TO COPE WITH FUTURE DATA TRAFFIC THE SERVICE
IS LOOKING AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PCM NETWORKS  AND  THE  USE  OF
FIBRE  OPTIC LINKS.  PLANS EXIST TO CONNECT IMPORTANT CENTRES BY
SUCH LINKS WITH A CAPACITY OF 140 MBITS/SEC.  THE INVESTMENT FOR
ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS IS 80 MILLION SWISS FRANCS PER YEAR

  A DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE COMPUTER NETWORK FOR AN  INTEGRATED
FLIGHT  CONTROL  SYSTEM  WAS  DESIGNED  INCORPORATING  A MINIMUM
DIAMETER GRAPH TOPOLOGY AND A NODE CONNECTION  DEGREE  OF  FOUR.
EACH  NODE  OF  THE NETWORK CONTAINS AN INTEL ISBC 86/12A SINGLE
BOARD COMPUTER WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A NODE  PROCESSOR,   AND  FOUR
INTERCOMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS UNITS (ICUS), EACH OF WHICH HAS THE
CAPABILITY  OF  TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING AT A 2 MBIT/SEC RATE.
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT FLEXIBILITY OF THE ICUS, THE NETWORK CAN BE
OPERATED IN A CIRCUIT SWITCHED MODE, A PACKET SWITCHED MODE,  OR
IN  ANY COMBINATION OF THE TWO,  DEPENDING UPON THE NEEDS OF THE
SYSTEM AT THE TIME.  THE  ROUTING  STRATEGIES  APPLIED  TO  THIS
NETWORK  ARE  1)  SHORTEST DISTANCE,  2)  SHORTEST DISTANCE WITH
PRIORITY, AND 3)  SHORTEST TIME.  THE SPEED OF AN ALGORITHM IS A
DECISIVE  FACTOR  BECAUSE A MESSAGE PACKET HAS ONLY 10 MSEC WITH
WHICH IT MUST TRAVERSE THE NETWORK TO ARRIVE AT ITS DESTINATION.
VARIOUS ROUTING  ALGORITHMS  ARE  CURRENTLY  BEING  STUDIED  FOR
IMPLEMENTATION ON ETWORK

  ONE OF THE  INHERENT  COMPLEXITIES  ASSOCIATED  WITH  QUEUEING
MODELS FOR STORE AND FORWARD DATA COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS ARISES
FROM  THE  FACT THAT MESSAGES TYPICALLY PRESERVE THEIR LENGTH AS
THEY TRAVERSE THE SYSTEM. THE INTERARRIVAL AND SERVICE SEQUENCES
AT QUEUES INTERNAL TO THE NETWORK ARE  THUS  DEPENDENT,   MAKING
STANDARD METHODS OF ANALYSIS REALISTICALLY INAPPROPRIATE (EXCEPT
IN  AN  APPROXIMATE  SENSE).   IN  AN  EFFORT TO FIND METHODS OF
DEALING WITH SUCH NONSTANDARD QUEUEING  SYSTEMS,   A  MODEL  FOR
SPARSELY  CONNECTED  NETWORKS  (OR  NETWORK  SEGMENTS)  CALLED A
MESSAGE CHANNEL HAS BEEN STUDIED.  A MESSAGE CHANNEL IS  DEFINED
AS  A  TANDEM  CONNECTION  OF  SINGLE SERVER QUEUES IN WHICH THE
SUCCESSIVE SERVICE TIMES EXPERIENCED BY ANY PARTICULAR  CUSTOMER
ARE  SCALED  VERSIONS  OF THE SAME RANDOM VARIABLE.  A NUMBER OF

  THIS  PAPER DESCRIBES THE FUNDAMENTALS AND SOME OF THE DETAILS
OF TASK COMMUNICATION IN DEMOS,  THE OPERATING  SYSTEM  FOR  THE
CRAY-1  COMPUTER  BEING  DEVELOPED  AT THE LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIFIC
LABORATORY. THE COMMUNICATION MECHANISM IS A MESSAGE SYSTEM WITH
SEVERAL NOVEL FEATURES.  MESSAGES ARE  SENT  FROM  ONE  TASK  TO
ANOTHER  OVER LINKS.  LINKS ARE THE PRIMARY PROTECTED OBJECTS IN
THE SYSTEM;  THEY PROVIDE BOTH MESSAGE PATHS AND  OPTIONAL  DATA

  SINCE THE INVENTION OF TELEGRAPHY,  AND ESPECIALLY  IN  RECENT
YEARS,   THERE  HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN TECHNIQUES
FOR WRITTEN TELECOMMUNICATION.  NEW  SERVICES  WITH  NEW  NAMES,
GROUPED  UNDER  THE  GENERIC  HEADING OF 'ELECTRONIC MAIL',  ARE
GRADUALLY  INVADING  THE  WORLD  OF  BUSINESS.   AFTER   BRIEFLY
EXAMINING  THE  NEEDS  THAT  MUST BE SATISFIED BY SUCH SERVICES,
THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN STANDARDIZED AT THE

  ALONG WITH THE ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC ELECTRONIC
MAIL  SYSTEMS  IN MANY COUNTRIES,  INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC MAIL
SYSTEMS ARE ALSO BEING INTRODUCED.  AN INTERNATIONAL APPROACH TO
ELECTRONIC  MAIL  IS  PARTICULARLY  ATTRACTIVE  BECAUSE  OF  THE
GENERALLY LONGER DISTANCES, TIME ZONE DIFFERENCES AND ASSOCIATED
TIME AND COST FACTORS INVOLVED. ON THE OTHER HAND, INTERNATIONAL
APPLICATION OF ELECTRONIC MAIL MAKES  IT  IMPORTANT  TO  ACHIEVE
INTERNATIONAL  STANDARDIZATION  OF THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL
FEATURES OF THESE SYSTEMS. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS AN EASY TASK.  THE
INTERNATIONAL  TELEGRAPH  AND  TELEPHONE  CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE
(CCITT)  HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN THIS  FIELD  IN  RECENT

  ELECTRONIC MESSAGE SYSTEMS (EMS) ARE BEGINNING TO PROLIFERATE.
NEARLY TWO DOZEN COMMERCIAL MESSAGE SYSTEMS ALREADY  EXIST.   AT
LEAST  TWO PRIVATE MESSAGE SYSTEMS ALREADY CARRY SEVERAL MILLION
MESSAGES ANNUALLY. THERE WILL SOON BE DOZENS OF EMS COMMUNITIES,
EACH  WITH  THOUSANDS  OF  USERS.   HOWEVER,   UNLESS   DRAMATIC
BREAKTHROUGHS  IN  STANDARDS  ARE  MADE  SOON,   EACH  OF  THESE
COMMUNITIES WILL BE ISOLATED,  UNABLE TO EXCHANGE MESSAGES.  THE

  THERE ARE  SEVERAL  EXPERIMENTS  UNDERWAY  WHICH  SPECIFICALLY
ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF SENDING MAIL BETWEEN DIFFERENT NETWORKS.
ONE  OF  THESE,   THE  MULTI-CHANNEL  MEMO DISTRIBUTION FACILITY
(MMDF), IS OPERATIONAL AT SEVERAL SITES INCLUDING THE UNIVERSITY
OF DELAWARE WHERE IT FORMS  THE  BASIS  OF  THE  CSNET  PHONENET
CAPABILITY.   THE  EXPERIMENT  IS  BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT
USER'S  MAIL  WILL   NEED   TO   TRAVERSE   MANY   HETEROGENEOUS
ENVIRONMENTS.   IDEALLY,   THE  TRANSPORTATION OF THESE MESSAGES
SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT TO THE USER.  NETWORKS WILL COME  IN  MANY
FORMS.   IN  ADDITION,  IT MUST BE POSSIBLE TO SEND MAIL THROUGH
EXISTING POSTAL  SYSTEMS  AND  THROUGH  TELEX/TWX  AND  TELEGRAM
SERVICES. IT IS STILL THE CASE, THOUGH, THAT THE MOST ACCESSIBLE
OF  ALL  THE COMMUNICATION MEDIA IS THE TELEPHONE NETWORK.  MMDF
TRANSMITS   AND   RECEIVES   MESSAGES   OVER   CHANNELS,    I.E.
COMMUNICATIONS MEDIA.  FOR EACH CHANNEL,  THERE EXISTS A LIST OF
HOSTS ON THAT MEDIUM, AND A QUEUE OF MESSAGES TO BE SENT ON THAT
CHANNEL

  THIS  PAPER  DESCRIBES   AN   APPROACH   TO   ACHIEVING   MAIL
CONNECTIVITY  BETWEEN  NON-COOPERATING  MAIL  SYSTEMS  WHICH ARE
INCOMPATIBLE AND DO NOT NECESSARILY SHARE COMMON CONVENTIONS  OR
PROTOCOLS.   THIS  APPROACH  ASSUMES  ONLY THE EXISTENCE OF HOST
COMPUTERS WHICH HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN  ONE  MAIL  SYSTEM  AND
THAT  EACH  MAIL SYSTEM HAS SOME ADDRESSING SCHEME.  THESE HOSTS
PLAY THE ROLE OF 'MAIL-GATEWAYS' WHICH ARE INTERNETWORK GATEWAYS
DEDICATED ONLY TO THE SUPPORT OF MAIL EXCHANGE.  THE PROBLEM  IS
DESCRIBED    FIRST    IN   GENERAL,    THEN   SEVERAL   SPECIFIC
IMPLEMENTATIONS  ARE  DESCRIBED  FOR  SCENARIOS  WITH  DIFFERENT
DEGREES OF COOPERATION AMONG THE VARIOUS MAIL SYSTEMS. THE PAPER

  THIS  PAPER  DESCRIBES   AN   APPROACH   TO   ACHIEVING   MAIL
CONNECTIVITY  BETWEEN  NON-COOPERATING  MAIL  SYSTEMS  WHICH ARE
INCOMPATIBLE AND DO NOT  NECESSARILY  SHARE  COMMON  CONVENTIONS
(E.G.   PROTOCOLS).  THIS APPROACH ASSUMES ONLY THE EXISTENCE OF
HOST COMPUTERS WHICH HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN  ONE  MAIL  SYSTEM
AND  THAT  EACH  MAIL  SYSTEM HAS SOME ADDRESSING SCHEME.  THESE
HOSTS PLAY THE ROLE OF 'MAIL-GATEWAYS'  WHICH  ARE  INTERNETWORK
GATEWAYS  DEDICATED  ONLY  TO THE SUPPORT OF MAIL EXCHANGE.  THE
PROBLEM IS DESCRIBED FIRST IN GENERAL,   THEN  SEVERAL  SPECIFIC
IMPLEMENTATIONS  ARE  DESCRIBED  FOR  SCENARIOS  WITH  DIFFERENT
DEGREES OF COOPERATION AMONG THE VARIOUS MAIL SYSTEMS. THE PAPER
ALSO  INCLUDES  A  CRITIQUE  OF  THE  DESCRIBED   IMPLEMENTATION
STRATEGIES. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM FROM
A  MORE  GENERALIZED  POINT  OF  VIEW  WHICH  LEADS  TO  SEVERAL
CONCLUSIONS

  MESSAGE SYSTEMS SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES BUT  DO  NOT  MANAGE
THE  INFORMATION  THE  MESSAGES  CONTAIN.   DATABASE  MANAGEMENT
SYSTEMS MANAGE THE INFORMATION OF A GLOBAL DATABASE BUT  DO  NOT
HAVE  A  NOTION OF ADDRESS.  IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHORS OUTLINE A
PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH  INTEGRATES  THE  FACILITIES  OF  MESSAGE
SYSTEMS  AND  DATABASE  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEMS.  THE SYSTEM MANAGES
STRUCTURED MESSAGES ACCORDING TO THEIR CONTENTS.   THE  MESSAGES
CAN BE STORED WITHIN A STATION AND TRANSFERRED BETWEEN STATIONS.
INFORMATION  PRESENT  IN  THE  MESSAGES  CAN  BE  QUERIED  IN  A
DISTRIBUTED MANNER.  MESSAGE STRUCTURE CAN ALSO BE EXPLOITED  BY
AUTOMATIC  PROCEDURES  WHICH RECOGNIZE TRIGGERING CONDITIONS AND
PERFORM USER SPECIFIED ACTIONS

  IN A COMPUTER-BASED MAIL ENVIRONMENT,  DIGITAL  ADDRESSES  ARE
SUFFICIENT  TO  ALLOW  THE MAIL SYSTEM TO PERFORM FORWARDING AND
DELIVERY.  HOWEVER,  DIGITAL ADDRESSES ARE NOT EASILY REMEMBERED
BY  PEOPLE  AND  SOME OF THE INTELLIGENCE INHERENT IN THE SYSTEM
MUST BE USED TO PROVIDE A  MORE  HUMANLY  ENGINEERED  ADDRESSING
SCHEME.  THIS PAPER PROPOSES A TWO-STAGE APPROACH.  IN THE FIRST
STAGE,  A SET OF ATTRIBUTES IS MAPPED INTO AN  IDENTIFIER  WHICH
DESIGNATES A SINGLE ORIGINATOR OR RECIPIENT (O/R) OF MAIL.  THIS
MAPPING IS PERFORMED VIA A DATABASE QUERY DIALOG AND IS EXECUTED
PRIOR TO THE  POSTING  OF  A  MAIL  ITEM.   THE  O/R  IDENTIFIER
DESIGNATES  AN  O/R INVARIANT TO ITS CURRENT LOCATION AND IS THE
PRIMARY INFORMATION BY WHICH THE MAIL  SYSTEM  DECIDES  TO  WHOM
MAIL  MUST  BE DELIVERED.  IN THE SECOND STAGE,  THE MAIL SYSTEM
CONVERTS THE O/R IDENTIFIER INTO AN ADDRESS WHICH IS  THEN  USED
BY  THE  MAIL  SYSTEM  FOR  FORWARDING  AND DELIVERY.  THE PAPER
DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  A  HIERARCHY  OF  AUTHORITY
DOMAINS AND THE ATTRIBUTES AND IDENTIFIERS. IT ALSO ANALYZES THE
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH UPDATING THE DATABASES THAT SUPPORT THE
TWO MAPPING FUNCTIONS.  IN ADDITION,  METHODS ARE DEVELOPED THAT
ALLOW THE MAIL SYSTEM TO DELIVER MAIL ITEMS CORRECTLY EVEN UNDER
THE ASSUMPTION THAT NOT ALL DATABASES INVOLVED CONTAIN  ACCURATE
INFORMATION

  IN  THIS  PAPER  THE  AUTHORS  PRESENT  AN  OVERVIEW   OF   AN
ARCHITECTURAL   MODEL  FOR  LARGE,   DISTRIBUTED  COMPUTER-BASED
MESSAGE SYSTEMS.  THIS MODEL SPECIFIES (1)  THE ORGANIZATION  OF
MESSAGE  SYSTEMS  IN  TERMS  OF  FUNCTIONAL  ENTITIES;  (2)  THE
OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM; (3) THE PROTOCOLS AND INTERFACES NEEDED
FOR INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION; AND (4)  THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
DIRECTORY   SYSTEM  USED  TO  SUPPORT  IDENTIFICATION  SERVICES.
GENERAL   ARCHITECTURAL   CONSIDERATIONS    RELATED    TO    THE
COMMUNICATIONS  PROTOCOLS FOR COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SYSTEMS ARE
PRESENTED;  THESE FOLLOW THE GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF THE ISO  MODEL
FOR OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION.  THE ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION
OF THE  DIRECTORY  SYSTEM  ARE  DISCUSSED  IN  DETAIL.   SPECIAL
EMPHASIS  IS  GIVEN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFICATION SERVICES
IN INTERNATIONAL AND INTERCONNECTED MESSAGE SYSTEMS

  A TECHNIQUE BASED ON PUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY IS PRESENTED THAT
ALLOWS  AN  ELECTRONIC  MAIL  SYSTEM  TO  HIDE WHO A PARTICIPANT
COMMUNICATES WITH AS WELL AS THE CONTENT OF THE COMMUNICATION-IN
SPITE OF AN UNSECURED UNDERYLING TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM.   THE
TECHNIQUE DOES NOT REQUIRE A UNIVERSALLY TRUSTED AUTHORITY.  ONE
CORRESPONDENT CAN REMAIN ANONYMOUS TO A SECOND,  WHILE  ALLOWING
THE  SECOND  TO  RESPOND VIA AN UNTRACEABLE RETURN ADDRESS.  THE
TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO  BE  USED  TO  FORM  ROSTERS  OF  UNTRACEABLE
DIGITAL PSEUDONYMS FROM SELECTED APPLICATIONS. APPLICANTS RETAIN
THE  EXCLUSIVE  ABILITY TO FORM DIGITAL SIGNATURES CORRESPONDING
TO THEIR PSEUDONYMS. ELECTRONS IN WHICH ANY INTERESTED PARTY CAN
VERIFY THAT THE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN PROPERLY COUNTED ARE  POSSIBLE
IF  ANONYMOUSLY MAILED BALLOTS ARE SIGNED WITH PSEUDONYMS FROM A
ROSTER OF REGISTERED VOTERS. ANOTHER USE ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO
CORRESPOND WITH A RECORD-KEEPING  ORGANIZATION  UNDER  A  UNIQUE
PSEUDONYM WHICH APPEARS IN A ROSTER OF ACCEPTABLE CLIENTS

  COMPUTER  MAIL  SYSTEMS  OFFER   SPEED,    CONVENIENCE,    AND
FLEXIBILITY  FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF TEXT MESSAGES.  SIMPLE MAIL
SYSTEMS ARE IMPLEMENTED ENTIRELY WITHIN THE  FILE  SYSTEM  OF  A
HOST COMPUTER.  AS COMPUTER NETWORKS BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND
MORE INTERCONNECTED,   THE  COMPLEXITY  OF  THE  ADDRESSING  AND
DELIVERY MECHANISMS IS INCREASED. A TUTORIAL ON THE STRUCTURE OF
VARIOUS  KINDS  OF  MAIL  SYSTEMS  OF  INCREASING  COMPLEXITY IS
FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF VARIOUS SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF
ADDRESSING,  ADDRESS DISTRIBUTION,  ADDRESS CHANGING,  DELIVERY,

  ELECTRONIC MAIL WILL BE POSTED VIA ELECTRONIC  INPUT  DEVICES,
SCANNED  AND  TRANSMITTED TO LOCAL STORAGE AND PROCESSING UNITS.
IN LOW TRAFFIC HOURS, PREFERABLY AT NIGHT, THE ELECTRONIC IMAGES
OF  THE  MAIL  WILL  BE  TRANSMITTED  VIA  THE  PUBLIC  SWITCHED
TELEPHONE NETWORK TO THE DESTINATIONS. ONE PART OF THE MAIL WILL
BE   TRANSFERRED   DIRECTLY   TO  RECEIVING  UNITS  AT  BUSINESS
ORGANIZATIONS,  USING A CODED ADDRESS.  THE OTHER PART  WILL  BE
REPRODUCED  IN  DELIVERY  POST  OFFICES  AND,   AFTER  AUTOMATIC
ENVELOPING, DELIVERED LIKE CONVENTIONAL LETTER POST.  THE DESIGN
OF  A  PUBLIC  INPUT  DEVICE  (ELECTRONIC  MAIL  BOX)   FOR  THE
ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED AND PARTICULAR ATTENTION  IS
PAID   TO   HUMAN  FACTORS.   AS  A  RESULT,   THE  SOLUTION  IS
CHARACTERIZED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS:  A COMPLETELY NEW DESIGN
ENABLES  THE  USER  TO  POST  HIS LETTER EASILY FOR SCANNING AND
TRANSFER,   A  WELL  DESIGNED  METHOD  OF  SIGNALLING  THE  NEXT
OPERATION  STEP MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO OPERATE THE DEVICE FAST AND
WITH A LOW ERROR RATE,  AND INFORMATION  FEEDBACK  CONFIRMS  THE
CORRECT EXECUTION OF EACH OPERATION STEP. AS A CONSEQUENCE,  THE
DEVICE CAN DO WITHOUT OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS IN  A  CONVENTIONAL
SENSE.   THE  PAPER REPORTS ON A USER TEST WHICH SHOWED THAT THE
AVERAGE OPERATION TIME TENDS TO BE LESS THAN  45  S  PER  LETTER
AFTER USERS HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE DEVICE. THE ERROR RATE
WAS  LOW.   IN  A QUESTIONNAIRE MORE THAN 90PERCENT  OF ALL TEST
PARTICIPANTS CHARACTERIZED THE BOX AS SIMPLE TO HANDLE
