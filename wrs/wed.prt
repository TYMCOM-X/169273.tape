Subject: transit field in login string 

Dennis, Bill:

I realize that this is rather late in the game for revisions, but I was
wondering if there was any compelling reason (e.g., CCITT compatiblity)
for having a transit field per se in the login string.  It seems to me
that this has several drawbacks.  Consider the login string:

	JSMITH=2000:-3000(408)446-6000

The Sup cares about the syntax in the destination field only when there
is no transit field (i.e., when the Sup actually targets to the
specified destination).  The syntax diagram reflects this.  However,
when there is a transit field, the Sup merely passes the destination
field on to the next network.  The next network might not accept this
syntax (with dashes, parens, etc.)  or our syntax might be too
restrictive.  In short, it does not make sense to impose Tymnet syntax
on a field which is interpreted elsewhere.
	  
You might argue that the destination field syntax should not be checked
whenever there is a transit field.  But this is very confusing and makes
the syntax diagram misleading.  You might also argue that the user
should use the extension field when he wants to pass an arbitrary
string.  But then why have the transit field at all?  Why not always
force data for other networks to be put in the extension field?

Another drawback is that the transit field horribly confuses
terminology.  It has been customary to use the term "destination" to
refer to a host within the Sup's network.  And other terms are naturally
spawned off - destination name (as opposed to a username), destination
host list, etc.  But these can be easily confused with the items in the
destination field of the login string.  In my ADRII GED (New
Addressing), I end up using awkward terms such as "local destination
specification" to refer to the specification relevant to Sup targetting
(i.e., the transit field if present, else the destination field).  I
admit this latter problem seems very minor, but I think we should not
underestimate the confusion that can be caused by poor terminology.

In light of this, I suggest that we drop the transit field entirely
and simply tell our customers to use the extension field.  We may
eventually provide a syntax chart for extensions which are passed to
Tymnet-technology networks.  But we should emphasize that the contents
of the field should be a function of the neighboring network, not the
current one.

Please give me your thoughts on this matter.  If we must conform to
international standards, perhaps we can do so in a better way.

P.S.  Bill... have you thought about the priority stop issue?

SUBJ:  RODNEY Review, Your OnTyme #I12869 (Appended)


Thanks for your OnTyme.  I appreciate the need for thorough, 
timely review input on key development documents by all relevant 
organizations.  That's why I got verbal approval from Jeff last 
week and sent a followup OnTyme requesting he make it formal by 
sending you a message.  Inasmuch as you have not yet received the 
message, NTD should consider the document approved - both because 
that's our agreed "default," and also because of the verbal 
approval Jeff conveyed.

I am, however, aware of comments on the document by Mary Arnett 
and her team.  These were expressed in #M76775, sent March 19.  
In case you did not receive the comments, I am resending them 
separately.  I am unaware of any other comments from anyone, and 
it is Jeff's job to get any such comments to you.

To avoid any future problems in the review/approval area, I 
intend to get the reviewers/approvers clearly defined by document 
as a result of the program planning meeting April 1, and 
following.  As input to that, will you please prepare a list of 
documents for which external approval is required, plus their 
associated planned release dates, and bring 20 copies to the 
meeting.  Thanks, Ken!

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
As of  this morning,  I have still not received any comments from
your  organization  regarding  Rodney.     I   can  only  assume,
therefore,  that  none  are  forth  coming.  At this point, if we
receive   any   substantive   request   to   change   the  Rodney
specification, it is likely that it could be accommodated only by
slipping the schedule.  
 
Thanks...Ken

                      RODNEY ARCHITECTURAL SPECIFICATIONS REVIEW
                                         from
                              QSATS Skywalker Test Team


    The following is a list of the Skywalker Test Team's concerns, 
    questions and recommendations for your consideration.  Alterna-
    tives and/or implementation ideas presented here are given to 
    share with you some of our thoughts.


    FILE SYSTEM

    File system protection

    If the client has write access to the handle it seems that he can 
    access any disk file, thus presenting a security risk, as well as 
    being able to modify or corrupt files.

    Questions:  How much information is in the file handle?  In which 
    address space is the file handle resident?  What protection does 
    the handle have?  Can access be gained to something else by manip-
    ulating the file handle?  Are there any file system attributes?  
    Where?  What could modify it?

    Recovery of disk space on client crash:  How is this accomplished?


    BUS-DRIVER FAILURES

    Failed drivers asserting (disabling/negating) VMEbus signals.

    Question:  Is there protection from this possibility?


    DISTRIBUTED DISPATCHER

    Buffering limitations

    Existing MP dispatcher may NOT be the best model for a Skywalker 
    dispatcher due to buffering limitations.  MP dispatcher implements 
    in S/W the Engine bufferlet scheme and is limited to only 32K.  
    Both are thought to be inadequate due to processor/throughput 
    demands.

    A possible alternative might be Ring-lets (circular buffers with 
    chaining capabilities), and buffer space whose size is dependent 
    upon the system configuration, i.e. max. port no., max. users, 
    etc.

    A second alternative might be to take advantage of the 68000 
    processor series "loop mode" for messaPotential


    IPCF

    Potential for a late processor reading the wrong message.

    Once the recipient has modified it's translation descriptor tree, 
    the sender has no control over the receiver's access and should 
    not free memory until ALL recipients have read the message.  A 
    possible alternative to a timeout to free memory might be to count 
    the number of rings in which we place a pointer to a message.  The 
    recipient can be allowed to lock and decrement the count field.  
    (CAS can be used for decrementing.)

    Message solicitation

    IPCF comments imply that some process (OS?) must "poll" to see if 
    messages are present.  Why not include this in periodic operating 
    system processing, such as the scheduler?  Mail-box interrupts 
    would be an even better solution.  We are assuming that an opera-
    ting system "relays" messages to certain tasks.

    If a write process times out before successfully sending a message 
    and the recipient has no knowledge of who the sender was, can the 
    message get lost?  Does the sender have any way of knowing he was 
    unsuccessful in sending the message?  A sender should know enough 
    to retry.

    Overhead

    When messages are sent, enough address information must be sent to 
    allow the receiver to add the message pointer to his logical 
    address space; therefore we have to add or modify and later remove 
    part of the translation descriptor tree for each message.

    A possible alternative would be to pass the physical address of 
    the message and VME base.  We could pass the physical address of 
    the page descriptor for the buffer and add this to the receiver's 
    descriptor tree (68851 INDIRECTION), allowing the sender some 
    later access control.

    Another possibility might be to use small pages and define the 
    message as a set of contiguous pages resulting in the need to only 
    pass the page descriptor address.  This would allow the recipient 
    processor to "allocate" a local buffer with correct mapping.  No 
    second IPCF mapping would be necessary.

    Questions:  Can multiple processes on a single processor use IPCF, 
    or do we have a "single handler"?  Is there any way to trace the 
    sender of a message?  (This could be very important for debugging 
    purposes.)


    MMU

    Concurrence Problems

    It is unclear if both RODNEY and the Operating System maintain the 
    translation tables.  If both do, what protection do we have that 
    concurrence problems do not result in mapping to an incorrect 
    address.


    I/O COMMUNICATION

    Definition of access to another CP's memory

    Questions:  Is this a DMA?  Do we have a VMEbus DMA protocol 
    controller?  Do we have to pass MMU access information and manip-
    ulate MMU's?  Can one CP access another CP's buffers?


    VMEbus

    Lack of 32 bit operations across the VMEbus requires 32 bit trans-
    fers to be executed as two 16 bit operations.  A later 32 bit 
    upgrade may involve software changes to take advantage of 32 bit 
    atomic R/W operations.  Dual ported RAM for the VMEbus seems to 
    imply no need to limit ourselves to only 16 bit displacements on 
    the bus, since the bus interface could handle the difference.


    SYSTEM LOGS

    Page 34 offers a choice of initials or username.  Username should 
    be used to avoid ambiguity, and to aid in debugging.

    Logger information will be written to the disk when the log buffer 
    fills up.  There should be a timer added to update the disk 
    periodically, even if no events are written into the log buffer.

    The boot code should ALWAYS write out the last current log buffer 
    to the disk in the event of a card failure.

    Record the initial relative time stamp at system bring up, as well 
    as the last relative time stamp before UTC is recorded.


    SECURE UID

    Non-socketed EEPROM

    It should be impossible to erase certain information on the 
    EEPROM, namely the Manufacturers serial number, the H/W model 
    number, and the PC board art work version.

    Nonerasable information can be stored into the high address field 
    of the EEPROM prior to installation on the individual cards.  The 
    PC board can then provide only traces to the lower order address 
    lines, allowing future upgrades to be input.  If it is desirable 
    to install the EEPROM prior to wave soldering the populated board, 
    then a fixture can simply be provided at the point of assembly 
    and/or the depot for repairs to allow writes to the entire address 
    field initially.  When removed again only the lower addresses will 
    be able to be rewritten.


    DEBUG

    Page tables

    The debug facility should have access to the page table areas.  
    This would be very useful for tracking and identifying bus errors.

    Debugger Output to TTY problem

    Output to the TTY port appears to be the same as in the original 
    XRAY design.  Past experience has shown this can create a problem 
    due to the slow baud rate,i.e. 300 baud, and the need for very 
    careful buffering.


    BACKUP

    We would like to emphasize that failure information MUST be logged 
    before reinitialization.

    We are concerned about the Single Point of Failure with the 
    arbiter and possibly the IOCP, depending upon the design.


    BOOTSTRAPPING

    3 second window

    We feel that the 3 second window may not be enough time to allow a 
    DLL BOOT command in to change the load file name, if the system 
    used is very busy.

BILL

I STILL NEED TO GET FEEDBACK FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED
WITH THE TEXT GATHERING SIDE
OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO START WITH,
SO I MIGHT AS WELL PASS THEM ALONG NOW.

IS IT POSSIBLE TO SET SOMETHING IN THE INIT FILE FOR INFORMATION TO ALLOW
THE ^S AND ^Q TEXT SCROLLING FUNCTIONS TO BE OPERATIONAL WITHOUT THE
^R AT LOGIN?  

THE MODIFIED MENU PROGRAM WHICH WILL BE USED FOR THE NEW 
INFORMATION SYSTEM CURRENTLY RESIDES IN THE USERNAME DDD:38 AND IS
CALLED INFO2.FTF.  THE MAIN CHANGES MADE TO THE PROGRAM ARE AS FOLLOWS:

THE HELP MENU CAN NOW BE CALLED FROM ANY LEVEL AT THE "YOUR SELECTION"
PROMPT.

THE ESC KEY IS SET TO BREAK LONG LISTINGS, INSTEAD OF LOG OUT THE USER.
IT IS NOW BASICALLY THE EQUIVALENT OF THE "UP" COMMAND.  

AN ONLINE ORDERING SYSTEM FOR THE "ELECTRONIC UNIVERSITY NETWORK"
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS CURRENTLY BEING HANDLED BY
GENERATING A RANDOM OUTPUT FILE WHICH APPENDS RAW ORDERS TO A FILE
CALLED "ORDERFIL".  

THE LOAD FILE FOR THE INFO2.FTF PROGRAM PLUS SUBROUTINE FILES AND
LIBRARY IS CALLED MENU3.LOD.

I NEED THE ABOVE PROGRAM PLUS NUMEROUS TEXT FILES INSTALLED IN
INFORMATION:38 AND INFORMATION:74.  I CAN EITHER GIVE YOU A
LIST OF THE TEXT FILES, OR PERHAPS COPY THEM OVER MYSELF, DEPENDING
ON WHAT WOULD BE EASIEST FOR YOU.

I WOULD LIKE TO DEPLOY THE NEW SYSTEM SOMETIME DURING THE EVENING OF
4/2.

I AM NOT IN ANY WAY ADVERSE TO BEING CALLED AT HOME IN THE EVENING.
I HAVE A 444 AT HOME, SO I CAN COPY FILES, ETC.
FROM HOME.
MY HOME NUMBER IS (415)490-6278
WORK NUMBER IS (408)432-5024

THANKS,
