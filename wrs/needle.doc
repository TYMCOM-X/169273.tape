         subject: Proposal for New Nee-
                  dle and Circuit Re-          from: Bill Soley
                  quest Message Formats

          _________________________________________________________________


          This proposal addresses the requirements of the (UUN) National
          Numbering Plan for _T_e_l_e_v_e_r_k_e_t, the Proxy Login capability for
          X.PC, the Menu Server and the MUX, the elimination of cleartext
          password traffic within the network, expansion of host number
          fields (32 bit host numbers), and other future requirements.

          The SNI string is designed to allow optional, variable length
          data items to be incorporated into messages.  Emphasis has been
          placed on expandability and ease of migration.  An SNI list con-
          sists of multiple SNI logical records, terminated with a termina-
          tion SNI (_F_C).  The SNI logical record format is determined from
          the last two bits of the first (possibly only) byte.  As seen
          below, SNI type 0 carries no data field; type 1 and 2 are fol-
          lowed by a halfword or fullword of data, respectively; and type 3
          is followed by a byte count and up to 255 bytes of data.

          The messages to request a circuit will be replaced by one circuit
          request message.  SNIs will be used to specify additional infor-
          mation in the request.  The Originating Host (_1_0) SNI will speci-
          fy the host number making the request.  IIX Dialect SNI (_1_4) will
          be present if the circuit would like to use IIX.  Finally, Login
          Characters SNI (_1_8) will carry the accumulated login string.

          The last free bit in the flag word of the needle message will be
          used to indicate an extended needle format.  The extended needle
          will have a SNI list following the USER data.  Although some of
          the old needle fields should be contained in SNIs, this will not
          be done for compatability reasons.

          Examples

          The circuit request message (type _0_C) replaces the present aux
          circuit request (type _1_0), new login request with TID and string
          (type _0_F), and login string continuation (type _0_E).  During the
          transition period, the supervisor will continue to honor the old
          requests.  Some of the fields in the old messages have been re-
          placed with SNIs, in particular HOST and IIX.  To specify an ori-
          ginating host number in a circuit request, an SNI is placed in
          the SNI list of the form:



                 _____________________________
                |   _1_9    | HOST # (halfword)|
                |__________|___________________|

          Since SNI formats 1 and 2 are interchangeable, a host number
          which exceeds 16 bits may be specified in an SNI of the form:



                 __________________________________________
                |   _1_A    |         HOST # (word)         |
                |__________|________________________________|

          If the originator is requesting a circuit with IIX dialect en-
          abled, it would include an SNI in the circuit request of the
          form:



                 _________
                |   _2_0   |
                |_________|

          Finally, if the requester needs to know the UUN from the circuit,
          it would include an SNI in the circuit request of the form:



                 _________
                |   _0_8   |
                |_________|








                                        - 5 -



          The revision to the needle message (type _0_9) allows the supervi-
          sor to supply SNIs to the requesting host and the destination
          host.  A needle containing such supplemental information will
          have the _4_0_0_0 bit set in the FLAGS halfword indicating that an
          SNI list appears at the end of the needle.  In the case of the
          supervisor sending a UUN to the requestor, it would include an
          SNI in the needle of the form:



                 ___________________________
                |   _0_9    | UUN (halfword) |
                |__________|_________________|

          Note that as with originating HOST number, should the UUN field
          ever exceed 16 bits, it may easily be expanded without any
          changes to the needle format by using a type 2 (word) SNI.
