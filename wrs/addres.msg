Bill -

I'd like to thank you again for lunch , it really helped, and I also
told mom that Becky tried to have me over for dinner, but between me
not checking my messages regularly, and going to Minden Friday afternoon,
it didn't work out.

Here is my new address, phone number, etc. that will hopefully
last for a while:

           550 Tyndall St. #8
           Los Altos, CA  94022
           415-941-0659

It's right near where Scott lives (still lives?)

Becky also mention something about having someone stop over.  That sounds
good but I'd like to settle in the place and finish unpacking so that
it looks respectable!

- Melissa
