ILLUSTRATIVE RISKS TO THE PUBLIC IN THE USE OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND RELATED 
TECHNOLOGY

Compiled by Peter G. Neumann (1 November 1986), Chmn ACM Committee on Computers
and Public Policy

A compendium of all of the following cases is in preparation, anthologizing 
back issues of ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes [SEN], references to 
which are cited below as (SEN vol no); e.g., (SEN 11 5) is October 1986, one 
vol per year, quarterly (plus an occasional special issue).  Some incidents are
well documented, others need further study.  Please send corrections, 
additions, and refs to PGNeumann, SRI International, BN168, Menlo Park CA
