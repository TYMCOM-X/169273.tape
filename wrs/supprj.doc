Node 64 bug

Problem arises from race condition with Tymnet-I base building
an aux circuit.  Node 64 (in Paris) seems to be most likely to
have this happen.  Interim solution appears to be to increase
timeout.  Long term solution is to eliminate Tymnet-I.  [1

Network analysis tools:

Design and implement performance analysis tools to allow
network to be better managed.  This includes work on ANSI
X3.102 standard.  C. Holmberg had shown me one of tools to
measure the performance of SYNC engine.  [3 months]

Release 41 to (SOURCE)

The source code for SUP 41 are already in CCDA.  Some
modifications might be needed before release.  Documentation
needs to be filled in and checked.  [1 week]

Revise MUD formats

Tony has some documents for new MUD formats.  Recent
considerations need to be incorporated into plan, such as
value added passthroughs.  Port addressing, host names (32 bit
host numbers).  [3 months]

Origin only hosts

Implement ability for host to declare itself origin only or
destination only in order to restrict circuits.  The message
formats between SUP & Node have already been approved from
Node-Code Unit. [1 month (SUP side only)]
