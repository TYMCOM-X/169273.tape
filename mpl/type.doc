                               Abstract

               This program allows files  or  parts  of
               files to be listed on a TTY or any other
               device.   The  monitor  TYPE  and   LIST
               commands  can  be  processed directly by
               TYPE.  TYPE is upwardly compatible  with
               the   current   TYPE  and  LIST  command
               processing, but in  addition  it  allows
               full  wild-carding  and command scanning
               by using SCAN and WILD.

1.0  GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.1  Introduction

     TYPE is designed to greatly enhance the file listing capabilities
currently  available  through COMPIL/PIP.  It uses SCAN to provide the
DEC standard command line processing  and  indirect  and  option  file
processing.   TYPE  uses  "TYPE"  as it's identifier in the SWITCH.INI
option file and it uses "TYP" as it's default CCL  TMPCOR  file  name.
WILD  is  used  for full level-D disk wild-carded lookups.  Facilities
are provided for listing sections of a file and controlling the format
of the generated output.



1.2  Command String Format

     TYPE uses a standard command string which may  contain  1  output
file  specification  and any number of input file specifications.  The
format of the specification is:

     Output-spec/oswitches=/gswitches Input-specs/iswitches

/oswitches are a list of switches which pertain  to  the  output  file
specification.   If  no output file specification is given the default
is "TTY:<first input name>.LST".  If the  first  input  file  name  is
missing  or  wildcarded,  the name "TYPE" is used.  If any part of the
output file specification is given, the default  used  is  "DSK:<first
input  name>.LST[-]".   If  no  output file specification is used, the
equal sign may be dropped.  /gswitches are a list of  global  switches
that  pertain to all input file specifications.  /iswitches are a list
of switches pertaining to the preceding file  specification  and  they
override any global switches which may have been set for this command.
Any number of input file specifications  may  be  given  separated  by
commas or a SCAN logical connective (i.e.  'OR', 'AND').



1.3  Monitor Command Interface

     TYPE is setup to process  both  the  "TYPE"  and  "LIST"  monitor
commands.  On the TYPE command, the defaults are the same as when TYPE
is  run  directly.   On  a  LIST  command,  the  default  output  file
specification  is  changed  to  "LPT:<first input name>.LST[-]".  When
TYPE finishes a monitor level command, it will just  exit  to  monitor
level  like the current TYPE and LIST commands.  Note that TYPE is run
directly by the monitor thus eliminating the  intermediate  processing
by COMPIL.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 3


1.4  Input File Specification Defaulting

     Two modes of defaulting  are  available  with  TYPE.   These  are
controlled  by  the /WILD switch.  The default mode /NOWILD is similar
to "PIP" and the /WILD mode is similar to "DIRECT".   In  both  modes,
the  first  input device is defaulted to "DSK:" and successive devices
are defaulted to the previous specification's device.  All directories
are  defaulted  to  the  users current PATH "[-]".  The user's current
PATH is the PPn he logged in on unless he explicitly  changed  it.   A
global  directory may be specified which refers to all successive file
specifications by placing the directory specification before the  file
name and extension.

     With /NOWILD processing, the file  name  must  be  specified  for
directoried  devices  and  the  extension  is defaulted to null.  With
/WILD processing, the first input file name is defaulted  to  "*"  and
successive  file  names are defaulted to the preceding file name.  The
extension is defaulted to null if the dot is present (e.g.  FILE.) and
to "*" if no dot is present.



2.0  SWITCHES

     TYPE accepts and processes all of the standard SCAN  switches  as
well as many of it's own.  Any switch may be placed in the option file
"SWITCH.INI[-]" to be  used  as  a  default  if  that  switch  is  not
explicitly given on the command line.



2.1  Output File Specification Switches

     These switches refer to the output file  only!   They  should  be
placed  before  the  equal  sign  and  may  result in errors if placed
elsewhere.



2.1.1  APPEND - If the output is going to disk and if a  file  by  the
same  name  as the output file already exists, an attempt will be made
to append to the end of the existing file.



2.1.2  ERSUPERSEDE - If the output is going to a directory device  and
the file already exists, an error message is given and the old file is
not superseded.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 4


2.1.3  ESTIMATE:n - When the output file  is  entered,  the  estimated
file length is set to n.  This only has effect on disk files.



2.1.4  IMAGE - If the output device is "TTY:", output is performed  in
IMAGE  mode  rather  than  ASCII mode.  On any other device, output is
always performed in ASCII mode.  This switch turns  off  several  text
formating commands and allows generation of output closer to the given
input text (e.g control characters are not output as ^-char).



2.1.5  NOIMAGE - This is the default mode of output.   It  causes  the
output to be performed in ASCII mode.  See /IMAGE for more details.



2.1.6  OKSUPERSEDE - If the output is going to  a  directoried  device
and  the file already exists there, it is superseded by the new output
file.  This is the default.



2.1.7  PROTECT:nnn - If the output is to disk, set the  protection  on
the  output  file  to  nnn.  The default is 057 or if the file already
exists, to the same protection as the old file.



2.1.8  VERSION:vnum - If output  is  to  disk,  set  the  output  file
version number to vnum.



2.2  Input File Selection Switches

     Several switches allow selection of a given subset of  the  files
that  match  a given file specification.  All of these switches except
/PHYSICAL and /NOPHYSICAL only affect files  on  directoried  devices.
The "date-time" argument used by 4 of these switches can be in several
forms which are described in appendix A.



2.2.1  BEFORE:date-time - Allow only those files created prior to  the
given date-time value to be considered for listing.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 5


2.2.2  SINCE:date-time - Allow only  those  files  created  after  the
given date-time value to be considered for listing.



2.2.3  ABEFORE:date-time - Allow only those files  accessed  prior  to
the given data-time value to be considered for listing.



2.2.4  ASINCE:date-time - Allow only those files  accessed  after  the
given date-time value to be considered for listing.



2.2.5  LENGTH:n:m - Allow only those files  whose  block  lengths  are
between n and m inclusively to be considered for listing.  If only one
value is given (e.g.  /LENGTH:5), then all files whose  block  lengths
are at least n long are considered for listing.



2.2.6  PHYSICAL - Treat the device name given as  a  physical  device.
Thus  if  DSKB  is assigned the logical name DSKC and a file is listed
from device DSKC, TYPE will look on physical device DSKC.



2.2.7  NOPHYSICAL - Treat the device as either a logical  or  physical
name  in  that  order.   This is the default.  Thus in the example for
/PHYSICAL above, TYPE would look on physical device DSKB for the  file
is /NOPHYSICAL is set.



2.2.8  STRS - If a generic disk device is given,  this  switch  causes
all structures in the devices search list to be searched for the given
file.  Thus if both DSKB and DSKC are in the user's search list and if
a  file,  call it X.X, exists on both DSKB and DSKC, the specification
DSK:X.X/STRS will cause both files to be listed.



2.2.9  NOSTRS - Causes only the first file encountered  on  a  generic
disk device with a given name to be listed.  This is the default mode.
Thus in the example for /STRS  above,  only  the  first  copy  of  X.X
encountered  on DSK will be listed in /NOSTRS is specified (explicitly
or by default).
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 6


2.3  Input File Selection Error Control Switches

     This set of switches allow some control over the  type  of  error
messages produced when there are problems reading an input file.



2.3.1  OKPROTECTION - Do not give a warning message for each protected
file.  This is the default.  A warning message is issued at the end of
an input file  specification  if  some  or  all  matching  files  were
protected.



2.3.2  ERPROTECTION - Give a warning message for  each  matching  file
that is read protected.



2.3.3  OKNONE - Do not give a warning message if  no  file  matches  a
given file specification.



2.3.4  ERNONE - Give a warning message if no files match a given  file
specification.  This is the default.



2.3.5  OKBINARY - Allow   files   with   binary    extensions    (e.g.
REL,SAV,UFD) to be listed.  This is the default.



2.3.6  ERBINARY - If a given file has a binary extension, then  output
an error message and don't list the file.



2.3.7  SKBINARY - If a given file has a binary  extension,  then  just
skip  over it.  No error or warning message is output.  This switch is
ignored if a file is type out as octal (/OCTAL).



2.4  Special Input File Format Switches

     This set of switches allows special format files  to  be  listed.
Only  one of the /FORTRAN, /COBOL, or /OCTAL switches may be given for
a  given  file  specification.   Also  with  the  /COBOL  switch,  the
/NOSEQUENCE switch is meaningless.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 7


2.4.1  FORTRAN - This switch will interpret  the  first  character  of
each  line  in  an  input file as a FORTRAN carriage control.  See the
FORTRAN-10 or F40 manuals for a description of what the legal carriage
control  characters  are  and  what  they  do.  If an illegal carriage
control character is encountered, TYPE will discard it and  treat  the
line  as  if  the character was a space.  Note that for computation of
carriage control characters which skip a partial page, a standard page
length of 60 printable lines is assumed.



2.4.2  COBOL - Use this switch if the input file  is  a  SIXBIT  COBOL
file.   Note that any page limitations will be ignored since there are
never any form-feeds in this type of file.  Block skipping is illegal.



2.4.3  OCTAL - Use this switch to produce an octal dump of  the  given
file.  The number of octal words placed on a line is determined by the
/WIDTH setting (4 words for 72, 8 for 132 etc.).  Any page limitations
are   meaningless  for  this  type  of  listing  since  there  are  no
form-feeds.  This switch will overide the /SKBINARY switch.



2.4.4  SEQUENCE - If the given input file has sequence  numbers,  then
list  them.   This  is  the  default.  If the input file does not have
sequence numbers, then this switch has no effect.



2.4.5  NOSEQUENCE - If the given input file has sequence numbers, then
do  not list them.  This switch will suppress both the sequence number
and the tab following it if there is one.  If the input file does  not
have sequence numbers, then this switch has no effect.



2.4.6  CRYPT:"text" - Allow files encrypted by the  string  "text"  be
listed.  Currently the only way to produce a file in this format is by
using a modified version of SOS or TYPE itself.



2.5  Partial File Listings

     This set of switches allow the selection of a particular  portion
of  a  file.   The  part  of the file listed can be limited by blocks,
pages, lines, and columns.  These switches are processed in  a  nested
fashion.   Block  counting  starts at the beginning of the file.  Then
the given number of blocks are skipped.  At this point  page  counting
starts  and the given number of pages are skipped.  At this point line
counting starts and the given number of lines are skipped.   Then  the
COLUMNS  switch  may  be used to select a given range of columns.  The
listing of a file continues until any one of the block, page, or  line
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 8


limits are exceeded or until the end of file is encountered.



2.5.1  Limiting File Printing By Blocks - There  are  4  switches  for
limiting the range of blocks listed.  On non-directory devices a block
is equivalent to a buffer or a record.



2.5.1.1  BSTART:n - Causes n blocks to be skipped at the beginning  of
the  file.   This  switch  currently  only  effects  disk files and is
treated as a no-op on other devices.  The  /SKRECORDS  switch  may  be
used  to  obtain  equivalent  results  on  magtape.  Block skipping is
treated as a no-op on COBOL SIXBIT files.



2.5.1.2  BEND:n - Causes file listing to cease after the n'th block is
listed.   This  switch  may be used for any input device.  However, if
the device is disk, a negative value may be given which is interpreted
relative  to  the  last  block  (i.e.   -1=last block, -2=next to last
block, etc.).



2.5.1.3  BRANGE:n:m - This switch is equivalent  to  /BSTART:n/BEND:m.
It has one additional feature.  If only one value is given, it is used
for both n and m.  Therefore  a  single  block  can  be  listed  (e.g.
/BRANGE:2 == /BRANGE:2:2).



2.5.1.4  NBLOCKS:n - This switch defines a relative number  of  blocks
to  be  listed  after the starting block (e.g.  /BSTART:2/NBLOCKS:3 ==
/BRANGE:2:4).



2.5.2  Limiting File Printing By Pages - There  are  4  switches   for
limiting  the  range of pages listed.  A page is always delimited by a
form-feed.  This is the only criterion used to determine where a  page
ends.  With /FORTRAN, the "1" carriage control character is equivalent
to a form-feed.  With /COBOL, any page limits are ignored since  there
are never any form-feeds in a COBOL SIXBIT file.  Page counting starts
with page 1.



2.5.2.1  PSTART:n - This switch causes file listing to  start  at  the
n'th page after the initial block skipping.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                    Page 9


2.5.2.2  PEND:n - This switch causes file  listing  to  be  terminated
after the n'th page of the file.



2.5.2.3  PRANGE:n:m - This switch is equivalent  to  /PSTART:n/PEND:m.
Like /BRANGE, if only one value is given, it is used for both m and n.
Therefore  a  single  page  can  be   listed   (e.g.    /PRANGE:2   ==
/PRANGE:2:2).



2.5.2.4  NPAGES:n - This switch defines a relative number of pages  to
be  listed  after  the  starting  page  (e.g.   /PSTART:2/NPAGES:3  ==
/PRANGE:2:4).



2.5.3  Limiting File Printing By Lines - There  are  4  switches   for
limiting  the range of lines listed.  A line is always terminated by a
line-feed.  This is the only criterion used to determine where a  line
ends.    With   /FORTRAN,  several  carriage  control  characters  are
equivalent to one or more line-feeds.  With /COBOL, a  carriage-return
line-feed  is  added  at  the  end  of each COBOL SIXBIT record.  Line
counting starts at 1.



2.5.3.1  LSTART:n - This switch causes file listing to  start  at  the
n'th line after the initial block and page skipping.



2.5.3.2  LEND:n - This switch causes file  listing  to  be  terminated
after the n'th line is passed.



2.5.3.3  LRANGE:n:m - This switch is equivalent  to  /LSTART:n/LEND:m.
Like /BRANGE, if only one value is given, it is used for both n and m.
Therefore  a  single  line  can  be   listed   (e.g.    /LRANGE:2   ==
/LRANGE:2:2).



2.5.3.4  NLINES:n - This switch defines a relative number of lines  to
be   listed   after  the  starting  line  (e.q  /LSTART:2/NLINES:3  ==
/LRANGE:2:4).
TYPE - Program to List Files                                   Page 10


2.5.4  COLUMNS:n:m - This switch allows the selection of a  particular
range  of columns for listing.  Only these columns and any end of line
characters are listed.  The columns are counted from  the  input  file
after   any  special  conversions  needed  for  the  file  format  are
performed.  All control characters,  except  end  of  line  characters
(cr,lf,vt,ff) and tabs are treated as occupying a single column.  Line
numbers will count as columns if they  are  not  suppressed  with  the
/NOSEQUENCE switch.



2.6  Output File Format Control

     These switches control what the output listing looks like.   They
are  independent  of  the  input  file format.  Some of these switches
effect the listing of all input files  whereas  others  may  refer  to
individual  input files or groups of input files.  This aspect will be
discussed under the individual switches.



2.6.1  Page Simulation Switches - There are two switches for  defining
the  physical  length  of  the output form.  Only one of each of these
switches may be given per command line.  They affect all input  files.
If  neither  /PAGESIZE  or  /BREAKSIZE  is  given,  the output will be
assumed to be going to a device which has forms control.  If either or
both  of  these  switches  are  used,  the  TYPE program will simulate
form-feeds with multiple line-feeds.  This allows a formed  output  to
go to a device without hardware forms control.  Defaults are filled in
for either switch if the other is present.  Some examples are:

        /PAGESIZE       = /PAGESIZE:66/BREAKSIZE:6
        /BREAKSIZE      = /PAGESIZE:66/BREAKSIZE:6
        /PAGESIZE:70    = /PAGESIZE:EAKSIZE:6
        /BREAKSIZE:5    = /PAGESIZE:66/BREAKSIZE:5

     When one of these switches is specified, special setup operations
must  be performed.  If output is going to a device other than the TTY
running the TYPE program, it will  be  assumed  that  this  device  is
positioned  at  top  or form.  If output is to the TTY TYPE is running
on, TYPE will request that the paper be positioned  at  top  of  form.
Then  a  space should be typed, and printing of the file will start on
that line.  An additional carriage-return is output to  move  back  to
the start of the line before the file actually starts printing.



2.6.1.1  PAGESIZE:n - This switch defines the  actual  length  of  the
forms  as  n  lines  long.  This is not the printable number of lines.
This value is computed as  the  values  of  the  /PAGESIZE  minus  the
/BREAKSIZE  value  (e.g.   /PAGESIZE:66/BREAKSIZE:6 yield 60 printable
lines).  The default value for /PAGESIZE is 66.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                   Page 11


2.6.1.2  BREAKSIZE:n - This switch defines the number of lines to skip
between each form.  Therefore the number of lines printed on a form is
the actual forms size minus the number of lines skipped.  The  default
value for /BREAKSIZE is 6.



2.6.2  Tab And Space Conversions - This  set   of   switches   perform
special  actions  on  spaces.   They  allow the conversion of multiple
spaces to tabs and the suppression of  leading  and  trailing  spaces.
Note  that  only  spaces and not tabs are suppressed.  If the /COLUMNS
switch is used, these switches will act on the section  of  each  line
that is output and not on what the input line looked like.



2.6.2.1  TABS - This switch converts multiple spaces to tabs.  This is
the  default  if  the  output  is  directed  to a TTY that understands
hardware tabs (i.e.  SET TTY TAB).



2.6.2.2  NOTABS - This switch suppresses the  conversion  of  multiple
spaces to tabs.  This is the default for all devices except TTY's that
understand tabs.



2.6.2.3  SUPPRESS - This switch suppresses  the  listing  of  trailing
spaces.   This  is  the  default.   Note  that  trailing  tabs are not
suppressed.



2.6.2.4  NOSUPPRESS - This switch allows trailing spaces to be listed.



2.6.2.5  LSUPPRESS - This switch will suppress leading  spaces.   Note
that leading tabs are not suppressed.



2.6.2.6  NOLSUPPRESS - This switch will allow  leading  spaces  to  be
output.  This is the default.



2.6.3  Width Control Switches - This set  of  switches  allow  control
over the width of the output forms.  They also signify what to do when
the width of the form is exceeded.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                   Page 12


2.6.3.1  WIDTH:n - This switch will define the  width  of  the  output
listing.   If no width switch is given, a default value of 132 is used
for any output device except TTY.  For a TTY, the default  width  used
is  the current width setting obtained from the monitor.  Note that if
output is to a TTY and a width switch is given, the TYPE program  will
reset the TTY's width to the given switch value.



2.6.3.2  TRUNCATE - This switch causes lines  longer  than  the  given
width to be truncated.



2.6.3.3  NOTRUNCATE - This switch causes lines longer than  the  given
width  to wrap around.  That is, a CR-LF is output and the rest of the
line is listed on the next output line.  This is the default.



2.6.4  Miscellaneous Output Format Switches - This  set  of   switches
allow  special  formating  and character conversion to be performed on
the output.  Any of these actions occure  only  on  the  part  of  the
output  file  selected  by  the previously described switches.  All of
these  switches  except  /BACKSPACE  and  /NOBACKSPACE  may  be  given
individually for each file specification.



2.6.4.1  HEADER:"text" - This switch places a heading on  the  top  of
each output form.  It will list the filename and extension starting at
the left margin.  If "text" is given, it is output at  this  point  in
the header line.  And a page number is output near the right margin as
defined by the /WIDTH switch.  If the argument to /HEADER is  omitted,
only  the filename, extension, and page number are output as a header.
A header is output after each form-feed is output and before the first
character  of  the  file  is  listed.   A special case occures if page
simulation is in effect, if either a /PAGESIZE  or  /BREAKSIZE  switch
was  given.   In  this  case,  headings  are output at the top of each
physical page, and also at the top of each logical page.  If a logical
page  is  encountered, a sub-page number is incremented instead of the
page number, and both are output in the header.   This  method  allows
the page number to reflect the physical page correctly.



2.6.4.2  SPACING:s - This switch allows multiple  blank  lines  to  be
skiped  between each line output.  It converts each line-feed to 1, 2,
or 3 line-feeds corresponding to the legal switch  values  of  SINGLE,
DOUBLE, and TRIPLE.  The default is SINGLE spacing.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                   Page 13


2.6.4.3  INDENT:n - This switch allows indentation of each output line
and  the  header  if  present  by  n spaces.  This indentation occures
independent of the /COLUMNS or /LSUPPRESS switches.  The default value
if  no /INDENT is present is 0.  If /INDENT is present and no value is
given, a default value of 8 is used.



2.6.4.4  BACKSPACE - This switch will output the  backspace  character
directly  and  not  as  a  control-H (^H).  It assumes that the output
device has a hardware backspace function.



2.6.4.5  NOBACKSPACE - This switch causes the backspace  character  to
be output as a control-H (^H).  This is the default.



2.6.4.6  ALTMODE - This switch causes the altmode character (octal 33)
to be output as a dollar sign ($) rather than a control-[ (^[).



2.6.4.7  NOALTMODE - This switch causes the altmode  character  (octal
33) to be output as a control-[ (^[).  This is the default.



2.6.4.8  BELL - If output is to a TTY,  this  switch  outputs  a  bell
character as a control-G (^G) and also rings the bell by outputting it
directly.



2.6.4.9  NOBELL - This switch causes the bell character to  be  output
as a control-G (^G).  The bell is not rung.  This is the default.



2.7  Magtape Function Control Switches

     This group of switches allow  various  Magtape  functions  to  be
performed.   These  only  affect  input  devices  which  are  physical
Magtapes.  The order of the tape movement switches are:  REWIND,  EOT,
SKFILES  and  BKFILES, SKRECORDS and BKRECORDS.  Note that all Magtape
operations are performed before the file is read.

2.7.1  REWIND - This switch will  rewind  the  magtape  to  it's  load
point.



2.7.2  NOREWIND - This switch inhibits the rewinding of the magtape to
it's load point.  This is the default.



2.7.3  EOT - This switch will skip to the logical end of the Magtape.



2.7.4  NOEOT - This switch inhibits skipping to  logical  end  of  the
magtape.  This is the default.



2.7.5  SKFILES:n - This switch will cause n files to be skipped on the
Magtape  before  the  file  is  read.  If no value is given after this
switch, a default of 1 is assumed.



2.7.6  SKRECORDS:n - This switch will cause n records to be skipped on
the  Magtape  before the file is read.  If no value is given after the
switch, a default of 1 is assumed



2.7.7  BKFILES:n - This switch will cause n  files  to  be  backspaced
over  on  the  Magtape  before the file is read.  If no value is given
after the switch, a default of 1 is assumed.



2.7.8  BKRECORDS:n - This switch will cause n records to be backspaced
over  on  the  Magtape  before the file is read.  If no value is given
after the switch, a default of 1 is assumed.



2.7.9  DENSITY:s - This switch will set what density the input Magtape
is  to  be  read  at.   The value s may be one of 200, 556, 800, 1600,
6250, or INSTALLATION.



2.7.10  PARITY:s - This switch sets the parity of  the  Magtape.   The
values may either be ODD or EVEN.

2.8  Miscellaneous TYPE Switches

     This set of  switches  control  various  functions  of  the  TYPE
program that don't really fit in any one of the previous categories.



2.8.1  ACCESS - This switch will cause TYPE to change the access  date
of the input file when it is listed.



2.8.2  NOACCESS - This switch will inhibit the changing of the  access
date of the input file.  This is the default.



2.8.3  NAME - This switch will type out a file description on the  TTY
before  a  given file is listed.  The file description consists of the
file specification and the access and creation dates.



2.8.4  NONAME - This   switch   will   inhibit   the   initial    file
specification type out.  This is the default.



2.8.5  ENAME - This switch will type out a file description on the TTY
after a given file is listed.  The format is the same as for /NAME.



2.8.6  NOENAME - This switch will inhibit the final file specification
type out.  This is the default.



2.9  Additional SCAN Switches

     This group of switches are standard SCAN switches  which  may  be
used  with  other  system  programs  such as DIRECT, QUEUE, and LOGIN.
These switches perform global functions which are not associated  with
a given file or command.



2.9.1  EXIT - This switch will cause TYPE  to  exit  to  monitor  mode
after the given command is completed.
TYPE - Program to List Files                                   Page 16


2.9.2  HELP - This switch will type out the TYPE help file on the TTY.



2.9.3  HELP:SWITCHES - This  switch  will  type  out  a  list  of  the
switches accepted by the TYPE program on the TTY.



2.9.4  MESSAGE:s - This switch will set the  length  of  the  messages
that  are  produced  by  TYPE.  The values "s" can take on are PREFIX,
FIRST, CONTINUATION, and ADDRESS.



2.9.5  NOOPTION - This  switch  suppresses  reading  of  the  standard
options for the TYPE program from the SWITCH.INI[-] file.



2.9.6  OPTION:s - This switch uses option "s" from  the  options  file
SWITCH.INI[-] to fill in the defaults on the current command line.



2.9.7  RUN:file - This switch will cause the given file to be run as a
program after the current command line processing is completed.



2.9.8  RUNCORE:n - This switch will set the  amount  of  core  that  a
program  will  be  run  in.  This is used in conjunction with the /RUN
switch.



2.9.9  RUNOFFSET:n - This switch will set the offset  from  the  start
address  at  which  a  program will be run.  If no value n is given, a
default of 1, the CCL starting  point,  is  used.   This  is  used  in
conjunction with the /RUN switch.



2.9.10  TMPFIL:xxx:"text" - This switch will generate a temporary file
with name "xxx" containing the given text.  This switch is useful when
used to run a program at it's CCL offset.
