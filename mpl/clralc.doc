CLRALC is a program that corrects a situation which occurs after
an ALL FILES restore in which DSKCLN cannot allocate enough core
to clear the "allocation has changed" bit (RIPALC) for all the newly restored
files.

The new "fast" DSKCLN (introduced in P034/E) depends on a bit called
RIPALC. When the allocation changes for a file, this bit is set.
The bit is cleared 1)by DSKCLN in FAST and FULL modes, and 
2) every time a file is looked up and all monitor buffers that
the file used to change its allocation are known to have been written
out.

When a file structure is refreshed and its files are restored from
tape, the files are entered, thereby having their allocation changed.
However, most of them are not looked up again. The result is that
almost all files on the system have the RIPALC bit set. If there
are enough files on the file structure, DSKCLN may not have enough
free storage in which to remember all these files (DSKCLN cannot
turn the bits off until all its processing is complete).
Therefore, CLRALC is used to look the files up after the restore
to clear the RIPALC bits.

The procedures for an ALL FILES restore should be modified as follows:

CLRALC should be run immediately after completion of the restore.
If the system crashes before the restore is complete, an attempt should
be made to allow DSKCLN to run as usual. If DSKCLN fails to complete
(gets an ILL MEM REF or complains about being out of core)
bring the system up manually and run CLRALC. Then bring the system back
down and bring it up such that the system runs FULL DSKCLN.
For example:

*Start all files restore.

*System crashes.

*Bring system back up, DSKCLN fails to complete (gets ILL MEM REF message)
 Mode was FULL.


*Operator brings system down, brings it up manually. Logs in and
 runs CLRALC according to instructions.

*Operator brings system down. Brings system back up, specifying
 FULL DSKCLN

*Operator continues all files restore.

If DSKCLN still fails to complete after running CLRALC, call someone
in the operating systems group.

The typical sequence of events if there is no crash during file restore
is as follows:

*File structure refreshed

*All tapes restored

*CLRALC is run

INSTRUCTIONS for running CLRALC
-------------------------------

Set RF license.

Run CLRALC. It asks "FIX?" Type in a Y. It will start processing
immeditaley (no carriage return is needed).

When it is done, it will exit. A file called CLRALC.DAT will be
written out which gives a summary of how many files with RIPALC
were found out of the total number, for each directory and for the
entire file structure.
