DISPLAY SELECTION

There are five kinds of output from ICP:

	job lists
	file lists
	job summaries
	file summaries
	system statistics

They are controlled by switchs as follows

	job	produces a job list with entries for all jobs,
		and a job summary

	active	produces a job list with entries for all active
		jobs (all jobs not in TTY i/o wait or HIBERs),
		and a job summary

	file	produces a file list with entries for all
		files currently open or with pages mapped
		from them, and a file summary

	shared	produces a file list with entries for all
		files posessing a shared page table (this
		is roughly all files a page of which has
		ever been shared), and a file summary

	summary	in combination with any of the above,
		turns off the job and file lists, leaving
		only the summaries

	statistics
		produces a list of system statistics about
		paging performance

The modifier

	repeat <wait time>

causes the selected display to repeat forever, waiting
<wait time> seconds between displays.

OTHER COMMANDS

Other ICP commands are:

	quit	leaves ICP

	open <file name>
		causes subsequent ICP output to go to
		the specified file rather than to the
		terminal (input still comes from the
		terminal)

	close	directs ICP output back to the terminal

	display	enables a crude ADM3-oriented mode, which
		is mostly useful for repeating displays
		(only the fields that change are updated
		on the screen)

JOB LISTS

The columns of a job list are

	job	the job number (decimal)

	program	the program name

	size	the number of existant pages for the
		job

	wss	the number of pages in the job's working
		set. an asterisk is printed to the left of
		this column if the number is greater than
		the system-wide job working set limit.

	act	the number of pages currently in core for
		the job (more or less). a + is printed to
		the left of this column if the pages are
		currently protected from being stolen by
		the swapper for another job. a - is printed
		if they are not so protected and the swapper
		has at least thought about taking some of
		them.

	icp	the number of jiffies left in the job's in-
		core quantum. if this is nonzero, the job's
		pages will be protected from the swapper.

	mc/s	microcycles per second since ICP was started
		or since the last job list was output by ICP

	io/s	blocks per second of (simulated) disk i/o

	state	the job's state

JOB STATES

The state field is more or less the same as SYSTAT's. A minor
exception is that TI and TO are both given as TI. The major
exception is that RN jobs get extra information printed
about them:

	Q<queue number>.<queue position>
		indicates which of the four run queues
		the job is currently in and where it stands
		in the queue (ICP's method of obtaining
		this information is somewhat unreliable, so
		the queue indication does not always appear)

	+mrq	the job has page-faulted and is now blocked
		waiting for the swapper's attention

	+prf	the job (directly or via the disk i/o
		simulator) has prereferenced a page and the
		swapper has not finished the prereferencing

	+swpinp	the swapper is currently bringing in pages
		for the job

The SW state, it should be noted, does not exactly mean
"swapped out". When a job page-faults, it stays in RN but
+mrq gets set. Eventually the swappper comes around and
decides to get all the job's working set back in again.
This results in +swpinp getting set. When the swapper has
queued disk requests for all of the job's swapped-out
pages, it lets the job run again (and +swpinp goes off).
If the job gets to a page before the corresponding disk
request gets satisfied, the job goes into SW.

JOB SUMMARIES

The ICP job summary fields are:

	XX jobs		XX is the number of logged-in jobs

	XX active	XX is the number of jobs not in TTY
			i/o wait or HIBERs

	NN (N0+N1+N2+N3) RN
			NN is the number of jobs in the RN
			state. Ni is the number in queue i.

	XX with MRQ set	XX is the number of (RN state) jobs
			having MRQ set (see JOB STATES)

	XX SW		XX is the number of SW state jobs
			(see JOB STATES)

	XX microcycles/second
	YY simio blocks/second
			XX and YY are the totals from the
			corresponding job list columns

	XX mapped, YY in wss, ZZ in active wss,
	AA activated, BB icp
			XX, YY, ZZ, AA and BB are in pages
			over available core pages

			XX is the sum of the size column
			YY is the sum of the wss column
			  (roughly SYSTAT's swapping ratio)
			ZZ is the sum of the wss column for
			  jobs not in TTY i/o wait or HIBERs
			  (roughly SYSTAT's active swapping
			  ratio)
			AA is the sum of the act column
			BB is the sum of the act column entries
			  which have a + in front of them

FILE LISTS

	directory file ext
		the file's directory, name, and extension

	u	the number of jobs with this file open in
		update mode

	eof	the position of the end-of-file (in
		decimal pages/decimal words)

	prv	the protection code in octal

	md	the data mode

	pages	the number of allocated pages for the file
		(including RIB pages)

	mapped	the number of pages being mapped from the file

	shr	the "sharing factor" -- the average number of
		jobs having each page mapped
