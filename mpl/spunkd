Please read (SPUNKDEV)CNVIT4.MEM, and also send mail to those you feel
should see it (I addressed it to you and Jack, but I'll let you tell Jack)

Jack,
I can't find (CONPS5:23)ERMSG.TBA.  I have talked to David Miller who
handles installations and he says they have fixed it since the time
of your phone call.  Please test ASAP and let me know if it is still
causing problems.

Please type (SPUNKDEV)CNVIT4.MEM for Samuel

Samuel,
As you probably know, USPS development has been moved from C39 to
V23.  I have asked validations to move (SPUNKDEV:39) to (SPUNKDEV:23).
I don't know if you have been using 39;  if so, you may find that
SPUNKDEV is no longer valid there.  When this occurs, you should b

able to log on to V23 instead.  I will have operations bring TBATLIB:23
up to speed also.  Let me know if this causes you problems.
Sherman.

Jack,
From what you say, the RUN UUO in (TBATLIB)TLIB behaves in the same
manner as the monitor's RUN UUO.  This is as it should be, I would not
want to see a high level language's functionality differ from the
analogous system function.
I suggest that you write a subroutine

which closes files as needed and
then calls the RUN UUO.

WRT the RUN UUO not closing files, I am confused about your statement
that FORTRAN, TBA and others do close files.  Do you know of any language
which supports a RUN capability and actually closes files as the 
result of a RUN?

Samuel,
The following suggestion comes from Allen Ginzburg, and should substantially
simplify the concurrent update problem if you are not already using it.
Define clubs on a per page basis, when someone access a page (in a file
opened via an SOPEN) they join a club for that p

age, apply for a club
lock and release the lock when they are done.  They will lose their
club membership automatically when they cease mapping the page.

In other words, Allen's suggestion is to use clubs on a per page basis
rather than on a per file basis.  This should also

 solve the problem
of locking records which span one or more pages/files.

Your comments, please.  Thanks ... Sherman.

SHERMAN,
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD!!  THE ONLY THING IS THAT I THOUGHT SAMUEL
WOULD KNOW WHICH PAGES WERE TOUCHED, WHETHER 1 OR 50 AND COULD THEN
LOCK ANY NUMBER OF PAGES..  I.E. 256 DOUBLE PRECISION VARIABLES 
WOULD LIKE THE PROBLEM EXPLAINED MORE FULLY.
THANKS,
JET

SHERMAN,
CAN'T SAY THAT I DO.  WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO AVID HERE
IS CHANGING 900 PROGRAMS JUST LOOKING FOR CLOSES. IF WE
HAVE TO, THEN I GUESS WE WILL.  TBA DOES IT PROPERLY SO IT
WOULD ONLY BE THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE RUNUUO IN THEM..
THANKS,
JET
