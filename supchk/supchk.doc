           The SPOOL, BATCH and MAIL collection program for Tymcom-X

                                  Version 1.0
                                  May 17, 1985


   OVERVIEW:

        The SUPCHK program is designed to build auxiliary circuits to a  list
   of  hosts  for  a given data center and collect any pending BATCH or SPOOL
   requests and/or mail to the username OPER.  The list of hosts is  kept  in
   an  external  file  called  HOSTS.LST  in  the  UTIL  directory and can be
   modified either directly or during the execution of SUPCHK.   The  program
   is  designed  to  report errors encountered during the collection of MAIL,
   BATCH or SPOOL and can be run in a "de-bug" mode to help  identify  system
   errors.  The program also includes a RESTART INTERVAL, expressed in number
   of minutes, for which SUPCHK will "sleep" after polling the list of hosts.
   The RESTART INTERVAL can be specified by the user during execution or will
   default to a period of 15 minutes.


   EXECUTING SUPCHK:

        The SUPCHK program is located in the UTIL directory and can  only  be
   run  by  a  user  logged  in  under  the  username "OPER".  To execute the
   program, the user logs onto a host that is located in the computer  center
   they  wish  to  poll (under the username OPER) and issues the command "RUN
   (UTIL)SUPCHK" at the EXEC prompt.  The user  then  responds  to  questions
   generated  by  SUPCHK  and the program will begin polling each host in the
   HOST.LST file.  Note:  the file (UTIL)HOST.LST must be  present  in  order
   for   SUPCHK  to  run  properly.   (See  "HOST  FILE"  section  below  for
   instructions on restoring the HOST.LST file if it is not present).

        When executed, SUPCHK will obtain the site name and  host  list  from
   the  HOST.LST file and will ask for verification that the list is correct.
   The list may be modified by adding or removing  host  numbers  and  SUPCHK
   will   again   request  verification  that  the  list  is  correct  before
   proceeding.  If modifications are made, SUPCHK will ask if the changes are
   to  be  made  permanent.   If  the  user  wishes to make the modifications
   permanent, SUPCHK will update the  (UTIL)HOST.LST  accordingly,  otherwise
   the  modifications  will  affect  the current session of SUPCHK only.  The
   following is an example of modifying the host  list  during  execution  of
   SUPCHK:


          .RUN (UTIL)SUPCHK


          SUPCHK VERSION 1.0


          CURRENT CUPERTINO SYSTEMS ARE:
          26 29 33 34 35 36 39 55 57
          OKAY ( Y OR N )? N

          REMOVE SYSTEM[S] ( Y OR N )? Y






SUPCHK.DOC                                                             Page 2
EXECUTING SUPCHK


          ENTER SYSTEM NUMBER[S] ( OMIT LETTERS ): 26,29,33

          ADD SYSTEM[S] ( Y OR N )? Y

          ENTER SYSTEM NUMBER[S] ( OMIT LETTERS ): 58,59,60

          CURRENT CUPERTINO SYSTEMS ARE:
          34 35 36 39 55 57 58 59 60
          OKAY ( Y OR N )? Y

          ARE CHANGES PERMANENT ( Y OR N )? Y


          (UTIL)HOST.LST UPDATED


          ENTER RESTART INTERVAL [DEFAULT 15 MINUTES]:




        After the host list has been verified, SUPCHK  will  prompt  for  the
   RESTART  INTERVAL  to  be  entered  in  number  of minutes.  Typing only a
   carriage return will cause SUPCHK to use the default (15 minute) interval.
   Once  the  host  list  and RESTART INTERVAL have been entered, SUPCHK will
   poll each host in the host list and then "sleep" for the specified RESTART
   INTERVAL.


   THE HOST FILE:

        The (UTIL)HOST.LST file consists of two lines separated by a carriage
   return.   The  first  line contains the name of the site the hosts are for
   (i.e.  CUPERTINO, DALLAS, FREMONT, etc...) and the  second  line  contains
   the  host  numbers for that site (separated by commas).  Note:  the second
   line does NOT end with a carriage return.

        SUPCHK will not run if the (UTIL)HOST.LST file is not present or does
   not  conform to the above format.  Should this file get deleted, it may be
   copied from another host IN THE SAME DATA CENTER, restored from backup  or
   allfiles  tape  or  recreated using any valid text editor.  If the file is
   recreated using an editor, it must conform to the above format (two  lines
   separated  by  carriage  return,  site  name  in  first line, host numbers
   separated by commas in second line, no carriage return at end of file).


   SUPCHK ERROR MESSAGES:

        The SUPCHK program builds auxiliary circuits to each host in the host
   list,  checks  for mail, and then runs a slave program called SLVSUP.  The
   SLVSUP program checks for pending BATCH or SPOOL requests and,  if  found,
   sends  the  information  to  SUPCHK which then reports them to the running
   terminal.  If any errors occur during any of these processes, SUPCHK  will
   ring the bell on the running terminal and report the error.  The following
   is a list of possible errors reported by SUPCHK:

        Any errors encountered  aside  from  those  listed  above  should  be
   reported to Tymcom-X software support immediately.


   USING THE DE-BUG MODE:






SUPCHK.DOC                                                             Page 4
USING THE DE-BUG MODE


        If SUPCHK is failing to work properly but is not  generating  any  of
   the  above error messages, the program can be run in "de-bug" mode to help
   pinpoint possible system errors.  During  normal  execution,  SUPCHK  only
   generates  output  at the beginning and end of a RESTART INTERVAL, when an
   error occurs or when it is reporting MAIL, BATCH or  SPOOL  requests.   In
   de-bug mode, SUPCHK will report its current host number and activity as it
   polls the hosts in the host list.  This can be helpful in locating exactly
   where an error is occurring.

        To run SUPCHK in de-bug mode, the user types a control-Z at any point
   where  SUPCHK  is  asking  for a yes or no response from the user.  SUPCHK
   will echo the control-Z (by typing "^Z") and will then re-prompt  for  the
   yes  or  no  response.   The  control-Z  will  cause  SUPCHK to report its
   activities as it is running.  The  following  is  an  example  of  running
   SUPCHK in de-bug mode:


          .RUN (UTIL)SUPCHK


          SUPCHK  VERSION 1.0


          CURRENT CUPERTINO SYSTEMS ARE:
          26 29 33 
          OKAY ( Y OR N )? ^Z

          OKAY ( Y OR N )? Y

          ENTER RESTART INTERVAL [DEFAULT 15 MINUTES]: 5


          CLEARING CUPERTINO HOSTS  5/17/85  15:26

          C26: port(122) CHECK MAIL  -NO MAIL
               RUN SLVSUP , RUNNING, HANDSHAKE: ABCD-OK,
               INTERACT: k^Afe NORMAL EXIT
          C29: port(122) CHECK MAIL  -NO MAIL
               RUN SLVSUP , RUNNING, HANDSHAKE: ABCD-ERROR ON HANDSHAKE,
          ABORTING

          C33: port(94) CHECK MAIL  -NO MAIL
               RUN SLVSUP , RUNNING, HANDSHAKE: ABCD-OK,
               INTERACT: k^Bfe NORMAL EXIT

          BEGINNING 5 MINUTE WAIT  5/17/85  15:28




        In de-bug mode, SUPCHK will report its current target host, the  port
   number  through  which  it has built the auxiliary circuit and type "CHECK
   MAIL  -" as it attempts to collect mail to OPER.   If  there  is  mail  to
   report,  it  will  report it.  Otherwise, it should type "NO MAIL".  If it
   does not, there could be problems with the  mail  system  on  the  current
   host.






SUPCHK.DOC                                                             Page 5
USING THE DE-BUG MODE


        Next, SUPCHK will type "RUN  SLVSUP  ,  "  and  attempt  to  run  the
   (UTIL)SLVSUP  program.  If it is successful in running SLVSUP it will type
   "RUNNING, HANDSHAKE:  ABCD-".  If  it  does  not,  then  the  (UTIL)SLVSUP
   program  is  probably  missing or bad on the target host.  The "HANDSHAKE:
   ABCD-" message indicates SUPCHK is attempting to communicate  with  SLVSUP
   by  sending  a  handshake  code.   If  SLVSUP is running properly, it will
   respond with the proper code and SUPCHK will type "OK".  Otherwise, SUPCHK
   will  type  "HANDSHAKE  ERROR"  and will abort the current host indicating
   that SLVSUP is not running properly on the target host.

        Finally, SUPCHK will interact with SLVSUP to determine if  there  are
   any  BATCH  or  SPOOL  requests  to  report  for  the  current  host.  The
   characters typed between the "INTERACT:" and "NORMAL  EXIT"  messages  are
   the  codes  used by SUPCHK and SLVSUP to indicate whether or not there are
   any pending requests.

        SUPCHK is designed to break (or ZAP) a circuit if it fails to receive
   a  response from the target host after 30 seconds.  If SUPCHK seems to get
   "hung" (i.e.  fails to break the circuit or type an error message after 30
   or  so  seconds),  the  de-bug  mode  can be used to determine what system
   SUPCHK is getting hung on.  Once this is done, the problem system  can  be
   examined  (to  determine  if  there  are  any  evident  problems)  and, if
   necessary, taken out of the host list so that SUPCHK will not get hung.
