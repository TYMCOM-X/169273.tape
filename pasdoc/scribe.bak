&BASIC CONCEPTS&
$skip
$jus
&Page Width&
$skip
$bot 3
SCRIBE segments the document into &pages&, defined by a line &width&
in characters and a page &length& in lines.   The width is further subdivided
into a left &margin& and &left indentation&, which together specify the number of spaces to the left
of printed text, and a &right indentation&, specifying the number of spaces
to the right of printed text.  Thus,
$skip
$center
spaces available for text=width-(margin+right indent+left indent)
$just
$skip
Normally, the indentations are zero, and the margin and width define the 
maximum extent of printed text.  For example, on a Silent 700 terminal, 
which has an intrinsic margin of 2 (the print head after a carriage return
is two positions to the left of the edge of the paper), to define a 70
space line centered on the page, one would set the width=75 and
the margin=5. 
Since the paper is 84 positions wide, this would leave 7
spaces to the left (margin+2) and 7 spaces to the right (84-(width+2)).
$skip
To further shorten lines, the right and/or left indentations would be increased.
For example, before the list of SCRIBE functions in the previous section, the
right indentation was set to 5.  While one might argue that
this could be accomplished by resetting width=70, it is
simpler to change the indentation, since it is relative to the 
width, and thus, one need not know what the current width is to increase
indentation by 5.  In general, the best practice is to set margin and width
once, corresponding to the paper size, and then to change the right and/or left indentations in
the remainder of the document.  If this is done, the document can readily
be printed on different paper sizes since the margin and width can be
entered from the teletype (refer to the following section describing commands).
$skip
&Page Length&
$skip
Pages are subdivided lengthwise into header lines at the &top&, and trailer
lines at the &bottom&, with lines of text in between.  In addition to blank
lines, the header may contain title line(s) and/or a
page number.  The trailer may contain a page number (if it is not printed at the top),
and/or footnote line(s).
Page numbers may be printed on the left, centered, or on the
right of pages.
$skip
If both a title and a page number are printed at the top,
and the number is not centered (justification has been specified for it),
their relative position
is determined by the position of the number, as shown in the following diagram.
If the number is to be centered, it will always be printed centered before
the first
title line.

The preceding discussion also applies to the &last& footnote line, if
numbers are being printed at the &bottom& of pages and are not to be centered.
$skip
Page numbers, if not printed on the same line as a title/footnote, are printed
&before& titles, and &after& footnotes.
$skip
If page numbers are printed at the top/bottom, a minimum of 3 header/trailer
lines must be specified.  If a title/footnote is printed, a minimum of
2 more header/trailer lines than the number of title/footnote lines are necessary.
If both a title/footnote and centered number are printed, 3 more than the number
of title/footnote
lines are required.  An insufficient number of lines causes a diagnostic to
be printed on the terminal and the printing of the title/footnote and/or number to be
suppressed.
$skip
$BOT 4
&Processing Modes&
$skip
SCRIBE is capable of processing input text and producing output in four
different ways, referred to a &verbatim&, &centered&, &right justified&, and
&justified&.  In verbatim mode, lines are read and written exactly as they
appear on the file, except that spaces are inserted before
as defined by the current margin and left indentation.  SCRIBE allows the
right indentation to be violated in this mode, but width violations will cause a
diagnostic.  This mode is typically used when printing figures, tables,
and so on.
$skip
Right justified and centered modes are similar to verbatim, in that the text
of lines is output in the same form as it is input.  In centered mode, the
text is centered in the available text space (width-indentations-margin),
while in right justified mode, the text is right justified in the available
space.  As in verbatim, right indentation violations are allowed (input
line is longer than available space) but width violations are diagnosed.
These modes are useful for section headers, and other such things.
$skip
In justified mode, the input is segmented into &words& (non-blank strings
delimited by blank(s) and/or line boundaries), and then reassembled into output
lines of length equal to the available text space.  If necessary, extra blanks
are inserted between words to pad lines out to the
desired length.  This mode produces even left and right margins, and thus is
the normal processing mode.
$skip
If $JUSTIFY LEFT is specified, SCRIBE will not insert extra blanks to pad lines.
This produces lines of nearly equal length, giving the appearance of a
manually typed document.
$skip
Since line boundaries and extraneous spaces are ignored in the input, preparation
and especially modification of document text is greatly simplified.  For
example, words can be inserted in, or deleted from, the middle of input lines
without worrying about the length of the edited line.
$skip
Justification of contiguous word blocks, corresponding to paragraphs or
outline entries in the finished document, is usually desired.  Thus, it is
necessary to have a way to tell SCRIBE where a justified block ends (and perhaps
where a new one begins).  Such a point is called a &justification& &break&.  In
SCRIBE, any and all commands (described in the next section) cause a justification
break, if a block of justified text is currently being processed, in addition
to whatever other effects they may have.  There are two commands which are
typically used to break justification, namely:  $SKIP (causing blank line(s)
to be printed), and $PARAGRAPH (modifying the left indentation of the first line
in the next block of text).
$skip
&Commands&
$skip
Formatting parameters are set by &commands& in the input file, which are read
and processed by SCRIBE, but not output.  Command lines are identified by a
dollar sign ($) in the first column, and, as described earlier, cause an 
immediate justification break.  An imperative, which identifies the command,
immediately follows the dollar sign.  Typically, the imperative identifies a
parameter to be changed, and the following &items& in the command line
give the new value it is to assume.  Items may be keywords (alphabetic strings
delimited by blank(s)), integers (which occasionally may be signed), or
strings (arbitrary characters enclosed in primes).  Any imperative or keyword may
be &abbreviated& to a minimum of its &first 3 characters&.
Multiple commands on the same line are allowed ('$ski $par 5'), but the
first column of the line must contain a dollar sign.
$skip
Commands are divided into two groups:\\those specifying &pagination&
parameters, and those specifying &line& parameters (for want of a better name).
Commands in the first group set such things as line width and page
length, and do not take effect until the &beginning& &of& &the& &next&
&printed& &page&.  Commands in the second group take effect &immediately&.  It
is important to note that pagination commands at the &beginning& &of&
&the& &input& &file& or &immediately& &following& &a& &PAGE& &command&
(see the next section), take effect &immediately&, since SCRIBE is positioned
at the beginning of printed page.
$SKIP
Erroneous command lines are printed on the user's terminal, followed by an
up-arrow (^), indicating the approximate point in the line where the error
was detected, and a diagnostic.

FOOTNOTES ( [LEFT,RIGHT] string ) ...
$skip
Defines a footnote (effectively a title printed at the bottom of
pages) to be printed on subsequent pages.
Characters within footnote string(s) are decapitalized and/or
underlined if either of these options is in effect (see later sections).
A &string& is any number of characters enclosed in primes ('), 
i.e.\'Report'. A prime may be included in a string by doubling it;
for example, '''' produces a single prime on output.
&Multiple line& footnotes are specified by multiple strings
following the imperative; the command "$footnotes 'Here' 'Now' will cause
a two line footnote with "Here" centered on the first line and
"Now" centered on the second.
Footnote strings may be justified to either the left or right margin by
preceding the string with LEFT or RIGHT as indicated above.
If neither is specified, strings will be centered (unless it
is the last footnote line and justified numbers are being printed at the bottom.
See the previous section &Page Length& for a discussion of this case.)
As indicated in the syntax above, multiple footnote lines may be specified.
Justification must be specified for each line, thus if you wish to have a
three line footnote justified left, you must precede each of strings with
LEFT.
The current page number may be included in a footnote line by typing
a backslash.
When the line is printed, the backslash will be replaced by the current
page number.
This allows you to format your own page numbers, rather than
using the default numbering formats.
In this case, generally $NUMBER OFF is specified to suppress default
number printing  (note that this does &not& suppress incrementing
of page numbers).
To cancel printing of footnotes, type either $FOOTNOTES\OFF or
 $FOOTNOTES\''.
$skip
In the default case, SCRIBE does not print any footnotes, e.g., it defaults
to $FOOTNOTES\OFF.

TABS [integer [[,] integer]... ]
$skip
Specifies successive column positions for tabs (control-I) in &verbatim&
mode. In all other modes, tabs are completely ignored, i.e., they are
discarded. As one might expect, tabs are useful for preparing tables to
be printed verbatim.
Tab positions are &relative& to the left margin as defined by $MARGIN,
 $INDENT, and/or $PARAGRAPH.
Thus, if the first defined tab stop is 5, the left indentation is 2, and
the margin 5, the first tab stop will be at absolute column 12.
The fact that tabs are relative allows tables to be shifted left
or right without affecting the relative column positions.
Unfortunately, tab positions are not settable on the PDP/10, and
are always printed at intervals of 8 characters.
This makes table preparation with tabs more of a chore, as you cannot
see what the tables will actually look like when editing, but must run
the document through SCRIBE.
When beyond the last tab stop, or if no tabs are specified, a tab
is printed as a single space in verbatim mode.

<string1> must be longer than or the same length as <string2>; characters

&TEXT JUSTIFICATION&
$just
$skip
This section discusses a few other details on text justification which have
not been covered previously.  Recall that when text is being justified, SCRIBE
segments the input into &words&, which are strings of non-blank characters
delimited by blank(s) and/or carriage returns.  It then reassembles words into
lines of uniform length, inserting space(s) between words to pad the lines out
to the desired length.
$skip
$just
&Specifying Fixed Word Spacing&
$skip
Occasionally in justified text, it is necessary to have a fixed number of
space(s) between words.  This can be accomplished by typing a &backslash&
at points
where the printing of a space is desired.  The backslash will be converted to a
space when it is printed.  For example, in outline format, one typically wants
two spaces  between the number, e.g., "2)", and the first word of the entry.
Separating the number and the last word with two backslashes will do this.
$skip
&Spacing After Punctuation&
$skip
SCRIBE insures that there are at least 2 spaces after words ending
with the following characters: period (.), colon (:), question mark (?),
and exclamation point (!).  If only one space is desired after such a word, for
instance, between someone's initial and last name, it should be separated from
the next word by a single backslash.
$skip
$center
&UNDERLINING&
$skip
$just
If underlining is on (SCRIBE's default mode, or if an UNDERLINE ON command is in
effect), text enclosed in ampersands (&&) will be underlined, and the 
ampersands will be removed.  Spaces within text enclosed in ampersands are not
underlined.  Thus, "&&underlined text&&" will be printed as &underlined text&.
$skip
&Underlining Spaces&
$skip
If spaces are to be underlined, type backslashes instead of spaces within
ampersands.  The backslashes will be converted to spaces &and underlined&
on output.

When underlining is on, a double ampersand (&&&&) in the input will be converted
to a single ampersand on output, &even within text enclosed in single ampersands&.
Thus, "&&R&&&&D&&" will be printed as "&R&&D&".
$skip
&Method of Underlining&
$skip
SCRIBE normally underlines by printing the line of text, and then overprints
a line of underscores (_) and spaces.  This method produces correct output on
line printers, and almost all terminals.
$skip
SCRIBE can also underline by backspacing within the line, and then printing
underscores.  This is the only method which works on an IBM 2741
(Selectric)
terminal.  It also works on most other terminals, although not on line
printers.
$skip
The method used can be selected by a &switch&, which is input from the terminal
when SCRIBE is run.  Switches are described in the final section of this manual.
$skip
$center
&DECAPITALIZATION&
$SKIP
$JUST
If the terminal you are using for document preparation has both upper and lower
case, you can skip this section, since it is much easier to use the shift
key on your terminal than it is to enter the special characters indicating
character case to SCRIBE.  However, if all you have is an ASR33, or somehow
you get stuck on one to prepare your document, turn decapitalization on
with the DECAP ON command, and read on.
$skip
When decapitalization is on, output character case is determined by special
characters in the input (asterisks and atsigns), which are removed
before the text is output.  In actuality, SCRIBE &decapitalizes& all
alphabetic characters in this mode, except those modified by special characters,
which are &left alone&.  Thus, SCRIBE, in effect,
assumes that all text entered in this mode in upper case, and that the
special characters indicate which characters are not to be decapitalized.
$skip
&Capitalizing Single Characters&
$skip
Any character preceeded by an asterisk (*) will not be decapitalized, and
the asterisk will be removed from the text.  This is typically used to
capitalize the first character of a word, for example, at the beginning
of sentences, or in names.  To print a single asterisk, type a double
asterisk in the input.
$skip
&Capitalizing Strings&
$skip
All characters enclosed in atsigns (@) will not be decapitalized, and the
enclosing atsigns will be removed.  Strings enclosed in atsigns may 
contain any character (including blank), and may extend across multiple
input lines.
$skip
Within such strings, an asterisk is treated as a normal character, and is
printed.  Thus, you must indicate that characters are not to be decapitalized
by &either& enclosing them in atsigns, or by preceeding them with an asterisk,
&not& by doing both.
$skip
Anytime that decapitalization is on, to print a single atsign, type two 
atsigns in the input (even within strings enclosed in atsigns).
$skip
A good practice is to minimize the length of strings enclosed in atsigns,
perhaps to single words, but certainly to strings on one input line.  This
avoids errors, such as omitting the terminating atsign of a string when
entering the document, or inadvertantly inserting a string enclosed in 
atsigns within another string when modifying the document.
$skip
&Decapitalization and Underlining&
$skip
 It is important to note that decapitalization is performed &before&
underlining.  Thus, asterisks and/or atsigns effecting decapitalization should
occur within ampersands indicating underlining.  For example, type "&&*SMITH&&",
not "*&&SMITH&&", and type "&&@GOD@&&" rather than "@&&GOD&&@".
$SKI
&Special non-alphabetic translation&
$ski
When decapitalization is on, the following equivalences are established:
$ski
$ver
$tra '%' '\'
#[ --- {    #% --- ||     #] --- }    #^^ --- ~
$jus
$ski 
since most terminals without lower case do not have these
four characters.
A pound sign (#) preceding any other character has no effect. An 
asterisk (*) before the pound sign defeats pound sign processing;
i.e. "*#[" appears literally.
$ski
$cen
&CHARACTER COMMANDS&
$SKI
$JUS
Character commands invoke immediate special processing, similar to
underlining with "&&" and capitalizing with "@" and "*". The
general format is:
$ski
$ver
^^x <chars to be processed> ||x    (that's a vertical bar)    OR
^^nx <chars to be processed>
$ski
$jus
where x is the character command, and n is the number of characters
to process.
$ski
Four character commands are currently implemented: "a" for
superscripting ("above"); "b" for subscripting ("below"); "o" for
overlining; "u" for underlining. $CONTROL ON is specified to enable
character command processing. For example, to produce "^1oV^4binit",
the following sequences will work: "^^1oV^^binit||b"; "^^oV||o^^binit||b";
"^^oV||o^^4binit"; "^^1oV^^4binit".
$ski
When using the "^^nx" form of character commands, 
the special processing is terminated after n characters have
been processed, 
or by the end of the
line, &whichever comes first&. The "^^x .. ||x" form, however, may
extend over multiple lines.
$ski
As with ampersand underlining, decapitalization is performed first. For
example, to produce "^oV|o^4binit" above with $DECAP, use
"^^1O@V@^^BINIT||B".
$ski
If $CONTROL OFF has been specified, no character commands are processed,
and up-arrows and vertical bars are output normally. With $CONTROL ON,
double up-arrows and double vertical bars are converted to a single
arrow or bar. In addition, if the character following the up-arrow or
bar does not designate a character command, the text appears normally;
for example, "^Q" appears as "^Q" in the output.
$ski
Superscripting, subscripting, underlining, and overlining may be specified in
any combination for a given character. A superscripted subscript, or
a subscripted superscript, will appear as a normal character. 
Nesting of a single character function, however, does not work; a
subscripted subscript is subscripted only once, and the subscripting
interval ends at the first "||b",
or at the exhaustion of the innermost count, whichever occurs first.
$ski
Underlining using the "^^u" command works exactly like ampersand
underlining -- embedded spaces are &not& underscored, while backslashes
are normally converted to spaces &and underlined& (see TRANSLATE command).
Overlining, however, overlines &all spaces& within the field to be
overlined. To prevent overlining of spaces, you must use separate
intervals of overlining; for example, to write "^otwo|o ^ovectors|o", use
"^^otwo||o ^^ovectors||o".
$ski
A few more examples may make this feature clearer:
$ski
$ver
" ^^ovector^^bsub1||b||o"      becomes      ^ovector^bsub1|b|o
$ski
" ^^o&&double^^asuper||a&&||o"   becomes      ^o&double^asuper|a&|o
$ski
" FOO^^bsub^^aboth||bsuper||a" becomes      FOO^bsub^aboth|bsuper|a

&EXECUTING SCRIBE&
$skip
$just
When the document has been entered into a file, type:
$skip
$ver
$ind lef 10
RUN RND:SCRIBE
$ind lef 0
$skip
$just
to the monitor prompt (".") to run SCRIBE.
$skip
SCRIBE will then print its version information and prompt with an asterisk,
to which you type:
$skip
$center
[<printed document file>=]<input document file>[/<switch(es)>]
$jus
$skip
The <input document file> is the name of the file you have prepared,
containing text, commands, special characters, etc.  The <printed document
file>, if specified, is written by SCRIBE, and will contain the finished document.
If the <printed document file> is omitted, output will be written to the terminal.
All diagnostics generated by SCRIBE are printed on the terminal.
$skip
You can also generate output directly on the terminal by typing "TTY:"
as the <printed
document file>.  However, it is generally preferable to send output to a 
permanent file, except when producing the final copy, since you may wait for
most of the document to print before you discover that SCRIBE has detected
an error (and ruined the copy with a diagnostic).
$skip
SCRIBE assumes an extension of "TXT" for the output file and "SCR" for the
input file, so be sure you include
the extension if either of the files has a different one.
$skip
Switch(es) (separated from the input file by a slash or comma) may also be specified.
These are global formatting options, and are described in the next section.
Multiple switches are separated by commas.
$skip
After processing a file, SCRIBE will prompt with another asterisk, allowing
another file to be processed.
To return to the monitor prompt, type either a carriage return or break.
$page
$center
&SCRIBE SWITCHES&
$skip
$just
Switches are single alphabetic characters, which in some instances are followed
by one or more items, separated from the switch character by a colon.
Switches are separated by commas, and are preceeded by a slash, separating
them from the input file.  If no switches are to be entered, a carriage return
should be typed immediately after the input file.
$skip
$indent left 5
$par -5
B\\\\Backspace
$skip
SCRIBE normally underlines by overprinting a line of spaces and underscores.
If this switch is specified, SCRIBE will underline by backspacing within
the line of text, and then printing underscores.
$skip
$par -5
C\\\\Carriage Control
$skip
SCRIBE normally fills out pages with blank lines.  On line printers
and terminals with carriage control, this is time-consuming and unnecessary.
This switch causes SCRIBE to fill out pages by printing a form feed.
$skip
$par -5
D\\\\Dashes
$skip
This switch causes SCRIBE to print a line of dashes between pages, which
aids in bursting pages when the paper is not pre-folded.
$skip
$par -5
F\\\\Form-feed Before
$skip
This switch causes SCRIBE to print a form-feed before the first page, which
is an alternate way to line the paper up on terminals with carriage control.
Normally, you should line the paper up by positioning the paper after
entering information to the teletype prompt, and before hitting the carriage
return.
$skip
$par -5
L\\\\Print line numbers in margin
$skip
This switch causes SCRIBE to print the approximate line number
in the input file of every output line in the document. The line
number is printed left justified in the left margin, and thus if
the margin is too small to accomodate the number, it will not be printed
even though the L switch is specified.
SCRIBE's default margin of 5 is sufficient.
This switch is particularly useful when printing rough drafts as it
allows points where corrections are required to be rapidly
located when editing.
The line number printed is generally the input line containing the
&last& word of an output line, or the line after.
Thus, if the point requiring correction is not in the line indicated
in the margin, you should check the lines immediately preceding
it.
$skip
$need 4
$par -5
N\\\\No Underline
$skip
If this switch is specified, SCRIBE will perform underline processing
(removing ampersands, etc.) normally (as specified by UNDERLINE commands
in the input), but will not print underscores in the output.  This option
is useful on weird terminals which cannot handle underlining,
or do it
poorly (say by printing a back-arrow through the middle of characters
as does the ASR33), or if you just aren't interested in seeing the underlining.
$skip
$par -5
O:range [,range] ...\\\Output only
$skip
Specifies that only certain &physical& pages are to be output.
Note that the numbers specified do not necessarily refer to the numbers
printed in the document, but to physical pages in the output, starting with
1.
A range may take one of three forms:
$ind lef +2
$ver
integer-integer prints all pages in the range, inclusive.
integer-*       prints pages from "integer" to the last one.
integer         prints &only& the specified page.
$ind lef -2
$jus
Ranges should be non-overlapping, and specified in ascending order.  For
example, O:2,4-6,9-* would print physical pages 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 of
a ten page document.
$skip
$par -5
P\\\\Pause
$skip
If this switch is specified, SCRIBE will pause between output pages and
wait for a carriage return from the terminal before printing the next
page.  This option is useful when printing on non-continuous form paper
(such as letter-head paper), as it allows new pieces to be inserted in
the terminal between pages.
$skip
$INDENT LEFT 5
$par -5
S:integer\\\Start At
$skip
SCRIBE will not begin generating output until the physical page specified
by the integer after "S".
Thus, S:n is equivalent to O:n-*.
  This option is useful when initial pages have been printed 
correctly, and then an input or format error is detected.  Output
can be aborted, the error fixed, and then SCRIBE run again with the "S"
switch to avoid re-printing pages.
$ski
$par -5
T:string\\\Terminal Type
$ski
Specifies a set of special operations for the specified terminal.
At the moment, 'diablo' is the only terminal type supported; the
'/t:diablo' switch enables special control character output for
superscripting, subscripting, and overlining. On ADP, "$$CRT; LEN 0"
should be specified for proper operation.
