     TYM-Pascal Status Report, February, 1984

     The  TYM-Pascal  product  is  currently  available  for
internal  usage.  A reliable version should be ready for the
market by the end of April, 1984.  This will consist  of  of
the  TYM-Pascal  compiler  and debugger, un-optimized, and a
PDP10 code generator with  runtime  support  for  TYMCOM-10.
The  TYM-Pascal  Language  Reference  Manual  and TYM-Pascal
Compiler User Guide will be available in a SPOOLable  format
also by the end of April.

     Currently, the compiler is under development to  remove
the  remaining machine-dependencies from the "pure" modules.
All that remains is  to  finish  work  on  the  source  file
reader, about a week to complete and test.

     An effort is also being made  to  collect  the  command
processing,  syntax  analysis  and  listing modules into one
program both to simplify the overall  compiler  organization
and  to  speed  up the operation of the compiler.  Estimated
time is a week.

     The Language Reference Manual and Compiler  User  Guide
both  need  to  be  re-worked to include the latest compiler
features and to fix known inconsistancies in the  tables  of
contents  and  indexes.   This  should  take about a week to
complete.

     The QA  testing  system  is  very  unorganized  at  the
moment.   There  are  many test routines available, but they
have to be connected into a  workable  procedure.   Allocate
two weeks for this.

     The utility library  is  a  little  confused.   As  the
compiler  is  simplified,  certain  functions  are given the
status of "utility"  and  thus  removed  from  the  compiler
sources  to  the  utility  library.  This makes the compiler
sources simpler and  also  increases  the  capacity  of  the
utility  library.   The cleanup of the utility library is an
on-going project.  Release of the  library  to  the  general
users could happen sometime after April 1984.

     The intermediate form optimizer, PDP10 optimizing  code
generator,  TYMCOM-10  Overlay  Manager  and cross-reference
listing generators are not fully tested.

     We need to determine the legal status of the  VAX  code
generator, the 68000 code generator, SCRIBE, PMF, QED etc.
