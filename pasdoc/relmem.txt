          1  Release Schedule             _______ ________


          Version 2A(463) of  MDSI  Pascal  is  now  available  on  account
          [52250,261]  on  ADP  systems  12  and  13, along with compatible
          versions of the  Pascal  library  (PASLIB),  debugger,  utilities
          library  (RDLIB),  and  utilities.  If  no  serious  problems are
          reported, then between 5PM and 6PM on October  22  the  following
          events will occur:

           1. Version  1V(231)  of the compiler system will be removed from
              account [52250,234].
           2. Version 2(345) of the compiler  system  will  be  transferred
              from account [52250,220] to account [52250,234].
           3. Version  2A(463)  of  the compiler system will be transferred
              from account  [52250,261]  to  account  [52250,220].  Version
              2A(463)   will  also  remain  on  account  [52250,261]  until
              December 1,1982.

          This is an official release of  the  DEC-10  cross-compiler.  The
          version  of  the  compiler  in  the  release  account will not be
          changed after October 22 until the next official release.

          Independently and simultaneously, the following events will occur
          on the old VAX 11/780 running operating system V2.5:

           1. New  runtime  libraries  will  be  moved into the Development
              Software release account, DRA0:[250220].
           2. PASCAL Version 3, an MDSI Pascal VAX resident  compiler  will
              be  moved to the release account.  You will be able to invoke
              it by issuing the command "PASCAL" from any VAX account.  The
              VAX resident compiler generates code only for the VAX.

          A  release of the VAX resident compiler for operating system V3.0
          on the new VAX is tentatively scheduled for November 1, 1982.

          The VAX resident compiler  contains  the  same  enhancements  and
          modifications as the DEC-10 cross-compiler, with the exception of
          those changes related directly to the M68000 or the  DEC-10  code
          generators.  This  compiler  has  passed all Development Software
          internal tests but is still undergoing quality  assurance  tests.

          20 October, 1982


          Periodic  updates  will be made to the release account on the VAX
          as problems are reported and corrected.

          In the event that serious problems are encountered that  need  an
          immediate  solution,  contact  Paul  J.  Pinkstaff (ext.  57382).
          Otherwise, report any problems  encountered  with  the  compilers
          through  the  normal PCR procedure.  Be sure to state whether the
          PCR refers to the DEC-10 cross-compiler or to  the  VAX  resident
          compiler.

          If  this  schedule is changed, a message will be left in the file
          RELEAS.NOT[52250,261] on both system 12 and system 13.

          Code generated by version 2A of the compiler is  compatible  with
          code  generated  by  version  2 with one exception.  See "Linking
          PASCAL programs on the VAX", below.  Code generated for  the  VAX
          with Version 2A of the compiler is identical to code generated by
          the VAX resident compiler, therefore object modules  produced  by
          either compiler may be used interchangeably on the VAX.

          2  Source Code Changes Required             ______ ____ _______ ________


          Source  code changes are required to use either new compiler with
          existing source modules.  The changes are as follows:

           1. All references to the switch [NO]LIBRARY should be removed.
           2. The DATAMODULE  keyword  should  be  changed  to  the  MODULE
              keyword.
           3. Generic  arrays  can  no  longer  be used.  This affects only
              programs compiled for the DEC-10 systems.
           4. NEW no longer implicitly initializes  the  storage  allocated
              for  a  user.  Code  which relied on this initialization must
              perform explicit initialization.  For example,  when  NEW  is
              used  to allocate space for a record containing two numerical
              fields, the value of those fields will be  undefined.  If  an
              initial  value  of  zero is expected, instructions to set the
              fields to zero must be performed after the call to NEW.
           5. The Pascal  standard  procedure  EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  has  been
              changed.  Previously,  EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  wrote  a message to
              the user's terminal describing the exceptional condition last
              signaled.  Now,  EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  is a function returning a
              result  of  type  STRING.  Therefore,  to  achieve  identical
              functionality  using EXCEPTION_MESSAGE with the new compilers
              as with the old, the following source code change  should  be
              made:


                       Old                         New

                    exception_message;     writeln(tty,exception_message);

          3  Linking PASCAL programs on the VAX             _______ ______ ________ __ ___ ___


          Pascal  programs  compiled  for  the  VAX using either of the new
          compilers -- the new ADP  VAX  cross  compiler  or  the  new  VAX
          resident  compiler -- should be linked in the same manner as they
          always have been, using the predefined logical symbol "PLINK"  to
          specify  the  linker  options file.  However, to relink a program
          whose  main  program  has  not  been  recompiled,  or  has   been                 ____  _______
          recompiled  using  the  old  cross  compiler,  the logical symbol
          "OLDPLINK" should be used in place  of  "PLINK"  to  specify  the
          linker  options  file.  Once the main program has been recompiled
          with one of the new compilers, regardless of whether or  not  any
          other  modules  have  been  recompiled, "PLINK" should be used as
          usual.

          Note that there is no reason to relink a program  which  has  not
          been  recompiled.  The new version of the VAX PAXCAL runtime will
          automatically be used by all Pascal programs, regardless of  when
          or how they were linked.

          4  Enhancements and Modifications             ____________ ___ _____________





          4.1 :TARGET M68


          The  new  DEC-10 compiler fully supports the :TARGET M68 compiler
          command as well as the :TARGET VAX and :TARGET P10 commands.  The
          :TARGET  M68 command causes code to be generated for the Motorola
          68000.



          4.2 /[NO]EXTLENGTH(length)


          The new compiler switch, [NO]EXTLENGTH(length), allows  the  user
          to  specify  the number of characters which should be checked for
          uniqueness on  public  and  external  symbol  declarations.  This
          switch  causes  the  compiler  to  warn  the user when apparently
          unique symbols cannot be differentiated within the given  length.
          This  switch  is  useful  since  there  are  symbol length limits
          imposed by the linkers on different machines.

          Using the switch as follows:

               /EXTLENGTH(6)

          will cause the  compiler  to  warn  the  user  that  the  symbols
          PARSE_RECORD  and  PARSE_COMMAND  are not unique within the given
          length of 6 characters.

          The length given must be between 1 and 255.  NOEXTLENGTH  is  the
          default  and causes the use of the full length of the symbols for
          uniqueness checking.



          4.3 /RUN:file-name switch


          The  /RUN:file-name  switch,  implemented  only  on  the  DEC-10,
          directs  the  compiler  to  run  the specified file.  The default
          ersatz SYS:  is used  unless  some  other  device  or  ersatz  is
          specified.  If  a  PPN  is  specified,  the  device  must also be
          specified.  This switch is useful when the compiler is  run  from
          another program.  For example, at the end of the the command file
          read by the compiler, "/RUN:LINK"  would  run  the  linker.  This
          provides the ability to chain programs together.

          20 October, 1982


          4.4 /RUNOFFSET[:offset] switch


          The  /RUNOFFSET switch, implemented only on the DEC-10, specifies
          a CCL offset for the program specified with the /RUN switch.  The
          default  offset  is  0 if the /RUNOFFSET switch is not specified.
          The defaut is 1 if the [:offset] portion is left off the  switch.
          This  allows  the  use  of  the  standard  DEC  convention of CCL
          offsets.  An offset of 1 tells the program that it was  run  from
          another  program.  It  will will then look for a command file for
          input rather than prompting for input at a terminal.



          4.5 /NOSEARCH switch


          The  new  switch,  /NOSEARCH,  will  cancel  the  effect  of  any
          previously specified search list.



          4.6 [NO]LIBRARY switch removed


          The   /[NO]LIBRARY   switch  has  been  removed.  Library  search
          requests are emitted only for  main  program  compilations.  This
          switch should be removed wherever it is currently used.



          4.7 DATAMODULE keyword removed


          The  DATAMODULE  keyword  is  no  longer  valid.  MODULE has been
          generalized to not require any code in the module and thus  fills
          the  function  of the DATAMODULE keyword.  The DATAMODULE keyword
          should be changed to MODULE wherever it is currently used.



          4.8 EXCEPTION_MESSAGE change


          The Pascal standard procedure EXCEPTION_MESSAGE has been changed.
          Previously,  EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  wrote  a  message  to  the user's
          terminal describing  the  exceptional  condition  last  signaled.
          Now,  EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  is a function returning a result of type
          STRING.  Therefore,  to  achieve  identical  functionality  using
          EXCEPTION_MESSAGE  with  the  new  compilers as with the old, the
          following source code change should be made:











          MDSI Pascal Version 2A                                    Page 7
          20 October, 1982


                   Old                         New

                exception_message;     writeln(tty,exception_message);




          4.9 New warning messages


          Warning messages are now put out by the compiler when:

           1. Parentheses  are  not  used  around  each  level   of   array
              constructors or,
           2. Octal constants are specified in the form "<number>B".

          These  will  be errors in the next release of the compiler.  Full
          parenthisization will be necessary to avoid ambiguity when repeat
          counts are added to the language.



          4.10 Allocation using NEW


          NEW no longer initializes the storage it allocates to zero.  Code
          that relied on implicit initialization must now perform  explicit
          initialization.



          4.11 Generic arrays removed


          Generic arrays have been removed from the MDSI Pascal language.



          4.12 TTY and TTYOUTPUT


          The files TTY and TTYOUTPUT are now automatically associated with
          the user's terminal at the start of execution.  Any call to OPEN,
          RESET  or  REWRITE  specifying the user's terminal will associate
          the specified file variable with the  existing  input  or  output
          device.  Such  a  call will change the ASCII and RETRY options in
          accordance with the options parameter in  the  call.  The  user's
          terminal  will  never  be  closed;  CLOSE(TTY)  has no effect and
          CLOSE(TTYOUTPUT) has the same effect as BREAK(TTYOUTPUT).

          No changes are necessary to any existing program.

          20 October, 1982


          4.13 Improved compiler exception handling


          Exception handling has been incorporated in  all  passes  of  the
          compiler.  This  should  give the user more useful information in
          the case of a problem with the compiler.



          4.14 Improved assembly listing


          The assembly listings generated for any system  now  cleary  show
          all public symbols.

          5  Bug Fixes             ___ _____





          5.1 I/O fixes


          Many bugs on all systems have been fixed in the I/O routines.  In
          particular, the following changes have been made:

           1. EMPTY on a text or typed file opened for output only  on  the
              VAX  was not allowed.  The file association was incorrect and
              has been fixed.
           2. READs from a binary file opened for output only  on  the  VAX
              were allowed.  This has been corrected to result in an error.
           3. WRITEs  to a text or binary file opened for input only on the
              VAX were allowed.  This has been corrected to  result  in  an
              error.
           4. Reading  beyond  end  of  file  on  a binary file opened with
              update on the DEC-10 resulted in an illegal instruction.  The
              error condition is now handled properly.
           5. Attempting  to do a number of SEEKs on typed files on the VAX
              sometimes resulted in an integer overflow.  The  problem  has
              been fixed.
           6. Association  of  a  file  having a one character name did not
              work on the DEC-10.  It now works properly.
           7. Typed file reads were reading the minimum size  of  the  type
              rather  than  reading  the size needed for a variable of that
              type.  The correct amount of data is now read.
           8. Checking the status of  or  closing  a  file  after  an  open
              failure sometimes caused unexpected results.  Better checking
              is now done to  ensure  that  a  file  is  associated  before
              performing these operations.
           9. A  binary  file  read  on  the  VAX of a flex array now works
              properly.




          5.2 Compiler failures


          The compiler occasionally failed or reported unexpected assertion
          failures.  The following improvements have been made:

           1. Problems  with  the  compiler's  register handling caused the
              compiler to fail or to  generate  incorrect  code  at  times.
              These problems have been fixed.
           2. The   optimizing   code   generator's   recursive  processing
              sometimes would cause a PDL overflow.  This problem has  been
              resolved.

          20 October, 1982


           3. The statements:

                   X:=ADDRESS(Y);  Z:=X^;

              caused  the  compiler to attempt an illegal memory reference.
              It now works properly.
           4. The compiler attempted an illegal  memory  reference  on  the
              following sequence of code:

                   PROGRAM FOO;
                   EXCEPTION = EX1;
                   BEGIN  END.

              since  there  was  no  valid  definition  for  the  condition
              declaration.  This is now properly handled by the compiler.
           5. An ENVIRON command specifying a nonexistant environment  file
              is now handled properly by the compiler.
           6. A  SEARCH list specified before a :TARGET or :ENVIRON command
              now works properly.
           7. The  VAX  and  DEC-10  code  generators  reported   assertion
              failures processing aggregate constructors with trailing flex
              arrays.  Such constructors are now properly supported.
           8. ANDIF/OFIF boolean expressions passed as parameters now  work
              properly.  They did cause assertion failures.
           9. Using  a  TYPE  in  an external definition before it had been
              declared  caused  an  assertion  failure  in  the  VAX   code
              generator.  It now works properly.
          10. Attempting  to  pass  a  varying string to a FORTRAN external
              routine no longer results in an assertion failure in the  VAX
         code generator.
          11. PASS1 of the compiler no longer infinite loops on

                   WITH PTR(<expression>)

          12. An assertion failure no longer results from code like:

                   READ(<file of X>,<ptr to flex>^:
                         SIZE(<ptr to flex>^,LEN))





          5.3 Optimizing compiler incorrect code


          The  following  changes  have  been  made  in the optimizing-code
          generator:

           1. The call list of a procedure was being  built  backwards.  It
              is now properly generated.
           2. Incorrect   code   was   generated   for   "ptr_type(constant
              integer)".  The generated code is now correct.

           3. The instructions:

                   X:=Y;
                   A:=ADDRESS(X);

              assigned the address of Y to A rather than the address of  X.
              It now works properly.
           4. Incorrect   code  was  sometimes  generated  for  some  array
              subscript computations.  Now the array subscripts are handled
              properly.
           5. Incorrect code was generated for:

                   <ptr>:=PTR(<integer>-1);

              The correct code is now generated.
           6. Incorrect  code  was  sometimes generated because of improper
              handling of registers which at times caused register 15,  the
              Pascal  runtime PDA pointer, to be overwritten.  The register
              handling has been improved.




          5.4 Miscellaneous fixes



           1. An attempt to read or write a  flexible  argument  from/to  a
              binary  file  without  specifying  an  explicit  size was not
              diagnosed as an error  by  the  compiler.  The  compiler  now
              prints an error message when an explicit size is not given.
           2. PTR:=ADDRESS(procedure  name)  is  now  supported by the code
              generators.
           3. Passing a substring was not always handled properly.  Correct
              code is now generated.
           4. Constant  aggregate  constructors containing arrays sometimes
              did not  get  initialized  properly.  They  are  now  handled
              correctly.
           5. On  the  VAX,  FOR loops containing procedure calls in a main
              program did not work properly.  This has been corrected.
           6. On the VAX, assignment of a longword integer to a packed word
              field  is now handled properly when the field is unsigned but
              the expression is signed.
           7. On the VAX, packed fields in unpacked records are now  having
              their packed attribute taken into account.
           8. Sign/size  information is now correctly set for integer unary
              negation and absolute value.
           9. The VAX compiler generated code  to  compare  integer  values
              against (2**31)-1 and -2**32.  Limits of an arbitrary integer
              expression should be the min/max of a  machine  word  on  the
              target machine, not of the host.  This has been corrected.
          10. Runtime  value checks are no longer generated for scalar type
              conversion when "/NOCHECK" is specified.

          20 October, 1982


          11. Code for the coercion of  an  integer  to  a  scalar  is  now
              properly generated for the VAX.
          12. On  the  VAX,  nested  WITH statements were sometimes handled
              incorrectly.  This is fixed.
          13. Use of stack overflow conditions on the VAX  will  no  longer
              result  in undefined symbols in the link.  The stack overflow
              conditions will never be signaled.
          14. On the DEC-10, incorrect code was  generated  for  constructs
              like:

                   ORD(A^.B)

              where B is a pointer into a packed record.  It is now handled
              properly.
          15. Range checking is now done for <char>:=CHR(<integer>) on  the
              DEC-10.
          16. The   correct   code   is  now  generated  for  the  VAX  for
              <string>:=CHR(<integer>).
          17. Procedure and function variables were always passed as  value
              parameters on the DEC-10.  Passing them as VAR parameters now
              works properly.
          18. The upper bound word for a flex string parameter on  the  VAX
              had been missing.  This has been corrected.
          19. The    compiler   will   now   diagnose   references   to   a
              non-addressable flexible non-varying string  value  parameter
              when an addressable reference is required (e.g.  ADDRESS(FOO)
              or WRITE(<binary-file>,FOO)).
          20. Code generation for a call  to  SEARCH  has  been  corrected.
              Incorrect code had caused certain sets to not be found in any
              string.




          5.5 Debugger Fixes



           1. Use of the [file] option on the .DISPLAY PAGES[module@][file]
              command  no  longer  results in an improper termination error
              when it is used.
           2. In some cases the  stack  couldn't  be  displayed  completely
              after a program failure.  This has been fixed.
           3. A WITH command is now remembered across single steps.
