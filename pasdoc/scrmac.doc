The SCRMAC package is a set of PMF macros designed primarily for writing
section structured documents.  When using the macros PMF is used
as a preprocessor to Scribe.
#par()
The SCRMAC package provides three advantages in preparing documents:
#beginmargin(8,8)
#par(0,-4)
1.\\Key-in time is reduced; SCRMAC macros have the potential
to emit several Scribe commands for a single macro call.
#par(,-4)
2.\\The macros are flexible and permit easy changes to
the controlling parameters to allow variations in
designing documents, and yet
#par(,-4)
3.\\SCRMAC provides some standardization to document design.

#sect(General Information)
This section provides an overview of the use and
functions of the SCRMAC Package.
#beginlevel
#sect(Preparing to Use the SCRMAC Package)
When preparing a document for use with SCRMAC the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro
(described fully in Section 4.1.1) ^umust|u be called
^uexactly|u once at the beginning of the document.  This will
make the necessary initializations to SCRMAC and emit several
initializing Scribe commands which include the setting up of the
title, date, page number,
margins, page length, and page width.
#sect(Available Functions)
SCRMAC is set up primarily for use in designing section
structured documents.  <:#SECT:> is a macro which is provided
to flag and set up a new section of text.
#par()
The macros <:#BEGINLEVEL:> and <:#ENDLEVEL:> are used in
conjunction with <:#SECT:> to "level" sections (e.g., this section,
2.2\ Available\Functions, is one level below, i.e. contained in, the
section 2.\General\Information).
#par()
A macro <:#PAR:> is provided so that new paragraphs may be started
and spaced properly within sections.
#par()
For text which is desired to be put in Scribe's verbatim mode,
the paired macros <:#BEGINFIGURE:> and <:#ENDFIGURE:> may be used. In 
addition to emitting Scribe's $VERBATIM command they provide
indenting and spacing options.
#par()
For constructing lists of "items" the macros <:#BEGINITEM:>, <:#ITEM:>,
and <:#ENDITEM:> are provided.
#par()
Margins may be easily changed and reset using the <:#BEGINMARGIN:>
and <:#ENDMARGIN:> macros.
#par()
A macro called <:#APPENDIX:> is included so appendices may be
used in the document neatly.
They are handled very much like <:#SECT:> handles sections.
#par()
A macro called <:#TITLE_PAGE_1:> is provided to setup a a title page
for documents.
#par()
Level one section titles and appendix titles may be placed as footnotes
to the sections text by using the macro <:#FOOTNOTES:>.
#par()
A table of contents macro, <:#TOC:>, emits Scribe commands
which set up a table of contents containing entries
for each of the sections and appendices in the document.
#par()
A <:#MEMO:> macro is provided  to generate a standard
memo heading for memos.
#sect(Changing Default Values)
<:#DOCUMENT:> initializes many SCRMAC values used by other macros
in the SCRMAC package.  These initial values are called the
default values.  SCRMAC includes several macros which enable 
the user to change these default values to suit personal needs
if the default values set in <:#DOCUMENT:> are not convenient.
Default macros are provided to change section, paragraph,
figure,  item,  margin,  table of contents,  and tab default values,
and are called
<:#SECT_DEFAULT:>,
<:#PAR_DEFAULT:>,
<:#FIGURE_DEFAULT:>,
<:#ITEM_DEFAULT:>,
<:#MARGIN_DEFAULT:>,
<:#TOC_DEFAULT:>,
and <:#TAB_DEFAULT:>
respectively.
#sect(Resetting Default Values)
Once default values have been changed using a DEFAULT macro
they may be changed back to the values they had preceding 
the last DEFAULT macro call.  To do this the POP macro is 
used which corresponds to the DEFAULT macro used. (e.g., If
the <:#TAB_DEFAULT:> was used to change the tab default values,
then <:#TAB_POP:> macro will reset the default values to the 
values they held preceding the last <:#TAB_DEFAULT:> call.)
#endlevel

#sect(Operating Instructions)
This section describes the operating procedures for the SCRMAC Package.
#beginlevel
#sect(Where to Find SCRMAC)
The SCRMAC Package is actually a PMF library used by the PMF program
to preprocess a document for Scribe.
  The library, called 'SCRMAC.PML',
is available on ADP, account [52250,220], on TYMSHARE, account
[31024,320162], and on the VAX, account [250220].
#sect(Using SCRMAC)
Prepare the document using the SCRMAC macros and
place them in a file with the extension '.PMF'\.
#beginmargin(5,0)
#par(1,-5)
On ADP:
#par(,0)
Simply type
#beginfigure()
/SCRMAC[52250,220]  <filename>
#endfigure
at the monitor prompt, ".", where <filename> is the name of the file
containing your prepared text. (Note: <filename> is the name of the file
^uWITHOUT|u the extention.) The final Scribed text may then be found in
<filename>.TXT, where <filename> is as above.
#par(2,-5)
On TYMSHARE:
#par(,0)
Two steps are then required.  First, run PMF (DO PMF) and
enter the command line:
#beginfigure()
<filename>.TMP=<filename>/NOPASCAL/LIB:SCRMAC[31024,320162]
#endfigure
at PMF's prompt, "*".
The produced file, <filename>.TMP, may then be run through
Scribe (DO SCRIBE) by entering the command line:
#beginfigure()
<filename>.TXT=<filename>.TMP
#endfigure
at Scribe's prompt, "*".
  Your final Scribed document produced will then
be found in the file <filename>.TXT.
#par(2,-5)
On the VAX:
#par(,0)
At the monitor prompt, "$", type the line
#beginfigure()
@DRA0:[250220]SCRMAC <filename>
#endfigure
where <filename> is as above. The final Scribed text will then be found
in the file <filename>.TXT.
#endmargin
#endlevel
#sect(Macro Descriptions)
The SCRMAC maros are divided into two groups: 1) function macros
(macros which emit Scribe commands to perform a specific
function), and 2) default macros (macros used to change the
default values used by the function macros).
#beginlevel
#sect(Function Macros)
The following is a list of the function macros of SCRMAC.  If the 
macro has parameters they are listed and their function described.
If a parameter is omitted in a macro call
the action taken is detailed under
the macro description and is specific to that parameter of that macro.
#figure_default(4)
#beginlevel
$page
#sect(The %DOCUMENT Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#DOCUMENT:>(the_title,date,page_length,left_margin,page_width)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#DOCUMENT:> macro sets several document wide parameters and
must be called once at the beginning of the document.
The first parameter is the title;
the second parameter is the date (see below);
the third parameter is the page length;
the fourth parameter is the left margin size;
the fifth parameter is the page width (as would
be specified in a Scribe $WIDTH directive).
#par()
PMF text quotes ,'<:<:' and ':>:>', should be used to bracket any
parameter which includes commas.  For example, the date parameter
"June 22, 1981" should be specified in the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro as
follows:
#beginfigure()
<:#DOCUMENT:>(This Is The Title,<:<:June 22, 1981:>:>,,5)
#endfigure
#par(0)
Note in the above example that commas must be used to omit
any non-trailing parameters (above:page length is omitted).
#par()
<:#DOCUMENT:> emits several Scribe directives which set the
page length, the left margin size, the page width, the default
tab values, and also sets page numbering off (i.e., $NUMBER OFF).
A title directive is also emitted which places the title left 
justified and the date left justified
on the line below the title.
#par()
Default values used by <:#DOCUMENT:> for omitted parameters
are as follows:
#beginfigure()
the title        defaults to the null string;
the date         defaults to the null string;
the page length  defaults to 66;
the left margin  defaults to 10;
the page width   defaults to 75.
#endfigure
#par(0)
Omitting the title parameter causes the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro to  
omit the title, date, and page numbering throughout the document.
$pag
#sect(The %SECT Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#SECT:>(title)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#SECT:> macro should be used at the beginning of each section.
The title of the section is the only parameter.
#par()
The action of the <:#SECT:> macro is generally as follows: lines are
skipped before the section title using a $SKIP directive, the 
section number and title are then emitted, a table of contents 
entry is emitted, and a number of lines are skipped after the title
before the section text begins (using a $SKIP directive).
#par()
The number of lines skipped before and after the section title
varies depending on the current section level.  $SKIP directives
are emitted for skipping before and after section titles using
the current default values.
Initially the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro sets the default values as follows:
#beginfigure(,0)
Level One     pages before section title  - skips 2 lines after
Level Two     skips 3 lines before        - skips 2 lines after
Level Three   skips 2 lines before        - skips 1 line after
Level Four... same as Level Three
(for an explanation of Levels see <:#BEGINLEVEL:> macro description)
#endfigure
#par(,0)
NOTES:
#beginmargin(5,0)
#beginitem()
#item()The first line of the first paragraph of the section will be 
indented according to the current default value used by the
<:#PAR:> macro.
#item<:#SECT:> guarantees that ^uat least|u two lines of section text
will be on the same page as the section title.
#item()To start level one sections at the top of a new page
 the default value
for skipping before level one section titles must be equal to or
greater than the page length.
#enditem
#endmargin
$pag
#sect(The %BEGINLEVEL Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#BEGINLEVEL:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#BEGINLEVEL:> macro should be just before any <:#SECT:> macro
which begins a lower level section. It emits a Scribe $LEVEL +1 command
and internally keeps track of the current level for use by other macros.
#par()
In case the idea of levels is still confusing here is a short example:
A lower level section is one which is contained in the section above it.
 For
example, we have a Level One section entitled "The Alphabet", i.e.,
#beginfigure()
2.  The Alphabet
#endfigure
Two sections in "The Alphabet" may be "The Consonants" and "The Vowels".
They would be at Level Two (one level below "The Alphabet") and 
would be titled as follows:
#beginfigure()
2.1  Consonants
2.2  Vowels
#endfigure
Two sections in the section "Vowels" may be "The Letter A" and
"The Letter E".  These two sections would be Level Three 
sections and would be titled as follows:
#beginfigure()
2.2.1  The Letter A
2.2.2  The Letter E
#endfigure
#par()
After the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro the level is automatically set to
Level One; therefore, it is ^unot|u necessary to use a
<:#BEGINLEVEL:> macro before Level One sections.  Also it should
^uonly|u be used when a new level is started, not before each
lower level <:#SECT:> call (i.e., a <:#BEGINLEVEL:> should be
used before the <:#SECT:>(Consonants) macro call, but ^unot|u 
before the <:#SECT:>(Vowels) macro call).
$pag
#sect(The %ENDLEVEL Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#ENDLEVEL:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#ENDLEVEL:> macro should be used whereever the section level
should increase.  The Scribe directive $LEVEL -1 is emitted and
internal bookkeeping is done.
#par()
Using the example in the <:#BEGINLEVEL:> description, after the 
last section in 2.1 Consonants, say "The Letter Z" section, the 
<:#ENDLEVEL:> macro should be used to return to Level Two from
Level Three before the <:#SECT:> (Vowels) is used.
#sect(The %PAR Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#PAR:> (lines_before, first_line_indentation)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#PAR:> macro should be used at the beginning of a
paragraph which is ^unot|u the first paragraph of a section
(i.e., it should be used to separate pargraphs within 
sections).  The first parameter is the number of spaces to
skip before the beginning of the new paragraph text.  The second 
parameter is the number of spaces to indent the first line
of the paragraph.
#par()
<:#PAR:> emits Scribe commands which do the necessary
spacing and indenting using the $SKIP and $PARAGRAPH
directives.  <:#PAR:> also assures that ^uat least|u the
first two lines of the paragraph will be on the same page.
#par()
If either of the parameters are omitted <:#PAR:> will use the
current <:#PAR:> default value corresponding to the omitted parameter.
<:#DOCUMENT:> initially sets
these default values to skip one (1) line before the new
paragraph,
 and not indent the first line (indentation\=\0).
These default values may be changed using the <:#PAR_DEFAULT:>
macro. If the user wishes to omit both parameters <:#PAR():>
should be used, thus forcing <:#PAR:> to use both of the
current default values.
$pag
#sect(The %BEGINFIGURE Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#BEGINFIGURE:> (lines_needed, indentation,
				   lines_before, lines_after)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#BEGINFIGURE:> macro may be used before text requiring Scribe's
verbatim mode.  The first parameter, if given, will be used as
the argument for the $NEED directive to insure enough lines remain for
the figure before a page break;
 if omitted, no $NEED
directive will be omitted.  The second parameter
is the relative number of spaces the figure should be indented.
The third parameter is the number of lines to skip before the 
figure, and the fourth parameter is the number of lines to
skip after the figure.
#par()
The initial default values for the second and 
third parameters are 5 and 1,
respectively.
 The current default values for these parameters will be used if a
parameter is not explicitly given
in the <:#BEGINLEVEL:> call.  If the fourth parameter is omitted,
but the third parameter is given, the number of lines skipped after
the figure will be the same as before the figure;  if both 
parameters are omitted default values will be used.  These default 
values may be changed using the SCRMAC <:#FIGURE_DEFAULT:> macro.
#sect(The %ENDFIGURE Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#ENDFIGURE:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#ENDFIGURE:> macro must be used following any verbatim
text which was preceded by the <:#BEGINFIGURE:> macro.  There
are no parameters required.  <:#ENDFIGURE:> emits Scribe 
directives to skip lines after the verbatim text, readjust
the indentation, and begin to justify  the text again.
$pag
#sect(The %BEGINITEM Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#BEGINITEM:>( text_indentation, skip_before_each_item,
	    start_number, skip_before_list, skip_after_list)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#BEGINITEM:> macro is used before a section of text in which
the <:#ITEM:> macro is used to form a list of items.
There are five possible parameters to the macro which all use
default values if the parameter is not explicitly given with
the macro call.
The first parameter to <:#BEGINITEM:> is the relative indentation of the
text of an item.
The second parameter is the number of lines to be skipped
before ^ueach|u item in the list.
The third parameter is the number of the first item of the list.
If the user does not wish to have the items of the list numbered,
 then 
zero (0) should be specified as the parameter. 
If the list to follow is a continuation of the last list, then 
specifying a negative number as the parameter will continue the
consecutive numbering from the previous lists last number.
The fourth and fifth parameters specify the number of lines to be
skipped before the first item of the list, and after the last item
of the list respectively.
#par()
The initial default values for the <:#BEGINITEM:> parameters are set
in <:#DOCUMENT:> and will perform the following actions if used:
the text of an item will be indented four spaces from the current
 margins;
no lines will be skipped before individual  items;
numbering of items will be turned on and will begin with one (1);
one line will be skipped before the first item of the list;
one line will be skipped after the end of the list.
The default values for <:#BEGINITEM:> may be changed by using the 
<:#ITEM_DEFAULT:> macro.
$pag
#sect(The %ITEM Macro)
#beginfigure()
<:#ITEM:>( label )
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#ITEM:> macro is used to specify items of a list.
The only parameter is a label for the item.
If a label is given it will be placed to the left of the item text
following the item number (if items are being numbered).
Labels will be used only if given explicitly with the macro call;
<:#ITEM():> should be used if no label is desired.
#par()
When using the <:#ITEM:> macro, text for the item should
immediately follow the closing parenthesis of the <:#ITEM:> macro call:
#beginfigure()
<:#ITEM:>()this text immediately follows the macro call
<:#ITEM:>() this text does not immediately follow the macro call
#endfigure
If a space is placed between the closing parenthesis and the beginning
of the item text then the text indentation can not be guaranteed to be
consistantly correct.
#par()
Four types of lists may be formed using the ITEM macros.
For examples of the different types of lists see
"A Sample Using SCRMAC" at the end of the User's manual.
#sect(The %ENDITEM Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#ENDITEM:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#ENDITEM:> macro is placed at the end of a list which began
with the <:#BEGINITEM:> macro.
It will make necessary adjustments to return to normal text
justification and save the last item number in case the list
numbering is to be continued
with the next list.
<:#ENDITEM:> has no parameters.
$pag
#sect(The %BEGINMARGIN Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#BEGINMARGIN:>(left indent, right indent,
			      skip before, skip after)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#BEGINMARGIN:> marco is used around blocks of text that should be
indented relative to the current margins. The block of text enclosed
between<:#BEGINMARGIN:> and <:#ENDMARGIN:> macros will be indented
from both the left and right margins according to the user's 
specifications (or the current default values if
a parameter is omitted by the user).
The
first parameter is the number of spaces from the left margin
to indent.  The second parameter is the number of spaces from 
the right margin to indent.  The third parameter specifies 
the number of lines to skip
after the <:#BEGINMARGIN:> call, and
the fourth parameter specifies the number of lines to skip 
after the <:#ENDMARGIN:> call.
#par()
Any or all of the first three parameters may be omitted,
in which case the current default value for the
corresponding parameter will be
used.  If the third parameter is given but the fourth
omitted, the number of lines skipped after the <:#ENDMARGIN:> call
 will be the same as those skipped after the <:#BEGINMARGIN:> call.
  If both the third and fourth
parameters are omitted, both current default values are used.  If all
parameters are omitted "<:#BEGINMARGIN():>" should be used.
The default values, initially set in <:#DOCUMENT:> to be 
5, 5, 1, and 1 respectively, may be changed by using the 
<:#MARGIN_DEFAULT:> macro.
#sect(The %ENDMARGIN Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#ENDMARGIN:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#ENDMARGIN:> macro, pairing with a <:#BEGINMARGIN:> call, 
will restore the margins to the columns to which they were
set immediately before its matching <:#BEGINMARGIN:> call.
There are no parameters to <:#ENDMARGIN:>.
$page
#sect(The %APPENDIX Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#APPENDIX:> (the_title)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#APPENDIX:> macro is used to generate an appendix heading.
Its only paramter is the appendix title.  The Scribe commands 
emitted will page, skip two lines, write a title, do a table
of contents entry, and skip two lines before the appendix text.
The first line of the text following the appendix title is
indented as it is for the <:#SECT:> macro.
#par()
The title used in both the text and in the table of contents
is the ^uexact|u title given as the parameter to <:#APPENDIX:>.
If the user wishes the title to read "Appendix A - Letter Games"
it must be stated explicitly as the parameter.
#sect(The %TITLE_PAGE_1 Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#TITLE_PAGE_1:>( title1, title2, foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4 )
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#TITLE_PAGE_1:> macro is used to generate a title page for a 
document. There are six possible parameters to the macro, all of 
which default to the null string if not given explicitly. The first and
second parameters, if given, will be placed centered on the page
approximately one third down the page with one line separating them.
The last four parameters will be placed each on separate lines, left
justified, approximately ten lines from the bottom of the page.
#par()
The <:#TITLE_PAGE_1:> macro may be placed in only two locations
in the original text:   ^uimmediately|u after
the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro , or as the last line of the text after the 
<:#TOC:> macro.
If it is not placed in one of these two places the page numbers
of the final document may not be correct.
#par()
 For an
example of how the title page is formatted by the <:TITLE_PAGE_1:>
macro see the example document "A Sample Using SCRMAC" at the
end of the User's Manual.
$pag
#sect(The %FOOTNOTES Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#FOOTNOTES:>( instruction )
#endfigure
#par()
The <:#FOOTNOTES:> macro is used to have level one section
titles and appendix titles placed as footnotes on the bottom of
pages containing the section's text. The only parameter to the macro
is an instruction to tell where to place the footnote on the page.
Possible instructions for <:#FOOTNOTES:> are: "LEFT" to have the
 footnotes placed left justified; "CENTER" to have the footnotes 
centered between the margins; "RIGHT" to place the footnotes right
justified. The instruction "OFF" will turn the printing of footnotes
off on subsequent pages.
(Instructions to <:#FOOTNOTES:> may be in either upper or lower case.)
#par()
It is recomended that if the <:#FOOTNOTES:> macro is used that
all  level one sections be started on a new page. This will insure that
the footnotes and the sections on a page correspond.
#sect(The %TOC Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#TOC:>
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#TOC:> macro is used to generate a table of contents and 
should be the last line of the document file.  It has no
parameters.  It emits Scribe commands to generate a
"nice looking" table of contents.
#par()
Level 3, Level 4,..., Level n table of contents entries are indented
to the right relative to section entries of the next lower level.
The initial indentation default value is a  three
 space quantum for each
level over Level 2. This value may be changed using the
<:#TOC_DEFAULT:> macro.
$pag
#sect(The %MEMO Macro)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#MEMO:> ( to, from, date, subject, CC)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:MEMO:> macro can be used to generate a standard memo heading.
The parameters above, from left to right, correspond to: the person
or group the memo is addressed to; the person or 
group sending the memo; the date of the memo; the topic of the memo;
and, if needed, who gets carbon copies of the memo.
#par()
This is the only SCRMAC macro that does ^unot|u need to be
preceded by the <:#DOCUMENT:> macro as long as no other scrmac macros
are used to produce the memo.
The only optional parameter is the "CC" parameter. If omitted <:MEMO:>
will omit the corresponding heading line on the memo heading.
#endlevel
$pag
#sect(Default and Pop Macros)
#par()
The DEFAULT macros are used to change the default values of
macros which are initially set in <:#DOCUMENT:>.  Each
DEFAULT macro also has a corresponding POP macro which 
restores the default values back to their values immediately
before the last matching DEFAULT call.
A POP macro should never be used without being preceded by a matching
DEFAULT macro.
#par()
If a parameter is omitted in a DEFAULT call the default value
for that parameter remains unchanged unless otherwise noted.  POP macros
have no parameters.
#beginmargin(10,,0,0)
#par(,-7)
NOTE:\\A default value is used by a macro only if two conditions hold:
1)\a parameter is omitted in the macro call, and
2)\ the parameter has a corresponding default value. If a 
parameter is given explicitly in a macro call, the given 
 will ^ualways|u override the default value for the
parameter.
#endmargin

	      skip before Level 3+ section titles,
	      skip after  Level 3+ section titles)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#SECT_DEFAULT:> macro should be used to reset the default values
used by <:#SECT:> to space around section titles.  The first, third,
and fifth parameters, if specified, will change the default values 
for the number of lines skipped ^ubefore|u the section titles for
Levels One, Two and Three or greater, respectively.  Similarly, the
second, fourth and sixth parameters, if given, will change the
default values for the number of lines specified ^uafter|u the 
section titles for Levels One, Two and Three or greater, respectively.
<:#SECT_POP:> is the restoring macro.
$pag
#sect(The PAR Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#PAR_DEFAULT:> (skip before, indent first line)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#PAR_DEFAULT:> macro will set new default values
for those used with the <:#PAR:> macro.  The first parameter,
if given, changes the default value used to skip lines
before the paragraph text is started.  The second parameter,
if specified, changes the default indentation for the first line
of the paragraph (this default value is also used by <:#SECT:>
to indent the first line of the first paragraph of the new section).
<:#PAR_POP:> is the restoring macro.
#sect(The FIGURE Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#FIGURE_DEFAULT:> (new indentation, lines before, lines after)
#endfigure
#par (0)
The <:#FIGURE_DEFAULT:> macro sets new default values for
those used by <:#BEGINFIGURE:> and <:#ENDFIGURE:>.  The first
parameter changes the number of spaces the verbatim text
is indented if it is specified.  The second and third
parameters change the default values for the number of lines
skipped 
after the <:#BEGINFIGURE:> call and after the <:#ENDFIGURE:> call
respectively.
<:#FIGURE_POP:> is the restoring macro.
#sect(The ITEM Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0

<:#ITEM_DEFAULT:> ( text_indentation, skip before each item,
                  start number, skip before list, skip after list)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:ITEM_DEFAULT:> macro allows the user to change the default
values associated with the ITEM macros. The first parameter to the
macro changes the relative indentation of the item text. The second
parameter allows the user to change the number of lines skipped
before each item of the list.
 The third parameter will change 
the number of the first item of the list; if zero is specified
the default value will be to turn numbering off, if negative
list numbering will default to continuing numbering from the last list.
The fourth parameter to <:#ITEM_DEFAULT:> changes the number of lines
skipped before the first item on the list. The last parameter
specifies the number of lines to skip after the list.
<:#ITEM_POP:> is the restoring macro.
#sect(The MARGIN Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#MARGIN_DEFAULT:> (new_left, new_right,
				  lines before, lines after)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#MARGIN_DEFAULT:> macro changes the default values used by
the <:#BEGINMARGIN:> and <:#ENDMARGIN:> macros.  The first and second
parameters specify the number of spaces the margins will be 
indented relative to the current margins for the left and right
margins respectively.  The third parameter, if given, will
change the number of lines to skip after the <:#BEGINMARGIN:> call.
  If the fourth parameter is given, its value will be used 
for the number of lines to skip after a <:#ENDMARGIN:> is found.
The <:#MARGIN_POP:> macro is the restoring macro.
#sect(The TAB Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#TAB_DEFAULT:> (tab 1, tab 2,..., tab 8)
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#TAB_DEFAULT:> macro enables the user to change the initial
standard tab stop settings of 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57 and 65.
  Scribe allows
users to set up to eight tab stops, therefore eight parameters
are possible (tab 1,..., tab 8).  In accordance with Scribe, all
tabs encountered after the last tab stop specified will be
treated as blanks.  When changing the tab stop default values
all eight parameters need not be specified; however, only
trailing parameters may be omitted.  For example, if
#BEginfigure()
 <:#TAB_DEFAULT:> (10, 20, 30)
#endfigure
 is specified, the Scribe command emitted will be:
#beginfigure()
 $TABS    10, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35
#endfigure
<:#TAB_POP:> is the restoring macro.
#sect(The TOC Default and Pop Macros)
$par 0
#beginfigure()
<:#TOC_DEFAULT:> ( new level 3...N toc indentation quantum )
#endfigure
#par(0)
The <:#TOC_DEFAULT:> macro is used to change the indentation of
Level 3 ... Level N section titles in the table of contents. 
Beginning with  Level 3 section titles, the table of
contents entries are
indented to the right one indentation quantum for each successive
higher level section title.
There is only one parameter to this macro and it corresponds to the
new indentation quantum for these table of contents entries.
<:#TOC_POP:> is the restoring macro.
(See this document's table of contents to see how the indenting works.)

#sect(Helpful Hints for Using SCRMAC)
#beginitem(,1)
#item()SCRMAC macros may be used in upper or lower case, but
^uNO|u abbreviations are recognized.
#item()When omitting parameters two successive commas should be
used for non-trailing parameters and a right
parenthesis used for trailing
parameters.
#item()If a parameter contains a comma the parameter should be
enclosed in PMF text quotes: "<:<:" and ":>:>".
$control off
#item()The ampersand "<:&&:>" is a special function character used by the
PMF processor, and therefore use of ampersands should be avoided
in the text.  All underlining should be done with the ^u, |u pair
(i.e., to capitalize string enter <:^ustring|u:>).  If an
ampersand is necessary in the final text it should be doubled ^uand|u
enclosed in PMF text quotes ( i.e., <:<:&&&&:>:> ).
$control on
#item()The literals "<:#title:>" and "<:#date:>" may be used anywhere in the
document and when processed they will be expanded into the title and
date parameters of the <:#document:> macro. If they are used as part
of a parameter to another macro the ^ufirst|u character of that parameter
^umust|u be a quote, '"'.
These literals are particularly useful as parameters to the title page
macro.
#item()If the user does not wish to use the title/date format provided
by SCRMAC and likes another format better, an explicit Scribe
"$TITLE" directive should be placed immediatly following the
<:#DOCUMENT:> macro call with the prefered format.
#item()If there is ever a need to extend a parameter list for a macro over
 more than one line, an ampersand, "<:&&:>", should be used
as the ^ulast|u character of the line to be continued.
#item()If the user wishes to indent lower level sections it
may be done using the <:#BEGINMARGIN:> macro with the <:#SECT:> macros,
or by explicitly putting the Scribe directive $POSITION at
the beginning of the original document text.
#item()The use of SCRMAC macros in no way limits the user to use
only SCRMAC emitted Scribe commands.  All Scribe directives 
may be used explicitly by the user if desired, with the only
exceptions being those already noted.
#item()If there is a need to put a SCRMAC macro name into a document,
it must be enclosed in PMF text quotes if it is preceded by
a pound sign ('#').
#item()When usng QED to edit the ".PMF" file containing the macros
it may be convienient to use the
#beginfigure()
SET MARK <::#SECT(:>:
#endfigure
command, and then use the
#beginfigure()
BOUND /<section title>/
#endfigure
command to bound your working area to one section.
(The letter case of "<:#SECT:>"  in the "SET MARK" command  ^umust|u match
 the case in your file exactly.  It is recommended that if this is used
 that all  "<:#SECT:>" macro calls use the same case, either upper or
 lower.)

%SECT(Explaining Some SCRMAC Macros)
In the following document I will try to explain the
uses of some of the SCRMAC macros used when preparing 
a document.
The best way to use this example is to look at the text
containing the SCRMAC macro calls while reading this
final Scribed text.
%PAR()
For starters this section is a Level 1 section. The
sections to follow (1.1 ... 1.4) are Level two sections
and in order to get to Level 2  I must use a
<:%BEGINLEVEL:> macro. 
%BEGINLEVEL
%SECT(The DOCUMENT MACRO)
The <:%DOCUMENT:> macro is used in this document giving
a  title and a date (enclosed in PMF text quotes,
'<:<:' and ':>:>', because the date parameter contains
a comma).  The third parameter is omitted and thus the
page length will default to 66 lines. The fourth
parameter sets the left margin to 15 spaces instead of
the default value of 10. Since the last parameter is
not given the right paren is used to omit trailing
parameters and thus the page width will be set to its
default value of 75.
%SECT(The TITLE_PAGE_1 Macro)
Following the <:%DOCUMENT:>  macro is the
<:%TITLE_PAGE_1:> macro. There are ^uonly|u two places
this macro may be used: immediately following the
<:%DOCUMENT:> macro, or after the <:%TOC:> macro as
the last line of the document.
%PAR()
In this example I have used all six possible parameters
to the macro to illustrate how they are all placed on
the title page. All the parameters of this macro are
optional and if not given will default to the null
string\-\however if null, they ^uwill|u still take up
a line on the page.
%PAR()
Take note of the parameter list of this macro. The
first parameter uses the '<:%title:>' literal which
holds the title of  the document as given to the
<:%DOCUMENT:> macro. The last parameter uses the
'<:%date:>' literal for the date of the document.
If these literals are used as a parameter or part of a
parameter to a macro the ^uvery|u first character of
the paramater ^umust|u be a quote, '"', as done in the
<:%TITLE_PAGE_1:> macro. Also the parameter list for
the macro is spread out over three lines. To do this
an ampersand ^umust|u be the last character
on the lines that are to be continued.
%PAR()
Notice in the preceding paragraphs the use of "^^u" and
"||u" for  underlining the words "only", "will",
"very", and "must". This method ^uis|u necessary.
Using ampersands to ^uunderline|u will usually not work
correctly because they are a special character used for
other purposes by the PMF preprocessor.
%SECT(The FOOTNOTES Macro)
After the <:%TITLE_PAGE_1:> macro I have used the
<:%FOOTNOTES:> macro. This will put level one section
titles and appendix titles as  footnotes at the bottom
of all pages containing text for these sections.
I have specified that I want my footnotes to be on the
"LEFT"; they may also be "CENTER"ed or
put on the "RIGHT".
%PAR()
It is recommended that if footnotes are used that level
one sections are always started on the top of a new
page. This will insure that the footnotes will
correctly reflect the section on the page. If  level
one sections are not started at the top of a new page,
footnotes can not be guaranteed to correspond to the
section(s) of text on the page.
%SECT(The SECT Macro)
The <:%SECT:> macro is used to begin sections. The
section title is printed with the section number and
also a table of contents entry is made for the section.
Section numbers are handled by SCRMAC and Scribe so the
only parameter to the <:%SECT:> macro is the title.
Spacing around the section titles is handled by
<:%SECT's:> current default values and may be
controlled by the user (Section 2.).
%PAR()
%SECT(The PAR Macro)
Next, notice the use of the <:%PAR:> macro. Paragraphs
immediatly following section titles will automatically
be indented according to the first line indentation
default value ( I changed my default value  from zero
to four using a DEFAULT macro - explained in
Section 2.1\). Paragraphs not following section titles
may be started using the <:%PAR:> macro. The one used
above with no parameters, <:%PAR():>, will use the
current default values to skip one line and indent the
first line four spaces.
%PAR()
Now I am ready to end Section One and return to Level
one. To return to Level one I use the <:%ENDLEVEL:>
macro. Following the end of this section I will begin a
new Level one section, Section Two.
%ENDLEVEL
%SECT(Using Default And Pop Macros)
%BEGINLEVEL
%SECT(Default Macros)
Default macros are used to change the current default
values used by a macro. Initially the default values
are set by the <:%DOCUMENT:> macro, but they may be
changed by the user at any point in the document.
%PAR()
The <:%PAR_DEFAULT:> macro used in the beginning of
this document changes the default value for the first
line indentation of paragraphs used by the <:%PAR:>
macro. <:%DOCUMENT:> initially sets the default values
to skip one line before the new paragraph, and to 
leave the first line of the paragraph without any
indentation (indentation=0). The macro used above will
leave the lines skipped unchanged, but changes the
indentation to four. Now when <:%PAR:> is used with no
parameters, <:%PAR():>, it will be the same as using
<:%PAR(1,4):>.
%SECT(The Pop Macros)
To change <:%PAR's:> default values back to their
values before the last <:%PAR_DEFAULT:> macro call,
the <:%PAR_POP:> macro should be used
(^uNot|u <:%PAR_DEFAULT(1,0):> !!). I will use the
<:%PAR_POP:> macro after this paragraph to show the
default values are changed back to one and zero.
%PAR_POP
%PAR()
Notice that this is the beginning of the new paragraph,
but the default indentation is changed back to zero.
I would really like my paragraphs indented so I will
use another <:%PAR_DEFAULT:> macro call to change the
indentation from zero to six.
%PAR_DEFAULT(,6)
%ENDLEVEL
%SECT(Figure and Margin Macros)
The Figure and Margin macros can be very useful for
handling certain situations encountered while preparing
a document.
%BEGINLEVEL
%SECT(The Figure Macros)
The Figure macros,<:%BEGINFIGURE:> and <:ENDFIGURE:>,
are used in pairs around text that should be put in
Scribe's verbatim mode (this may include a figure,
example command lines, etc. the user does not want
incorporated into Scribed paragraphs). To illustrate
the use of the Figure macros here is an example:
%BEGINFIGURE(14,,,2)
*--------------------------------------------------*
|                                                  |
|   the first parameter guarantees I have 14 lines |
|   before the end of the page so my figure is not |
|   split between pages.                           |
|                                                  |
|   the figure will be indented the default of     |
|   five spaces from the left margin.              |
|                                                  |
|   as specified by the fourth parameter of the    |
|   macro call, two lines will be skipped after    |
|   the <:%ENDFIGURE:> call.                           |
|                                                  |
*--------------------------------------------------*
%ENDFIGURE
After the <:%ENDFIGURE:> call I return to the Scribe
justification mode.
%SECT(The Margin Macros)
The Margin macros, <:%BEGINMARGIN:> and <:%ENDMARGIN:>,
can be useful for indenting sections of text relative
to the current margins. The Margin macros have been
set up so nesting of the macros is allowed (see below
for an example).
%BEGINMARGIN()
Here we have moved our margins in on both sides five
spaces relative to the old margins (five is the
default value).
%BEGINMARGIN(10,0)
Now the left margin is moved in ten more spaces, while
the right margin is unchanged. This was done by
specifying explicitly in the <:%BEGINMARGIN:> call
that these indentations were wanted. Also notice a line
is skipped after the <:%BEGINMARGIN:> call. A line will
also be skipped after each <:%ENDMARGIN:> call (one
skipped line is the default for both after the
<:%BEGINMARGIN:>, and after the <:%ENDMARGIN:>).
%ENDMARGIN
Now we are back out to the first indentation after
using <:%ENDMARGIN:>. I would also like to point out
that the other macros may be used within the new
margins.
%PAR()
New paragraphs may be started, and anything else that
may normally be used with SCRMAC may be used within
the new margins.
%ENDMARGIN
Now that I am back to the original margins I will end
my discussion of the Margin macros.
%ENDLEVEL
%SECT(The ITEM Macros)
In this section I would like to illustrate how the ITEM
macros can be used to produce four types of lists by
varying the parameters to the ITEM macros.
%BEGINLEVEL
%SECT(Numbered Lists)
The first and probably most common type of list is one
with a number associated with each item of the list:
a numbered list. The following is a simple example of
this type of list:
%BEGINITEM()
%ITEM()the first item
%ITEM()the second item
%ITEM()the third item
%ITEM()this fourth item is very long to show how
the second line of an item is handled.
%ENDITEM
%PAR(0)
Notice that all the default values were used in the
<:%BEGINITEM:> macro call. Also notice that the text of
the items ^uimmediately|u follow the closing
parenthesis of the <:%ITEM:> macro call. This  will
insure that the indentation  of the item
text is correct.
The fourth item shows how multi-line items are indented.
Multi-line items are handled similarly for the first three
types of lists (Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3).
%SECT(Lists With Numbers and Labels)
In this section I will show a list with both numbers
and labels on items of the list. For this type of list
the item text indentation will usually have to be
increased to accommodate both the item number and the
item label, and not run over into the item text area.
%BEGINITEM(10)
%ITEM(MDSI)Manufacturing Data Systems, Inc.
%ITEM(ANC)Advanced Numerical Control
%ITEM(PDT)Product Development and Technology
%ENDITEM
%SECT(Lists With Labels Only)
In this example only labels will be placed before the
item text(no  numbers). In order to do this zero must
be specified for the  "start\number" parameter in the
<:%BEGINITEM:> macro call to turn off the numbering
of items.
%BEGINITEM(5,,0)
%ITEM(I)Roman numeral one.
%ITEM(II)Roman numeral two.
%ITEM(III)Roman numeral three.
%ITEM(IV)Roman numeral four.
%ENDITEM
%PAR(0)
Notice that the indentaton was again increased to make
room for the label. The default indentation is
initially set up to accommodate a list with numbers
only.
%SECT(Lists With No Numbers or Labels)
The last type of list is a special case of the <:ITEM:>
macro. When an item does not have a number or label put
before the item text the first line of item text is not
indented, but any subsequent lines of text for the same
item are indented the specified amount. Here is an
example of this type of list:
%BEGINITEM(10,1,0)
%ITEM()This is the first item of the list.
%ITEM()This is the second item of the list which should
require more than one line thus showing how these types
of items are indented.
%ENDITEM
%ENDLEVEL
%SECT(The Table of Contents Macro)
The last macro I would like to show you is the <:%TOC:>
macro. It is placed  after the last line of document
text. For every <:%SECT:> title and every <:%APPENDIX:>
title (of which I have none in this document - see
SCRMAC User's Manual for an example) an entry will be
put in the table of contents along with the
corresponding page number. Upon completion of the
document processing, the table of contents may be then
taken from the back of the document and placed at the
beginning. Following this last sentence I will put in
the <:%TOC:> macro call.
%TOC
