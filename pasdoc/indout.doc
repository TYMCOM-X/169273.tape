#system (INDENT)
#module (INDOUT,9/20/78)
INDOUT is the module containing the output coroutine WRITER. WRITER
performs output line splitting for length.
#entry (INDOUT)is the name of the coroutine to be created.
#algorithm
WRITER accumulates splitpoints (as detailed in the INDENT manual) until
either the maximum width would be exceeded, or an end of line occurs.
At this point, the line is written out.  Leading spaces for output
indentation is canonicalized.  Groups of stand-alone comments are
written out in one big shot if there are any.
