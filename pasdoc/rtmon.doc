#system (PASCAL Runtime)
#module (RTMON,5/11/79)
This file contains the primary support routines for PASCAL programs,
including stack and environment initialization, DEBUG interface,
and procedure and function interfaces.
The three modules in this file are PASMON, STACK, and PNTRY.
#entry (INITP.)is called from the mainline to set up the stack and
environment. 
#entry (STACK.)determines whether a user specifies a larger stack-size
at link time.
#entry (PNTRY.)sets up the stack on procedure entry.
#entry (PRTRN.)restores the stack on a procedure return.
#notes
The PASMON module is conditionally compiled under the DEBUGF flag
to support the debugger. The DEBMON module should precede PASMON in
the library.
$skip
External symbols PSA.1 AND PSA.2 delimit the PSA request blocks
which must appear at the end of the library. These blocks
enable the PASCAL monitor to allocate the PSAs and to give modules
the opportunity to perform initialization and cleanup.
