The ASK module is responsible for simple interaction.

The "ask" routine asks a question and returns the index of
the response word in a given list.  Zero is returned if the
input is ended or is null.

"ask_tty" is the same as "ask" except that the interaction
is forced to be with the terminal.

"abbrev" returns TRUE if its first string argument is equal
to, or an abbreviation of its second string argument.  The
null string abbreviates all strings.

The ASK module requires the SETUP module.
