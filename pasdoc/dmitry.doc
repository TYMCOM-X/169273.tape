		Report on the current state of the Pascal 
		-----------------------------------------
			compiler version #0B.
			---------------------

		The purpose of this report is to give an overview of
	existing problems and bugs for version #0B of the Pascal
        compiler.

  1. The VAX code generator.
  --------------------------
		
		This version of the compiler has the VAX machine code
	generator (plus two code generators for the PDP-10).  We do not 
	want to support this code generator currently, but we might want
	it in the future.  If we want to take it under support, a large 
	amount of administrative and technical work will be involved:  
	  1/. Get access to the VAX computers.
	  2/. Either get permission from MDSI to take their VAX run-
	    time library, and convert it to our environment on 
	    VAXes, or write our own VAX run-time library.
	  3/. Test the VAX code generator and prepare a version of it 
	    acceptable to users.
	  4/. Move the compiler to the VAX computers and maintain it
	    there for the VAX users.
	However, regardless of whatever our future use of the VAX code 
	generator may be, it is a large piece of software at least
	halfway ready as a product.   So it would be thoughtless to
        simply throw it away.  There are three possible decisions which
        we could make about the VAX code generator:

	  a. Leave the compiler as is with the VAX code generator.

	    Note: This way requires about 150 useless pages of disk 
		space for each version and for each copy of the compiler
		and makes the compiler less flexible for development.

	  b. Take out the VAX code generator of the compiler and save
	    its sources somewhere.

	  c. Develop a standard procedure for adding new code generat-
	    ors to the compiler, then take out the VAX code generator
	    and save its sources somewhere.

	    Note: This project becomes a very reasonable one if we are
		going to develop other code generators for the compiler,
		in particulary, a cross code generator for the engine.

      Approximate estimate: Both projects, b and c, seem to require 
		about the same amount of time - 10 person days.  It may
		turn out that c will take 2-3 days more.

  2. IO_ERROR exceptional condition.
  ----------------------------------

		Testing of the I/O errors handling revealed many
	problems, most of which must be considered as serious.  These
	problems are:

    a. IO_DGIT exceptional condition handling.

		An error occurs in integer or real reads when a
	character unacceptable for the conversion is seen.  When this
	happens in the case of unformatted input, the I/O handler
        assigns IOSTATUS=IO_DGIT and does not move the I/O buffer
        pointer.  Therefore if the unacceptable character is not the
        first non-blank one on the piece of the input line subject to
        the conversion, it reads the number on the left side of this
        character, converts it into an appropriate internal represent-
        ation and assigns it to the input variable.  This is contrary
        to the documentation, which says that I/O handler assigns zero
        to the input variable in this case.
		After the above error has occured, any next try to
	read from the same input line causes an input variable, 
	integer or real, to be assigned zero, but at the same time
	the I/O buffer pointer is unchanged, IOSTATUS is assigned 
	to IO_OK, and NO IO_ERROR is signalled.  This means that while 
	only integer and real values are being read, the end of the 
	input line will never be reached.  So the execution of the 
	following very natural program piece can put a program into an 
	infinite loop:
		................
		readln(input);
		while not eoln(input) do
		  begin read(input,int_var);
		..................
		  end;
		................
	Of course, if a statement after read(input,...) checks up on
	the value of IOSTATUS, the error will be caught.  But even 
	so, such behavior of the I/O system can not be considered
	correct.  Apart from that, it is impossible to catch the 
	above error in the case of formatted input.
		The IO_DGIT error in the case of the formatted input
	causes the same consequences as are described above, except that
	IOSTATUS is never assigned to IO_DGIT.  This means that there is
	no way to catch the IO_DGIT error or to check the correctness
	of the input.

    b. Absence of the IO_EOLN I/O exceptional condition.

		If a program tries to read beyond the end of an input 
	line the IO_ERROR exceptional condition is signalled.  But it 
	is impossible to check what kind of I/O error occured in this 
	case because the values of the IO_STATUS type do not include 
	the IO_EOLN value.  Because of this, instead of indicating the
	real cause, the I/O system makes the following assignments:



							Page 3


	IOSTATUS=IO_OK
	EXIOSTATUS=IO_DGIT
	EXCEPTION_MESSAGE='%    IO_EOF Read beyond EOF at user PC ... '

	We can easily see how confused a user will be in this case.

    c. IO_OPNF exceptional condition.

		The IO_OPNF error does not cause the I/O system to 
	signal it immediately.  As a result, if a program performs the
	OPEN operation for a nonexisting file, the attempt finishes but
	associates the file variable with something wrong.  In other
	words, the file variable is not equal to NILF after the oper-
	ation.  Any later reference to this file variable will
	force the I/O system to signal an error (but not either IO_ERROR
	or PROGRAM_FILES).  The latter is supposed to be signalled when
	either a file variable assigned to NILF is used in some I/O 
	operation or its buffer variable is used in an assignment.

	        The following observations on the behavior of the I/O
        system in the above case must be made:
	  1/. It is true that the IOSTATUS function recieves a correct
	    value when the IO_OPNF error occurs, but we can not expect
	    users to check its value in all situatons.  And if a user
  	    did not check it, he would expect to get a correct reaction
	    from the Pascal environment in the case of an error.  Alas,
	    that does not happen.
	  2/. Too many different kinds of errors (many requiring
            different processing) are combined under IO_OPNF.  For
            example, a file association failure when the physical file
            does not exist obviously requires different handling from
            situations where  the process does not have enough licence
	    to access a certain file.  So splitting the IO_OPNF
            exceptional condition into several conditions might be very
	    useful.

    d. I/O fatal errors.

		When an I/O fatal error occurs (which implies that the
	corresponding I/O operation does not finish) IOSTATUS is
	always assigned to IO_OK while EXIOSTATUS mostly gets an in-
	correct value.  This problem needs no comment.

    e. The EMPTY function.

	   	If EMPTY is applied to a file opened for input, IO_ERROR
	is not signalled at all.  Instead, another exceptional
	condition is signalled.

    f. Incorrect behavior of the PT0140 test program.

		In PT0140 the most internal IO_ERROR handler of the 
	DTFL_SEEK procedure transfers control incorrectly when the
	program is running.  It is not yet clear whether there are
	problems in the Pascal run-time I/O system, or whether wrong
	code is generated for the procedure DTFL_SEEK .

    g. I/O errors handlers and the overlay manager.

		The problem described under 7.a seems to be related to
	the problems in the Pascal I/O system.

    Discussion:
    -----------

		There is no doubts that the problems described above
	must be fixed.  It is going to be a medium-sized project;
        several different technical strategies could be chosen.  To
	choose the best one, we have to remember that the Pascal I/O
        system was originaly written for the TOPS-10 environment and
        then crudely adjusted to the TYMCOM-X environment without using
        many of the X's features.  One of the MDSI comments about the
        Pascal I/O system states:  

	"Quick and dirty modified to run under Tymshare (SVC FILOP.s
	removed and a few CHANIOs tossed in).  WARNING: this should NOT
	be taken as a production quality I/O system."

	Keeping this in mind, we consider two alternatives for fixing 
	the problems described above:

	  1/. Make a global improvement and adjustment of the Pascal 
	    I/O system to the TYMCOM-X environment.

	    Note: This project seems to be very reasonable if either 
		we are going to make a full customer release of the 
		compiler or we are going to develop it seriously.

      Approximate estimate: 2 person months.

	  2/. Make local repairs necessary to insure proper operation
	    of the Pascal I/O system.

	    Note: We can try this way, but keep in mind that a local
		repair of a "quick and dirty" area may lead to new
		problems.

      Approximate estimate: I have no idea how much time this way will
		take.


  3. MATH_ERROR exceptional condition handling.
  ---------------------------------------------

		We have to distinguish two points of view about the
	MATH_ERROR exceptional condition and its handling:  
	the user's viewpoint and the implementation viewpoint
	I will consider both points of view with the assumption that
	the MATH_ERROR exceptional condition is created when
	the execution of a primitive expression fails.  Here and below,
	the term "primitive expression" is used for any Pascal expres-
	sion which contains only one Pascal math operation.  For 




							Page 5


	example, a*b, a-b, -a, a**b, arcsin(a), ln(a) are primitive
	expressions.

	    	From the user's point of view when a primitive expres-
	sion is being executed two different events can occur:

	  a. The execution has succeeded and no exceptional condition 
	    has been created.  It implies that the theoretical value of
	    the expression has a correct representation on the computer 
	    installation where the expression is executed, and this
	    representation has been produced as a result of execution.

	  b. The execution has not succeeded and the MATH_ERROR excep-
	    tional condition has been created.  It implies that the
	    produced result is not a correct representation of the
	    theoretical value of the expression.  It does not matter 
	    to the user whether a hardware interrupt occurred during
	    execution or not.  He still expects the MATH_ERROR exceptional
	    condition to be created so that his program can process it.  

		An implementation of the expression execution, depend-
	ing on the kind of expression, can be of two types:
	    1/. One instruction representing a direct operation on the 
		expression.  In this case a hardware interrupt usually
		occurs when a correct result can not be produced
		on the computer installation.
	    2/. A procedure called to compute the result of the express-
		ion.  In this case no hardware interrupt usualy occurs.
		But for a good implementation, the return code passed
		by the procedure will show whether the execution
		succeeded or not.
	So from the implementation point of view three different events
	can occur when an expression is being executed:

	  a. The execution has succeeded and a correct result has been
	    produced.

	  b. A hardware interrupt has occurred.  In this case any 
	    implementation creates an exceptional condition (in our 
	    case, MATH_ERROR).

	  c. The execution has not succeeded and no correct result has
	    been produced, but no hardware interrupt has occurred.  
	    This happens when a routine is called for the expression
	    execution.  To satisfy a user's assumptions about the
            behavior of his program, the MATH_ERROR exceptional
            condition must be created in this case.

	MDSI's implementation of the exceptional condition handling
	does not create the MATH_ERROR exceptional condition, nor
	any other exceptional condition in the latter case.  That
  	destroys a correct picture of the program behavior from the
	user's point of view and is a source of confusion for him.
	Two examples are given below.




							Page 6


	  1/. If an overflow occurs when an expression like a**b is
	    executed, no exceptional condition is signalled (see test
	    programs PT0131, PT0132, PT0133).  It implies that the 
	    target variable of the expression gets an incorrect value,
	    and there are no means to detect this.

	  2/. If an illegal argument is passed to a math function like
	    ARCSIN or LN (see PT0135, PT0138), the corresponding Fortran
	    library routine called for execution of this function sends
	    a correct error message to the screen.  But the Pascal run-
	    time creates no exceptional condition and the program 
	    executing this function continues to run.  It involves the
	    same consequences as in the first example.

		Now it should be clear as to why the
	problem must be fixed.  We need a few more details of MDSI's
	implematation of the expression execution in the above case.
	Almost all routines called for execution of expressions are
	Fortran library routines.  I have looked at the code for many
	(but not all) of them and have found that all of those routines
	which I looked over pass a return code to the caller
	indicating an error if it occurs during their execution.
	Having that in mind, I see the following possible projects we
	can run to fix the above formulated problem:

	  a. Develop a mechanism to check a return code passed
	    by the Fortran routines and to create the MATH_ERROR excep-
	    tional condition if this code indicates an error.

	    Note: This will be possible if further investigation shows
		that all Fortran math routines called by the Pascal
		run-time do pass a return code.  It is
		not clear yet whether it is easier to include that
		mechanism in the code generated by the compiler or to
		include it into the Pascal run-time system.

	  b. Include the Fortran math routines in the Pascal run-time
	    system with necessary adjustments, and then develop a
	    mechanism as described above.

	    Note: The development of the above mechanism will be 
		facilitated a lot in this case and, of course, will 
		take less time.  But total time needed for this project
		will be more than for the first one.  
		  This project becomes very reasonable if we are going
		to write a cross code generator for the engine.  If we
		are, then we have to include the Fortran math routines
		into the Pascal run-time system for the engine anyway.
		Together with the project b it will take less time than
		together with the project a.

  4. Optimizing code generater.
  -----------------------------

		The compiler fails during the code generation pass when




							Page 7


	compiling the PT0120 and PT013# test programs with the OPTIMIZE
	option.  It is not clear yet what kind of bug causes that and
	how hard it will be to fix it.

  5. Quick pass code generator.
  -----------------------------

		There are several cases when the quick pass code 
	generator generates wrong code.  They are:

	  a. When compiling the PT0030 test program with the QUICK 
	    option, the compiler inserts a piece of garbage code between
	    the pieces of correct code for the string concatenation
	    operation.

	  b. The PT0134 program signals MATH_ZERO_DIVIDE when it has to
	    signal MATH_FLT_OVF.  The difference between this program
	    and PT0131 behaving correctly at this point consists of 
	    two statements ( writeln(tty,...); break(tty); ) inserted 
	    just before the statement computing the expression with an
	    overflow result.  The code generated by the compiler for
	    this place in the PT0134 program seems to be wrong.

	  c. When compiling the MMBLDS program (one of the modules
	    of the ODMS system) with the QUICK option, the compiler 
	    informs of continuing after an assertion failure during 
	    code generation.  The program works incorrectly after that.
	    However it works correctly after it is compiled with the
	    NOQUICK option.

	    Note: All the above problems seem to be results of small
		bugs in the quick code generators which can be fixed
		quickly.

  6. Two small bugs.
  ------------------ 

	  a. The compiler does not create a new relocatable file if a 
	    relocatable file with the same name already exists.  Some-
	    body may be seriously confused by this "feature".
	
	  b. When loading an environment file, the compiler prints out 
	    the error message #90 for some names declared in this file.
	    Though this does not cause incorrect compiling of programs
	    with the environment from this file, it must be fixed for
	    the user's version.

      Approximate extimate: Both bugs need 5-8 person days to fix.

  7. The overlay management system.
  --------------------------------- 

		Testing of the Pascal overlay management system shows
	that one serious and several small problems exist.  They are:




							Page 8


	  a. The PT008# and PD008# test systems show that currently the 
	    overlay manager and exceptional condition handlers do not 
	    work together properly.  As it appears for these two test 
	    systems the overlay manager and I/O run-time system are not
	    consistent with the exceptional condition handlers.  This
	    problem, as it is mentioned above, seems to be related to
	    the Pascal I/O system problems.

	  b. If a run-time routine which has a static area is called
	    inside of an overlay segment that is not a main segment and
	    is not called from the main segment, then the entry points
	    of this routine must be declared in the MDL file as resident
	    entries.

	    Note: This is not a bug, but a disadvantage of the overlay
		management system, because in some cases without a deep
		knowledge of the Pascal run-times a user is not able to
		make his system work.hink we have to fix this
		problem in future.

	  c. The MOE.TV entry appears as an undefined global symbol when
	    a nonsharable overlay segment is linked. It does not cause
	    a program to run incorrectly, but may bother users.

	  d. The VERIFY function seems to not work properly in some 
	    cases.
	
  8. Two unclear problems.
  -------------------------

	  a. A precision of computations for double precision numbers is
	    different when PT0030 is compiled with the OPTIMIZE option 
	    and when it is compiled with the QUICK or NOQUICK option.  
	    It should not happen, because a program is expected to 
	    produce the same results when running regardless of what 
	    type of code generation was used.

	  b. The PT0040 program testing the Pascal run-time system does
	    not output values of the set variable LNGST for some reason.
