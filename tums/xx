SUBJ: IMPLEMENTATION OF TMS AT MDHC

DURING  THE  LATTER  PART  OF JUNE,  MDC  SCHEDULED  MDHC  TO  BE
CONVERTED  TO  TMS DURING THE PERIOD OF JULY 21-23.   DURING  THE
JUNE  VISIT,  LIGHT HELICOPTERS AND INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS  WERE
TRAINED ON TMS.  DURING THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I WORKED WITH THE TMS
USERS  (5  USERS)  TO SCHEDULE  TRAINING,  AND  PREPARE  FOR  THE
TRAINING/CONVERSION.   I PREPARED THE PC FOR SHIPMENT TO 540 COMM
CENTER.   I PARKED THE DISK AND REMOVED THE CABLES.  ARRANGEMENTS
WERE MADE FOR SORBUS TO INSTALL THE PC ON MONDAY 20TH.   THEY DID
NOT.   THEY SHOWED UP ON TUESDAY TO INSTALL THE MACHINE, AND I AM
TOLD THAT CHARLIE SENT THEM AWAY.   AS YOU KNOW, I WAS IN CYPRESS
ON 20-21 REPRESENTING YOU ON THE MDC INTERCONNECT COMMITTEE,  AND
COULD NOT SUPERVISE THE TMS CONVERSION, EXCEPT FOR A BIT OVER THE
PHONE.  I  WAS  TOLD BY TOM CARR ON TUESDAY THAT THE PC  WAS  NOT
WORKING.   I CALLED MESA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PC WAS WORKING. ON
MY  RETURN,  I  WAS TOLD THAT THE PC WAS NOT  WORKING.   I  ASKED
CHARLIE  ABOUT  THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THE MODEM  WAS  BAD
(EVEN  THOUGH  IT WORKED FRIDAY),  AND THAT SORBUS  WAS GOING  TO
REPLACE IT.  I WAS LATER TOLD THAT THE REPLACEMENT MODEM WAS ALSO
BAD AND THAT ALL OF THE MODEMS NICK SANDOVAL HAD WERE BAD.  (THIS
SEEMS UNLIKELY).   I ASKED CHARLIE TO KEEP ME ADVISED AND TO CALL
IF  ANYTHING  WENT  WRONG.   I TRACKED  HER  DOWN  SEVERAL  TIMES
WEDNESDAY  AND  THURSDAY AND WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT  EVERYTHING
WAS GOING OK,  BUT THAT SORBUS WAS STILL WORKING ON THE PC.   SHE
SAID  THAT  ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS COULD NOT BE  TRAINED  AS  THE
MANAGER WAS AWAY ON A BUSINESS TRIP.  DURING THE PERIOD OF 22-23,
I  COULD NOT GET OUT IN THE FIELD TO WORK ON THIS PROJECT DUE  TO
THE  ASSIGNMENTS  RELATIVE TO THE JOHN  PRINGLE LAN  LETTER,  THE
FIBER-REMOTE  CONTROLLER PLAN,  AND THE OTHER ASSIGNED  PROJECTS.
APPARENTLY CHARLIE WENT TO JUDY HOLCOMB FOR LEADERSHIP ON THE TMS
PROJECT.   I ASKED CHARLIE TO MEET ME AT LUNCH TO  GET AN  UPDATE
ON THE PROJECT. SHE DID NOT. IN THE LATE AFTERNOON (23) I FINALLY
GOT  AHOLD OF HER TO LEARN THAT:  THE TWO USERS WITH CONVENTIONAL
TELETYPE MACHINES WERE NOT TRAINED ON TMS AS SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW
TMS WORKED ON THESE MACHINES.  A THIRD DEPARTMENT WAS NOT TRAINED
AS  THE MANAGER WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP.   MARKETING WAS  TRAINED,
BUT THEY HAD NOT GOTTEN THEIR MODEMS YET,  SO THEIR TRAINING  WAS
LIMITED.   CHARLIE  SAID  THAT JOAN,  SHIRLEY,  AND BARBARA  WERE
TRAINED,  BUT  THAT TERRA KEPT LEAVING,  SO SHE GAVE  UP  TRYING.
CHARLIE  SAID  THAT SHE TRIED TO CALL ME SEVERAL TIMES,  BUT  SHE
SAYS  SHE  WAS TOLD I WAS IN A MEETING AND COULD  NOT  BE  CALLED
AWAY.  SHE LEFT NO MESSAGES.  CHARLIE SAID THAT THE PC IN 540 WAS
DEFECTIVE  AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.   I ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG,  AND
CHARLIE  SAID THAT THE PC WOULD RECEIVE MESSAGES,  BUT COULD  NOT
SEND THEM.   SHE THEN SAID THE NETWORK TRUNKS WERE DEFECTIVE  AND
THE  WRONG TYPE,  AND THAT THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM--SHE
WORKED WITH JUDY ON THIS ISSUE!  SHE THEN SAID THAT THE HARD DISK
WAS  THE PROBLEM,  AND THAT TMS WOULD NOT WORK FROM  AN  EXTERNAL
HARD DISK.  I TOLD HER THAT TMS WORKED JUST FINE WITH MY EXTERNAL
HARD  DISK.   SHE THEN WENT BACK TO THE MODEM BEING THE  PROBLEM.
IN MY OPINION, IF IT CAN RECEIVE, BUT NOT SEND, THE PROBLEMS MORE
LIKELY  RELATE TO SOFTWARE.   THE BOTTOM LINE IS--LITTLE GOT DONE
THIS WEEK,  AND WE ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED.   AS I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS  PROJECT,  I  THINK  THAT  IT IS  NECESSARY  FOR  ME  TO  BE
AUTHORIZED TO ALLOCATE MY TIME TO GETTING THE PROJECT UP.   IT IS
OBVIOUS TO ME THAT MDAIS HAS FAILED TO DO SO FOR US.   I ESTIMATE
THAT  IT  WILL  TAKE  ABOUT 30 HOURS TO GET TMS  UP.   IT  IS  MY
SUGGESTION  THAT  CHARLIE  NOT BE  INCLUDED  IN  FUTURE  TRAINING
EFFORTS,  BUT  THAT I DO WHAT EVER IS NECESSARY (WITH TOM  CARR'S
HELP  AS HE CONTROLS THE LONG BEACH SWITCH.) TO GET THE SYSTEM UP
AND  KEEP IT UP.   I WOULD GUESS THAT TMS WILL TAKE NO MORE  THAN
FIVE HOURS PER WEEK ONCE THE SYSTEM IS UP.

Subject:      DAC Personnel Discussion with Frank Boensch, NASP
              SPO

1.  DAC personnel,    Murphy, Ray Petty, J. Bhatt and C. Kam met
with Boensch on 7-23 to renew previous relationships and briefly
discuss their IRAD interests related to NASP.  Boensch went out
of his way to schedule the meeting because he wanted to talk
with the Douglas part of MDC.  In this regard he made the
following points:

o  MDC deserves on attaboy for DAC coming onboard the prog9am.
   It is important to the program.

o  DAC brings to bear their experience with large structures
   and fabricatin of large high performance, close tolerance
   tooling.  This is commendable.  He expects to see this
   capability and experience to be used for hardware.

o  He sees DAC as the only part of the company having large
   enough facilities to build the NASP vehicle.  It is very
   important that they get onboard.

o  He was happy that coordination was being done with St. Louis
   and cautioned that the MDC team must keep tied together.

2.  Boensch very definitely wanted to get the above points
across.  He feels DAC participation in NASP is essential to our
competitive position.

Plans:
Switching System:

Activity:
    -  Two Remote Line Concentrating Modules (RLCM) will be
       installed in Long Beach when Building 78 is occupied.
       The RLCM's will be directly connected to the SL-100 in
       Long Beach.  Also, a host expansion of 2000 lines is
       needed to provide service to the additional buildings.
                                       New Completion Date:
                                       3rd Quarter

Status:   The installation process has started for the RLCM's.
          They will be in service 3rd quarter before the
          building is occupied.  The host expansion has been
          put on hold until further notice.

Activity:
    -  An upgrade of the S1- in Crystal City is planned in
       order to provide more extensive service to personnel.
                                       New Completion Date:
                                       3rd Quarter

Status:   A switch is being purchased to satisfy the needed
          services.  This in-service date is planned for the
          end of August.

Activity:
    -  One RLCM will be installed in Huntington Beach;
       connected to the SL-100 at that location.  This RLCM
       will provide service to personnel off-site due to
       expansion and new programs.
                                       New Completion Date:
                                       3rd Quarter

Status:   The hardware has been received and installation will
          begin shortly.  The RLCM should be in-service during
          August.

RETRANSMISSION  25 JULY 87 PER YOUR REQUEST

July 13, 1987

Memo for Steve Krause
cc: Tom Gunn, Jim Caldwell, Phil Edsall(here)

Subject:   Justification

Because of the nature of this information, it would be convenient
for you to have Flash elaborate.

Based on my observation, and on the strongest recommendation of
our advisors, MDKL strongly recommends continuation at the
present rate.

Kongo has been effective in gathering and providing highly
important information, much of it passed to St Louis without
credit of authorship, dealing with FX related activities of
jupiter, hospital and grocer and its senior staff members.

Kongo has been effective in Hornetizing influential high ranking
hospital and green house officials who have suppressed and
neutralized old vanguard's blue suit influence over the
evaluation.

Kongo is playing a big role in placing the discriminators in
front of decision makers in a way that Hornet value as related to
their peculiar interests can be perceived.

Kongo has developed meaningful contacts with key people. Phil
will provide further documentation.

Grocer is stepping up its activity. We need Kongo's help more so
in this final phase, than ever.  Because of the sources of info,
the nature of activity, it has been difficult to report Kongo's
activities.  It has been positive and professional.

Recommend we continue.
