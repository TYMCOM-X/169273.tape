This UUO is used by LOGOUT to release the spare LDB to the next
waiter in the queue (if any).
If the frame has no DDB, 
or if the calling process does not have {JL} license,
take the error return.
Otherwise,
release the spare LDB, 
and wake up any waiters.

If the spare LDB is not attached to this frame,
this UUO is a no-op.
