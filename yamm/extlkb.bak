!RBCNT\0\\\\\\The count of argument words to follow.
\RB.NSE\18\-\A\-\-\If 1, ENTER will return error code (4) !ERAEF if
the specified file already exists.

\RB.AWD\19\-\-\A\A\If 1, RENAME and UPDATE will interpret .RBALC as
being in units of words rather than pages.  (The .RBALC value returned
to the user is always in units of blocks, regardless of the setting of
this bit).

\\20\A\-\-\-\If 1, LOOKUP will grant access if .RBPID
matches the PID of the caller.  If 0, LOOKUP will grant
access according to the conventional protection system.
See {SecRef PidAuth}.

\\27-35\A\A\A\A\Word count. Must be >= 3.

.byteDef !RBPPN,1,|PPN of UFD to search|
!RBPPN\1\\A0\A0\A0\A0\PPN. This can be supplied in any of
the forms:
--0 (or a negative word): the current process's PPN
--0,,[SIXBIT /username/]: the AUN of the specified
(two-word) username
--project number,,programmer number: (directly)

.byteDef !RBNAM,2,|SIXBIT /<filename>/|
!RBNAM\2\\A\A\A\A\File name (in SIXBIT).

when deleting a file with RENAME, a 0.

.byteDef !RBEXT,3,|SIXBIT /<extension>/|
!RBEXT\3\0-17\A\A\A\A\File extension (in SIXBIT).
--When selecting a directory,
the extension is SIXBIT /UFD/.

\\18\-\V\-\-\ENTER sets this bit if the file
already existed (SUPERSEDE)
and clears it if it did not (CREATE).

\\20-21\V\A0\A0\A0\Creation date high-order bits.
--(see .RBPRV, bits 24-35)

\\22-35\V\A0\A0\A0\Access date (in days since 1/1/64 GMT).
--CREATE and SUPERSEDE use the current date
if this field is 0 or a date in the future.
--UPDATE and RENAME use the current date
if this field is 0.


\\18-35\V\V\V\V\Error Code.  If LOOKUP, ENTER,
or RENAME fails, the file selection error code
from {TabRef TAB15} is stored here.

.byteDef !RBPRV,4,privilege word
!RBPRV\4\\\\\\Privilege word.

\\0-8\V\A0\V\A0\Protection code.
--CREATE and SUPERSEDE use this field
if either it or the data mode field (below)
is nonzero;
otherwise,
CREATE uses 051 for directories and 750 for files,
and SUPERSEDE uses the original protection.
--RENAME uses this field if .RBPRV is nonzero;
otherwise it retains the original protection.

\\9-12\V\A0\V\A0\Data mode.
--CREATE and SUPERSEDE use this field
if either it or the protection field
(above) is nonzero;
otherwise,
CREATE uses ACSII (0)
and SUPERSEDE retains the original mode.
--RENAME uses this field if .RBPRV is nonzero;
otherwise it retains the original data mode.

\\13-23\V\A0\A0\A0\Creation time (minutes since midnight GMT).
--(see .RBPRV, bits 24-35)

\\24-35\V\A0\A0\A0\Creation date low-order bits
(in days since 1 January 1964).
--CREATE and SUPERSEDE use both the creation
days and minutes fields
if either is nonzero;
otherwise,
they use the current day and minutes.
They will also use the current day if the day
specified is in the future.
--UPDATE works the same but accepts future
days.
--RENAME uses both the creation days and minutes
if .RBPRV is nonzero;
otherwise it retains the original values.

--UPDATE and RENAME will truncate the file
if supplied a .RBALC argument which is > 0 but
less than the file's current size.
A .RBALC value of 0 will truncate the file to
length 0 rather than retaining its original length.
Note that if bit 19 of word 0 is set, RENAME and UPDATE 
will interpret .RBALC as being in units of words.
--ENTER and RENAME will compare the supplied .RBALC
argument with the last value stored in .RBEST, and
place the larger of the two values into the RIB's .RBALC field.

{ChanioRef !CHUFD} ).

a user-program one and is not enforced or supported
by the monitor.)

\\12-17\V\A0\A0\A0\Creation seconds (since the last minute).
--RENAME uses this field if it is nonzero
and retains the original creation seconds otherwise.
