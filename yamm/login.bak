where <addr> points to a block of <count> words:

JBTPRV	 wd 1	initial frame privilege word
JBTAUN	 wd 2	initial frame AUN
JBTUNM	 wd 3	first word of SIXBIT username

   	 wd 5	ASCII characters 1-5 of project code
   	 wd 6	ASCII characters 6-10 of project code
         wd 7	ASCII characters 11-12 of project code

If JB.LOG is set for the frame
(already logged-in), {abort HT!ILU}

Copy as many words as are defined or specified by <count>,
whichever is smaller,
into the appropriate monitor tables.
Set JB.LOG in the frame status word.
If JP.COR is greater than JP.CRM, set JP.COR = JP.CRM.

If the instruction following the LOGIN UUO
is a HALT,
perform the equivalent of a RELEAS UUO for
all initted channels,
type a prompt sequence
on the command port,
and put the port into command mode;
otherwise just return.

If project code is supplied in words 5-7, WRTACR is called to write a
LOGINN stream record.  The project code information is in the
same form as the argument block to {calliRef CHPRJ}.
