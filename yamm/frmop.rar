If <count> is greater than the number of words needed
to return all currently defined rights-bits, take
the error return.
(To determine the proper number of words, see
{frmopRef !FORSI})

These two FRMOPs return rights associated with a
particular handle.  
!FORAR returns the AR of the
handle itself.  
!FORER returns the rights for which
the handle is currently good, which may or
may not be the same as the AR of the handle.
See {secRef MFR}, {frmopRef !FOSMF} 
and {secREf HandEffAR}.
For FD!ABS, the UID and PNO fields are returned
zero.
Note that any process which needs to know the absolute
frame number of a frame to which it has a handle can find
out that number with either of these FRMOPs.
