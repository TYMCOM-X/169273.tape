!JBJDA\75-114\\For channels 0 through '17, .JBJDA(channel no.)
is nonzero iff the channel is initted,
so a program can scan .JBJDA to find a vacant channel.
Note that .JBHCU can be greater than '17,
so it should not be used blindly as an index
into .JBJDA.

!JBHRL\115\LH:\Set by
the RUN, RUNSEG, GETSEG, REMAP, and CORE UUOs,

by the GET and RUN commands, and by the loader,
to the highest high-segment address.

.byteDef !JBSYM,116,|Symbol-table pointer stored here|
!JBSYM\116\\AOBJN pointer to the symbol table
created by the loader,
or 0 if there is no symbol table.

.byteDef !JBUSY,117,|Undefined-symbols table pointer|
!JBUSY\117\\AOBJN pointer to the undefined-symbol
symbol table created by the loader or DDT,
or 0 if there are no undefined symbols.

.byteDef !JBSA,120,Start Address of loaded program
!JBSA\120\LH:\Set by
the loader to the first free low-segment address.
==\\RH:\Set by the loader to the program's
start address.
The RUN command starts a program at this address.
The RPG program starts a program at this address+1.

.byteDef !JBFF,121,|First Free loc for buffered I/O to use|
!JBFF\121\LH:\(always 0)
==\\RH:\Set to c(.JBSA left) by the RESET UUO.
Used in buffered-mode i/o
as the starting point for allocating buffers,
and advanced as buffers are allocated.

.byteDef !JBREN,124,REENTER command address stored here
!JBREN\124\LH:\(unused)
==\\RH:\Set by the loader
to the program's reenter address.
The REENTER command transfers control to the
address stored here.

.byteDef !JBAPR,125,APRENB transfer address stored here
!JBAPR\125\LH:\(always 0)
==\\RH:\The APRENB trapping system
transfers control to the routine whose
address is stored here.

.byteDef !JBCNI,126,APRENB simulated CONI word location
!JBCNI\126\\The APRENB trapping system
simulates a CONI APR into this location
before dispatching to the user's
routine.

.byteDef !JBTPC,127,APRENB trap PC loc
!JBTPC\127\\The APRENB trapping system
stores the user's PC here before dispatching
to the user's trap routine.

.byteDef !JBOPC,130,|Old PC loc set by DDT,START etc.|
!JBOPC\130\\The DDT, START, REENTER, and CSTART
commands store the last user-mode PC here
