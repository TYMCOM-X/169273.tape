Carl:
Your suggestions about Vivian's data base using tape number got me to
thinking about the present file naming conventions we are using for 930
and VAX backups.  There is no reason at all why we cannot incorporate
tape numbers or letter designations in the files instead of the day of
the week (that I always felt was rather redundant information since the
date is included).  As you know the present convention is day of week-
month-day.back up type as in MO0627.INC  which could be 110627.inc for
tape number 11 or a0704.all for an all files directory that is tape
group a.  There is no reason why we have to continue to use the naming
convention that Ron Saltgaver started if something else is more useful.

What do you think?  I still think that any changes in Vivian's data base 
should be based on current Operations practices (especially since my
charge to Vivian's project was merely to consult on MAGNUM and advise on
documentation and user interface--not on basic design questions0

Hi,

  I'm surprised to see you logged in.

Anyway, I agree that we should talk to operations first before we
give them a version of Vivian's program to test.  That way we can
make it fit their needs.

...Although there's nothing which says they can't just continue to
do what they do now.  Print the directories on fiche and lookup files
when they need snmething.  {Sigh}.

Vivian,
  Ref: PRODUCT LIST

  What you've done so far has been useful, but I'd like you to do
the same thing "OVER" using a different list of TYMCOM-X programs.

You were right about there only being a few product names which were
on both lists.  Adele and I had already edited out the ones that were
the same... (or most of them).

There are two lists on my terminal table (or desk).  One is a complete
copy of the TOPS-20 list and the other is a list of filenames that exist
somewhere on TYMCOM-X, one name per line, with no other information.

I'd like you to compare lists and check off the ones that appear on both
the tymcom-x list and the tops-20 list.  Then, I'd like you to mark off
the ones you've already looked at and then look at the others as before.

If you can't find the lists, they can be found in:

  (PRODUCTLIST)118.SRT  and  (PRODUCTLIST)SAVSHR.FIL

Send mail or talk to me if you have any questions or problems.
/Carl.

Could one of you take a look and see if you can get someone from the
MAGNUM section to find out why FTMAGNUM is dying on 930 ???

It's possible 930 went flakey (just a while ago) and something got
damaged.  Both ZONNIE and I were doing things in MAGNUM and then when
I got to actually "TEST" the new code, everything went haywire... Now
I can't even re-compile the text I created without a series of FATAL
MAGNUM ERRORS.  Some printouts are on my terminal. /Carl.

I kept the scanner proposal simple in order to give an overview picture

claim to be a MAGNUM expert.  However, when we discuss the project, I
will be happy to describe what I'd like to see.  /Carl.

-Greg

From: MATOKA
Date: JULY 6,1983 17:26
Since I probably won't see you this afternoon, this message will have to do.
When the fatal REMCHR stopcd is hit, it appears that the child frame that
PCOM creates has gone away, ie it no longer exists. Assuming that the frame
went away in the normal course of the PCOM program, it would seem that
PCOM itself is just about finished running. If this is the case, what does
PCOM do after the child frame is killed? What would happen if PCOM were to terminate after finishing running the child frame? In other words, can you think 
of any possible "quick fixes" (temporary, of course) to PCOM that could
eliminate what it does after PCOM finishes the child frame?
-Greg

From: CARL
Date: JULY 6,1983 18:18
Greg,
  No... no ideas.  When PCOM finishes running, it unmaps some pages
in it's address space (from the LOG file) then closes the file.  Then
it (might) delete the log file and EXIT.  That's all.  I'll try to make
some time to take a look at PCOM, but I dodn't expect to find anything.

Can WE reproduce the problem at will ???
/Carl.

Hi!  How was your weekend?  Hot enough for you?  It feels like it's
95 outside now.

Not much happening over on this side of the building these days.
This picnic is sure driving me up the wall, though.  Me and my
big mouth...did I really volunteer to organize this mess??
By the way, are you going to be able to come?  Hopefully, once
I've got my act together, it'll be a lot of fun there.

Well, only 3 more hours to go...I'm so tired.  I keep snoozing off
at my desk here.  Think I'll head straight for my bed when I
get home and sack out for a while.

Have a nice day!

>Surprise!<
  Are you actually sending me a MAIL message?  Wow, golly gee whiz.
  (and I thought that you were so wrapped up with someone else that
   you didn't have time for anyone else.  Sigh... guess again Huh?)

Oh, my weekend was pretty good.  Hot?  well yes, but I limit myself
to just 1 hour a day (per side) for getting sun.  I hope to stop
looking like a ghoul (white like a ghost) by getting the proverbial
California "tan".

As for the picnic... well, probably.  It depends on the things that
are happenning at the time.  Sleeping on the job, huh?  well, I think
that it's going around.  I've been so tired myself all day, and like
a fool, I rode my bicycle to work and put my car in the shop again.
SO, TIRED or NOT, I have to ride home.

I'm happy to hear from you.  It's nice to know that you are TOTALLY
neglecting you other FRIENDS,  I mean that you are NOT totally
neglecting... oh darn, I'm so tired I can't even type what I'm tryinbg
to say... let's try that whole paragraph again.

I'm happy to hear from you!  It's nice to know that you're NOT TOTALLY
neglecting your other FRIENDS.  One of these years we should TRY lunch
again, but only if I'm not interrupting anything between you and Tim.

Talk to you later.   Ciao!   /Carl


From: SDUNHAM
Date: JULY 12,1983 9:06

Yes, I do still write people occasionally.  What I have been wrapped
up in lately is work and this stupid picnic, not to mention personal
problems with Al and the divorce.  I'm also taking a couple
classes at night (volleyball and ballet) which keep me on the run.

Lunch sounds fine...how about Tuesday of next week.  You're not 
interrupting anything between Tim and I...if anything, it would
be more like between Bob and I (who is coming by tomorrow to take
me out to lunch, so if you're around, you'll get to meet him).
I'm actually trying to avoid ANY relationships right now until
I get my acvt together and my head straightened out a bit.  Howver,
I think I'm failing in that respect (avoiding a relationship, that is).

I sure don't envy you having to ride you bicycle home in this heat!
Hope your car is out of the shop by now.  Mine needs to go in for
a complete physical but I can't afford it, I don't want to know about
the one million things wrong, and I don't have time to leave it.

Well, back to ole grinding stone or something like that...

Today looks like it's going to be another scorcher!

Biking in the heat hasn't really been a problem.  In fact, with the
heat it's been like living back east.  SOME LIKE IT HOT is more than
just the title of a book/movie/song (i forgot which).

My car isn't "sick", it's just that since my gas tank was ruptured
4 months ago, they still haven't gotten my fuel gague to work right.
I'm getting tired of using my odometer for a gas-gague!

Well, gotta eat so I don't become ill... chat later. /Carl

Ref: Tops-20 Stream Scanner

After checking into MAGNUM's capabilities, it has become apparent that
reading any form of SIXBIT data (either numbers or text) wil not be
very easy.  It "can be done" if we are converting to an integer value
but it may not be possible for text strings (such as devices, structure
names, etc.).

  I've filled out an ITSR which describes the problem and put it on
Nick's desk for his return on Monday.  No promises, but we will have
to wait and see what happens at this point.

  As for the scanner, it remains to be seen exactly how much data is
in SIXBIT.  Once that is determined, we can decide whether to put the
project on "HOLD" until a solution is found, or to implement in some
other language {Sigh}.

  In any case, I plan to plough ahead until it becomes necessary to
stop.  We can skip the SIXBIT data (or read it as integer data) for
the time being.   /Carl.

Lois,
  I have the support line this afternoon... as such , I should be
insometime this afternoon.  In any case I've spent most of the night
digging into the BLOCKIO problem and may oversleep. If anyone wants
me for anything, feel free to call, but not before 10am please.
Thanks. /Carl.



From: CARL
Date: JULY 14,1983 3:25
Oh yes,... a quickie update on the BLOCKIO problem itself:

The 1st through 4th characters (i.e. the first word of the buffer)
is where the problem is occurring.  Apparently the word is being
skipped (overlooked or duplicated) intermittantly.  As soon as I can
devise a method to test it, I intent to transmit block upon block
of data using blockio again and again trying to cause it to fail
switching 400 character buffers so that they should NEVER be the same
while I'm testing.

I don't believe that it's a BIONIC problem, but there's still no
conslusive proof yet.  /Carl.


From: HIATT
Date: JULY 14,1983 9:11
Carl,
Bionic cleared parity that was set for the terminal at the end of
execution.  All I did was to change some code so that the user's
parity setting wasn't wiped out.  I tested by running TIO.  

I was going to try what you did to the SCAN program this morning,
glad to see it works.. Now I am goin to try reading in some sixbit,
2 ibts bits at a time and storing in character form.  Then I will use
a relation like you would an array to transloateate to ASCII (effectively
adding '40' to the sixbit value) to convinge ncece myself that it
will/will not work.

manual.  I know what the various functions do.  I'm interested in
what things affect the cache and in what ways, eg. writing to memory,
reading from memory/cache ... BLT's vs MOVE/MOVEM ... and someone
to bounce some things off of.

I appreciate very much your cleaning up 930.  However, in the future, it

Or put a list of such in a message and ask for objections.

Now Adele!!!
  If I'd passed out a list of directories asking for anything
it would take a week before anything would be done.  Also, the
directories are not "GONE".  I explicitly mentioned that!  I merely
deleted empty UFD's which all come back as soon as the owner logs
in or someone who needs them GFDs to it.  THEY ALL STILL EXIST IN
THE LUD AND THE DUL!
  So Please don't give me a hard time about it!

CARL,

I AM STILL THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO LIMIT ACCESS TO CERTAIN FILES
ON OUR PRIVATE NET FILE DIRECTORY.  I HAVE FOUND SOME REFERANCES
IN THE YAMM MANUAL AND ELSWHERE TO PIDS OR PROCESSOR ID
MECHANISM.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT , ONCE A PID HAS BEEN SET FOR
A PROCESS, ANY FILE THAT IT WRITES IS ONLY ACCESSABLE TO A
PROCESS WITH THE SAME PID.  I AM NOT CLEAR ON EXACTLY HOW THIS
WORKS OR WHAT GAINS ARE TO BE HAD BY DOING THIS.  SPECIFICALLY
I AM INTERESTED IN KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF PROTECTION A PID
CONFERS TO A FILE, AND IF A FRAME CAN SET PID FOR A SESSION, OR
IF ONLY PROGRAMS CAN HAVE PIDS.  IT IS PROBABLY OBVIOUS FROM
MY QUESTIONS THAT I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DEALING WITH HERE.
I WONDER IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A VERY BRIEF EXPLANATION/ ENGLISH
TRANSLATION OF THE YAMM MANUAL?   ALSO, CARL THERE IS QUITE A BIT
OF DEMAND OUT HERE FOR A COURSE FOR NEW EMPLOYEES ON
THE PDP-10S.  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT HERE TO VIENNA, VA.
AND HAVE ANY INTEREST IN DOING SOME INSTRUCTION , I WILL 
TALK TO MY BOSS ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE SOME ARRANGEMENT.  I AM
CERTAIN THAT WE COULD BENIFIT FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE.  I HOPE
THAT I AM NOT BOTHERING YOU WITH QUESTIONS LIKE THESE.

THANK YOU AGAIN,
BRUCE


From: CARL
Date: AUGUST 4,1983 20:03
Bruce,
  No!  You are not "bothering" me with questions.  As far as
training on the PDP-10s is concerned, I'm not sure that our
section's charter covers that area any longer... although it
might be a consideration on a trip to Vienna.  (I was due to
pop into the area for a friend's wedding in Bethesda on the
7th of August, but my finances ran a little short for me to
make the trip.)

  Anyway, PIDs.  Process ID's actually.

  PIDs allow a user to EXTEND the file-proteciton scheme that
is provided by the monitor, and to circumvent it for those
processes which "know" the PID for a specific file.  However,
unless you provide that all of your files are protected to
NO NO NO or some such (un-accessible) protection there will
be no gain in security.  Users with appropriate license and
normal access to the files in question will still have the
normal access provided by the system.

  I don't mean to say that PIDs do not allow you to have more
security.  I mean to say that you CAN do ANYTHING you want
regardless of the directory in which the file with a PID is
located.  BUT, you must do everything if you want REAL added
security, and also make it difficult for "normal" use.

  It would be easier to explain this on the phone, rather than
in a mail message.  To be clearer, I'd have to re-write the
entire PID section in the YAMM, and I'm not inclined to do that
without actual testing and research in the monitor to insure
that what I wrote was accurate.  And I don't have time for that.

Ref: 1pnupd

It looks like it has 4000 hardcoded all over it.
There are reference checks in just about every routine
checking against 3777B as well as 2048 ('4000) and 4095.

I'd guess that simply changing these to a highere range
and then chenging SPOOL and NODPRI/PRIADR/SPNODE and their
940 counterparts is all that needs to be done.

(However, 940 SPOOL is NOT something we'd like to get involved

Round II:
  (I modified the PUB file, didn't bother to PUBify it.)  I thought
that the wording of the TOPS-20/VAX issues were too terse and made
a single combined objective under the personal half.  ** Comments ** ?

  I think we need to come up with something better, and just drop the
consulting items from the personal half.  Note:  My comment on the
things involved with product support.  It would be nice to s-p-e-l-l
out the things that we're most interested in, in order of importance.

  Also, these do seem to be expected in order of importance (or they
read that way...), thus developing more expertise is more important
than becoming a proficient user...  We need to discuss some of this
reasonably soon so that we keep our perspectives in line with which
items are most important.

  As per the combined "user proficiency vs systems programming expertise"
if you don't mind, I'd rather see them as ONE objective, a la my second
version (under personal).  Whether it appears in both parts isn't of much
concern, just that repetition of 2 items is 2 repetitious!

I called Dallas OPS to ask them that.  One was run on the 11th after

I suspect that the user (if it's the same user) has a bad (really bad)
rib pointer which is causing the crashes.  I haven't looked, but from

to reboot, had problems finding SYSTEM.SAV.  Booting from backup tapes they
got HOME PAGE INCONSISTANCY errors.  (All this before I was called.  I did
not ask if anyone else was contacted).

I had hardware look at the drives.  Unit 0 had 2 bad heads, with small
scratches.  The other drive (where they moved the pack) seemed OK.  They
tried a PACK-COPY and got too many errors to continue.  Shifts had changed
and Debbie handled it from there.   The only thing left at this time was
to do a full rebuild from 2 weeks previous's all-files and the intervening
incrementals.   The schedule said they'd be back up at midnight.  (I was

  The "STANDARD" way to get the username given the UUN is to look
up the UUN in the file (SYS)DUL.SYS and the username is adjacent
within the same entry record.

  The "NONSTANDARD" way is to attempt to lookup the UFD of the user
whose AUN you have, i.e.  (UFD)'aun'.UFD  where  (UFD) is [1,1]
and 'aun' is the sixbit representation of the given aun.  Then in
the lookup block for the UFD, (words 27 & 30 [octal]) contain the
username in sixbit.

CARL,
THE REASON I NEED TO GET THE USERNAME FROM THE UUN IS THAT THE UUN IS
COLLECTED IN LOG INFO FROM A PROGRAM THAT I AM WORKING WITH. IT IS
NOT IMPORTANT THAT IT COLLECT USERNAME INSTEAD AT THIS TIME, BUT I
WONDERED HOW I WOULD FIND OUT WHO WAS REALLY USING IT FROM THE LOG.
ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION.
--BRUCE


From: CARL
Date: AUGUST 16,1983 12:15
It would be easier if in the LOG you just got both pieces of info.
THEN, you would be absolutely sure that the UUN and USERNAME match.
It's possible that both of the ways I mentioned could be wrong, but
the likelihood of either being wrong is very low.

  To get it at runtime, simply do a gettab on .GTAUN, .GTUNM and .GTUN1

Re: Validations Goof up on system 54

ISD (Integrated systems div) was having validations do them a favor by
simply changing the gan on a series of about 50 usernames (instead of
cancelling them and re-validating them).  All went well as far as the
MUD and for changing them on system 33.  However, on system 54, Joyce
Kearney only got as far as changing the usernames in the DUL and about
22 of them in the LUD.  The ones changed in the LUD then had their UFD's
simply renamed to the new PPN.

  We suspect that some of these users were logged in and trying to do
some work at the time.  In any case, these users' files became inaccessible.
DIR/EVERYTHING repoorted what was in the UFD but otherwise, the long
lookup information was inaccessible and showed as 0.

  While looking at this, the system crashed and DSKCLN deleted all of the
files from all of these directories.  (See the latest crash on 54 if you're
interested, Darren).  Ed Gauci and I have deleted the remains of the files
and the offending UFD's and by tonight, operations should have the files
restored to this morning's state.  Tomorrow, Ed is going to talk to Joyc
and try to get everything straightened out.

  If any of you get any calls on this, that's what's happenned so far.
I suspect the ggoofed up ribs also caused the crash, but I didn't bother
to look at it.

The delay in diagnosing the problem with System 33 last week got me
thinking about how to clarify what is happening during Autoreload.
Operators and field service people can identify where the Autoreload
process is failing, and possibly fix the problem themselves if
it is as straightforward as  a defective INITIA.SAV file... as was
the case with System 33 last week.

I would like to suggest that we expand the Autoreload dialog as
follows...

Module          Dialog

ONCE            Once initialization complete... forcing INITIA on Line 0
INITIA          INITIA starting DSKCLN
DSKCLN          <DSKCLN messages>
SCNSER          SETUUO forcing INITIA on Lines 1,2,3 & 4
INITIA          INITIA starting CHKPNT on Line 1 
INITIA          INITIA starting COPYCRA on Line 2
INITIA          INITIA starting XEXEC on Line 3
INITIA          INITIA monitoring AUTORELOAD on Line 4
INITIA          Initialization completed

I have already mentioned this proposal to Gary Perez, and he liked the
idea.  Please let me know what you think... your suggestions are
welcome.

Dave,
  your proposal is reasonably sound, and I wish you luck in getting it
implemented.  XEXEC is actually supposed to be a replacement for INITIA
although it's in a very incomplete state.  It would be best for the
info that INITIA types to the cty to be keyed from a data file with some
default internal table when that fails, rather than X on line 1, Y on
line 2 ... etc.  I'd advise you to talk to Bill Soley when he returns
from vacation next week to get the scoop on WHY some of your ideas in your
proposal were never implemented.

your terminal all this time... it is not, (I REPEAT, NOT) a good idea
to walk away from your terminal (no matter how secure the area it's
in) for long lengths of time, while you have lots of license set.

  Please remember to clear your license when you walk away.  You can
always re-enable.   (Also, it's a good idea not to set license unless
you actually need to, this will help to prevent the above-mentioned
situation from recurring too often).

the internal list I gave you) and the write-ring problem.

  While I'm waiting on the DOC review, I'll look into the write-ring
stuff to see what I can do, if a work-around is reasonable.  (Also
checking the SAIL sources for ideas).

  I'd like someone (other than ME), possibly a marketing or MAGNUM
person to do a complete QA by trying all the commands and seeing if
they can break anything, or if anything looks strange to them.

PENFILE or to use OPENF instead.  Given that all of those worries are

the write ring and do the appropriate goodie based on whether the
particular device at the current moment can do I/O.  (Isn't there a
hack in TENEX-SAIL to defer the "open for writing" until the last possible
moment in the case of a tape drive?)

deeply embedded this "feature" in the UNDELETE program and there was really
no alternative except to practically rewrite the program from scratch. Thereforepeople will just have to live with it I'm afraid. The reaon UNDEL was telling
you that there were no deleted files matching request was because it was lookingfor a file named "(MPL)PCO??.SCM". Had you used "#" instead of "?" I'm sure

I did a bit of analysis on the accounting question of the odd job with
ppn [0,24450].  What I can figure out is both were created by (mpl)copy
jobs.  The login on port 0 is usually created by an "internal" aux
circuit, and is seen in PCOM and COPY jobs where you are attaching to
the same system.

ACCT.RPT on 22 and 70 shows the scenario.  Different users, NETAPS
and GHBARLOW with ppns of 21447,147773 and 21476,50612.  Where the
mystery ppn came from I have no idea, but I could try and call the users
to figure out what they were doing.  Do you have any ideas?  I think I
will look next for .com files on their directories with the appropriate
job numbers.

  If (BIG IF) you ever go back to fix anything in UNDELETE or in
DIRIT for that matter.  It would be nice if the job number could
be put in the rib somewhere, or something to uniquely define one
instance of a user from another.

  Thus, UNDELETE would only all the user that actually deleted a
file to undelete it.  So if two people worked in one directory,
then only the files deleted by person #1 could be undeleted by
person #1, regardless of how many files were deleted by person
#2.

  2) I added VT102's just like VT100's only they HAVE insert/delete
     char/line according to the manual.

-------------------
  I DID NOT change anything about VT100's an simulating the insert/delete
stuff for lines, although they don't have anything for characters.

oh yes, I also re-numbered Enum's so that VT102 is just after VT100,
but that shouldn't cause any havoc.

Carl,

I tried (MyPeak)Peak, and found that there were problems of some sort
with (it seems) backpressuring that do not exist in the Vt100
implementation.  What I did was to try just a bunch of ^Ks and ^Os, and
found that ^Q had been entered behind my back.  Also occasionally
delete-splotches showed up. 

An observation, however:  I utilize smooth-scrolling in my general
approach to life, and when Peak is running in Vt100 mode, it ignores
scrolling altogether, and works fine.  However, I noted that the Vt102
code utilizes the smooth-scrolling I have set.  What would be ideal in
this application would be to push the prevailing scrolling
characteristic, and enforce jump-scrolling for the duration of the edit.

In point of fact, I just reset to jump-scrolling and tried again, and it
worked fine.  So is there a way to do this?

I'll look at the new code in a few minutes.

/Ken


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 2,1983 10:49
What you say makes sense.  All I did was install the terminal codes
in the right places.  I didn't do anything for initialization or to
worry about timing.  See ou in about a half hour.
/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 2,1983 11:09
I was HOPING that the VT102 would be different, but I guess not.
The VT100, even when you do the complicated set-scroll-region-type
of insert/delete line requires padding characters based on the
terminal speed.  There is a table in the back of the VT100 manual
that says how much padding each function needs in ms.  It may also
be in the VT102 manual, but I haven't read that far.  /Car.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 3,1983 15:40
Peak suggestion:
   If the user has a terminal type selected.  I.e., it isn't blank as per the
tty class command, then do NOT set the terminal type from inside peak.  If it
is blank, then let peak set the terminal class after finding out what the user
wants.

Peak feature report		Noon Edition		Volume 1, Number  1

Inconsistent ^N and ^P behavior:

   Depending upon the text in the buffer, the following two sequences
   of commands do not produce the same results:

        ^N^N^N^N^N^N        vs.       ^U^N^N^N

   Single occurrances of ^N remember the column that you started in.
   However, ^U^N forgets the original column if (IF) the line that you
   stop on, doesn't have enough characters.  (I suspect that this means
   it ALWAYS forgets, bu re-assigns the NEW current position to the
   column position that it remembers.

   ^P has the same problem.  To reproduce the problem, make a file with
   5 or six lines of the same length, and then put a line which is much
   shorter someplace in the middle.

   eg.
              aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
              bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
              cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
              dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
              eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
              ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
              gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

   Now, position the cursor on line 1 someplace past the end point of
   the shorter line.  Type ^N 6 times.  See where the cursor is.  Now
   put the cursor back at the top (type ^P 6 times) and repeat the
   experiment using ^U^N followed by two ^N's.  See where the cursor
   is now?

      Isn't that a "NICE" feature?

since I assume that it's an ascii file and I can't expect a
real "null" to stay in the file between editing sessions with
any and all editors (Even IF PEAK doesn't delete them).  Do
you have any way to designate that the next character is a

Peak feature report	Evening Edition		Volume 1, Number  2

Inconsistent behavior in PEAK.INI:

    The following command was deemed to be illegal.  However, the
    action taken by PEAK while executing the command seems to be
    inconsistent depending upon the context.  This feature report
    may be regarded as showing 2 separate problems:

	^XD/^E^J/	^X| Define a macro ^E ^J |
	^XM^J		^X| Assign it to character ^J |

    This will, in fact, cause recursion, (if it wasn't obvious).
    if this is entered from the keyboard there isn't any real
    danger until you type a lone ^J command.  Then, the result
    is an immediate dump to EXEC level with the message:

    	PDL OV at user 004561

    However, if this command definition is entered inside PEAK.INI
    then the result seems to be a little different.  First of all,
    with no occurrances of ^J in PEAK.INI except for those following
    a CR as part of a CR-LF sequence, the command definition causes
    the user to be dumped to EXEC level with the message:

	PDL OV at user 40062


    Of course, redefining the command using the following macro does
    make a big difference.  Notice that there is no recursion:

	^XD/^E$XOpen Line with Indent$/    ^X| Define a macro ^E ^J |
	^XM^J				   ^X| Assign it to char ^J |

    However, please note that this recursion problem could, in fact,
    occur with ANY macro definition.  The user should not get dumped
    in such an un-gainly manner with the terminal characteristics all
    screwed up.  One fix would be to check each character in a macro
    as it is executed to see if it matches the "saved" command being
    executed?  Good Luck!

   I have not finalized anything on this yet, but I have been
considering taking a short vacation, probably for a week or so
sometime in the near future.  (I'll probably go and visit my
friend, Steve, in Tucson).  In any case, "IF" I am going to get
into the class I was planning to take at De Anza, that means
that I will have to go and come back by the 20th or 21st.  I've
still more planning to do on this, but I think that my window
is getting smaller and smaller, and looks a lot like the 12th-
16th, and maybe the 19th & 20th as "GONE" time for me.
   Of course, I will probably login via Tymnet since Steve has
a VT100 at home, and he'll be working during the days.  I'll
send you more on this later.  I'll be talking to Steve in the
next day or so.   /Carl

The monitor in (SYS)SYSTEM has not been changed( it has Greg's diagnostic

System 55 had crashed again this afternoon.  NOTICE.55 has not been
updated properly for at least a week.  I've noticed M33 logged in
attempting to do that, but the job on the otehr end (system 55) keeps
getting an ILLEGAL LOOKUP SPECIFICATION message from SAIL and hangs.

just because NOTICE.55 looks clean, don't assume that system 55 has
not been crashing!  Re: REMCHR+4!

I have check with Kal Kalenda, and he said the most recent crash was a
CRAM parity error.  He was going to reload the NEWSYS monitor, but if
there was any difficulty he would take a dump and load the SYSTEM monitor.
I called Sue Pan earlier, and she could find no evidence of the first
system crash.  How did you learn of it?

					Dave Sutton


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 7,1983 15:45
When a TYMCOM-X system crashes and is reloaded, part of the
initialization is to run CRSHID which logs the current crash files
into a file, and also builds a circuit to system 930 and sends a
copy of the log (as it is generated) into a file named (M33)NOTICE.???
where ??? is the system number.

When I log in, I print out a quickie systat of all GAN 3 users, and
I noticed that M33 was logged in.  A systat of M33 showed that it
was writing a file (M33)NOTICE.55 which means that 55 had crashed
recently.

As per the mail I sent you earlier, I looked at system 55 and there
was something wrong with crshid which caused it to die while trying
to read (SYS)CRA044.SAV, the crash from your /KK10 monitor on Aug 31.

Well,  I've noticed this behavior a number of times in the last week.
And it's mostly been NOTICE.55 that's been hanging around in some
funny state.

Well,  I just RENAMED (SYS)CRA044.SAV to CRADLS.SAV  (in case you
still want to look at it), and that seems to have fixed CRSHID.

week.  I don't know what (if anything) was wrong with the crash file.
I didn't even do a directory of it.  Anyway, you now have a little
bit more info than you had earlier, and I suggest talking to OPS as
being helpful in finding out if your patch was causeing any crashes.

Carl:
The feature you report seems to be an epiphenomenon of your Peak.Ini.
I've looked at it, and besides being highly non-standard, it seems ok.
It may relate to what you want to do with ^J.

/Ken



From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 7,1983 16:38
Oh YES.... as he took out his hammer and SAW!

I started to look at my PEAK.INI (as in I printed it out) and I
thought that there mst be some interaction between the LF's that
are part of the CR-LF pairs inside the ^X- and ^X+ commands.

Well,  that's exactly the problem.  Because the buffer is locked,
the ^J part (i.e. the OPEN LINE WITH INDENT part) is NOT executed,
But the ^E part of the new ^J command IS executed.

I will refrain from making any snide remarks about this being a
real CROCK, because it IS in keeping with the way CRLF works.  One
day (week? month? year? ...) IF the INI stuff is re-written by a
valiant programmer, such as yourself, this CROCK might be fixed.

PS.  Did you find a solution (or is there one) to my previous question
about putting a NULL in the INI file, so tat I can redefine Meta-space

not, it seems he put his patched monitor up on sys 55 this morning which

really germane to the problem of NOTICE.55 not getting updated, but I 
thought I would pass it along anyway.

Is there (IF NOT, this is a suggestion) an enviroment variable

  I find it very cumbersome to kill a line, or some text, then
position where I want it, then Yank it, to be left at the beginning.
re-arranging phrases in sentences is a major pain, becuase i work

Ken,
  there is now a "dumb" version of my newest MAP program on (SPL)
for you to try out.  It will take a single file-spec and copy it
to another file-spec, a la:

R (SPL)MAP
Map file: FOO.BAR,(FOO)TEST.MAG
Map file: ^C  (or crlf)

R (SPL)MAP;FOO.BAR,(FOO)TEST.MAC

will also work, and won't prompt you for another spec.  The stuff you
can type to the prompt is mostly:

<from-spec> <space|comma> <to-spec>
<to-spec> <equals|underbar> <from-spec>

<from-spec> and <to-spec> are any parts of the following without
duplication or bad characters:

<(username)|[ppn]> <file> <.ext> <<prot>>

and prot must have angle brackets surrounding 3 octal digits, no more,
no less.  Of course, 99% of the time nobody will use the protection
stuff.  I put it in, 'cause it works in DIRIT, and I use it instead
of having to type:
     RENAME (FOO)=(CARL)*.XXX
     DECL XXX YYY ZZZ (FOO)*.XXX

instead I say
     RENAME (FOO)<nnn>=(CARL)*.XXX

/Carl


PS. IF you HAVE WF set, then you will get a nearly "exact" copy of the
old-file's RIB info, including status, dumped, etc. bits.  Otherwise,
you will get only some stuff the same, but off the top of my head, I'm
not sure which things.

Feel free to experiment.   NOTE:  It will overwrite anything you
tell it to.. it does NO checking of that type at all.

course).  However, I tried to get help, since the names had been moved around,
and I just got a nasty error message (I/O error at ...)  Eventually I figured
out that it was just that (SPL)FIND.DOC could not be accessed, but you might
really consider a better error message (or even a in-the-source precis for that
case).

Re:  Upgrade to SYSDPY  (also called SY on SYS:)

SY now understands VT102's !


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 8,1983 20:53
Ken,
  On (DWS) there are sources for SYSDPY.  I changed the require for
RDISP.REQ to say REDISP.REQ and made a copy.  Then I took a copy of
REDISP.SAI & DED.DEF fro (PEAK) and loaded them with SYSDPY.

It works!

The REDISP.SAI, etc on DED were untouched, (as in, I did this elsewhere),
but I put the SYSDPY and DED source files back on (DWS) sans REDISP.SAI.
If you want to put a copy of this product someplace, let me know and I
will tell you where all the pieces are, since this message has gotten a
little bit confusing.

/Carl.


From: CARL

  note of interest (barely)...

  your SYSDPY program now uses the current (whatever the current is
  at the moment) version of the REDISP module used by PEAK.  The old
  RDISP.* stuff is still around, but since Ken has made some slight
  improvements + added terminals, rather than retrofit into a new
  RDISP, I used the newest.  SOmeday, RDISP ought to be upgraded.

re: Crash files on 930

I noticed that our disk space on 930 has been disappearing recently
to numerous crash files accumulating on (SYS).  Nearly 10,000 pages
to be precise!

Since I believe that there hasn't been much crash analysis activity
going on on 930, except what Dave has been doing, I've taken the
liberty of copying the 31 or so crashes to magtape and leaving the
tape on DARREN's desk with the CRSHID output attached.

If you want to look at any of these, feel free to restore them.  But
NOT all of them!!!!!

I have been working on the "Input ring processing time-out" crashes
with Bill Soley's considerable help.  We have not solved this problem
yet, but the symptoms indicate that hardware is involved.  Once
these crashes have been eliminated, I intend to install L series
monitors containing the operator messages and necessary patches
for the REMCHR+4 and "Input ring processing time-out" on the several
different types of hardware for shakedown before general distribution
of M series monitors.  The M series will not contain any additional
enhancements.

I have moved (SYS)NEWMON to (SYS)SYSTEM on system  930.  SYSTEM was
generated from source code containing the operator messages and the
REMCHR+4 patch, and was running for about a week.

I'll be over to Valley Green Tuesday(Sep 13th)... see you then.

I'M SUSPECTING THE TAPE DRIVER: WE ARE USING TU77 TAPES AND MAY BE THERE
VERY SUBBTLE DIFFERENCES WITH TU45'S REGARDING HOW TO REACT TO TAPE DRIVE
ERRORS. THAT'S WHY I WAS LOOKING INTO OSP. WWHAT'S THE FILE NAME
FOR THE TAPE DRIVER ??
/ERIC JAY.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 21,1983 0:53
Eric,
  It is possible, that there are subtle differences between the drives.  I
am not that familiar enough with the two drives to answer better.  The file
name for the magtape service is MAGSER.MAC for 2020's, but you may also
want to look at FTASER.MAC which is used to interface to similar TU70-style
tape drives rather than the TU45's which come standard on a 2020.

As far as I know, there have been NO changes to MAGSER since the 2020's
were merged into the regular monitor version in P034/G, at least NO MAJOR
changes.  (This is however a guess!)  Between /K and /L however, there
have been NO changes.

  I Hope that I have been helpful.

From: LOIS
Date: SEPTEMBER 23,1983 8:47
Carl:
I think the idea of SCREAM accepting a time is great, as long as a time
is not required (i.e. it defaults to all day if no time is given).  Mixed
feeling on end time if it requires more typing.  Really don't want to
answer any more questions in SCREAM either as it is really an awkward
program to use.

Another suggestion--the most common thing I do is to want to specify a
username, always a date and range of days, less frequently a program,
less a record type.  I really wish the prompts came in more or less that
order so I could carriage return blithely without finding I had given
a carriage return to the start date (what does it do then, anyway?)

Incidentally using the new SCREAM on 27 it blew up when writing to a file,
but I could do both and I got all I needed as it didn't give up until
past the time I needed.  So it still will not handle a busy day.  27 is a
KI and not terribly busy, either.  This was your latest I believe as I
telecopied a new one from 930 (unless I got the wrong version--I took what
was on mpl).

From: LOIS

Well, SCREAM does behave better than SCAN when you carriage return to
starting date (it repeats it, SCAN just goes on).  So it probably is not
too important.  I do wish there were a way to default a bunch of the prompts
without all the carriage returns, but have no brilliant suggestions.

Re: (MPL)TYPE - New version

There is a new version of (MPL)TYPE up on 930, soon everywhere...  It
has two new switches:

      /LA50       which re-directs output to the printer instead
                  of your terminal
      /PITCH:arg  which sets the pitch of the LA50 printer when the
                  /LA50 switch is used (and does nothing otherwise).
                  Valid "arg"s are:  5,6,8,10,12 and 16;  Each does
                  the same as the implementations that LOIS and VIRGIL
                  have put on the VAX and TOPS-20.

i'm having withdrawal symtoms. i may not make it.
can i get a part time job so i can log in ?     anything
can i appeal to adele ? she met me once !

anyway i did not get pass the troll.

i will be loging in once again to find out how you want us to
communicate from now on.

also, is explorer available as a fortran source or something ?
is so, i'll be glad to send a tape. we have various fortran compilers
including F77. a tops10 style image may be acceptable if i can run it
at pima.
		so long for now.......sigh........very depressed..sniff..bye

Yes,
  System numbers are possible in LOGON.  Format should be:
   /select:system --system-number--:--label--

where --system-number-- is like:  C930, 74, F74 or V72
     if the letter is there, it better match, else just use
     the number.
      --label-- is:  some 6-character label used later as LOGON:label

Don't be so paranoid...  Today I wasn't feeling well (still), so I
stayed home.  Try to call me on MONDAY at the office to discuss whatever
arrangements we'll have to make.

(Don't give any treasures to the Troll.  That doesn't work.)

I don't think Mgmt here is interested in allowing non-employees use
of the machines.  There is the sensitivity issue, and THAT seems just
an excuse for whatever OTHER uneasiness there might me.  No other
plans are in the works for "guest"s.  I'll turn off the acct after I
hear from you on Monday.  /Carl

Oh!  I changed it so that you can print directly to the LA50 printer
without garbaging up your screen.  As such:

  .R (MPL)TYPE      (or however you run it, eg. Do TYPE, etc.)
  *(user)file.ext/switches

  *(user)file.ext/LA50/PITCH:16    will give you a nice compressed
                                   listing on your rainbow printer

No width settings are tampered with.  If you want 132 columns, you
need to say  /WIDTH:132  or .TTY WIDTH 132  (both having the same
effect).  Other pitches are 5,6,8,10,12 and 16 with pitch 12 as the
default.

SAIL.  Any other option is welcome.

i had an inquiry from an adventurous user with an adm terminal, who
wanted to redefine his meta-prefix to ']'.  lois and i looked into it,
and found that by setting the value of the environment variable
".metaprefix" to the decimal ascii value of the desired character, the
desired effect is achieved.  however, the other use of esc, namely
termination of typein strings, is not affected.  clearly they are
different concepts, but i wonder what you think of allowing the
redefinition of this character too?
/ken


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 23,1983 20:33
Ref: TYPE -- it hs tops-20 conditional code, and should port pretty
             much as is.  I haven't had the time to move it.

ref: redefinition of prefixes
     well, I had thought of, and implemented the following:

    meta-prefix (33),  escape (33),  abort (7), rubout (177),
    delete-char (10),  x-meta (30),  ??? not sure if more ???

all of which were re-definable.  re:  some TYMNET people wanted to
use ^A for delete... so, if you ask me, I'd like to see as many
distinct entities for various functions, all of them re-definable
(at least to a single key value).

I left in a few hard-wired things like '177 always worked even if you
redefined .delvalue or .rubout, but I have mixed feelings about any
hard-wired constants, unless they're re-definable at compile time.

Ref: KERMIT
  Sigh... one is as bad as the other, TOPS-20 has the CMND JSYS
and TOPS-10 has GALAXY.  Whoever setup the tops-10 version decided
to heavily imbed a lot of GLXLIB, the galaxy library stuff.  It
may take a lot of painstaking ferriting out of non-TYMCOM-X calls
in the galaxy system before KERMIT will work.  I'll let you know
more sometime next week, after I dump the TOPS-10 distribution for
7.01 with Galaxy sources to disk.

there shouldn't be any FF at the beginning.  There is one, however,
at the end, but that is on purpose.  I shall look.

sigh.  I never noticed it before.  ref: TYPE printing the beginning FF.
But, I can't find anythig which checks or prohibits it on the initial
output... possibly it has something to do with the output to the printer
thus making the ... will check... hhhhmmmmmmm.

Well,
  IT works!  (it's not up on MPL yet.)
  I want to figure out why the old version types a <CR> at the
end, and the newest version doesn't.  Thus, files which end in the
middle o a line get left hanging funny.  Otherwise... it's great.

/DEVICE:arg   - arg = TTY (default) or LA50
/PITCH:arg    -same as /HPITCH:arg
/HPITCH:arg   - arg = 5,6,8,10,12,16  !!!! 10 is default !!!!
/VPITCH:arg   - arg = 2,3,4,6,8,12    !!!!  6 is default !!!!

({m|s}pl)type reads switch.ini, doesn't it?
/ken


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 24,1983 23:51
(MPL)TYPE uses DEC's SCAN/WILD and thus reads SWITCH.INI[0,0]
  i.e. from your GFD'd directory.  I could force it to your AUN
       by hacking SCAN, but I don't know if I should do that?

(SPL) just has the .NWS file.

PEAK IDEA!
  "IF" there are multiple buffers to write out, (maybe always),
  Why not tell the user (one line per buffer) the filename that
  is being written out.  That way, the user can at least figure
  out what happenned if the same file is edited twice!!!

  (maybe always?)  What's one line telling what was written.  If
  there are multiple buffers the one I'm in may not be the ONE
  that I'm writing out either...  The message would be great!!!!

  What do you think?

/Carl


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 25,1983 0:53
La Voila!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It was "easy"!
  My new version of SLIGOS' SCAN looks for SWITCH.INI[-aun-] and
it is installed in (MPL)TYPE.  NOW!  Will also be in (FTSYS)RUNOFF
when I re-transmit it.  That won't be until I find the WILD bug.

From: CARL

Ken,
  I realize that this is probably NOT a bug, but I consider it rather
"RUDE" and un-useable behavior!!!!!!!!!  (Re: PEAK, or course!)

The ^K (Kill Line) function is quite useless for deleting a form-feed
character.  In effect, it kills the form-feed and the next line.  I can
understand that in NON-PAGE mode, the ^L resides on the beginning of
the line and thus, it make sense.  However, the default mode is PAGE-
MODE (or I think it is), and IF I delete a ^L at the bottom of the
screen, I "EXPECT" to see the first line of the next page, NOT the
second!!!!!!!!!!!!  Besides, I NEVER GET TO SEE THE LINE I'M DELETING
IF I DELETE LINES, ONE AT A TIME, WHEN I CROSS A PAGE BOUNDARY.

TECO, and SOS handle page marks as though they are a LINE terminator,
such as a VT (vertical tab) or LF (line-feed).  I think that PEAK
should also!

Also, for the LA50, Mike did a version of under that does underlining,
and overprinting.  It is on (pub), called "tunder".  Hopefully, as soon
as I get around to it, it will trap control-C's and not cause the
problem of leaving output to the printer (at present it has the same
problem as (mpl)type).
-Lois


From: KEN
Date: SEPTEMBER 26,1983 10:23
you are right. it's a bug.  it seems i never try to delete ffs with ^K,
otherwise i would have noticed it eariler.  i think that breakpageonff is
a display-only toggle, and the behavior of ^K should always be as you
describe.

From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 26,1983 13:13
Ref: 17 ==> 18 bit uun's on TYMCOM-X.

My first inclination is to say that there shouldn't be any major problems
but DEC, and (who knows what WFW did) some others depend on the GAN and
UUN not having the "sign" bit (the 18th bit) set.  In other places this
is used to designate "all" ppn's in that GAN, as in the case of 3,777777.

It is preferable to keep the 18th bit CLEAR, unfortunately, for some
sense of compatibility and so as NOT to break ay ancient software that
relies on it.

From: CARL

I see no reason why your /HPITCH doesn't work.

There's no reason NOT to make the 350 understand the appropriate
pitch settings.  Get me a 350 manual, and I'll setup another device.
(That's why I made it /DEVICE:XXX instead of simply /XXX).

    and the 2 CMD related routines (p4 & p6) in COMM3

--------------------------------------------

  New feature is, any unique abbreviation for variables and command
names will work fine where referenced.  Error message is smart enough

are re-displayed in their entirety (sp?) where applicable.
