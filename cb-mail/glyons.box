all:  rpg 141.0 up on sys has new MAIL features

1) Bill's @-construction bug is fixed. you can send name:name:@file;
I can't get send @file1:@file2 to work, nor can I get it to work
if you put any <name> after @file in the list.  It doesn't complain
about trailing names, but they don't get the mail, either.  RPG's
failures are now "safe"..they will not destroy the mailbox database,
just give you NO SUCH FILE name  messages.
2) You can say .send name,name,name,   comma now works. Space doesnt.
";" doesnt. ")" does [that is not my doing!]
3) Length restrictions on mail are removed.  Send as much terminal
text as you wish.  RPG will just keep sending more mail for you,
all dated with the original block of mail.  If you send a file's
contents, you are allowed to send only 1 block.

I have considered allowing the sender to append TTY text to short
files he might send.  If I send a small file FOO which fits
within a single mail package leaving room to spare, it would be
nice perhaps to be able to type in some additional stuff, then ^D.
i.e.,

.send name:name
@FOO
a little more text
^D
.

However, this means that anybody who wants to send JUST the file
contents would now have to ^D after the file name, which he never
had to do before.
.send name
@FOO
^D
.

Does anybody think this is a major objection, or if the idea
is valuable?

Opinions, please.

what was "reasonable".

amount of KS stuff to be done.  I want to all I can for the KS but I don't want
to be late with BOOTS either.

OK. SCNSER.MAC => SCNSER.E04, new SCNSER => SCNSER.MAC in KS2020. But
all the new one has (besides line numbers) is the fix from ILDB to UUILDB
at CLSLP1.

BILL, PTYs Don't work on p034/e07.  It is the test monitor for mergeing KMC
stuff into p034/E.  None of the source changes that broke PTYs are in (m33)
yet.  Let me know if you notice anything other than PTYs that is broken.


From: BOWLESM
Date: JUNE 16,1980 18:13
(M33)SCNSER.E08 is a SMERGE of (KS2020)SCNSER.MAC and the /E06 (M33)SCNSER.
It does not assemble using MONED1: there are a half-dozen undefined
symbols (CSHIVL IFKMC IFNKMC KMCDO RDIO WRIO). I assume this is because
I need a different S.MAC from the (M33) one. At any rate, it's there
if you can make a monitor out of it. PAUX fails under /E06 only because
of an umimplemented TINASS cause; when that call is commented out, it
works fine.

MURRAY,  I swapped scnser.mac and scnser.e08 and move all the rest of the KMC
changes into (m33).  Now the backups are *.e08.


From: BOWLESM
Date: JUNE 17,1980 15:30
Shouldn't the backups be .E07? (Since the monitor is /E08).


From: GLYONS

I've set the LOGOUT QUOTA for M33 to 14000 pages.  This will not ever prevent
anyone from creating any files, the only effect is that the message "LOGOUT
QUOTA EXCEEDED BY xxxx PAGES" will appear when somebody

From: WRS
Date: JUNE 18,1980 13:50
LOGS out or GFDs out.
The idea is to let people know when its time to look around for unnecessary
old versions.  I urge people to voluntarily set the LOGOUT QUOTA on their own
directories ... ideally, all the logout quotas should add up to the amount of
disk we have.  If you send me mail with a # in it, I'll set it for you.

BILL,  (m33)37XE08 is the KI version of the KMC-PTY smerge.  PTYs seem to work
in the KS version.  If you get a chance to bring E08 up and try the EXEC out
on it please do.  I'm anxious to see it tested but I'm tied up during non-prime
time this all this week.  Thanks. /GL

At first glance, there seems to be some subtle bug in the terminal parameter

well be the program I'm using to test it.

To all of you who blamed the poor OPRs for zeroing memory before dumping:
Jim Westlake and I have discovered that if the operator has to load in
boots from KLDCP DECtape, KLDCP zeroes all of memory below where it reads
in BOTLOD (which is at 334000). so this is why we are not getting dumps on KLs
when deposit in 30 fails to load in BOOTS. More on this later as we find
out more about whether or not it ever worked (which I think it did.)

"So that even now the machines will only serve on condition of being
served, and that too upon their own terms; the moment their terms are
not complied with, they jib, and either smash both themselves and all
whom they can reach, or turn churlish and refuse to work at all.  How
many men at this hour are living in a state of bondage to the machines?
How many spend their whole lives, from the cradle to the grave, in
tending them by night and day?  Is it not plain that the machines are
gaining ground upon us, when we reflect on the increasing number of
those who are bound down to them as slaves, and of those who devote
their whole souls to the advancement of the mechanical kingdom?"

Ernie, The "W" rel files are for TRWs NON-KMC monitor.  The KMC affects many
modules.  When TRW gets its KMC later this month all KS systems WILL include
a KMC and the "W" rel files will go away forever.  Thanks on DDT and for mail

Greg,
Paul Gilfoyle just called to ask if 2020s can have 4-digit host numbers.
I told him that they could.  I thought that we had been through all of

What's the problem with network access to 930? Both yesterday and today I
get periodically kicked off, followed by a long spell of "host not
available through network" (from node 1017 - MVSR1). When I came in
yesterday to try working from the office, node 1327 seemed to be totally
dead. Is this TYMNET's fault? If so, who in the TYMNET group should I
rant and rave at? Whatever the problem is, it is unacceptable.

whereas when I run 20PASS from my username I get prompted for a username
and then a password.  Why the different prompts?  How does FORTHOFFER set
his local password on 930?

Message  17  3750 21 Jan 81  RECENT
From: Horton at OFFICE  
To:   Tymshare-User-Group
Subject: Upcoming Meeting

The response to the initial meeting of TYMSHARE users of AUGMENT, which took
place over a month ago, was so favorable that we have indeed decided to
make this group a recurring seminar for anyone wishing to  attend from
TYMSHARE or TYMNET.  As you may know, the next meeting is scheduled for
Tuesday, January 27th, at 3:00 pm in the large theater room near TYMNET.

One little bit of news to announce:  As of yesterday, Kathey Holland
was assigned to new accounts, and yours truly will be taking over her 
responsibilities with the TYMSHARE account.  Kathey will, as her 
schedule permits, be helping with TYMSHARE account applications, and I 
am sure you will join with me in thanking Kathey for her past, present 
and future assistance of internal clients.

As in our last session, will will continue with demonstrations of various
applications currently ongoing here at TYMSHARE.  Also, in response to
various requests, we will show some rather interesting applications of
the new TABLE subsystem, and demonstrate some of the new features and
capabilities of this powerful tool.  If you have any other suggestions
as to subsystems you would like to see demonstrated, please send me
a message with your request and I will do my best to comply.

One last thought:  If you have any friends who would like to see AUGMENT,
don't hesitate to bring them along to this meeting.  It is difficult
to TELL someone about AUGMENT, you must SHOW it to them.

Regards Horton

More about PFD:

The Purge Command has been 90% implemented.  The 10% which is
missing is the part to create foo.PFD in the author's directory
which contains a list of files which belong in the PFD.

Both DELETE and PURGE will attempt to rename all files out of the
PFD and into the author's directory before allowing the user to
do a DELETE of the PFD itself.  This will aid immensely in keeping
you from accidentally deleting the PFD with files inside of it.

SALTYRON just had a memo sent to us stating that all files dumps will
only be done every month instead of every week. This is because it takes
a long time to do them. I'm not happy about this, since during normal
operating system development cycles it is not unusual to lose the
file system while messing around with the machine stand alone. So, it would
help greatly if we could cut down on the amount of storage we keep hanging
around. I don't mean anything that is in the slightest bit desired - just
the junk thats not really being used. Good example are garbage crash files
on (SYS). This way the all files dump will be shorter and will cause less
problems.

PLEASE RESPOND TO THE FOLLOWING MAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

If you have a 126 or other hardcopy terminal at home and wish to
upgrade to a 444/912 combination, please submit the following to
your manager:
1) A requisition form for a 444 terminal and 912 modem.  Please note on
the requisition that this is in exchange for a model 126 and give the
serial number of the 126.
2) A note stating how many hours per month you currently work from home
and how many additional hours you would work from home if you had the
444/912 combination.

I have checked with EPM.  The current delivery time on 444s is 10 to 12
weeks, on 912s is 4 to 6 weeks and there is no problem with disposing
of 126s.  They will all get good homes without being scrapped.  Please
submit your requisitions ASAP.  When I get them all, I will hand carry
them all through at once and see if I can get better delivery times.

Please respond to this mail with mail stating whether you are
submitting a requisition or whether you are satsified with your current
terminal configuration.  If you want changes to your office terminal
configuration, please see me or your manager.

	I will be submitting a request for a 444 and a 912.  I will be glad
to turn in my 126 as soon as the 912 arrives (I'm confident that I can get a
friend to loan me a CRT until the 444 arrives).  /Greg

Folks,
Laszlo has signed requisitions for 444 terminals.  Unfortunately, none of 
them are ours, because we haven't submitted them yet.  If you want a 444/912
please, please, PLEASE get your req in ASAP (yesterday would have been nice).

Managers,
Please canvass your people and get their reqs ASAP.  I would like to get
them to Laszlo while the momory of the Rickey's meeting is still fresh.

Thank you,
/Sherman

Bill,
The main difference between Ernie's init and ours is defered echo.  With NO DEF
and TTY RBS and TTY BSD you can reproduce the ernie effect.  DEF maskes the
effect, New command allows turning off the "Remote BS echo" which is setup
from login terminal characteristics (same as CR delay etc.).

If you have a BUBB-NET node and are still typing NETC or NETV, send mail to

the Pre and Post interview sections and put them in a form to distribute with
Resumes (and interview schedule) so we can smooth out this process a bit.

Laszlo would like to meet with the TYMCOM/X System Section managers
at 4:00 PM tomorrow, Feb 25 in his office.  I don't know what he wants
to discuss, but he has indicated a desire to meet with us before he
signs the terminal requisitions.  I suspect he will probably want to
know what we have done and what we are planning to do to improve the
state of the section, and what impact we expect these new terminals to 
have.  He may want some commitments concerning what we will be able
to accomplish if he approves the terminal requisitions.

I am unaware of the "normal" procedures concerning interviewing, but in
any case I am interested in talking to Susan.  I have a very selfish
reason: I enjoy working with a good crowd and am willing to work to try
to keep that crowd good.
Let me know about timing etc. when you can.

Greg: I've ask Carl to take the "<>" hack out of the sources.  If you get a
chance before he does, help yourself.  I'm a little upset that that kind of
thing would be put in the sources without my permission.  Please remind Carl
that any monitor changes should be cleared first!  There are exceptions to
this, but until Carl gets used to things, etc., he should clear everything.

I've been on other systems for a few days, so I haven't read my mail...

1)  Please try and fit in some time on Monday for me to see Susan Hanson.

2)  I will try to get to the "<>" hack, but feel free if you get there
    first.

3)  About the "<>" hack.  Please tell bill, that I did "clear" that, by
    virtue of you telling me to go ahead with it.  I haven't (won't)
    make any changes without someone else ok'ing it (after this anyway!).
    Please make that clear to all concerned.  I don't want to take the
    responsibility for things I am not wholly responsible... I got into
    a bad situation at least once by doing that... I don't want that to
    happen here.  (I can go on and on about that.. so NUFF?)

4)  See me about MAGCON.  It needs further testing, but it may be fixed
    as of this morning.  I did not do an exhaustive search.  I can also
    write up some thing which need to be changed, but I believe are not
    high enough priority to be done.

I thought you'd be mildly interested...  I sent a letter to my father
a week or so ago and got a reply from him today.  I didn't do what you
had suggested, because it wasn't appropriate.  But, anyway, by sending
the letter to him, instead of to Mr & Mrs & Family, I made him a center
of attention for awhile.  He almost complained "Send a letter to everyone,
not just to me."  ha ha.. well, i thought you'd be interested.

Anyway, I got part of my test data-base into magnum & hot it to do
some things.  (That "hot" was "GOT").  There seem to be many drawbacks
to MAGNUM, especially if you have to specify the keys all the way out
each time, for re-entry of data... Yuk!

The first project I would like to have one of the CO-OP students tackle is
getting the latest transmittal of our products copied and into our files.  If
we are going to maintain hard copy ITSR files we need to have at least one
(if not the latest) transmittal for each product in our files.  Having to
go thru Ron's files for half of our products (which we may get calls on and
never have seen) is unacceptable.  Do you think Ron will approve of such a
project?  I have better things for Lois to work on (Perhaps including  the
supervision of the CO-OP student's filing).

TYMSHARE is now in a position to provide 2020 maintenance.  In order to
get Tymshare started and DEC turned off, I need to have the serial numbers
of the process and peripherals.  I believe I already have the CPU serial
number, but I do need the serial numbers of the peripherals.  Do you have
them, or can you easily read them off the back of the equipment?  If you
can't get them easily, I can probably get them from Allen Ginzburg, so
don't waste a lot of time.  Thanks ... /Sherman

From: WRS

1. tell Mike that Jane Perry says forms are ready.
2. tell Marconi that there is a much better chance of /I working than a hacked
up /G - also mention that we really can't get /G rebuilt by then because its
not online anymore.  -Bill  (I mean tell Ron Stevens)


From: WRS
Date: MARCH 19,1981 13:59
Ooops, I guess /G is online afterall (in OSB).  I still don't think its
a good idea, because /G is pretty unreliable without all the patches and
we don't really know what they all are.  If they insist, make a new /G
with the new config file, but try to talk them out of it.  -Bill


From: WRS

Bill, Greg:

Sub: Tom Marconi's request for monitor changes (reconfigurations)

All the configuration files have been setup in M33.  However, since
Tom wants them ASAP, he also wants them setup with the current /G
monitors, until /I or /J goes out.

Fine.   However, a quick look at the systems shows V25 ../G-4,
D37 ../G-7, D54 ../G-2, D56 ../G-7,  D65 ../G-3.

Um... I know how to give him /G (OSB) or /H (OSP) or /??? (M33) without
any patches.  What about any of the -n patches which I'm sure are
different ones for each system.  What is the proper procedure for doing
this correctly???  I was all set to do it & ... OH! What about the
current patches?  ... He doesn't want to run "H" I am told, and I don't
feel too good about giving him a "G" monitor without any patches.

I sent him a message saying that I would try to have it done sometime
tomorrow, so, any info you can give me would be helpful.  (I can always
tell him it will take longer, and give him /G27 or whatever it's up to.)
{Which is equiv. to /H or /I}

Bill & I have discussed the new configurations for dallas...
as of this writing... I'll generate a /H from (OSP) for D37 & D54
which are both KL's, and tell MARCONIT:54 via mail, that they will
have to wait a couple of days for the KI's which will be getting /I.

-- Wanted both of you to know, since I can't give them the current
   version of /H-/I and I think /G without any bug fixes is totally
   unacceptable to all of us.

I'm probably not going to make it to the meeting tomorrow, as I still
am running a considerable fever.  Please get as many specifices as you
can so you can explain it to me.  Since I've been on it once (before it
was revised) I don't expect to have much trouble.  Mostly I need to
know what fields are required and what the TASK codes are.  And copies
of all the forms and perhaps some examples of the reports would be nice.

I've told Carl to forget trying to kludge together a /G, without the
patches, its a very poor performer and is very sensitive to the load
on 54.  I feel much better about /H whose only know problem is it doesn'
like KIs.  Please keep me informed if there are any problems with this.
I suppose we could always patch the version number to /G28, after all,
the changes G01-G27 are mostly just the patches they need anyway.  [this
was not meant as a literal suggestion, rather a means of illustrating
their paranioa about the letter field changing as opposed to a number.

Printer problem was very intermittant.  But I guess we can go ahead and
cancel.  From what I heard after the TYMCARE meeting I'm surprised we were
able to get Rick(DEC) to come out.  I heard that DEC is ticked at us and
will not maintain ANY of our 3 2020s in Cupertino.  I don't like that
situation.  I've said to EVERYONE that we should keep one local 2020 on
DEC maintance forever as a control and a source of contact/information.

I need to order phones for Lee and Lois.  Shall we change the HOTLINE number?
I would say, for sake of ultimate flexibility, that we should keep one outside
line (say 446-3999) and keep it normally forwarding to the 2nd line which
would be changed to a centrex number with the same last 3 digits (say 446-7999).
Then advertise the 3999 number as the backup and 7999 as the HOTLINE so that
we control the destination of the backup as an alternative to whatever Msg
center service we can arrange.  (we may want to add 7998, 7997 for overflow)

Q: Do you know where the reference is in the bible to where Christ is
  describing the end of the world or some such, and he makes reference to
  ...if you do this for the least of my brethren, then you do it for me.. or
  ...if you refuse the least of my brethren, then you refuse me...

I don't have the quote right, but I think you may know what I'm talking about.

Greg,
What is the situation for terminals for Lois.  I have a 126 to turn in
and unless lois needs it, it should be given to Ellen.  Let me know
so I can do the right thing on Monday morning.

(Mike says that Laz is being sticky about signing terminal req's for
new hires until we turn in our 126's).

/Carl.


From: GLYONS

Go ahead and turn in the 126.
The "Sheep from the Goats" parable is Matt 25:31-46.  Thats probably the one
you are thinking of.  See Matt 24 and Luke 21 for more on the end, and try
John 13:34,3:16; I John 4:7,8; and I Corinthians 13 for LOVE.

  We are going to have to put her in the vacant office directly across the
hall from Ellen's office.  (I KNOW, I KNOW!!)  This is not desirable, but
the best that could be done.  Jay now has THREE consultants all told in the
"Bomberger" office.  We will move her close to the rest of us just as soon as
it is possible to do so.  Most likley scenario at the moment is that Colton
will be moved, and I'll take his office, freeing mine.
  There really just isn't anythng else that can be done right now.  Our space
problems should clear up by sometime in June at the latest--but for now we
have to make do.  (There are also several other new hires in the division
coming in in 2-4 weeks, so it is tough for everyone.  We're not being singled
out for poor treatment.  The company is just growing faster that Real Estate
can currently handle.)						  /Mike

I forget who was with me the other day when the "soundex" code
was mentioned, but for your perusal there is a file (carl:930)
soundex.txt which is the "official" document used by Social Security
for their employees.

Some sample uses (or codes) would be...

Baltrunas	B-436
Brengle		B-652
Corenson	C-652
Daniels		D-542
Gadol		G-340
Gavette		G-130
Hinckley	H-524
Lenkov		L-521
Lyons		L-520
Price		P-620
Roysden		R-235
Socci		S-200
Soley		S-400

Now memorize those codes, they will be the new system numbers for our
new centers in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Geneva, Halifax, Livermore,
Puerto Rico, Richmond and Sarajevo.

Re: 98.6

CC: Glyons, Wrs, Adele, Mch, Sgavette.

I still haven't seen 98.6 on my thermometer, so I may not be in again
today.  I'm up around 99.+ and I'm reasonably healthy, but I find it
difficult to stay up for more than 4-5 hours at a time without feeling
really tired.

If I don't have a fever when I wake up later, then I will "maybe" come
in, since I do have some things to finish up, which require some minimal
attention.  (eg. Utilities meeting, turning in my 126, watering my plant,
picking up any postal mail, etc.)

Re: MAGCON

There is now a version that works for reading & writing IBM labels with
the filenames written out as Zxxxxxx.Zyyy foreach xxxxxx.yyy read in
and upon reading back it ignores the Z's and the ".", however this will
not be compatible with old tapes written with MAGCON, which didn't do it
right anyway.

I have not looked at the multi-reel or translation table stuff yet, since
I left the listing at the office.

I will send RUSSELLB and GWOLF mail telling them to have Ranier Bank cut
a tepe and try it out on their IBM system.

There are 6 crashes on (carl:930) from system 118, also a
crashid.log and an FD034H from (m33:118).  All were moved from
118 due to imminent disk space failure if one more crash happenned.
Many may be from (all are from) my pty.sai on 118 which crashes it.
[Quite reliably!]  Anyone interested in diagnosing the crashes may
do so.  (we can send a copy of my program to Dallas for tomorrow?)

I made up a little hack to delete files with rib errors to give to the

we may as well give them a program till we get the real solution

group that there was a RIB error in case we want to know about it.

Greg,

I noticed that you had some things on 1051 for looking for a bad file.
Did you find the bad one?

I ran CKSUM on every file on the system (almost) and didn't find any that
I couldn't read.  A few were empty, but none were unreadable.

I ran DMS to see if all files could be looked up, and it looked at
all the files on the system including UFD's without any problem reading
the RIBS.

I also ran DSKCLN in FULL mode and again in checking mode and received
the same results.  Any suggestions?

Eg.  Any ideas why TITO might kill the system?

You really have to stop that "GO HOME" bit.
I might really start to get a complex.

If you really would prefer me here at a specific time,
then say so, and I will try, however, I'd prefer not to
be on any STRICT schedule.

I realize a good portion of it is in "FUN" and you do have a
responsibility as unit manager, but I don't have anything to
go home to, except physical labor of cleaning up, or to sleep
and I'm not interested in sleeping yet.  In fact, I'm just
beginning to wake up after being "tired" for the past few hours.

Thanks again for the Bible references, some interesting reading.
I hope their intent is taken, because I do think that what I am
doing about some things is what God would want me to do, at least
when I ask, it is all he seems to be telling me to do.

Have a nice weekend...

(GLYONS)PC70TS.DAT is where I've been playing with PC70 project specs.  Best
I've been able to do so far is 6 catagories.  I chose to include the quarter
spec (81B) in the catagory name since I'm not interested in reports beyond
quarters (I still leave room for seq #s in proj name just incase).  This is
certainly not complete or final but has features I like.  Let me know if you
see any grave problems.
Catagories are:
	ADM81B	- Administration (2nd Quarter 81)
	TRA81B	- Training (essentil^aal for my section) (?CRLF?)
	CON81B	- Consulting (probably not broken down by TMS, INSD etc.)
	SER81B	- Services (Non-development work performed for ???)
	LIB81B	- Section Library work (both DOC and program libs)

Stan Derry says next Monday is also not possible.  Possible dates for
Ernie's Monitor Internals Class (as per their schedule and room
availibility) are:

     Friday, May 8:  1 - 6
     Tuesday, May 12:  1 - 6
     or any of Monday-Thursday, May 4-7:  9 - 3 (room scheduled from 3 - 6).

Would you please let me know which of these possibilities you prefer,
and also if any of the proposed times are impossible for you.

How long do you anticipate the class will be?  Stan would really like to
schedule the class as soon as possible, and hence would prefer one of the
days early in the week of the 4th, if the times would work out.

Thanks.

The Monitor internals class has been rescheduled for Wed May 6th from 10AM to
3PM with a break for lunch.  Tuesday the 5th (same time) is an alternate
possibility if enough people have a conflict on wednesday to justify the change.
Tuesday conflicts with the FTP meeting --- so if you want to change it give me

  I think we need to get rolling with our planning--especially factoring in
recent changes in the situation with COEES.  I haven't been able to come up
with anywhere for a full day meeting on Monday, but I'd rather have us meet
early in the week as opposed to late.  So (unless someone strongly objects
to sitting on pillows on the floor), I'll volunteer my place starting at
13:00 on Monday.  That way we can at least have a full afternoon (and
people's schedules permitting, early evening) off-premises.  
  Address is 2540 Dell Ave.  It's just behind Mayfield Mall.  I'll try to
have maps on your desks by Monday morning.  If you can't make it let me
know as soon as possible.					/Mike

should probably hold the line on the date and time at this point.
There is always someone who has something else to go to.

Hi Greg!

FINE (SYS:CT4) on 930 now checks for JP.TYM and if you're a good guy
that is, if you're setup!  Off you go.  If not, then it checks JP.MOD
and indexes into a table based on your EXEC mode and off it goes to
run SYS:EDIT10, SYS:EDITOR, SYS:EDITOR, SYS:EDITOR with whatever command
you gave to it. (i.e.  Run CT4, or EDIT, or CREATE.. etc.)

Now about those other things... See you at the ITSR (pass!)

Greg,
I talked to Cody Wells re answering services, and he said they now have a 24
hour coverage here.  Their only problem is that there really are not enough
calls to keep their people busy.

Would there be any possibility of using their people for our hot line service?
There people are trained to answer the incoming problems, but Cody seemed to
feel it might be a possibility to have the two combined.  Marc Zammit is the
person who is handling this, x7985.^k^k^k^l^l^l^l^l^k^k^l^l^lir

Don Johnson has used many different answering service, and says they now use
AnswerPage, which is about as good as they have been able to get.  His opinion
is that they are all not as reliable as you would like, due to the caliber of
the people they hire.

What about "SCREEN" for Screen Can Really Emulate Emacs Nicely

I actually "like" (?) SCREEN better than "FINS" Fins Is Not Supported.

SCREEN can also mean one of --


	{ Screen   Can      Really   Emulate     Emacs    Nicely }
	{          Could    Royally  Eliminate   Everything      }

!!! FINE Users !!!!

Please copy the file (CARL)FINE.TUT into your respective directory
and run FINE {a la CT4} to edit that file.  Please make your own
copy, as it is read-only on my area.

It is a "TUTORIAL" based/converted from the MIT-EMACS tutorial which
is designed to get people "started" using <*FINE*>.

Please run through it A.S.A.P. (it takes about 1/2 hr at 1200 baud,
slightly less for those who already know something about FINE.)

Please send me your comments & suggestions.  Does it grossly miss the
point anywhere?  Is it too much to give someone to go through?
(Janice Bessling is my next test-subject {completely uninitiated})
I would like to install that with <*FINE*> for its transmittal.

Glad you asked.  I've been trying to get ahold of you.  A quick look at

time, and involve Ernie, and Adele as well as myself.  If you can give me
a deadline, some idea of your current confidence in the document, and
what (if any) specific types of "errors" you want us to check for then I
will be able to give you a much better progress report.

Especially, Reason for validation:
  for (VUE) - ? Editor sources, current!

  for (YEUX)- ? Editor development area.  Necessary so I don't
                really screw things.  Patches are not easy to

Re: How's it going?
Slow.

I went around to most of the systems and read through the stream
accounting records to see who was/has using/used CT4 since jan-1 or
however long ago the records still exist.

It is interesting to note that various people have made copies of
sys:ct4 or copied [930]sys:ct4 into their personal directories on
many of the systems.

Jim Parkhurst (tymnet)~~(now MIS tymshare) has scheduled a class for
FINE sometime next week or so, so I have to see about contacting him
and attempting to gain some control over this product we have, even
if it is INTERNAL!.
    I've sent him mail & also left a msg with his secretary, so I
should hear back soon.  If you think it is allright, I will attempt
to have him work with me a little on the documentation, so as to
make communications better.

Re: VUE -- I need to see about setting up some kind of user forum.  If
we intend to make any changes, we have to have a vehicle to inform the
users of them, so that they do not get screwed.
    If nothing else, something which makes it clear that almost everything
could change, but please bear with us while it changes & feel free to
suggest changes from the people who use it.
    Any ideas on how to do that here at Tymshare?

I took two calls at your desk today.  (1) Bruce called.

(2) Pete Meyers [Tymcare] Called.
    Apparently, a magnum procedure problem most probably, but he was
    unable to compile a magnum procedure & was being given an error
    message which (after conferring with Chris Larue) appeared to be
    caused by something wrong with the cross-reference file of names
    which caused magnum to try to read a page from a file (temporary?)
    which happenned to be a hole, instead of a page!  I referred him
    to talk with Nick Taddeo of Magnum group...

(2a) He also seems to have a problem with MAGCON.  He's running version
     5.2 (my new one is 5.4) and while attempting to write an unlabled
     tape, 80 char records, he gets an extra record written at the

I've made some changes to (WRS)TASK.DAT based on some further reading.  I'm
starting to feel real comfortable with the list, with the exception of the
catagory of meetings.  It appears all over.  We need to discuss which meetings
we want to classify as meetings as opposed to <XXX> where <XXX> is the subject
of the meeting.  All of the material I have read, mostly agrees on everything
else, but they generally don't mention meetings.  Also, I've made up most of
the non-development catagory myself - that's kind of unique to us.  Gee...
this msg is getting long...in summary:

Please pay special attention to

	ON (JAIL:930) is a copy of the new SAIL compiler.  A brief, incomplete,
cryptic (get the picture?) note about the new compiler is (JAIL:930)SAIL.NEW
Some warnings: (1) the SAILIB routines have not been reworked for this version,
		so you will at least get a warning message, and the routines
		MAY not work.
		(2) GOGTAB.DEF is now very different.  To use GOGTAB entries,
		   make sure you access (JAIL)GOGTAB.DEF, not the one from
			SYS:
		(3) This compilers version number will go away, so nothing
		  compiled with it will be useable without re-compilation
		  when the new compiler really comes out.
		(4) The files on (JAIL) will go away when the new compiler
		  comes out, and the compiler and libraries are subject to 
		  change without notice (although only by bugfixes and ^r
		  extensions, old working versions should still work).

These changes are as follows:

1) ^S now does Incremental searching
2) ^R  "   "       "         "
3) $S does the old style searching
4) $R does the old style searching
5) $$ <escape><dollar> does replace string (old $R)
6) $% <escape><percent> does query-replace string (old $Q)
7) $* does the parameter setting (old $S)
--------------------------------------------------------
The status line has changed slightly, but will not affect anyone.

Some of you have VUE.INI files which must be changed.  Some of you

You need to give my unit a class on Monitor Patching.  I copied
(m33:24)RMWAIT.PAT to :930 but I'm not sure It's right.  We also need
to clarify the patching strategy.  I thought there was supposed to be
a few words reserved for "patch bits" and that the /J-# patch level
was to reflect the latest patch applied. (Quick and dirty patches
that have no command file should use somthing other than "-")  Also
Patch files should have a corresponding "UNPATCH" file to back them out.
You might want to be arround Thursday PM to talk to Dave Smith.

Anyway I just wanted to let you know that was done so we won't duplicate
effort.  (I only changes the .CMD file.  CONF56.MAC looked ok to me.)
Carl says Marconi specified a KI monitor for 56.  ^aAnyway its telecopying

Thanks much for the plug.  I worked at home all day today so if any decision

announcement?  As to patching, the bit-per-patch idea is something
that was under discussion, but as for now we're still doing it the
old way: i.e. patch level = # of patches with no bit map.  We should
get the new pathing strategy finalized ASAP, perhaps we can do it

done.  Have added a lot, and will be adding a bit more than I expected.
Am up to 35 pages now, although 14 pages of that is command summary
and that will be cut by 1/2-1/4 and then tripled for 3 ways of ordering
the text.

My deadlines are set based upon a facsimile of me that is healthy and
not in pain, but I will try not to let them slip any further than is
humanly possible.

Darren's battery doesn't seem top make much difference.  I think it's
the micro-net or something dropping characters... although Darren's
battery helps it... it's only happenned 1 or 2 times, but not anywhere
as bad as it was happenning.

Talk to you later.
  Don't hesitate to call for informational purposes.  I can still think
lying down, just difficult to type.

I am feeling much better.  Still in a little pain, but the past
two days (yesterday & 2 hours today) I've not needed any aspirin
just to keep the pain down.
   (Although I may be speaking just a little too soon.)

I should be in soon, to continue with the VUE documentation.  I am
going to change another command.  $K (Meta-K) is going away, it can
be gotten at by typing Meta-\, thus Meta-K can be used for "kill" to
end of sentence once I get that code working.

Same-same with Meta-A (ask user, I need to find anther key) and Meta-E
(call editor recursively).  These should mean go to beginning and end
of a sentence.

Maintenance has a 2-pack system which they use to run their

  They bring up the system MANUALLY, set schedule 600000 and
run "FULL" DSKCLN.   After DSKCLN is finished, they attempt to
"GFD" and they get the "Boots Loaded" prompt.

If they do not run DSKCLN, or the dskcln type is not "FULL", then
everything works fine.  Prior to /J (i.e. /G7) thy had no problems.

VUE has changed again!  This time, the changes affect the calling
of keyboard macros (for the better [in all but one instance]).  One
change which will affect you immediately (if you use this command) is
the change to the Meta-K (<esc>K) command.  You now must use Meta-\
instead, M-K has been made illegal temporarily. (for Sentences!)

Other changes...  $A is now  typed as C-X Q  for query from a macro
                  $C is now  typed as C-X E  for execute keyboard macro
                  $E is now  typed as C-X *  for recursive editing
                        (later to also work as C-U C-X Q, but not yet!)
                  C-X M is now ... as C-X (  for begin macro definition
                  $P is now  typed as C-X )  for "end" macro definition

  $A, $E, $K return "Error" now, until sentences are installed.
  $C, C-X M and $P are "redundant"ly the same until the fingers "re"learn
             a new pattern, however, they will be undocumented, or listed
             as "reserved"!

These changes have already taken effect on :930 and :118.  Elsewhere
when the transmittal is complete.

(Actually, I tickled it enough that I had to!)
Anyway, it was going off the deep end by dropping
off the end of the screen searching for a carriage-return
which was never written.  It was setting up the screen length
from a hard-variable which was wrong, before it knew what size
screen, before it knew what kind of terminal.  So, moved the
code & it works.  BUG Gone!  <Shot> with DDT!

Another announcement will be forthcoming, but chances are you will find
this one helpful in the meantime.  Due to the nature of the CT4/VUE editor,
and the problems of re-learning later, many massive changes have taken
place.  These involve changing the commands which specific keys perform
to other commands, and removing some commands.  INIT files have also had
a major change, thus, I want each of you to obtain a copy of the "NEW"
documentation for VUE (and read it!) before you find yourself "stuck"!

Although it will be tedious & somewhat boring, I encourage you to read over
the entire DOC file.  Some commands have changed 'slightly' and you may
find the descriptions of the commands helpful.  You need not read the
descriptions over again in the command index (at the end) unless you wish
to familiarize yourself with the "names" of commands.

There is a new version of EMPIRE on (GAMES).  The only significant
change is that it is no longer possible to accidently make
undesirable moves (e.g., dumping armies into the sea, grounding
ships, attacking your own pieces, etc.).  In fact, it is not possible
to deliberately make such moves, either.  There is one degenerate
case in which I was unable to determine whether the original version
of the program would do the undesirable, and therefore I did not
explicitly prevent it in the new version.  As an incentive for
EMPIRE addicts, whoever can successfully guess the nature of the
degenerate case AND determine the behaviour of the program in
said case wins a free lunch.  Happy EMPIREing...

Subj:	:934 status update.
The part recieved last week for the broken disk drive was NOT the part that
was needed (I think that means the wrong part was shipped, not that the wrog
part was ordered).
The uNode was installed without reference to the configurtaion doc I left them
last week (symtom = Run light won't stay on).  They will be correcting this
this afternoon.  If there are no NETCOM hardware problems I think they will
have :934 up on the net later this week.
I'll keep you posted.  If it is going to take a long time to get the 3rd drive
fixed we may want to accept it with just two drives and have them get the 3rd
to us whenever they can get it together.  (I don't know if they can test it
without an F3 but if they can't they need one of there own.  Westlake has
a VAX over there just for his HWD people to play with (TRAIN on that is) so
they should be able to justify a FOO.

I had a discussion with Lois today about the Dskcln bits.  You can
read the "old" type with a Gettab.  This in fact is how Dskcln does
it.  I showed Lois how to read this data and set the Restart word
accordingly.  /Todd

Greg,
I now have my terminal hooked up at home. Everything seems to be working
well.

Todd met with me today and explained about the DSKCLN bits.  I'm sorry I
didn't make that clear in my mail message.  I can either write the
program to set DSKCLN and upgrade it, or read what the old setting of
DSKCLN was and use that (which Todd felt was probably the best idea).

I'll talk to you about all this tomorrow.

I "just" (well not "just", but close anyway) found out why VUE wasn't
distributed everywhere.

My instructions weren't followed.

VUE "was" everywhere, but the old CT4.SHR files were not "deleted", thus
the CT4 command ran the old FINE instead of the CT4.sav which runs VUE!.
So, it is now everywhere.  I just went and deleted all the old files.

I see you're back!
I trust that you had an enjoyable weekend.
Todd & I finally solved the problem with bringing up the Tymcare backup packs.
It was <stupid!>!!!
DSKCLN didn't have 'any' license, so it sat there waiting forever!
I put Todd, Darren, Carl & Lois on all three sets of packs.
(Well, you put most of the above on the 'real' packs for Tymcare.)
I put them on the backup packs.
Rocco came in yesterday to setup Ben's packs, I think for the benchmark?
Anyway, since they were up, I added the accounts & gave myself an OPER name.
Since I have to enter passwords, I didn't bother adding OPER names for the
rest of us.  All but LOIS have SETE passwords anyway.
Tell you more later.
We need to schedule more time with you and Adele and me.
Good Night!
Lois & Janice are supposed to wake me up at 9ish so I can come in to
go over the FRMOP stuff that Janice wants.
The rest of the day is unscheduled except for miscellaneous consulting.
I still haven't finished writing up the specifications for the LIBRARY
program for Scott.  Will pass it out to you, Tim, Scott, Dmitry, Lois &
Bill when it is done.  Scott & I decided to pass it out & do it 'right'
the first time.  (Even if it means it takes awhile to be 'finished'!).
I would have done some 'real' work, except that I don't trust the
network with all this line noise.  Node 1306 seems really flakey.  Since
you had trouble & I know both Mike & I did, it can't be Ma Bell (completely).
All of us (Mike, Scott, Bill & I) are all on the "96x" exchange group in
Mountain-View, so ot was feasible to assume Ma Bell has a hand in the noise.
Again, Good Night!!!

     I like what I see so far in the 2020 Spooler Design Spec.
     I think it would be good to have LPREQ handle the proposed function
of LPQ on systems other than the "host" (with printer).  LPREQ could
start the telecopy frame when a user submits a request as LPQ does now.
There is still no reason for the user to wait for its completion.  LPREQ
might give a status report by starting at telecopy frame to retrieve the
spool queue from the host, waiting for its completion (with the user given
a message to be patient), and reporting the results.  Hopefully the queue

will not be so large that this is a problem.

three seconds to complete.  I think the message is typed every thirty

this time - It's good to be able to communicate via a familiar medium after
such a long absence.)

Hello again,
    Have you been on vacation?  Please let me know what system to reach you
on.  Have you talked to Dave Lennert yet?  I`ll check back on :930 later in
the week.  God Bless.

Bill,
    If you could leave weekly TQ for the past few months of TYMSHARE and
UNION OIL of CALIF in (GLYONS)trend.rpt it would be a big help to me.
				Thanks

Hi Greg!  This is the right system.  I've been in a class on
ISIS programming since Jan 1.  (until Jan 28)  Every day 8:30-4:30.
(oh my)  Anyway, haven't talked to Dave yet.  (GLYONS)TREND.RPT as
you requested.  Let me know if you want to see volume too.  -Bill

Hi Carl,
  I got my picture taken.  Thanks.  It`s just of me so I doubt that you
really want a copy, but I`ll send one any way if you want.  The rules of
the Studio say that I have to wait a couple months between sittings so
the pictures with Melinda in them will be a while in coming.  I`ll be checking
mail on :930 every now and then for a while at least so drop me a note!
						Bye    /GL

Bill,
  Thanks, glad to hear from you.  How are the prospects for your doing work
on the network engines?  Is the class interesting in spite of the hour?
  Thanks for the report too, It`s time to start watching them both pretty 
closely.  I haven`t looked at the p^aapers but I would presume that the market
is doing pretty well as a whole right now.  Anyway both Melinda`s and my
stocks are about to test a new high.  The trend should be clear in week or two.
I`m hoping for 40 from UNION and high 20s from TYM.  I really don`t know what
to expect from TYM though.
  I`m afraid the idea of a VAX in Dallas is pretty dead.  I`m suppost to be
looking into cheaper solutions (from DEC).  I don`t like what I find.  A network
of MICRO-11s running RSX-11M+ is what I expect it will turn out to be; But
MICRO-11s arn`t due until APRIL (which being translated from DECese means mid-
summer at best) and a homogenous network of micro"hosts" has several significant
short comings. (Which I`ll elaborate on in segment 2 perhaps)
			end of segment 1
							Yours,
							Greg

(segment 2)
  Had to take a break.
  I`m looking hard at CP/M (80/86) and UNIX as alternatives.  You`ve heard
of the BRIDGE no doubt - A CP/M simulator for VAX and PDP11 with an optional
accelerator board for UNIBUS or Q-bus with up to 4 z80s w/64K each?  A very
cost effective way of giving everyone on a DECnet access to CP/M software if
 (hum I now have two copies of"they want it."
and I can`t figure out where the second one came from - what`s going on)
Anyway, I talked to them (Virtual microsystems, BErkley) and they may do a
CP/M-86 version too if the market demands it.  I`d almost rather have UNIX
with a CP/M so^himulator

Hi!

Glad to see you on.... I've been meaning to write you, but keep
putting it off.. Sigh!

	Hi Carl,

	Here is a note from Melinda:

	I have spent the last two of Greg's sessions watching him type
out letters to you and Bill.  I should be doing homework of course, but
I, too, have a certain facination with hacking.  Just to straighten thee
record, I am a librarian, not a programmer---but all the same I couldn't
stand Greg if I couldn't deal with computers.

	Greg sends the message that he got tentative approval to go out and
buy a system today.  That should keep him off the streets for a couple of
weeks.  After that he w----- Now Wait a minute!@!@!! I'M being slandered---
---After that he will take a couple weeks in California to regain his
(in)sanity (and see an old friend beat him in the marriage race).




		This is Greg again:  See you in May.  (And See if I turn
a terminal over to MELINDA AGAIN!!).

					Have Fun (but be good)

I'm off to home for now, so I'll read the rest of your letter there.

Hi Greg, Hi Melinda  (gee!  I've always liked that name ever since
                         working on the show: On a Clear Day ),

but, as I was saying, I'm off to home since I'm to meet my friend
Mike there soon, and probably have an evening of someone over for
company.

   Tel greg that he ought to get on the system more often.
  (unless of course, that interferes with his time with you, which
    is undoubtably MORE important! ))

/Carl.

Hi Greg!  (and Melinda!),

  Well, I really enjoyed hearing from you both, and it will be nice
to see Greg again (sigh!  No Melinda) out here in "sunny" california.
It's been raining out here just as much as anywhere, a really "rainy"
california actually!

  What's this about the marriage race?  Have you two set a date yet?
I'm not sure if you've told me everything... ..besides, I have to
plan for coming out to Bethesda for the wedding, and to see my folks
in Baltimore, etc, etc...

  Might even consider visinting my friend from college down in North
Carolina for a couple of days... seems like a good 1-day drive.

  Oh well, sometime later we should talk.
