Re: EXE file hack.

It will be moved to (MPL) but I wanted to discuss some things with
you about them first.  Four example, FOUR of them???  I should probably
do "some" work to make it "one" program... It is currently ONE source
file with two feature test switches.

My main concern is "which" of the current ones to put on MPL.. All of
them might be a bit much, although they only take up 2 pages each.

Well, 2 pages each isn't bad, ask Adele what she wants you to do.  Its

I guess they could be put over to MPL and left as is.. Of course, let LOIS
have something which says what thay are and all that.  The main differences
are (RUN vs GET) and (whether to do a REMAP for the highseg, or just to MAP
the pages).  It is useful to have all of them.  We'll see what Adele prefers.

Re: FILES in ONCE

I am still open for discussion (not in a mail message, because the
tone of the conversation usually gets misinterpreted)...

I am concerned about the changes to ONCE & ONCDSK.  Introducing the
FULL command is fine.  But, I am concerned that operations will NOT
make use of it unless you force them to use it instead of the "old"
way.

Making operations type out "FILES" instead of abbreviating it is also
fine, but again, that is based upon the order of the list and THAT is
not entirely OBVIOUS to anyone reading the code unless they've looked
at EVERY routine called and every place it is called from... etc...
  (I don't want to turn this into a discussion of who should and who
   shouldn't be modifying the monitor...)
  (the whole purpose of my making the modifications is to get them
   done, and free up the OS unit as a whole for more important fixes.)

I am not asking for the FILES command to be changed to ONCE either, just
that we discuss what is happenning now, and what we would like to do
in the future.  To set the DSKCLN mode on the disks themselves (home
blocks)  still requires going into the FILES command.

There is also the question of... rather only allowing FULL as a command
that we have FAST and NONE also, or some command which will allow the
second argument to be the DSKCLN type and only set it for the current
session, thus only requiring going into FILES for "real" reasons like
RESTRUCTURING or REPAIRING the file system or for setting DSKCLN type
on a set of packs before moving them to a new set of hardware..

YOU are administering the project, so I ask that you take the time to
discuss it before I make the changes and have to UN-make them because
that's not what you'd like.   I feel that what you've said so far, if
implemented by  just adding them to the existing structure is both
ARCHAIC and poor coding practice because of the existing code.  

Are we trying to make the interface MORE or LESS operator friendly?
and MORE or LESS apt to introduce error by an operator not thinking
or hitting the wrong keys!

I am currently implementing it the way you said, BUT I am uneasy about
doing this way and I want to go on record that THAT is how I feel about
it.  Someone will just be back into this code 6 months from now adding
the additional commands, or changing the existing format.

  Re: VUE
  To avoid problems... I don't know if you've been editing anything
on M33 or not... but since there are more than one of us GFD'd, if we
both used VUE at the same time... we could potentially clobber each
other's buffer.   A suggested work-around would be to always (whenever
possible) when editing a file get into VUE by saying "CT4<CR>" and
then "^X ^V file.ext"... this eliminates either of us having a buffer
named MAIN.VUE which is of any real value... then, unless we both try
to edit a file which makes the same buffer name, eg. COMMON.CAB, COMMON.TLC
then we won't cross each other...

Ps It's also a reeasonable habit to get into while working on "PUBLIC"

Bill,
  Just to be fair....   Please define a new project

  "Clean up and document ONCE dialogue"  or two projects

     "Clean up ONCE dialogue"
     "Document ONCE dialogue"

since these are not really the same as adding the FULL command or
making ONCDSK more difficult to enter...  Also, because the time
estimates I gave for those two projects were correct without the
additional time for cleaning it up.
  I suggest 2, since I will have it cleaned up tonight, and it will
be ready for K easily enough, but the documenting it all might take
a little longer... to do it right (in a document)... and that shouldn't
hold up a monitor release.

I'll give you time estimates in a little bit... at least for the
house-cleaning... needs a tiny bit of investigation, but I'd suspect
the same amount of time as you gave to the other two projects would
cover all of the time I've actually spend on all 3 projects:
     "adding FULL"
     "making ONCDSK harder..."
     "cleaning up ONCE dialogue"

Bill,
  Looked at the DATE stuff you're asking about...  It's done in the
crash code in COMMON.. by setting the time zone to GMT and then using
the DAYTIME command routines (in COMCON) to type it out... including
the CRLF after the time.

  So... I can copy the DAYTIM code into COMMON [wasteful?] [not really a
good idea--already too much duplication for special purpose]...

  So... I can munge the DAYTIM command code to return without the CRLF and
add the CRLF in the places which already call DAYTIM...

  So... I can provide out users with a NEW FEATURE and type out a few
characters telling them what their current time zone is, eg. GMT, PST
thus giving OPERations what they want & users will know where they are
also, thus no more complaints about time...

(PS the "GMT" or "PST" etc, seems to be the nicest & most elegant way to
 to it, assuming there is some info which says whether to look at the bit
 for DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS so we get PST vs PDT the right times of year.)

Let me know what you want done!

 it really ought to?)

Talked to New York and they said that starting Oct.8 they had trouble
printing out files one 29, 32, 36, and 39.  Files would have messed up
header pages with information that was supposed to be in the middle in
the left corner.  The file would start out all right, then lines would
wrap around instead of printing 132 or 80 characters per line.

There is one file that I could find that had caused this problem.  A 
copy of the file is on my directory on 39; file name spool.prb.

Ron just came in to report the same problems on 23 (banner wrapping
around) and also fortran options "+" and "$" do not work properly.
File (p6p00007)zprint.rpt, spool request 23119 has not been printed,
but is the type of file that will cause the problem.

  On your next pass for SPOOL maintenance... would you please take

From: CARL
Date: OCTOBER 18,1981 0:07
Mi  Re: The current SPOOL problem.

It is apparently believing that too many characters are on a line
and breaking the lines with a CRLF.  This is only happenning on the
REMOTE printers since the center "LPT" code checks <CR>,<LF>, and <FF>
while the remote "?" code only checks <CR> and <FF>.  When the FORTRAN
option is used, both sets of code were chenged to ignore <CR>'s, thus
the remotes were only checking <FF>'s and of course, you can figure that
every 132 characters, an extra CRLF was added.

I can patch it (binary patch) to NOT ignore the fortran option on the
remotes.  Or (when :36) comes back up, I can fix the code to do the right
thing on <LF>'s for remote printers.

After some thought, however, althought making the above change will work,
it is still an incorrect solution.  The better solution would be to invest
a day to change the code which checks for too many characters on a line to
make sure it really started at the beginning of a line.  This...  Strike
that last sentence...
   The <LF> patch above is wrong, only because it was part of a kludge to
keep a lone <FF> on line 1 from spitting out another <FF> unless there
were characters on the line already.  But, the way it checks is to see if
it is on line 1 position 1, which it sometimes is for <ff>text<cr>  ...
If followed by a <LF> all is well, but a <FF> thinks it's at Top of FORM!

-Anyway... which coruse would you like me to take?  Fix the <LF> for remotes,
or FIX both?  The first fix would work in 99% of cases, but not all.

I see that you're back... at least you have logged in...
  II was in til almost 6 this morning, mostly being domestic since most
things were down for one reason or another.  I suppose that Lois filled
you in about our latest SPOOL problem.  I hope to have it corrected
sometime yesterday... but 36 seems to be down all the time, I'm moving
the files to work on them.
  If I find my soldering tool soon, I will be in for awhile.. otherwise,
see you tomorrow.

Lois,
  I'm moving the SPOOL sources to their correct resting ground.
After talking with Mike, I found that the directory name was SSSPOOL, and
not sspool...  and it resides ONLY on system 39.  I've temporarily moved
what was in (SSSPOOL:39) into (JRR:39), so please don't delete anything
from (JRR) on that system.
  Thanks!

How was the show last night?   --Adele


From: CARL
Date: OCTOBER 24,1981 17:46
The show was pretty good.  I saw Lois & her husband & Barbara (their daughter).
The performance was better than some of the rehearsals, but still not perfect.
I think a lot of people had "opening night jitters".  I know that every time
the director popped into the lighting booth, I got a little nervous... and
tended to make a small mistake or two... otherwise, except for a few late
cues, the show was great.

Meg, said that Halloween night has lots of tickets still available, so we
ought to try and plan for a group to go that night...

check your calendar!  Octobre 31 - Next saturday.

what time tonight?


From: CARL
Date: OCTOBER 24,1981 18:21
...besides,
   if next saturday night was tonight, then my sentence would have
been an instance of misuse of the english language ..."halloween."
therefore, to parse the sentence correctly, "next saturday night" is
equated with "halloween", and since tonight is not halloween, it must 
mean next week...

From: SGAVETTE
Date: OCTOBER 26,1981 6:53
Carl,
Thanks for the invite to "Kiss Me Kate".  I think it is highly doubtful
that we well be able to attend on a weekend (Fri, Sat or Sun) night.
We just have too much work to do on the house to get it weathertight,
and an evening out -- no matter how pleasant -- consumes that time.

I have not consulted Kristine however, and I would like some more
information such as when, where, how much are tickets, etc.  Please
don't do any scheduling in an attempt to accomodate us, but if we can
leave it open, perhaps we will come.

  What changes, if any did you make to 1000?


From: TODD
Date: OCTOBER 26,1981 17:56
The "all" command didn't work in 1000 so I fixed it.  That's the only
change I made.  I'm surprised it was broken.  Did you run all the tests
by hand?  I ran tests on several KLs over the weekend and some machines
appear to be faster than others.  With the cache turned off things really
run slow.  In fact, a Kl minus its cache is much slower than a KI.
In answer to your previous mail about the play: maybe (probably yes).
Who else is comming? /Todd

From: CARL
Date: OCTOBER 26,1981 18:09
I knew about the ALL command, there was another way to get it to work, but
I forgot...  I presume you ran your tests stand-alone?  I hope so, otherwise
your figures are off.  Your stats are interesting.

as per the play... not sure yet... possibly dave, tim, barbara,  possibly

In case you hadn't noticed... ONCE has been fixed for the KS monitor.
A set of code inside an IFKMC conditional referenced a label which went
away with the rewrite. Fixed to reference the right label.
The IFKMC is really a "REPEAT 1," and that broke the use of "<>" inside
the macro, because REPEAT is different than IFxxx.  Anyway, fixed.

  ^&$ PG&E ...  sometime since yesterday, my power went off at home.
Of course, I wasn't here, or I was asleep.  The horrible thing was that
it was off for almost exactly 1 hour (I repeat, "one" hour).  Grrr.

So, I never noticed it...  so I was late tonight (am late).  I'm waiting

To monitor types:

Last night the cable was connected to the 930 tape drive upside down.  It
not only does not work that way, but it destroys boards!  Blue cables should
be at the bottom.  It is now full of red arrows to show the correct way to
plug in.

Hopefully both tape drives will be operational by tonight so we will not 
have to be disconnecting and reconnecting between 930 and 934, but, in the
meanwhile please be sure that you attach things correctly.

We are now down to one spare board (according to CE Paul).

To X-Section:
  Those of you who use VUE wil be interested to know that there is
a field-test version residing in (VUE)VUE.SHR on system 930 (ONLY).
This version is 2 pages smaller than the copy on SYS and has two
"welcome" additions:
   1) VUE.INI is read from your LOGGED-IN PPN (your AUN)
   2) If you set your terminal type with .AXTTP (auxcal 100) to a
      "Known"  terminal type, it will not ask you for what type
      of terminal you are on.

"Known" types are anything that you've seen inside the parenthesis

This version is 2 pages smaller than the copy on SYS and has two
"welcome" additions:
   1) VUE.INI is read from your LOGGED-IN PPN (your AUN)
   2) If you set your terminal type with .AXTTP (auxcal 100) to a
      "Known"  terminal type, it will not ask you for what type
      of terminal you are on.

"Known" types are anything that you've seen inside the parenthesis
on the status line... eg.   (HP2621 ... ).

/Carl.

(You can set you RPG.INI file to point at (VUE)VUE instead of sys.
 I will make sure that the version in (VUE) always "works".)

Bernard,
  I believe that you once said that the VT100 support in the VUE editor
was "broken".  At that time, I replied that I knew that it had a few
scrolling problems, but otherwise was working.

  Since that time, I have checked further into the problem.  The VT100
code seems to be badly broken.  I will be fixing it in the next month
or so (I hope), and will let you know when it "should" be working.

Regards,

I'd like to keep it up to date, (or you may do that), but I really don't

Re: 118 crashes  CRA008 CRA009 CRA010

System C118 seems to be having some type of problem... I thought at first
that it was MAGTAPE related, since the first of the above mentioned crashes
occurred immediately after trying to access the tape drive (MTA0) using
SPOOL.  So too did the second...  However, the third crash occurred just
after I logged in, started up LPTSPL, and then typed "SCHED 0".

Could someone take a look at the system / it's crashes, or whatever.
Thanks. -Carl.

SPOOL.SAV resides in (CARL:118) and has the license GD & WF
This version is to be given to Valley Forge and Cupertino-C for
the purpose of testing only.  It is not a transmittal (notyet anyway).
It can probably be put on (FTSYS) or whatever directory is convenient
for OPERATIONS.  It is not to be put on (SYS) or (UPL).

When it is run, the version number types out:

    Experimental SPOOL #123

transmit version 6.2.

Carl,

When you did the last MAGCON transmittal did this include updating either
the .DOC or .INF files?  Valerie of Valley Forge had some customer questions
regarding the label bug.

She was going to read the on-line documentation, and try to get more
information from the customer as to exactly what was their query/problem?
I did look in the ITSR file to give her as much information as I could find.
/Lois


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 17,1981 15:13
I believe that I did not update anything but the program.  IBM standard
labels did not wor, since the format had problems.  I used the IBM manual
as a guide, and had help from an engineer who tested the tapes on their
IBM system (which is how we found out they didn't work!).

The format is the same as the standard with one or two differences.
There was no clarification in the manual about names of files/processes.
Thus, the file-name-identification field looks like Zxxxxxx.Zyyy where
xxxxx and yyy are read by the pdp-10 as xxxxxx.yyy (filename & extension)
and the letter "Z" is prefixed becuase IBM filenames cannot begin with
a digit.
The other difference, was that our system does not return the tape dnsity
(density) as nnn (800.1600.etc), rather as "high" "medium" or "low" and
depending upon whether you have 800/1600 or 1600/6250, you get a different
density.  I "forced" the density to always say the same density, but I
forgot if t says "800" or "1600".

the tape labels ar always written in EBCDIC in IBM/industry compatible mode.
however, the data is in whatever mode is sopecified buy the user, thus

From: CARL

A bunch of things...

1) Spool fire:  IS a "user" problem.  There is "NOTHING" wrong with
   the way my experimental version prints the report given in request
   number "23707".  The same results occur with SPOOL version 5.5 and
   with TYPE using the /FORTRAN switch.  A closer look at the user's
   data file shows that the spacing is wrong in their data, not in the
   way it is being printed.

2) Hours/Timesheets:  This question has come up before... and it does
   involve reporting things under the "correct" category, task, etc.
   Time reported to a project, which is really "following up" to make
   sure that it is installed properly, etc., as well as not revising
   or expanding the scope of a project once it becomes obvious that
   it has changed, can make a project appear to take much longer than
   anticipated (or scheduled).  This, in particular, will screw up the
   "incentive" calculations for the individual as well as their manager.

   I "know" that grouping together much of my time on "SPOOL" and a few
   other projects, which need to have the estimates revised (as well),
   has already been misrepresented.  I would like to get it all straight
   and possibly prevent it in the future.  We can talk about this when
   we discuss my review tomorrow.

3) I will await your reports...

4) Do we have a time scheduled for our meeting?  (or a length?)

5) I'll be at the office for a while, if you need anything.

Jee, its funny how such a simple change makes it look so much more official!
Nice job (of course) -Bill


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 18,1981 7:18
Thanks.
  I also tested it for different zones, although I didn't try any
of the funny ones.  I only used what NONAME would allow (didn't feel
like DDT).  It also says GMT nicely on the CTY (which is what started
this whole thing, anyway).  Daylight savings works ok also, although
I didn't test for "boundary conditions" ... midnight?2-am ... on the
day that it changes from PST to PDT, but a nice day like today, or maybe
last June 6th works right.

Re: REAL WORK?

Do you know that I "wasted" 4 (count em) 4 hours yesterday, because
some $%#**(*$# customer complained that SPOOL was printing his data
incorrectly... and that his data was what was wrong!!!

        ^ ^what is the "/"?
        ^where did fractional seconds come from?
-Bill


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 18,1981 9:09
They came from...   push p,flag
			...
			push p,seconds
			...
			pop p,t1
      			idiv t1,xxx
			pop p,t2
			test t2 == flag
			move t1,t2  << get ? seconds?
			idiv t1,xxx
			print bogus t2 value (negative)
It has been fixed already... but I don't know what state
TODD left IOCSS in, so I'm reluctant to test it on 930
and leave it running.  I noticed it, as soon as I tried "WATCH" xxx
-Carl.

Carl,

All Valley Forge systems have the identical checksums on (sys)spool.sav,
and all have identical checksums on (upl)spool.sav.  Output is in 
(lois)splchk.txt, if you want to see for yourself.

Carl,

Mike wants me to eliminate everything in jrr directories and have validations
eliminate the user name.  All things on 39 are renamed to ssspool (where Mike
wanted them).  930 are renamed to sppoper, with spool.sav being renamed 
spool.jrr (so you can tell).
/Lois


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 18,1981 19:43
I would have preferred to move the files on 930 jrr myself.
I was using that as auxiliary storage to keep things separate from
sppoper.  I hope that I won't get confused.

fine otherwise as per vaidations, etc.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 18,1981 19:52
re: jrr/sppoper

Just a few?
or a whole transmittal?  (that's all I need to know)


From: CARL
Date: NOVEMBER 18,1981 20:10
Have you found any instances with /J55+ which the time shows up
incorrectly?  I checked all the places which COMCON uses them,
but may have missed one.

Re: New additions.

By popular vote, (VUE)VUE which has a few new features has been put on
(SYS) so that people can take advantage of the new features.


There is a new RPG on (SYS) which knows about the "VUE" command.

Both VUE & RPG are backed up on (SSBACKUP). Please let me know if you
experience any problems with either program (new problems that is).

Re: Recent 930 installation of VUE version %1(20)

This version has 4 user-visible changes from version %1

1) VUE.INI is read from your logged-in PPN
2) If your terminal type is set in the monitor, it will not ask you for it.
3) If you receive MAIL while editing, {MAIL} will appear on the status line.
4) The default buffer name is now MAINxx where xx is your job number in HEX.

John,
  Let me know what version of MACRO or DECMAC is the earliest version
that is archived.  You see, I am trying to find the point at which our
version of macro diverged from decmac.  The closer I can come, the easier
it will be to get "ONE" version.
-Carl.

I'd like to see what you have before you restore it.  Possibly around 11am
on Monday, I'll try to be in.  If you call me @ 10, I will be. 961-1082.
Thanks.

In an attempt to go over the changes made to MACRO and DECMAC,
I'd like to investigate what "OLD" release tapes we may have in
the library from DEC.

Could any or all of you help by giving me a list of USERNAMES, real people's
names, or AUN (whatever I need to ask for) to get a list of what tapes are
in the library.

from a few weeks ago....

any way, COEES had a SPOOL problem, so... I straightened it out for them.
well, the printout they gave for a test example was rather interesting.
In my office, on the floor in front of my lateral file are two copies of
their listing.  You ought to take a look at it.

Re: (VUE)VUE

Those of you using (VUE)VUE instead of (SYS)VUE should know of some
improvement made to that version.  Most of the changes have been internal,
but two external differences will be noticed:

1) It more optimally figures character costs for your terminal, rather than
   using the cononical values previously used.  HP2621's in particular now
   do a lot more insert/delete line functions than before.  A little flakey
   on the eyes, but more efficient.

2) The C-K command has been "enhanced".  If you kill a line using a single
   C-K keystroke, all will work as before.  It will take 2 times to delete
   a non-blank line, and once to delete a blank line.

   If you use a count, eg. "C-U 6 C-K", then instead of having to count
   blank lines as 1, and non-blank as 2, <n> (in this example, 6) complete
   lines will be deleted "data and <crlf>".

******* Please note this last difference ... it is documented differently
******* in the manual.

Item (1) was entered in version %1 (26) or later.
Item (2) was entered in version %1A (30) or later.

I'm not too impressed with Szechuan, ... although I think Dave is.
Of course, you "are" picking the place... so I will go wherever you
decide.  Szechuan will be fine. -Carl.

Meeting @ 1:45 should be ok on Monday, also.  :118 is aparently down,
and I suspect it is.... (I just got the message "BUSY, PLEASE STAND BY"
from mail!! hee hee)... only off the air because node 554 is down.  It
appears that the Calstate people didn't bring it up on Saturday... or

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU NAW HAVE THE FIRST ARCHIVED VERSION OF DECMAC.  HOWEVER
I THINK THAT MACRO VERSION 12.1 IS THE FIRST VERSION OF MACRO TO BE ARCHIVED.
YOU HAVE VERSION 12.2 AT PRESENT.  I'D BE GLAD TO GET 12.1 FOR YOU.
MACRO WAS FIRST TRANSMITTED IN 2/72 BUT ARCHIVING DIDN'T START UNTIL '75
SO THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE INITIAL VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT EXCEPT FOR THE
PHYSICAL TRANSMITTALS.

I created a UFD for you, (SAILFOO) [3,100] and renamed all the

To the best of my knowledge...
   The JRR dates may have been LOIS or I (carl) doing a telecopy from
one system to another.  (Aux-Circuits).  If you mean "actual MUD logins"
then NOTME.

They sound about the time we were first cleaning up the JRR directories.
As per SOCCI ... check were they were made from... but I suspect it may
have been more of the same (although definately NOTME.).
-Carl.


From: WRS

Re: SPOOL 6.2

I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing that we can do
about this in reference to SPOOL, since we do NOT wish to make it
supportable.  However,  we do HAVE to support parts of it until it
can be re-written.

THERE is no procedure to follow to test something like SPOOL in all
of it's glory.  There are too many thngs that it interacts with, and
we do not have "any" real control groups.  Also, it appears that
noone knows WHAT it does entirely.

1)  I have spent more than 2 weeks, chasing down "information" about
    spool.  That is not counting the weeks spent getting info from
    Mike, Jean, (and yourselves Lois & Adele).

2)  Now that I have this info, there really isn't anyplace to put it.
    If it goes into the SPOOL documentation binder, it will become
    lost.  Half of what IS in there, should be re-done, just from the
    point of having to maintain it, (ahh but we don't have the time).

3)  TESTING:  What needs to be tested... this should be included
    in the documentation binder...

    A.  User info entered (CPARSE) and stored in the GDF records.
        User info stored file by file in the FDF records.
    B.  Spool counting algorithm(s) to make sure they aren't broken
        whenever something changes.  (CPARSE & CPROMP)
    C.  Printing algorithm(s).  Options & how they affect the way it
        gets printed.  [/FORTRAN]  (CPROMP)
    D.  Remote USER entry of a request.
    E.  Center user entry of a request. (default)
    F.  Center user entry of a request with NODE = nnn.
    G.  Operator printing.  (CENTER/REMOTE/TAPE) (OPER/SPPOPER/GODGAN/USER)
    H.  Integrity of the files used
        1. License / Protection
        2. Internal format consistancy. (GDF/FDF)
        3. FOrmatted properly. (REMCNT/SPLCNT/NODPRI/PRIADR/...)

 4) Does anyone really know WHAT pieces need to be there?
    A.  LPT or TAPE drive?
    B.  SPOOL program.
    C.  Database (GDF/FDF/MAP)
    D.  Accounting (SPLCNT/REMCNT/...)
    E.  Geographic Data (NODPRI/PRIADR)

5) .... Ok...  I guess I've made some kind of a list...
   Maintenance... Lois is generally taking care of that...

6) This should really be a memo file... & I'm sorry to complain.
   I am very frustrated with what happenned today.  But, I want you
   both to hear the results.

SPOOL 6.2 as transmitted WORKS fine.  All of the known fixes to
problems have been installed.

The PRIADR file is BAD.  On :36 ... probably everywhere.
I don't know the format of the file, but... SPOOL expects to read
4 lines of data 60 characters long to print out for the address.
It expects a 5th line which contains the telephone number to
print out for "assistance".

Print location 94. had 3 lines of address and he telephone number
on the 4th.  The fifth line was "blank" and thus did not print.

Re: SPOOL 6.2

First, I'd like to apologise for the frustration shown today in
regards to the current state of affairs with SPOOL.

Second, I'd like you all to know that SPOOL 6.2 is exhonorated of
any wrongdoing in the case of Fremont vs Spool.

The real culprit for today's fiasco was PRIADR.  Contrary to the
checks made, and verification completed on the correctness of the
PRIADR data... PRIADR is formatted incorrectly for printer location
number 94.

SPNODE inadequately prints out the node and location data regardless
of blank or misplaced lines.

SPOOL expects to read 4 lines of 60 characters for the address, and
a fifth line which contains the phone number.  PRIADR shows that for
location 94, the phone number is on line 4.

Carl,

I do not like the new definition of ^U^K!!!  To delete two lines you either
must do ^U2^K or four ^K's--much more awkward than the old ^U^K.  Same
applies for deleting one-three lines.  

Bring back the old way.

Carl,

Fremont's address, and phone number were reentered in 1pnupd and the 
resulting priadr had a different checksum, so perhaps that will fix the
priadr problem.

PJ had updated 22 and 23 so I sent over the newest version to 118 from
23 for you to test to see if the Fremont center default and the node=
option now work.  (Let me know--I am curious).

Re: EMPIRE notes

I don't know if you know about these or not...

1. You can type "G" to put a transport into "FILL" mode while it
   is in a city.  I didn't try to get it out of fill mode, but I
   suspect it is impossible.

2. If there are more fighters inside a city than an aircraft carrier
   can carry (at least due to damage) then the additional fighters
   are "sunk" when the carrier next gets to move.  (??? UNFAIR ???)
   A city doesn't have a limit!!!


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 7,1981 22:28
As per: Carrier with fighters in a city...
  If (n) carriers carrying a sum greater than 8 fighters all dock
simultaneously in one city, all but 8 fighters are SUNK, or actually
all but the number able to be carried by the carrier with the smallest
capacity are sunk.


From: DARREN
Date: DECEMBER 7,1981 22:46
1. Docked transports in FILL mode is basically the same problem as docked
ships in SENTRY mode - they only wake up when an enemy piece happens along-
side.  I will put this on the list, but I'm not particularly worried about
it.
2. True, city-landed fighters should not sink - I don't think the newest
(unreleased) version will allow this, but then again it might.

This is really frustrating....

changes to fix it... it still happenned.  Then, it doesn't seem to
happen now.  Even using the old version.   I think it's dependent
upon the load... which means that the monitor is somewhat at fault...
it expects the program to be smart enough to make sure that all the

However, there is a new "undocumented" command/function accessable

Given the massive size of many of the stream files, you might consider
reworking the PUTLSA code to do so only if you find that the program
name isn't VUE, or it isn't run from (SYS),(FTSYS), or (VUE).  That
would make it alot easier on 1. The stream accounting, and 2. You,
when you went looking, as only nasty people would cause records.
If you're merely interested in who's running it, the RUN records
already suffice.

Hello,
   I am commenting on your newsletter...  "Number 1" recently distributed.

1) Procedure announcements:
   It would probably be a good idea if everyone, (not just managers),
   received announcements about procedures.  Maybe it IS up to the
   managers to request, require or enforce procedures, but if they
   decide to NOT use a procedure, sometimes the employee may be totally
   UNAWARE that there is a procedure for something!  (Even if the
   procedure does not apply, knowledge of its existence is important.)

2) ON-LINE documentation:
   I feel that if there is going to be documentation on a particular
   directory, eg *6NEWS, SYSNEWS, SYSDOC, INTDOC, etc... It should appear
   on "ALL" systems where the software exists.  Not just on the systems
   where the internal or external users are "normally" validated.  Such
   that INTDOC should appear on all systems, not just internal ones.  And
   SYSDOC should be on all systems, including "all" internal ones regardless
   of whether customers are validated on them or not.

3) Congratulations!!!
   It is finally a reality (the newsletter!).

Two comments in regards to your memo to operations:
(1) You should say that Euthan is no longer needed, not that it no longer
works.  You imply this, but some people could get the impression that
Euthan is now broken and they'll want to know when we plan to fix it.
(2) We may still want to change the name of the monitor when we install
a patch.  If we don't, operations won't have a good way of knowing whether
the correct monitor is running.  This will probably be necessary until
we augment systat. /Todd

on paper (prior to discussion) it is as done.  Point (2) changing names
is a hassle which keeps us from automating the patch mechanism, but
we shall see.

  At present, it appears this will all be done tomorrow except for some
polish.  The user memo/transmittal memo is also almost done... lots will

From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 16,1981 15:29
Ken,
  As to RPG.INI, I've avoided doing anything with it.  However, it
is reaching the point that it would be best to add that code.
Scott has voiced that RPG should be the only program which understands
the format of RPG.INI, and I have worked from that.  However, SETTRM
has code for the various formats already.

If my other projects this week don't swamp me, I'll take a look at
some type of implementation.  We would like to see more use of the
SWITCH.INI file and less use of RPG.INI,DIRIT.INI,xxxxxx.INI which
has been the trend.

So... OF COURSE, it is POSSIBLE, but it isn't yet implemented.
If you'd like to work on implementing it, I'd be happy to be of
assistance.  It would be a good thing to look into for future use
of the SCAN/WILD routines.

I didn't mean to harp... just wanted to be a little cautious.
Have you tested it in user mode? (checking mode?)
If so, then it may be safe.  I believe that CONSOLE and MANUAL
from ONCE will both let you bring up the system stand-alone
enough to swap DSKCLN, but there needs to be some kind of
verification test.  Do you know of one?

Tim,

Enclosed find a map (sic) depicting how to get to my house.
My apartment is the "X" on the corner of Acalanes and Coronado.
Address is 182 Acalanes, Apt #47 (2nd door on coronado from acalanes).

Directions from Foothill X-pressway:

  Take GRANT towards EL Camino, past EL Camino (on to 237)
   Turn RIGHT on the EXIT ramp for DANA street.
  Turn LEFT at the stop sign on Moorpark Way. (You never get to DANA).
  Follow Moorpark past the first intersection until it dead-ends.
  Turn RIGHT on Evelyn (at the stop sign).
  Turn RIGHT on Bernardo (at the APOLLO gas station).
  Turn RIGHT on Ayala (the first street).
  Follow Ayala... it turns left and becomes ACALANES.
  Turn LEFT at the first street (Coranado) and park.


Directions fron your house:

  Take Homestead to Mary or Bernardo.
  Turn Right.  Continue until you reach WASHINGTON street.
  Turn LEFT on Washington.

Carl,

I'm having trouble getting VUE to accept a re-specification of the
"Indent Width" Mode Parameter in my VUE.INI file.  It appears to have
trouble terminating the value provided in response to the "new value"
query.  To wit, I state:

    $XSet Mode Parameter$Indentation Width$2

and find that, if it preceeds a set of commands in the file, it
causes VUE to mangle the interpretation of succeeding command(s?).
("It" of course referring to this command line.  If it falls at the
END of the file, VUE awaits the entry of <cr> to terminate the command
andd initiate the session.  Throwing an escape after the "2" does no
good either.

Perhaps you know a cheap and easy way out of this little bind.

--ken


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 20,1981 0:26
...Indentation width$2$  (where $==<esc>) should work.

The problem you were having is that carriage-return (the normal
termination character) as well as line-feed and null
  0 - null - set mark
 12 - lf   - newline...
 15 - cr   - insert crlf
must be specified as ?@  ?J  and ?M inside INIT FILES.

thus, if <escape> doesn't work (and it should!) then try using "?M"
for control-M (carriage return).

-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 20,1981 0:31
Look at (CARL)VUE.INI at both
  "Autosave frequency" and "Right ... Margin".

They us the same code so what works for one ought to work for the others.
(I use <escape> after the numeric argument.)

-Carl.


From: CARL

Just in case we didn't mention it...
  I must chech the command scanner in ONCE once before we release the
monitor.  It seems to drop off the end of the table and crash if we
type in a command longer than 3 characters which does not occur in the
table.   Hopefully this is not a feature of the "structure" or "unit"
name and thus cause other problems...

  Will let you know as soon as possible.

The release document is done!

Re: MACRO %53A(1155) ==> %53B(1155)

There is a version on (FTSYS) called MACRO which appears to compile
most programs equivalently with (SYS)DECMAC and/or (SYS)MACRO.  I ran
a few tests (including its own source) through it without incident.

I have a list of all the DEC SPR's published since version 53A(1152) was
released (except for those which appeared in the DEC distribution books
which we are missing) which I'd like to talk to Scott about whether we
should consider installing.

Otherwise, Please try to compile whatever macro programs you might happen
to be working on, using the new MACRO.  Feel free to cross check it with
(SYS)MACRO as I haven't made any exhaustive checks.

The MAJOR differences are LVAR & SEXTERNAL although there are a few minor
ones which are mostly modernizations.  (Eg. UNV files work, .PSECTs should
work, etc...).
-Carl.


From: CARL

H E A R A L D !!!

Please try to use the new MACRO on (FTSYS).  It is a SMERGE of MACRO and
DECMAC version 53A.  Most TYMCOM-X programs will compile under it.  The
LVAR and SEXTERNAL statements are not LEGAL anymore.  UUO definitions
can now be referenced freely if you SEARCH UUOSYM... there are other nice
features which work too... Try it.

Adele,
  As you may have guessed by my previous messages... MACRO is just
about setup except for a few possible patches.  I've started to tackle
compiling parts of the monitor, but as yet haven't made much progress.
A few modules compile fine.  Most have some intrinsic problems with
a couple of macros's defined in S.MAC.  I'm seeing if I can rebuild
the macros to work differently... If so, then the only fixes needed will
be the SEXTERNALS and a few expressions.

Will tackle figuring what time was spend doing what later today.
If you need me for anything, just call me at home.

     Subject:  New version of MACRO

          I read  your mail  concerning the new  version of  MACRO.  I
          notice that you have made LVAR and SEXTERNAL illegal.  While
          I approve  of that  action in principal,  it means  that you
          will  not be  able to  release this  new version  to  SYS as
          product MACRO.  If you do, you will break an  unknown number
          of programs including TBA (which is still supported), LOADER
          (I  think) and  a number  of unsupported  programs.   If you
          really wish to have a single version of MACRO, you will need
          to include the LVAR and SEXTERNAL syntax.

          Since you can't put this is SYS as MACRO, it probably should
          not be called MACRO in  FTSYS either.  Please see me  if you
          have any questions.

Bill,
  I'd like to propose adding a CPUSYM macro to S and making all the
KSSYM,F3SYM,KISYM,KLSYM files into UNV files...

Define CPUSYM<
IfCPU (KS),<Search KSSYM>
IfCPU (F3),<Search F3SYM>
IfCPU (KI),<Search KISYM>
IfCPU (KL),<Search KLSYM>
>

S, of course would also be a UNV file...  (I've already started making
it into one on my area...  Also, I've found a bug in MACRO %46 with
conditionals..., (vis. IFCPU macro is bad)).
-Carl.

Let me know if you agree to go ahead...

Re: S as .UNV - a good idea but it locks us into the new Macro.  Don't want
to do it until we run with the new Macro for a couple of X-mittals.  We
could use .UNV with our Macro but I think it would confuse things too much
for a short term gain.
Re: conditionals in 46, yes, I remember Ernie spending a couple of days
trying to find a combination of kludges that would work for IFCPU.  There
was a lot of "colorful audio".

The only documentation about .LINK that I am aware of is the monitor

I don't know how it resembles/differs from any DEC MACRO constructs.


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 0:55
Thanks for your help.  It appears that DEC put it in a la Bill Weiher,
but they decided to change the name(s).  At least it appears to work
the same, only .ELINK has been renamed to .LNKEND in the DEC version.
Other than that, I can't find anything else on it.  Will let you know
if I do.

Can either of you (Bill, Darren) tell me if the symbol in the CONFxx.MAC
files, DP1VEC or DP2VEC for the KS-10's is for the DR11 vector or not.
It is under "communication vectors" along with the DZxVEC and KMCVEC
symbols.
-Carl.


From: DARREN
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 2:01
"DP" might refer to the DP-11, an ancient DEC PDP-11 synchronous line
driver.  The DP-11 begat the DQ-11 begat the DUP-11 begat the DMC-11
begat the KMC-11.  If it is for a DP-11, I don't think we have any.
You might check a PDP-11 Peripherals Handbook to see if the other
vectors (DZ and KMC) match those used for the PDP-11. /D


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 2:08
Good Idea.   (PDP-11 Periph. manual)  Anyway, they're defined for all the
KS's.  I'm fishing for a symbol which means there's a DZ or DR11-C in
the hardware so I can remove the S-Externals.  (by using compile-time
constants).

"disolve" rather consistently.  For a reason?  Is it really spelled
that way?

I hope you finished with the police all right.  You certainly are leading
an interesting life!!

Jay Jonekait came by to say that all of tech division is invited to the
first annual spring picnic and New Year's eve eve bash--beginning at noon
tomorrow until 5 or so in conference room 1.  Good food, drinks--for a
donation of $5.  If you plan to attend please let me (or Jay) know.

Lois,
  I can't win!

That call was from Telephone Repair, telling me that their records
show that there is no call forwarding from x7257 to x6519 and that
since my phone isn't broken, they will not fix it.

  Please,
    tell me who I have to see in telecommunications and where their
office is.  I just want my phone to WORK!

   x 7257    1) Call forward - No Answer - to x6519
             2) No call forward on Busy

Since most people seem reluctant to decide what sort of food to bring to
the section party Jan 16 (nobody wants to be first),  general ideas for
providing a guiding light will be entertained following the OSU meeting
on Thurs (approx. 16:30-17:00).

Phyllis,
  Ah well,   you remember those other three bags full of cans?  Well,
I had some unforunate luck this morning and they were stolen from my
apartment.  (No kidding!)  I'll let you know when I accumulate another

Tim,
  Call me immediately!  (If I haven't talked with you.)
  I need to know whatever information you may have gotten
  from Janet, as to the names, addresses, etc of any of
  her friends for relatives.

Re: She & her boyfriend decided to play burgler at my apartment
  this morning whilst I slept.  I have already notified the
  police and have done some small checking, but I don't have any
  more info on her/them.

Do you know what kind of car they have?  I know it sat there for a
week, but I never looked at it.  (DUMB!).

From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 23:34
Bill,
  Lois wants to talk to you about the /K transmittal.
She has to re-do some of the KS-10's and when she runs
MONED1 it says /J65...
  So does MONDOC... even though there's some text
which says <FF>/K  .... /K00 .... etc. in P034.MEM.

I'm sending this, because I'd like to document the changes I've
made to the (M33) sources, as /Kxx and not /J65.
-Carl.


From: WRS
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 23:42
The problem is there are now 2 .MEM files, one for M33 and one for OSP.
MONED1 (and MONED) will use the one in the current (GFD'd) directory.  Nobody
has bothered to make a /K in M33 so it doesn't know about it.  As for OSP,
when you want to make a /X as opposed to a /XNN monitor, you must use an
escape where MONED1 prompts for the monitor version (or type in the correct
name).  I made the change to (M33)P034.MEM so it shows /K now and you can go in and put
in your comments (or move them).  If you edit the .MEM file make sure you
follow the format exactly.  The safest thing to do is delete the lines with
your comments on them and put them back with MONDOC.  If you're not sure, send
me mail after you've done it and I'll take a look at it.  -Bill


From: WRS
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 23:53
Okay, what did you change?  The entry just says "/CARL...".  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 23:54
Nothing... I hit <esc> when it said
"[Updating P034.MEM entry for /J65]
 Enter comments (or ?): "

Then Ran it again... to type in what I wanted to say the firts time.


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 29,1981 23:56
then I ^C'd out and it apepars to have added it anyway...
Oh... I'll edit it by hand now that it's there! (and needs to be
fixed!)

From: CARL

But, There aren't any MAGNUM people on the PARTY list (at present).
Well,
  My changes all compile and load.  For F3,KS,39(token KL) and 35(token KI)
monitors.  You may also use LINK if you so desire.  Do you want me to
proceed and start moving those pointers around so that they're not externals.
-carl.


From: WRS
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 2:58
How about a count of pointers that would have to be moved.  Just a count,
not a list.  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 4:07
Bill,
  Common: 1 (R)      Filuuo: 1 (E)      Frmser: 1 (E)      Mapio: 3 (R,N)
  Filfnd: 2 (N,E)    Filrib: 3 (E)      Comcon: 2 (E)      Picon: 4 (E)
  Core1: 10 (E,N)    Sched1: 4 (E)      Uuocon: 2 (E)      Once:  3 (E)
  Oncdsk: 6 (E)

Total: 42

  (R) caused by expressions like ...,[(LMMCUR+LMPMXW)]
  (N) caused by expressions like ...,<SPTNME>B<SPNNFE>
  (E) caused by pointers with externs
          most commonly used ones   [POINT PTSUNI,...(...),PTNUNI]
                                    [EPTPTR(%UPS.N-1)]

  ? Most of the E erros here are symbols which are probably defined
    in one module and are used elsewhere, and MAYBE ought to be in S.

-Carl.
(PS. I didn't give you a list.. just a detailed count!)
(The list is about 6 pages long.)


From: WRS
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 6:10
Are the{(R) and (N) errors due to externals too?  If not, what is your
proposed solution?  
Also, I hate to see S.MAC grow any more than absolutely necessary, so
where possible find alternate solutions (like defining the pointer in
the same module the field size/position symbols are defined).
-Bill


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 6:20
Re: (R,N) Errors
Not exactly... The errors are really all because the value
 is some type of polish fixup.  A straight EXTERNAL probably
 works, as long as there isn't any arithmetic. (Which these have).

Re: S growth.  For the immediate present, I'd agree.
    However, If (WHEN?) S is a UNIVERSAL, then all symbols which
    are used in various modules, defined as offsets, but not DATA,
    ought to be in S, or xxSYM.

From: WRS
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 6:27
Okay, so what is your proposed solution to the lack of the new MACRO
to emmit reasonable fixups?  Its beginning to look like we ought to
fix MACRO, depending on the amount of work involved, of course.
-Bill


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 30,1981 6:30
Oh... It's not that MACRO doesn't emit reasonable fixups,  the code
appears to check to make sure that syntactically correct use is made
with external references.
  It appears that we've gone a little overboard on what the old
macro scanner caught as errors, and they just happenned to work.
Most of the code appears to be dependent upon PSECTS.  (Possibly to
prevent bad code from cropping up across PSECTs.)

Proposal?  Organize our SYMBOLS and pointers properly.

Most of them are in literals, such that they could just as easily
be made externals to where they are used and define them in ONE
place.  (All the pointers... easily [1/2] errors). That leaves only
5 or 6 exceptions which have to be checked.

Re: DDT
The last transmittal filed (and archived) was for version 27.0 with the
next previous version 24.0.   The current version is 33.1 on (SYS) and
(M33).  None of the versions reference OVTAB.  Thus, it is commented out
in version 33.2  (Which is now on (M33) in source only.)

Well,

The monitor sources on M33 are currently in an 'inconsistent' state.
I get various different results, and at present I believe ONCE may
be causing me problems.  The system never gets to FILMAN, or so the
CTY output confirms.
  I will let you know when it is consistent again.  After I look at
all the FILCOM's and figure out where the TYPEO (?) is at.

I'm sorry.  I don't have any right to yell at you.

Maybe now you can understand why I get so upset, why I'm so lonely,
and why (you think) that I'm so scared.  I'm hurt and when I need
to talk to anyone (even just someone, to feel not alone), there isn't
anyone I can turn to (either no one is available, or they don't have
the time.).

Goodnight!
