o  I am glad you and Cheryl are back, hope you had a good time.

o  Yes, we are still waiting for the Baby. If nothing happens
   between now and Jan 7, Dr says she will induce it, hope
   will have he/she by then. I am not sure but might take the
   next week(Jan 7-11) off, will let you know.

o  Nothing realy important happened while you were gone.
   (1) /N Monitors for Paris machines are cut but not installed.
       Only system running the /N monitor is S59 since middle of Dec.
   (2) Only urgent matter is the P90's Batch problem which you have
       copy of the mail Ken B. sent. I couldn't resolve the problem.
       There isn't any other problem. See you soon.

Sometime this afternoon I called the new answering service in a test
and the lady dutifully took my name, organization, system 99
and phone number (7942403).  You should have been paged.

Were you?

Subject: Payroll problem!

  I just finished looking over my last three paryoll stubbs that I picked
up at the office today.  There seems to be something dreadfully *WRONG*
with the amounts.  They've apparently only paid me for one week, for the
two week period, 17-Dec-84 to 30-Dec-84!  If something strange with MDC
is going on, I'd like to know about it, and if not, I'd like to know what
happened to my other week!

  I'm rather depending on that money to cover my first house payment, and
other new bills.  Just because we're switching payroll on 1-Jan-85 should
not affect our checks?  should it?  MDC better not be withholding a weeks
pay... Tymshare was probably already doing that....

  I will show you what I have when I see you later tomorrow.

     However, today I received copy of the memo which follows on next

     magically disappeared.

Subject: Batch problem on system P90
 
I tried to run the BATCH program to test the problem that was reported and
it seemed to work fine from the user end.  I tried it as myself, username
CARL and as Arlette B, username ABLAM to check the district 0/3 vs. 38 code
and they both worked fine.
 
Operations may see something else, but I'm not sure if that's a 940 problem
or not, if they do indeed see something wrong.  If it is a 940 error, I do
not believe that there is anyone available other than Guy Blood who knows
what to fix.  Please advise.  Does the problem still happen?  If so, can we
do a test, with me "linked" to who-ever is receiving the error when they
try it.  If the problem is gone, then this is superfluous.

Last Tymshare paycheck was for one week, contrary to what the

24dec84-30dec84 and you should receive it Friday January 4th.
Paychecks will come every Friday after that.

Welcome back!  Hope you enjoyed the warm east.  Re, TAU & FAU.SAI:  That's
Bill Mortensen's learning about SAIL.  I had use of a utility to build a/c's
to multiple hosts, knew of nothing prior to Bill's creation/scavanging, so I
used his stuff.  Although relatively high in system overhead, they are damn
handy utilities!

I would like to get the YAMM out with TRULIM documentation by the
end of January.


Bruce Ring is available to wrok toward that end.  I have asked him
to shepherd the "production" process and to cooperate in making edits
that correct technical errors ignoring mere cosmetic changes (typos, etc.).
Bruce states that you told him all technical edits other that the addition
of TRULIM documenation were already in. Is this correct?
Major lack at this time is some cut at a distribution list so we can
send new copies of the manual to receptive readers.

Please call me about this effort.

We are down to a little over 2500 disk pages. The big culprits are:
	SOURCE	44,000 pages
	UN1	12,000
	MYSYS	14000
	ISIS2	8000
	CCDA	7500

Does anyone have any idea what "MYSYS" is?? If not, why don't we back
it up and delete it.  Also, can we back up some of the things in
SOURCE? It probably would also not be a bad idea to go through our
directories and clean them up.

Yes, although I don't remember anything much at all, the program
(WRS:930)CRARPT.SAI uses associations, to do alot the same thing
you are talking about.  I believe it works, but I'm not sure.  I

Subject: SPOOL Nodes Map


I've received a request from George Beidler, of Tymnet, for a call from
the person(s) responsible from maintaining the SPOOL file listing printer
locations.  George has been notified that some new printers have been
installed in France (I believe).  SPOOL cannot currently send to these
printers.

Rumor has it that you're the ONLY person who knows anything about this
map file for SPOOL.  Please call George to get the information for the
updating, or please let me know where and how to do the updating, and I'll
call him, get the details and do the update.

I know this is not monitor N stuff, but this is what you have to put up
with when you're the only one who knows.


Thanks!
