ATTENTION ALL SYSTEM 36 USERS!!!!!

 RESOURCE CONTROL IS REVIEWING ALL INTERNAL NAMES ON SYSTEM 36. SINCE
TYMSHARE NO LONGER SUPPORTS A CUSTOMER ON THIS HOST, ALL USERNAMES
NOT NEEDED FOR THE DAY TO DAY OPERATION OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE REMOVED
ON APRIL 1, 1985.

 IF YOU HAVE FILES OR TAPES ON SYSTEM 36 YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM TRANSFERED
TO ANOTHER PDP10 HOST YOU ARE VALID ON. IF SYSTEM 36 IS THE ONLY HOST
YOUR USERNAME IS VALID ON YOU CAN SEND AN ONTYME TO 'CPC.SRAMAIL' TO
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ALTERNATE RESOURCES.

     SUBJ:  VALLEY FORGE CENTER SHUTDOWN

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


     THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHEN THE VALLEY FORGE DATA
 CENTER WILL BE CLOSING.  INITIALLY IT WAS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE DURING THE
 THIRD QUARTER.  WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT CLOSED BY THE SECOND QUARTER.
 THUS, SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES ARE BEGINNING APRIL 19, 1985.  THE TENTATIVE
 PLAN IS TO MOVE THE 370 SYSTEMS TO THE DALLAS CENTER AND DIVIDE THE
 PDP-10'S BETWEEN FREMONT AND CUPERTINO CENTERS.

     ALL BUSINESS UNITS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE VALLEY FORGE SHUTDOWN.
 SOME SPECIAL CONTRACTS OR PROCESSING AGREEMENTS FOR CLIENTS MAY EXIST
 THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF.  IF YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIAL AGREEMENTS
 FOR CUSTOMERS PLEASE LET YOUR BUSINESS UNIT OR RPM KNOW.  GIVEN THE START
 DATE OF APRIL 19, 1985 WE WOULD APPRECIATE NOTIFICATION BY NEXT WEEK,
 MARCH 25, 1985.

     WE REALIZE THIS IS NOT ALLOWING MUCH TIME TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A
 COLOSSAL TASK BUT THE BENEFITS WILL BE A GREAT COST SAVINGS FOR ISG.

     I CAN BE REACHED AT (408)446-6870 OR VIA ONTYME AT CPC.L/MORRIS.

I have no idea about MAGRIM.  For packaging purposes, however, assume that
all three are KI-10 & KL-10 only products.  No for the F3 and No for 2020s.
It's possible they work... but no one has had time to test it, or need to
use them while I've been at Tymshare.

I've talked with Hank Spencer, in St.  Louis, and have developed some

system 169, to provide the ability to see (and, if necessary) to work on
any software on the system.  Hank tells me you have a couple of

169, for the purpose of checking what is there and what we need to
upgrade (for the packaging efort)?

Bill,
  Yes... I've known about 897's problem with the lud. I've spent some
time looking at it, but haven't completely diagnosed the problem.  The
LUD entries themselves seem ok, 'cept for a couple of non-matching
DUL entries... I'm sure that there's a block pointer that's messing
up the works...
  Since looking up a USERNAME that exists isn't a problem, I haven't
made fixing it a high-priority item.  I will get to it sooner or later.

Bill,
  If I can't straighten out the block pointers, then fine, we can copy
39's lud & dul.  (Actually that's where the problem started... then
validations started deleting usernames... and their software doesn't seem
to "always" clean up after itself, so it left bad block & bad entry pointers
around.)   At this point I wouldn't be too sure that 39's lud is perfect
either...  I'll send you all mail after I check out the pointers.

Not that I'm worried, but it's interesting to find a directory that has
more files in it than in (SYS)... do you know if anyone polices the files
put into directory (UTIL) on the customer systems?

System 26 has over 20K pages, mostly due to some data bases that someone
appears to be keeping in directory UTIL.  I suspect that they don't really
belong there... but...  do a DIR/STORAGE on (UTIL:26) and see what I mean.

Also, [SYSMON.FT0,.FT1,.FT2,.FT3] in same directory, since you have such
influence with operations... could I give you a lesson on how to use PCOM
and then you can show operations how, so that they can (or we can) re-write
these above-mentioned files to use PCOM instead of COM.  These files seem
to be used to build MONITOR BOOT TAPES, and if they rely on the COM program
then the results could be disasterous...  granted, they test the tapes before
they rely on them, but... I'd rather be safe & do things right.

Subject: 930 outage

System 930 has been down since ??? this past weekend due to a disk
hang and an apparent subsequent ??? data-error on the rib for [1,4]
and a data-page in [1,1].UFD.

  I spent 12 hours hacking on the disk with TSTSUP & LKBDDT and anything
else I could find, (we had no idea at first of the extent of the damage
and could not find much of anything without a TITO tape, PPN's for some
of our stuff [no lud], the fact that some stuff was in (SOCCI) and it
seems someone has erased SOCCI from the net, I hope no files were lost,
and possibly even from 930 [I'll kill if that happens]), use or misuse.
It's a good thing that LKBDDT & TSTSUP have DDT imbedded in them, or
we'd have been paralysed without any tools.  This makes me more intent
on setting up a "backup" copy of certain system utilities.  Our biggest
hassle was that we only had 2K free pages & couldn't get DSKCLN to do
any space cleanup until the disk was repaired....sigh!

  I've been here since yesterday noon, so excuse me if I ramble... We
should be completely back on the air by 11 or 12 [noon] today after the
co-op finishes restoring the incrementals with [restore newest].  Feel
free to delete anythng you deleted since 30-Mar-85 since it has now
come back to haunt you again.

Backup copies don't help much - don't forget you can do RUN FTA1:FOO 50

  Carl,
  Did Craig give you that software change request from Dan Wedge

Jon,
  I don't recall receiving any requests from Craig.  Dennis mentioned
something to me about Fortran-10 & Link (I think), but I'm pretty sure
that this is the first I heard about F40 & Link.  My understanding is
that the 3rd phase of the F40 compilation is completed by special codes
in LOADER, and I do not know if LINK-10 handles that properly.  That is
the main reason why LINK-10 has not ever been considered as an official
replacement for LOADER.
  This entire issue needs further examination, and I will need some
clarification of what Dan Wedge is requesting and what he really needs.

setup in (M33) to build monitors?  You say, "PCOM MONED1 xx" where xx
is the system number.  That way you can't make mistakes ---- ok?  I
use it all the time.

I just copied DRWSPR.EPO from 34 to 58, & setup 58 in 34's PJ data file.
so that is done, hopefully everything else will work fine.

Subject: MORE PACKAGES

Carl-
     I have series of questions which are related to the disk/tape
package.  First is the current distribution of programs:

PRGM NAME	VERSION 	PDP-10	   2020
HACKUP.SHR	1.52		13/27	   NONE
HACKUP.LOW	1.52		16/27	   NONE

   As you see, the distribution is pretty uneven, with 13 systems having
the 2 parts they need to run the program.  (It differs from BACKUP by a
single instruction in each segment.)

BACKUP.LOW &
      .SHR	1.52		ALL	   NONE

     I'm not sure how BACKUP is used...maybe just to read DEC releases?
What is BACKUP.SAV?	Is Backup strictly a DEC product, or do we maintain
it.?  (Version .52 was changed specifically "to correct TYMSHARE date stuff,
provide for output at TYMSHARE: <UFD read with <UUO...etc.)

TITO.SAV       .163		ALL	   NONE
TITO.SAV       ?????		NONE	   ALL

     The TITO.SAV on the 2020's doesn't look like a version of TITO.
(It looks like some type of program in SAIL.)

     Your comments are welcomed, especially as far as (re)distribution
of programs on the 10's and 20's.  Thanks...Michael (sppoper:930)

     Last notes:  I was unable to produce a file access.sav using
access.f4(carl:930) which matches (upl)access.sav, cksum = YEYBEV.
access.f4 contains all the literals of (upl)access.sav...
     Lastly, can you comment on why FTALOD.REL is on the systems
as a .rel file?	Thanks again.

Subject: recent NEW monitors

/N08	- added stopcd at CIP7+3 to crash if JBTUMP(J) is effectively 0.
	- moved input ring & other buffers out of page 0, setup UPT-like
	  trap vectors in page zero to aid in trapping bad UPT faults.

The patch file ITMINT.PAT is no longer necessary.  At least we know that
monitors after /N08 do not need to be patched.  The error is caught at
CLOCK1:CIP7+3 if we get there with a job with no context pages assigned.
We have recorded a crash on C39 at CIP7+3 since /N08 was installed.

/N09	- deleted MAPONC(DUM,1) macro which kept a dummy per-process
	  page around because of a suspected bug, possibly fixed in
	  release /L31.

/N10	- added check in FRMASN to make sure job to be assigned is in
	  the NUL queue, and if not to log it BADQUE,BADQUE+1
	- removed unneeded use of a register to access a pointer.

This change should fix the assumed problem caused by a frame being
killed scheduled to go into the NUL queue but not yet there, getting
placed back in the RUN queue because SCNSER tried to assign another
tty to this frame number in the same clock tick.  All free frames
must now come from the NUL queue.

Bill,
  Systems C36, C897 are currently running /N10.	Systems C39, C57 will
be coming up on /N10 at the next scheduled reload.	57 is a KI and we
will get a chance to see if the ILLINS+2 crashes there are caught by
the same stopcd (if any at all*).

* /N10:  It seems that after our discussion, the last item we talked
about for checking if the job is in the NULQ started me thinking.  At
first I was going to check if the current PJBSTS field was the NULQ.
Well, that's not true in the case where PJBSTS == NULQ but JRQ is on!!!
So, we looked further... DECHJB which checks if a job going away and if
it needs to DECrement the HighJB variable checks JNA+CMWB+JRQ.  It seems
that FRMASN only checked JNA+CMWB.  SO... in addition to checking to see
if the frame is in the NULQ (JBTSTS==0; never used yet | PJBSTS==NULQ),
when I check JNA+CMWB I'm also checking JRQ.

  This is interesting in as much as if the job was in queue X and was
supposed to be put into the NULQ the next scheduler call (JRQ is set)
then someone comes along sees JNA off, doesn't check JRQ, re-assigns the
frame number, re-queues it for another queue, then it never goes into
the NULQ !!!  And I suspect something else thinks it can go directly in
the run queue and >BANG< we have our problem...

  It seems reasonable that this could happen, although following the code
it wasn't clear that this COULD happen at all.  Anyway, IF JRQ is set,
I think we shouldn't care what queue it's in or going into... since the
scheduler is expecting to have to do something to it, we shouldn't try
to assign it.. so we should skip it.  This being the case... we should
have solved the problem with this coding change.

  Cross your fingers... 'cause if it's fixed, we can then get on to some
other projects, like STOPCDs on the CTY, EXE files, etc...

Ranier Bank has a username on sys 32.  Not knowing that SYSMAINT was
ours, Shirley Steele gave us a username that would be good on both
1051 and 32, and approximated the requested username with SYSMAINT.2.
This was a fiat accompli before I knew what she was doing.	What I
forwarded to you was the notice she gave me of what she had completed.
I agreed to it in order to not disturb the customer further.

I agree that SYSMAINT on 1051 would be better than SYSMAINT.2.  Go for it!

Bill,
  It wasn't that I wanted anything special for ONTYME users of TUMS.
It was more like, someone setup in the (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT file found some
"new" ONTYME commands and setup things like command mode and alternate
prompts.  When the TUMS-ONTYME pulling program ran, it got confused and
it seemed like no one else in the file-list got any ONTYME mail until I
looked at the MAIL.LOG, noticed the problem and checked each user-ID on
ONTYME until I found the problem.
  I think the "pulling" program should break the circuit & continue with
the rest of the list whenever it gets really sick or confused...

Normally ONTMTP will just build another circuit, but if it doesn't understand
what the problem was, it can't really continue without fear of looping.	It
could all be made a little more intelligent, but I think you know...  Right
not it thinks the only thing that could cause a timeout is an Ontyme or
program problem so it decides to try again next hour.  I'll keep it in mind.

Subject: ONTYME MAIL

Bill,
  It has come to my attention that some people like to play around with
the prompt character and with the mode (text,command,etc) on ONTYME and
those with INIT files which muck with those things cause havoc for the
ONTYME slave which TUMS uses.
  I realize it's a lot to ask, but is there any way that TUMS can notice
that something has changed... i.e. like it is getting prompts, so it knows
not to type a prompt, like it's prompt is changed, so it knows to change
it (I realize that's harder unless someone tells it, by maybe typing a
command like "ONTP <ch>" or some such...)...

At present, I'm not sure but it would be nice to know if it continues to
scan through the ONTYME.DAT file after reaching one of these error
conditions or does it simply re-try from where it left off, or start over?
It logs the message, otxxxxx failure, but it isn't clear what happens to
the ONTYME slave.

I'd have to look at the code to see what happens on a timeout.  It can
handle being in "command mode" and getting prompts okay.  In fact it
turns that mode on itself.  It can't handle different prompts.	It is
too unreliable to rely on timing from Ontyme, so I realy have to know the
prompt.  I ask - if you use TUMS, why is it you care what your prompt
character is?  I answer - change it back to ":" or wait for Ontyme to
support host-host protocol.  -Bill

SUBJECT:       NETWORK SECURITY POLICY

--------------------------------------------------------------


The security and integrity of our corporate information and
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.

We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:	 Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This	 committee   developed  this	policy  for
my endorsement.  I strongly support it and the need for
attention and vigilance in insuring that it is implemented.
We  will be following this policy with appropriate procedure
and auditing activities.  In particular the Personnel Security
Agreement for employees will be forthcoming in the near
future.  There is much you can do at department level to insure
compliance with the policy.

Remember, safeguarding corporate assets is part of everyone's
job.

Questions about this policy should be directed to Wayne Bartlett,
Director, Data Security, at Orchard Parkway, San Jose.
Telephone: (408)942-5019









TYMNET				    POLICY & PROCEDURES DOCUMENT

			NETWORK SECURITY

	       GENERAL POLICY ON NETWORK SECURITY


  I.  PURPOSE:	The purpose of this policy is to provide safe-
      guards for the security and integrity of corporate informa-
      tion and customer information in our custody.  This policy
      is to be implemented by management and employees through
      appropriate administrative procedures and safeguards.

      For clarity, this policy will be separated into the
      following categories:

		    A.	NETWORK SECURITY
		    B.	CUSTODIAL ISSUES FOR CUSTOMER DATA
		    C.	PERSONNEL POLICY

 II.  POLICIES REFERENCED:  None

III.  SCOPE:  This policy applies to our information and
      data and our customers'data that is stored and trans-
      mitted by TYMNET.

 IV.  A.  NETWORK SECURITY:

      Data security and network integrity are vital to our
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.

      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.

      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:

	  1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES

	  2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
	       COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS

	  3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
	       CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
	       CHARACTER





	  4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
	       OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
	       ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
	       OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
	       EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

	  5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
	       TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION

      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.

      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.

      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:

      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.

      Customers are required to use network security features
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.

      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:

	       1.  They are using the available features and
		   controls
	       2.  They are committed to prosecute violators

      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.



      C.  PERSONNEL

      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.	The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the
      procedures required to safeguard information.

      Computer access and privileges for each employee will be
      limited to those necessary for his/her job function.

      Maintaining the security of corporate assets is a part of
      everyone's responsibility, and execution of that
      responsibility will be considered part of everyone's job
      performance.

The comment at DCOM: in COMCON says that D requires WC license.  This is
wrong.  WC is needed to POKE the Monitor, not to write in private core.

Whoever decided to set JERR on E and D did not know the right way to do it.
E and D should be CONTINUable, but "?ILLEGAL WHEN RUN-ONLY".

Subject: N10 monitor did not work on F3 or KS.

Osman built 2 monitors for system 24 and a monitor for 930, and all three
died during ONCE.  I tried putting MAPONC(DUM,1) back in, built F3XN11, and
it worked.  (Of course, changing S.MAC causes all REL files to be
recompiled).  Just to prove that this was the problem, I took MAPONC(DUM,1)
back out, and tried to build F3XN99.	I had to do it twice, because the first
time I used my default MACRO and it would not load.  F3XN99 is running as I
write this.

It looks like some of the REL files in M33 were assembled with the wrong
version of MACRO.  Simply changing S and reassembling ALL modules with the
right MACRO cleared it up.  I plan to look at MACRO more closely.  Until it
is fixed, ALWAYS remember to do ".CTEST SETPROC" before running MONED1.

Subject: Monitor Sources

Ok now,
  I've re-built an F3 monitor in M33, F3XN10 which is identical to the
monitor in SYSTEM.SAV in SYS.  This was accomplished by "editing" the
CNFNF3.MAC file after MONED1 was finished, and changing the serial number
back to 1305 and the date to 4-14-85.  UUOCON had to have the .N09 source
as .MAC and everything else matched fine.

  All is as was when I built the last set of monitors for the new systems.
I also built a monitor for 57, 58 and 24.  Osman, you can try 57's monitor
on the KI in building A, and I think 58 is now setup for only a single
disk controller (BPA) with up to 16 drives, and I re-assembled 24 with the
NOW current sources.

  *** Please do NOT (-D-O---N-O-T-) monkey around with the sources in ***
      ***  an effort to get system 24 up and running under /N10.  ***

If it still will not come up, please HALT the 2020, and examine the PC
address and see if we can figure out what it's dying on.  Maybe even use
930's copy of 24XN10 in DDT and check out the code...

ONCE can be funny... if it's "pre-BLT" then ONCSTT: is at ONCSTT-%ONC,
otherwise it's in the right place.  So, if it won't come up.. let me
know.  Also test 58[KL] and 57[KI] and get back to me with the results.

  I will be in today, but only for a little while... mostly to get my check.
Since I've spent all night rebuilding monitors.... sigh!

/Carl

PS: Joe, after we're sure the KS works we can think about your addition
    to the gettab tables.  "Think"... It's a great addition, but somehow
    I'd be happier if all of the locations in CNFTBL were put in, not just
    some of the ones we want for specific programs...  CPU/MONITOR-type
    can be determined pretty quickly using other means... sigh.

Subject: F3XNXX Synch with uNode

Well guys, it worked all along... having the system go through the
synch code at clock level lets INITIA get started and DSKCLN and all
that other stuff.  I still haven't added code to "guess" when the
base goes away, but that's the next step.

  What was wrong, and why it didn't come up was in editing SCNSER.MAC
one of the instructions XCT TYPTRN(P1) got clobbered to XCT TYPTRN(P)
i.e. the "1" got erased, and so SCNSER would loop forever as soon as
it finished synchronizing with the micro-base, executing some weird
instruction off in never-never land, always the same, and thus never
incrementing P1 or P4 to look at the next IRING location...

  Anyway, at the moment we're running that code... I'll probably put
some kind of timer or clock that sets a flag whenever so many ticks
have passed and the base hasn't changed the ORP620 pointer after the
host has completely filled it... i.e. output ring processing time-out.
This needs a little thought and a little research before the final
implementation.  Also, I'll need to test the new SCNSER on a KI/KL/KS.

Do you know if anything uses this obsolete module???

If it is as obsolete as I think it is, then I aim to

It relies on a varian base configuration that no longer is supported
by NTD (or exists).  Since Varians will not exist much more at all,
I think it is safe to donate it to the Smithsonian.  I think CHKPNT
uses a UUO that is documented as controlling the "remote", but I think
thats in UUOCON and not RMTSER.  Obviously if its /NOLOAD, it can't be
being used.  -Bill

Subject: UNDELE.MAC

Good luck finding it....

  PLEASE ASK (when you're not sure of something)!!!!!

UNDELETE was originally written by Todd Corenson, and later modified
by Greg Matoka.  It is written in SAIL and is completely in-compatible
with DIRIT as far as file specification scanning, etc.

If you are looking for a MACRO-10 source, i.e. UNDELE.MAC, you no doubt
will never find one that does what you're looking for.  I'm not sure
where the current sources are, but if they can't be found quickly on
system 930, [I'll check if you ask me to look], then the best thing to
do is to get them from archive.

I killed your TALS job, 'cause it was a waste of cpu time & tymnet
circuit traffic.  PS: Anyone with systat license can look at your job
and see what file it is reading, so putting your OPER password or
any OPER password into a file is a "no no".

PPS.  It is possible that you will not find UNDELE.SAI either, it was
originally called UNDEL.SAI and the command was UNDEL until too many
people complained to Todd that "UNDELETE file-spec" didn't work!!!!!!

Subject: (CARL)LOGON does not like 159:04:21

Osman asked me "How long has system 55 been up?"  Suspecting a trick question,
I checked it with both LOGON and SYSTAT.  Sure enough, LOGON=36:50:15 and
SYSTAT=195:54:36, a difference of 159:04:21.  This number, when expressed as
ticks, multiplied by 1000 and then divided by 60 to get milliseconds is equal
to 2^35=Integer Overflow.  FOROTS has the same problem.  You need to divide
by 60 first, look at the magnitude of the uptime, and don't bother with
milliseconds if it's more than 1 hour.

I have re-checked the ability to use SYSMAINT with OPER on these two hosts.
Username SYSMAINT, with password CEGI SYS is stil not valid on either
host 60 or host 1051.  I have spoken with Julie Mork, re. host 1051:
the host crashed and was restored from backups.  the backups apparently
were made before the OPER data-base file was updated with SYSMAINT.
Julie has NO objection to our re-establishing SYSMAINT in OPER's

see no need to do so.

Please re-enter SYSMAINT in the OPER data-base for these two hosts.

Subject: INITIA/LOGINN meeting

Bill,
  I've been looking through code. INITIA has been rewritten to startup
as one job, and startup the others using the .FOCFM and .FORUN FRMOPs.
It's unclear how DSKCLN is started and everything seems to wait for it
to finish at the moment, any comments?

INITIA used to setup the UFDs for OPER then LOGIN, and for the CHKPNT
job, it made sure that the UN1 UFD was there.  If starting CHKPNT with
it GFD'd to UN1 will force LOGIN to create both UFDs then the STR code
can be removed from INITIA, otherwise it needs to remain.

I'm going to proceed with my view of the world till next week, but I'd
like to get together with you for lunch or something, say next wednesday
and go over some of this.	If next week is bad, then I'd prefer sometime
this week.  (Of course that means just tomorrow and Friday...sigh).

Subject: System 59, Accounting data fixup

Peter,

  Verison %30(4) of CHKPNT should never have been distributed to any
system, let alone any of your 2020s.  It is in an interim state and
someone probably copied it from system 930 accidently.

  In any case, I have a program which condenses the huge files created
by version %30(4) to their proper size.  I took the liberty of running
my program on system 59 prior to sending this message, so that you could
run your accounting for MAY without any further holdup.

  I also concatenated the "good" .DAT and .SAT files with the condensed
files and replaced your .DAT and .SAT files with the rebuilt files.  The
files concerned were:

    (SYS)052885.DAT condensed		     replaced (SYS)052885.DAT
    (SYS)052985.BAD condensed (SYS)052985.DAT replaced (SYS)052985.DAT
    (UN1)052885.BAD condensed		     replaced (UN1)052885.SAT
    (UN1)052985.BAD condensed (UN1)052985.SAT replaced (UN1)052985.SAT

  With these "rebuilt" files, you should NOT lose ANY accounting
information for the 28 May or the 29 May.  The .BAD files contained
all the accounting information as usual.	CHKPNT %30(4) mistakenly
wrote 256 empty block between each good data block.

  Sorry for the mixup.  We will continue to investigate how the wrong
CHKPNT was installed.

					Sincerely...  /Carl

       ILLINS+2 ???  since INSSIM+2 is really only valid on an F3?  I've
       tried to keep it ILLINS+2...

Anyway, I guess we can bring the results to the tuesday meeting.  In case
anyone has noticed, 6 ILLINS+2 crashes last month, NONE are the zero-UPT
type crashes as best I can tell from the PC contents.	Can we determine
from looking at what is coded in MUR whether there were considered software?
or hardware?

Subject: TRW's host 33 on TRWNET.

	They have a public network username, TRWNET.  It had been on
host 32.  It was moved to host 54, about one month ago.  They use the
network host for storing backup copies of files from their host 33.
Last week, when trying to TELECOPY a file from their host 33 to username
TRWNET on public network host 54, they received an unprecidented error
message that concerned them:  "MUST COPY FROM OR TO SYSTEM 123".

	TELECOPY on both public network hosts appears the same (same
checksum).  Do you know of some file or process which might have existed
on host 32 or somewhere esle in the public network which translated
reference to their host 33 to our host 123?	It appears that this had
previously been done, somehow.

	An alternative would be to convince them that Tymnet host 123
is, in fact, their TRWNET host 33 or the access to it.	They are
difficult to mollify, I understand from the A.C., so restoration of the
original automatic translation might be the preferable solution to their
problem.  Your recommendations would be welcome.

Thanks!

Subject: TRWNET

I doubt very much if there is a problem with TELECOPY.  I'd more than
expect that something else is wrong (unless their copy went bad?).
Host 123 must be something on their network, since 123 is (was) a
supervisor on our net...

The procedure they should use is to use the GATEWAY command to get to
our network and then to one of our hosts.  The host number used in the
GATEWAY command is the host that they should be using to send/receive
data files, and 33 is the host they are sending/receiving from on their
network.

If this continues to be a problem, then I suggest that you get a username
and a password from the TRW A.C. so that we may login to their system and
try to copy stuff.  Please find out what monitor TRW is running, so we
can determine whether we need OPER privilages or not.  If they are at-least
running /J we are OK. (I think).  Anyway, as part of your packaging, are
we going to be sending TRW updates?
  I'd like them to have a /N10 monitor, or at least a /N with the right
fixes patched.  This requires a new LOGOUT as of /K.... etc.

Subject: GATEWAY command

	This GATEWAY command you mentioned in your message:  is it a
valid TELECOPY command, or do you mean that TRW must go through a
gateway?  I'm told by the TYMNET AC that TRW does it this way:  they run
Telecopy, then use "TALK" to connect to their gateway and to log in to
their username on system 54, then type "%%F" to go back to the standard
Telecopy colon prompt.  They then give the standard Telecopy command
line:

"(<username>:<source sysno>)<fileid>,(<username>:<destination sysno>)<fileid>"

It is at this point that they get the message about copying to or from
host 123.

	Their gateways, from their network to Tymnet, are their hosts 82
and 83.  The (or at least one) gateway from Tymnet to TRWNET is host
633.  Thanks for reminding me that 123 is (was) a Tymnet supewrvisor.  I
don't know how it enters into this mess.

2 201 cards, [Ed Roop thinks each card handles 32 lines], which means it
has 64 ports.  He is going to check tomorrow to see if they can upgrade
it to handle more ports, then will get back to us to cut a monitor for
it with the proper number of ports.

  It is node # 155.  The base for system 34 actually has more ports than
64, but we've only cut 34 for that many.  We will have to do some little
experimentation to find out what RPORTN to cut for a few of these hosts,
but for now.... we wait.

Subject: 930's copy of (MAIL)39.SAV

(MAIL:930)39.SAV somehow got sick.  Its checksum was bad, but its
creation date and error bits were okay.  I installed a new copy and
all is okay now.  Your mail to 39 has been dalayed as a result.  The
bad copy would "ADDRESS CHECK..." when it was run.  -Bill

Subject: New directory (NOBACKUP)

As a space-saving-reserving measure, I've created directory (NOBACKUP)
which will hold files which don't need to be backed up, most of which
are being kept around to reserve disk space for when we need to do a
full monitor transmittal (I see one coming soon!)...

Please, under pain of listening to a long tirade of verbal abuse, do NOT
delete any of these files.

I've put last year's accounting files, the transmitted /N *.SAV files,
last year's chkpnt data files, the (OSP)*.SAV files for updated/rebuilt
/N monitors that we have distributed to new and reconfigured systems.

Don't put anything  there without telling me what it is, and don't
delete any of it.  These files will NOT appear on the all-files tapes
and WILL make the bi-weekly backup go faster.

Craig,
  It seems that my beeper did go off... It so happens that I also set it
down while working around the house earlier, and left it where it couldn't
be heard from the bedroom.  {sigh}  So, at least we know that our system

CARL,
     I cannot find the source of BOOTS.SAV.	It exists in 2 versions...
ver. 1 is on all the 10s and 930.  V. 17 is on 897.	How do you want
them distributed?

     Does BOOTS.DMP have a source(s)?	I'm not sure of its origins.

     Lastly, should UNDELE be changed in its source code to reflect a
change in its version, that is, from v.  1 to v.  2?  That would include
loading the new binary version on the systems.  (Both old and new
versions say version 1 now).  If the answer is yes, do you want a new
logfile etc.  in the archives, or just the updated source and binary?

Subject: Accessing programs in packages

We have determined that each program included in a package can--and
will--be accessable in the TRABAS data base.  When the information about
each package is inserted into the TRABAS data base, all information
about each componenet program will also be inserted into the data base.

The information about each program will be:  (1.)	system number (the
host on which the package FDM file is being assembled); (2.) software
name (the original name of the program, as named in previous
transmittals); (3.) version number (the ver. number of the current
version of the program); (4.) date (the date of the entry of the package
and programs into the TRABAS data base); (5.) programmer name (the name
of the programmer who wrote the current version of the program; and (6.)
FDM name (the file name of the FDM file containing the package).

Doing a LOOKUP in (QASYS:38)TRABAS will provide the FDM file-id, which
can be used with a LOOKUP in (QASYS:38)ARCHIV to have the needed file
restored from Archives.  the Package FDM file will contain a
documentation file which will list a description of the contents of the
FDM file, plus an FDM file for each program contained in the package.
To extract a particular file from the archived package FDM, you must
open the package FDM file, WRITE to disk the contained program FDM file,
then open the program's FDM file and write the individual file(s) to
disk.

		     SOFTWARE PACKAGES OVERVIEW

     The following represents a listing of packages and the programs
that are included in the packages.	This listing represents the initial
phase of the updates, which tries to include all the monitor utility
programs.  Later phases will update other groups of programs, such as
the language compilers.  This initial phase includes about one-third of
the programs which will be checked and updated.  We plan to finish in 2
or 3 more months with this first phase.  As we finish a particular
package, we will contact you to inform you of our intentions and the
effects of the upgrade, and to allow you to inform us of any objections
by Mallinkrodt to the upgrades, before we contact the Software
Transmittal Group to install a particular package on their system.  (I
realize this may mean a steady trickle of changes, but the alternative
might be a flood.  I believe and hope that the improvements in security,
efficiency, and supportability make this a worthwhile effort.)

     Disclaimer:  This list is not exhaustive, and there will probably
be many changes as we work our way through the list.  But we will
let you know of any changes.

     If there are any questions or information we can supply, please
call us or send an OnTyme.  Thanks for your help....Michael Chinn

						       TYMCOM-X SUPPORT

DATE:	June 6, 1985

  TO:	Hank Spencer

FROM:	Michael Chinn

SUBJ:	Packages

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	In order to provide better support of the operating system,
languages and utilities for systems running Tymcom-X, we are currently
organizing our software into groups of related programs called "packages".
These packages are designed to integrate the most current versions of
each of their component programs, so that the installation of the package
will insure each host is kept up to date with new software releases.

	On 14-June-85 the current release of the FILOPS package
(version 001) will be distributed to all Tymcom-X systems.  This package
includes the following programs:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Name: DIRIT
Current Version:  33
New Version:  33.1

Comments:  Minor code change to delete a bug.  No visible change to any
users.  Has been on at least one other system for 3 years without
problems.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Name:  UNDELE

Comments:  We would like to install this program and provide the
documentation which is currently available to other users.  This program
has been used in its two versions for more than 3 years (second version
released Mar 1984).

     I am enclosing a copy of the file UNDELE.DOC which is the file
which explains the use of this command, and is installed in the system
to provide user documentation.  The user may also type the /HELP switch while
using the command UNDELETE to receive information on possible options.
-------
			   "UNDELETING" FILES

     The UNDELETE command will restore a file that has been deleted
during the current login or gfd session, if the UNDELETE ability has
been enabled.

     The general form of the UNDELETE command is

   -UNDELETE [file identifier1,file identifier2...] [switches]

file identifier    Specify the file(s) to be restored.	The usual wild
		   cards can be used (#, *, "ALL").

     If no file identifier is specified, all files deleted during the
present login or gfd session are restored.

     When UNDELETE is enabled, all files that are deleted can be
recovered until the user either logs out or gfd's to another directory.
UNDELETE is enabled by giving the command

   -UNDELETE/ENABLE

and disabled by the command

   -UNDELETE/DISABLE

Both enabling and disabling remain in effect until they are changed,
and do not need to be typed at the beginning of each session.

     The UNDELETE command switches are:

  Switch			   Function

/LIST		    List all files that have been deleted.

/RECOVER	    Recover specified files, or all.  (default)

/PURGE		    Expunge specified files; they cannot then be restored.

/SELECT 	    Select action to take for a list of files,
		    or rename a single specified file.

/ENABLE 	    Enable UNDELETE capability.

/DISABLE	    Disable UNDELETE capability.

/BEGIN		    Enter UNDELETE program.

/FAST		    List only filename, extension and success message.

/?		    Type the on-line help message.

     If a user attempts to recover a file when another file by the
same name exists, UNDELETE will give the error message

    "**ALREADY EXISTING FILE!**"

If this occurs the user can then use the /SELECT switch to rename the
file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the new name for the file.

     /SELECT can be used with a list of files to select the action to
take for each file.  UNDELETE will prompt for the action to take.
Responses, and their results are:

  Response		  Action

  Control-R	       Recover this file with the old name.
   <CR> 	     Skip this file, do not recover.
  Control-D	       Expunge this file; it cannot then be recovered.
  name Control-R	   Recover this file and rename it to "name".
  name <CR> 	 Recover this file and rename it to "name".
***end of undele.doc***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Program Name:  CHKPNT
Current Version: 30.2
New Version:  30.3
Comments:  A fairly minor change which insures that accounting data
will be written even when the "debug" switch is set.  This could prevent
the loss of revenue information in the event of a crash.  There
would be no apparent changes to users.

Changes between versions:  The following is the programmer's infor-
mation log which records the changes between versions.

30.3	/TODD  10-21-82: Previous versions of CHKPNT did not write
	records because debug switch was on.	Fixed this so that we
	can charge for interrupted sessions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Please note that earlier versions of the above programs will no
longer be supported.  If you have any questions or problems regarding
the distribution or installation of this package, please contact the
indicated member of the Packaging group listed below.

Thank you.

	First item:
Craig agrees that we do the following to save unnecessary redundancy,
especially when transmitting software to the domestic, customer 2020's.

We check the current copy of the executable binary file of the program
on the "production location hosts" (as they are called on the
transmittal form) to determine if they are identical with the executable
binary file created by our reconstruction of the file from the archived
source files.  This checking is done in this way:
	1.)  Determine the version number of the file built from the
sources and of the files on the production hosts.
	2.)  Determine the checksum of the file built from the sources
and of the files on the production hosts.
	3.)  If the production host's file has the same version number
and checksum as the file built from sources, telecopy this executable
binary file from the production host to another file name on the host
with the executable binary file rebuilt from sources.  Check for any
differences between the two files with the 'differences' command (which
runs the FILCOM program).

If the executable binary file from the production host is identical to
the executable binary file built from sources, transmittal of the
executable binary file to the production host is unnecessary.  This
transmittal should definitely NOT be done if the host is a customer host
(such as a domestic 2020).

	Second item:
The names of the packages that Craig suggested for the transmittal data
base, TRABAS, (and thus for everyone's access to the packages in
archives) is a 6 character mnemonic name, such as the filename part of
the file-id in the .DOC file in the archive FDM file, with ".PKG" as the
last four of the 10 characters allowed in the TRABAS and ARCHIV data
bases.  E.g.: the COMMAND package will be called "COMMAN.PKG" on the
"Software name" line of the transmittal form.

Since this name will be the name by which the package will be known
henceforth, we should be careful about what we choose for the first six
characters.  Coordination of this naming is recommended if you have any
questions.

	Third item:

Re. retransmittals of previously released packages:  If the package has
been transmitted, the "production" hosts' software has been installed,
and no changes to these installed files are to be made, then the new
transmittal should be marked "Archive only".

Every package transmitted should be re-transmitted with the following
changes, and these changes should be implemented for every new package
transmitted.:
	1.)  Package name should follow the new convention of
"<6-character name>.PKG".
	2.)  Version number(s) for packages should reflect the new
convention, including the manner in which the FDM file's name is
affected by the version numbering scheme.	Package file name format:

	"<4-char pkg name abbrev.>n[A|T].mmm"
(where:  n = digit 0 thru 9, reflecting the host class;
	 "A" or "T" = code reflecting Archive or Transmittal file; and
	 mmm = package version number, starting with 001.)

	3.)  The transmittals should include the following additional
information about EACH included program and instructions to Software
Distribution to enter this information into the TRABAS data base:
	    a.)	System number:  packaging host number;
	    b.)	Program name:  name of individual program, as in last
transmittal of individual program;
	    c.)	Transmittal number:  (numbering method to be
determined);
	    d.)	Version number:  version number of the individual
program;
	    e.)	Programmer name:  name of programmer who wrote the
current version of the individual program;
	    f.)	File name:  name of the package's current archive FDM
file;
	    g.)	File extension:  extension of the package's current
archive FDM file.

Subject: host 90 (now CEGI)

Peter Haas, in IOD, has called Craig, complaining that, although the
host is now in St.	Cloud, it is still calling itself P90, rather than
S90.  Craig passed this on to me.  I don't know how extensive the needed
changes are, what they would operationally affect, or how to make them.
Can I tell Craig and Peter that you are taking care of this?

TUMS is now available on 26.  It is recognized from 930, and will be
recognized by other TUMS systems as soon as the files get distributed.
As usual, please report any bugs (God forbid!)  to me.  Happy TUM'ing.

Subject: addendum to deleted (SYS) files

I took WF away from a lot of OPER names... canceled a few that don't
need to be on 930.  Most of the NTD names are still intact.	Feel free
to check.

This action was done because (SYS)*.REL were among the deleted files.
We can live with missing .DAT files but not .REL and others.  I doubt
that it was intentional... someone slipped?  Well, it's harder to slip.

If .REL files vanished from (SYS), that implies "stupid".	This would
tend to indicate somebody that doesn't know better.  I don't see any
reason why any NTD people that you don't know need names at all on 930.
I don't see any reason why anyone outside Tymcom-X Systems family and
friends need WF on 930.  That is to say, feel free to cancel all but
SY RF from anyone in NTD -- and even that if you think its warrented.
I don't even see why anyone but
  Dennis, Bill Euske, Gazel, Mike Rude, Greg, myself, Adele, Lois,
  Jill, and Nancy
even need user names on 930.  I might be able to help identify user
names if you have any you're not sure of.

Yes.... what I did was for exactly what you just said.  I was merely

Euske & RUDE...
   People having names are Nancy,Lois,Jill,Lynn,Greg,You,Dennis,Ishan
from NTD.  All others are gone.  If you think Euske or Rude really
need usernames or OPER status, feel free to put them back.

  Carl,
  Did Craig give you that software change request from Dan Wedge
  pertaining to f40 link ?? If so, Any status?
  jon
...
Jon,
  I don't recall receiving any requests from Craig.  Dennis mentioned
something to me about Fortran-10 & Link (I think), but I'm pretty sure
that this is the first I heard about F40 & Link.  My understanding is
that the 3rd phase of the F40 compilation is completed by special codes
in LOADER, and I do not know if LINK-10 handles that properly.  That is
the main reason why LINK-10 has not ever been considered as an official
replacement for LOADER.
  This entire issue needs further examination, and I will need some
clarification of what Dan Wedge is requesting and what he really needs.

     Dan, please note memo from Peter Stratman (Cegi Tymshare France),
     which follows on next page.

     I believe his analysis of the problem is quite accurate.  Originally,
     the base for host C14 was node 145 and this node was assigned a time
     zone equal to Central European time.  Apparantly, sometime in the
     recent past, the base node for C14 was changed to node 232, which has
     a U.S. (pacific) time zone.

     If I recall the workings of Perp this would cause the problem as
     indicated by Peter; do you concur?

     Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue, it's obvious-
     ly very important due to the accounting ramifications.

     Note to Gary Perez: Do you have any idea when the base node changed
     for host C14?  According to my present sources node 145 is now the
     dual base for hosts 11 and 16; node 232 is the dual base for hosts 8
     and 14.  Do you know if this is correct?

     If this is true and Peter's analysis is correct, we must change the
     time zone of node 232 to Central European time.  Will this cause
     problems in other areas, such as for host 8?

     I look forward to a prompt response on this item.  Thanks and best
     regards.	Ken

  Subject:   Errors in March accounting for host P90.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ken,

  We have  found an important problem  concerning the accounting  for host
  P90. This problem has been detected in the accounting files for March on
  host 90, but may be present in the files for earlier months, and on some
  of the U.S. PDP X's.

  The problem is that part, or all,  of our customers' PERP and DEFER jobs
  have been accounted for using prime-time  product codes for TRU and con-
  nect  time.	 This  has  resulted	 in  enormous  differences	in  the
  prime/non-prime ratio for	customers that rely on heavy use  of PERP and
  DEFER.

  I have briefly  looked into this problem,  and it seems to  me that this
  may be  related to a change  in the base  node number for host  C14, the
  european customer PERP driver. If this new	number (232) is defined as a
  U.S. node number, this may explain our problem.

  I would like to have the following information :

  1.  Can you confirm  that this node number	change is the cause  of this
      problem ? If so, since when has the node number changed ?

  2.  Has this problem  occurred on U.S. hosts on which  our customers are
      valid ?

  3.  Will the accounting  for April be correct, and when  can the problem
      be corrected permanently ?

  As the end of the month approaches,  I would very much appreciate having
  a response as soon as possible.
  Thank you, Peter.

Subject: SPOOL nodpri and priadr

Carl,

Ken Bedell called to ask me some questions about updating the SPOOL
nodpri and priadr files.  I did a little investigation, and it seems
that the files have not been updated since last June.  In Ken's
conversations concerning the problem with Nancy B, she had said a
necessary file for PJ was missing from all the 10s, which seems
curious, to say the least.	(MPL:930)spool.mem contains instructions
for hand copying over a nodpri file, which I tried.  There are
a few strange entries in the file, so I did nothing about installing
it.

It really does seem like a PJ problem, but it would be nice for
internatinal if the node map could be updated.  Ken has left
and said he was turning over the problem to Peter Haas.  I
suggested they contact you.

The files I did are on system 36.  Any questions, send mail
or give me a call.
-Lois

I have NODPRI in good shape, per (SPPOPER)SPNODE.  PRIADR on the 10's

How do I get NODPRI distributed, especially to the French hosts?  do I
have to disable SPOOL, or can I just copy it to the hosts it's needed
on?  Do I copy it to all "Tymshare" domestic PDP-10'S, and to one French
host, or to each host?

The process of updating the NODPRI & PRIADR files could be made much

If Coleman is to be working in TSUCOOP on 26 for packaging, he may need
a larger directory.  The directory now has a max of 3000 pages.  The
packages that Mike has been working on in SYSMAINT:26 occupy ~2800
pages, not including any other files such as packaging documentation
files or mail (TUMS) files.  SYSMAINT & DENCOFF on 26 are each allowed
5000 pages.	Maybe TSUCOOP should also be given 5000 pages.

Another item:  could you set up a TUMS for yourself, on 26, with a
MAIL.FWD file?  That would make it easy for me to send mail to you
without having to type '@X930" every time I send you mail from 26, which
is now my "home" system.  I keep forgetting, and you haven't received
mail I've sent because of my oversights.  The mis-addressed mail has
been resent or taken care of by talking, so I don't believe there's
anything you're missing, but the MAIL.FWD file could prevent slip-ups.

Thanks!

Subject: PRIADR on host 8.

Jan Krivanik & I are getting NODPRI current.  However, PRIADR on the
10's lacks the new printer in the Dallas data center (printer location
#91).  It is listed in the PRIADR file on host 8, but I don't know how
to get it to a PDP-10 (i.e., host 36).	Help in that arena would be MOST
welcomed.  (I don't have access to a username valid on both the 940's
and the 10's.	At least as significantly, I don't know how to put it
into the proper format for the 10's if Telecopy won't do it.)

Help or advice would be most appreciated!

The process of updating the NODPRI & PRIADR files could be made much
easier for the co-op student if he had access to a username which was
good on both the 940's (at least host 8) and the 10's.	My
recommendation is either TSUCOOP or SYSMAINT (the only options I know,
but the choice would be yours, of course).  Currently, the only one I
know we have access to is yours, since they changed the OPER password on
Dan.

LOGINN version 67-3 (current) which checks for (MAIL)ppn.MAI and

has been unable to check for mail for non-gan-3 users (MAIL is in

up.  LOGINN states correctly the license it needs when it is
assembled.  I talked to Dennis and he will cal the software dis-

changed the license on the systems with TUMS.  There is no security

Subject: suggested utility (support for SPOOL)

SPOOL has a current maximum for the network node numbers which can be
automatically associated with spool 'remote' sights.  The largest node
number that can be accepted is 3776.  Tymnet currently has node numbers
ranging as high as 6000+.  The user can bypass this limitation by
specifying a node number which he knows is in the valid Tymsat list.

Allowing users access to the SPNODE program (currently in SPPOPER) would
provide a service to users of SPOOL.  If their attempt to use SPOOL from
a Tymsat not in the list fails, and they do not already know the number
of a node which is assigned to the printer location they desire, they
have a potential problem.  Being able to run SPNODE from the SYS
directory would allow them to easily learn a node number to give the
SPOOL program to get their desired results.

I recommend that we place SPNODE in the SYS directory, with protection
to allow all users to run it, and license to allow the program to read
the NODPRI and PRIDAR files in the SPOOL directory.

Please let me know if I should do this.

thanks!

Subject: in reply to: suggested utility (support for SPOOL)

PLEASE.... NO!!!!!

SPOOL IS ALREADY A PATCHWORK MONSTROSITY!!!!!  ADDING YET ANOTHER
PROGRAM ("SPNODE") ONLY COMPLICATES MATTERS YET ANOTHER LEVEL.

PLEASE DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY, AND FIX SPOOL TO UNDERSTAND HIGHER NODE
NUMBERS.  DENNIS & I TALKED ABOUT THIS AND THE TRAINING AND HANDHOLDING
NECESSARY TO ADD ANOTHER PIECEMEAL "HANGER-ON" PROGRAM FOR THE SPOOL
USER IS NOT, I REPEAT, "N" "O" "T" WORTH THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX
SPOOL.

--- Already, SPOOL consists of:
    SPOOL, BCHARG, RCHARG, RBCHG, SHC, TAPCHG,
    SLVSUP, SUPSLV, SPFIX, SPLFIX, 1PNUPD  and a couple of others...

Not to mention, SPNODE and a few other "internally" used programs.
I haven't touched the code in SPOOL for close to 3 years, but I still
recall enough to know that the changes necessary to SPOOL to make it
read node<==>printer correlations for nodes higher than node 3777 is
only a couple of lines of code.  In fact, it could make the code smaller
if we removed the "+" feature.  However, that not withstanding, I'd bet
that I could patch the current "running" spool by changing references to
a couple of constants... that's how trivial the change would be.

The "work" involved would be to generate a version of 1PNUPD that ran on
the PDP-10s instead of on the 940s, and I understand that that is a real
necessity before the end of the year anyway!   (And I have a solution for
that as well.  -Sigh).

Carl, doesn't the 1PNUPD program need PJ, so that migrating 1PNUPD to a
Tymcom-X host would also need migrating PJ to a Tymcom-X?

I know that PJ doesn't currently do the updating of the node number to
printer location data base files on the Tymcom-X's, so the current lack
of PJ on a Tymcom-X is academic (for this job).  We're currently doing
the updating of these data base files by hand, and having a version of
1PNUPD on a Tymcom-X would make that process easier, as in interim
solution to the current, hopefully temporary lack of a Tymcom-X version
of PJ.

1PNUPD merely updates the NODPRI/PRIADR databases.
As far as updating the data from "a" master system to all the rest of
the systems, that requires a periodic transfer program, such as what the
(PJ)PAM program was doing.

When PERP is completed, PAM may simply vanish, since it will already have
been replaced by PERP....  sigh.	So, don't worry about PJ dependancies
since PJ & PAM won't exist for much longer.

I have had a request from Peter Stratman, CEGI-Tymshare, for PEAK to be
made available for customer use.  I have checked with Jon, who tells me
to do it, with the explicit provision that we will provide no support.

The only work I see necessary to carry this out is:  1.)  remove the
test for the Tymshare bit in the program, 2.)  the creation of a pricing
schedule, and 3.)	transmittal of the files to the CEGI hosts.  the only
files that I know to be needed by the program and users are:
(SYSNEWS) PEAK.CHT, PEAK.KEY, PEAK.NEW, PEAK.SUM, PEAK.TXT, PEAK.TUT and
(SYS) PEAK.SAV, PEAK.HLP

Please let me know of anything I've missed or any problems we might
encounter.  Please copy Jon on your answer.

In-reply-to: your message of Wed, 24 Jul 85 14:39:38 PDT

The provision of "no support" sounds nice on paper, but it doesn't hold
water for a product like PEAK.

I'd like to know the following:
   1)  Does CEGI use the Tymshare bit for anything?
       i.e. do any of their programs check for it?
   2)  Do they restrict their customers in any way?
   3)  Do their customers have regular TYMNET access, i.e. TYMNET usernames
       or are they all "only" on the 2020's ((and their 1 KL)).

Depending upon the answers to these questions, HOW to release PEAK to their
users will change.

An aside:  Since Ken Dawson is working for TYMNET again, (as of last wednesday)
	   there may be some development work on PEAK in the forseeable future
	   and quite possibly, he could make the necessary changes for CEGI for
	   us.

One more question for CEGI: How many customer groups do they have?  GAN's...
   PEAK has an internal list of customers who may use it, and depending upon
   their needs, that list could be augmented, or made external, so that CEGI
   could restrict or allow usage of PEAK on a customer by customer basis.

Let me know what you find out.
/Carl

PS:  Until it is decided that PEAK is error-free enough for general customer
     use, I'm against removing the TYMSHARE-BIT restriction.  Especially if
     we're not supporting it!!!!!

Carl:

Netval version 3.00 is operational in VALNET; in anticipation of it being

procuring the hardware), I would like you to test the communication of
any Tymcom-X programs that you know about that access NCUD1 to update the
CUD (password change program is all I can think of).  It can be accessed
for testing with the username VALNETNCUD1, defined as follows:

- VALNETNCUD1 has been set up in the public network with the following
attributes:

		ignore host
		transparent gateway
		Origin:
		    Class 0
		Destinations:
		    2 home host gateways to VALNET: 5762, 5763

- VALNETNCUD1 has been set up in VALNET with the following attributes:

		ignore host
		no password
		Origin:
		    Class 0
		Destination:
		    home host 83 (Netval host)

Please give it a try, and if you have any questions or problems, let me know.

Thanks.

Jill,
  I have been using TXS.C/Baltrunas since the very beginning of [On]tyme.
They may have setup a THS.{mumble} account for me, but no one has ever
given me the password. (I'll check on it).  As of now, the only, I repeat
ONLY ontyme name I personally use is TXS.C/Baltrunas.  Mail will get to
me via TXS.SUP (which I also manage) but that is a section account.

  No!  I have only received 1 message from you i.e. both that you sent
to TXS.C/Baltrunas, and have NOT seen anything from THS.{mumble}

  To test... I must change the programs which now build circuits to NCUD1
to build circuits to VALNETNCUD1 (spelling?)... right?  I will assume that

Jill,
  I tried a couple of things out using VALNETNCUD1 instead of NCUD1
and met with pretty consistant (successful) results.  I didn't try
changing passwords, but I did try changing class, adding/deleting
class and requesting MUD info for username data verification.  I'd
say that most things work OK.  I didn't do a thorough test, nor did
I try to validate/cancel a user.  I will try those later and let you
know if there's any problems.

Just wanted to be sure that you understand that the CUD and
MUDs that you are updating with VALNETNCUD1 are in a different
network, VALNET; you can access the network by logging
in to the username VALNET, and that will get you from either
Bubbnet or Tymnet into the valnet network. Once there isn't
much you can do...you can try setting a home host to 83,
the Netval host...other than that there are only 2 other
nodes, both supervisor machines.

Thanks for the testing.

I WOULD appreciate it if you tried to change a password:

Set a user to home host 83 and login to Netval to be sure the
name can access it. Then with your program, change the password and
try to login again...it usually updates the MUDs pretty quickly.

Let me know if you have any problmes...since we're in a test mode,
both Supervisors may not be updating...

Re:    An idea for an enhancement to PEAK.

As a former VUE user, I was trying to do the "Invert Case in Region" function
in PEAK and discovered that it did not exist.  "No problem," I thought.  "I'll
just create my own macro and bind it to some key sequence."  Then I discovered
that it was impossible to even do this (unless I have overlooked something or
you have an unpublished PEAK function).

In my labors to create such a macro, what I needed was a new function similar
to this:  "Repeat the next function until mark (or end-of-line, paragraph,
window, page, etc.)"  Then, I could have defined a region in a macro and
repeated the "Toggle Case of Character" to the end of the region.  I'm sure
that this "Repeat" function would be very useful to create other nice macros.

I don't know if anyone is chartered to add enhancements to PEAK, but I would
vote to add this sort of "Repeat" function.

Subject: PEAK - Toggle case in region, etc

    Craig,

    It seems clear that the easiest solution to the problem at hand, the
    inability to modify case within a region, is to provide a set of
    functions parallel to those availible for tokens and characters.  Since
    the logic is already designed, it seems little effort to provide these.

    However, I'm intrigued by your other suggestion, that of "repeat the
    follwing command until some condition takes place".  It would indeed
    expand the power of macros considerably, but needs some thought.  I'll
    keep in touch about it.

    Meanwhile, which system(s) do you work on?

Thanks for your help...I saw that you logged into Netval...hopefully

There should be no changes necessary when it comes up, since we

I don't know if it's a good assumption to make that program(s) that
access the cud login to NCUD1 without a host.	Most [PASSWORD,etc.]
still have "NCUD1:1;" hardcoded into them.  It might be best to turn
off the colon option for username NCUD1 when you make the switch.

I can fix PASSWORD with a new release, but that has NOT been done as
yet.  Let me know... otherwise, I'll wait until there's something else
to change.   /Carl

An idea:  help output could indicate the availability of the "n, n, ..."
construction, in combination with the "n-m" construction, and be more
compact with the following construction in the output: (eg.):

CHANGE	n,n-m  Change . . .

Also, the use of "PRINTER" to replace "LOCATION" in the command line
would be more compact and balanced, and might be clarified by the use of
"printer location" in the HELP text, as we've done.

It's your program, and I hope you see these suggestions as constructive.
At least I'm giving them to you as suggestions, rather than getting my
fingers in your code.

Take care,

Dennis,
  I appreciate your thoughts...   n,n-m would be more concise... good (!)
but the whole mess about printer locations, PRINTER vs LOCATION vs printer
location is simplicitiy and conciseness.  SPOOL has a LOCATION command,
picked to make it unique, since SPOOL has a PRINT command for operators to
use (sigh), so the same command will carry across programs for now.

  When I put in the changes for "+" and for the extended node #'s 0-7777,
0+-7777+, I'll probably add PRIADR support and make NODE/LOCxxx go away
in lieu of LIST node n,n-m  and LIST loc n,n-m and LIST printer n,n-m
and CHANGE {node,loc,printer} n,n-m  etc...

the September 10 seminar, please let me know ASAP as these classes are
filling up quickly.  Otherwise, I will assume that September 10 is
agreeable with you.  You will receive a confirmation memo, with
detailed information, approximately 1 week prior to the seminar date
you choose.

I would also like to remind you that I will need a Manager approval
form BEFORE you can attend this seminar.  If you haven't already sent
one please do so now.

Carl,
  I've looked more closely at the sample output you gave me.  Now I see
why you use "range of node entries" in your HELP output.  Slightly less
concise but (to me) more clear might be a comprise between our ideas:

CHANGE	n,n-m  Change printer locations for nodes or a range of nodes.

  I see this as appropriate for the CHANGE command only, to further
emphasize that the user is changing the printer location to one value
for all nodes in the range.

  Bye!

but... but... but...
  if I say:
	Change 1,5-10,25
   it prints:
	1 ....
	Printer location? xxx
	5 ....
	6 ....
	...
	10....
	Printer location? yyy
	25....
	Printer location? zzz

so, a CHANGE command (list, etc) work on EACH node or range of nodes
in the list, each or each range separately, not each node and each range
as a single unit...

  I think it's fine the way it is... many programs just give you the
command list (if at all) and hope you can figure out howto use them.

    list at at some point, and I'm set up for MEXEC.  When I say
    "fdm<crlf>", I get "Invalid Command."  from v0.7 of FDM.  But when I
    say "do fdm<crlf>" I get into the program and get a proper prompt.	Any
    idea why this is?

Well,
  that's one of the things that doesn't work.... it uses a "new"
command scanner that tries to read the monitor command.  I wanted
FDM<cr> to give a prompt, but FDM command<cr> to work... sigh at
the moment, neither do...  So, DO FDM<cr> or R (direcotry)FDM<cr>
or FDM<cr>	[wait for error msg] START<cr>  all work fine.

THE TYMNET-1 ELIMINATION SCHEDULED FOR SUNDAY DECEMBER 1 HAS BEEN DELAYED.

A SCHEDULE FOR COMPLETION WILL BE PUBLISHED ON MONDAY DECEMBER 2


THIS DELAY IS DUE TO UNRESOLVED SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN THE

BY THIS WEEKEND.  IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONVERSION AS ORDERLY AND 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE, WE ARE SCHEDULING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUPER-
VISOR FOR 3:00 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, 12/15.  THIS WILL ALLOW ONE WEEK
FOR CONVERSION, WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE FEW REMAINING NODES.

CURRENT STATUS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE:

940 NET - THE AUX CIRCUIT PROBLEM WHICH IMPACTED VALIDATIONS ON MONDAY
          HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND TESTING IS CONTINUING.

E-BUSS - NEW CODE IS BEING LOADED NOW WHICH FIXES THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

Carl,

    Dan Wedge has received a request for help re. an error message
received during execution of an old (11 yrs. old) reliable user
application program.  Dan and I don't directly know anything about the
message, and would like help or direction to the appropriate
documentation.

    The run-time error message received is:

"FATAL ERROR A016-nnnn"

Subject: TBA 

I've recieved a call from a Tymnet programmer about a TBA problem.  I
don't know anything about TBA, and need some direction or referral to
documentation about the TBA system.

The problem:  when running TBA the user sometimes gets a banner giving
version number info and then the TBA prompt, and sometimes immediately
gets just the prompt.  When given the banner all is O.K., when given the
prompt only she gets a "Ill. Mem. Ref." as soon as she tries to do
anything.  Is she not getting the whole program, or is she somehow
getting some obsolete executable file when she doesn't get the banner?

Any help would be GRATEFULLY accepted!
D.

As far as TBA is concerned, you're pretty much "in the dark".  I have
never even run a TBA program, let alone compiled or (whatever it does)
do anything to a source.

You would probably have better luck talking with Dan Wedge about it.
I'd reccommend that you set RC SY RF licenses and run FRMDDT and try
to examine location 137 in her core image to determine if it is a
"version skew" problem.  Other than that, we'd have to see how and
why she gets the banner & prompt... i.e. what her program is expecting
at that point.

Dennis,
  re: BOOTS.DMP ... I'm not sure, the whole BOOT mechanism is a mess on
                    the TYMCOM-X systems. ...mostly no documentation. I
                    or someone will have to research it.
  re: SYSTAT documentation probably stops at the point when they last
                    decided they had time to document what they had done
                    other than in the transmittal documentation.

  who to ask?  not to be facetious, but I'll give you the answer that
               was given to me when I asked what to do when I got this
               message "please see your tymshare representative"

  YOU are your tymshare representative...  YOU are the person to ask

Yes, I know... sigh!

Re: Age hath no beauty when it comes to old software...

"FATAL ERROR A016-nnnn" is a standard error message coming out of the
various programs which use royalty accounting.  The "A" means it is
an accounting error, for which Dan Wedge should have a list of the
possible error codes (someone in ACS should).  The "016" was probably
the user's Frame number, but I won't swear to it.

The problem is simple.  TYMNET!
The solution is to have Dan contact whomever it is that adds nodes to
the royalty accounting NODE database and add the node number that the
particular user was logged into when the error occurred.  At the moment
I'd also note that the program most probably WILL NOT run inside a PCOM
control file.  The perp-replacement program will attempt to handle this
PCOM limitation in a more reasonable manner.

PS: Dan may be able to add the node himself.  ACS used to handle this
    at one time.

/Carl

PPS: I said TYMNET, simply because they are adding nodes like crazy and
     a lot of the software won't even handle node numbers that large...

Subject: Co-op Student's Usernames 

Since we have lost the co-op student, I believe security dictates that
we remove usernames that he had access to, or change their passwords.
the username/password combinations that I'm concerned with (for both
Network login & OPER) are for usernames TSUCOOP, SPPOPER & SYSMAINT.
The former login passwords are valid for the first two usernames, but
these passwords do not work for OPER.  SYSMAINT's password is good for
both the network and OPER.

I believe all three usernames are worth keeping as login usernames.
TSUCOOP on 26 currently contains much of the software for packages under
development.  SPPOPER is worth keeping for the SPOOL support function
that we are taking over since the co-op position has been eliminated.
It is not necessary that an OPER username be maintained for either
of these two username.  I believe SYSMAINT is necessary but should have
a new password for both functions.

I have changed the login password for username TSUCOOP.  Shall I change
lthe login password for username SPPOPER?  If I do, whom should I
notify?  Shall I change the login and OPER passwords for SYSMAINT?  Do
you know whom I should notify about this change (other than Dan Baigent
and Bill Mortenson)?

Thankjs!

have a need for TSUCOOP, et al.

No, the usernames do not get cancelled.  I will take care of username
ZONNIE, or talk to Jon about it.  Please change the OPER passwords for
TSUCOOP, SPPOPER, SYSMAINT  and also their login passwords on bothe the

that should know the new passwords are: Jon, Dennis, Helge, Dan, Carl,

I cannot change the OPER passwords for TSUCOOP or SPPOPER, since I don't
know the current ones.  I will call Colman to get get the current OPER
passwords for these usernames.  I will then change the OPER passwords
for these usernames, and will notify everyone in the section (I won't

I will change all 3 login passwords, and notify everyone in the section
(except managers) of the new login passwords.

Since my last mesage to you I have talked with Colman and Dan Wedge.

1.)  Colman knew of no OPER password for usernames TSUCOOP or SPPOPER.

2.)  Dan can find no documentation on accounting error codes, and knows
of no one who would know of such matters.  I know of nothing, and can
find nothing in an examination of the hosts using (MPL) MHX & (SPL)
FINDIT.  Do you know who to point us toward?

3.)  In our looking for the source of the "spurious" "MAKE ERROR" error
message in the running of SPOOL on host 39, I have troubles.  I cannot
get a SAVEd copy of the DDT-included version of the program with the
needed data from the registers and the Program Counter saved.  When
operators tried to invoke DDT on the job after the crash, they had no
luck.  When they tried to save the registers and the PC's value after
the crash (without invoking DDT) the PC (loc. 130) contained 
"0000000 0000000".  I need some direction/help, to at least get the
needed data, to analyze.

Thanks!
