    It started when the bank moved it's offices from Maryland to Delaware
so that it could charge a service fee on it's credit cards.  In 6-82 I sent
two checks to pay off my balance and deposit the required $300 to avoid the
service fee.  The bank misposted the $300 in 7-82 which showed up on my
8-82 statement.  I didn't see their mistake until in 3-83 (7 months later)
the bank put a $300 charge on my card with no explanation on the statement.
This problem was finally resolved in 3-84 (21 months after the first mistake
occurred).

    In 6-84, while paying off bills in preparation for buying this house,
I decided to close my 1st Omni account.  My card balance was 1638.64 with a
1348.84 balance in savings.  [Note: 1638.64 - 1348.84 = 289.80]  I mailed
a check #1045, for 289.80 with an enclosed handwritten letter asking the
bank to payoff my account using the check plus the balance of my savings.
Account paid and closed, or so I thought.

    The closing date on the statement was 7/12/84.  The check was dated
7/1/84.  The check was deposited 7/6/84.  My bank paid the check 7/9/84.

    1st Omni waited until 8/2/84 to post the withdrawal from savings to
pay off my credit card account.  However, by this time, they charged me
$25.45 interest on the balance.  Of course, my savings earned $5.82 in
interest during the same time, and another $2.92 for the partial month
the bank took to pay off the account.


    What should have happened:  The $1348.84 should have earned $4.66
for the partial month of June-July/84 prior to withdrawal.  My account
should have been paid off and closed.  I should have received a check
for $4.66 from 1st Omni Bank.


    What really happened:  I was charged additional interest of $14.02
on 8/13/84, interest of $0.50 on 9/12/84, interest of $0.51 and a late
fee of $12.50 on 10/12/84 for a total of $44.24 which I didn't owe at all.

    When we purchased our house, our loan was held up because I had to
explain that the bank had made these mistakes, and I was required to pay
the $44.24 (that I didn't owe) to 1st Omni, via check to Valley Title.

    In July/85 I received a statement and bill from 1st Omni for the
yearly service fee.  I threw it away, because I had closed that account.
In August, I received a statement charging interest on the still unpaid
service fee.  I threw that away.   In September or October I received
a letter requesting payment or the bank would assume that I wanted to
close the account (due to non-payment of the yearly service fee) since
the charges and interest which were then past due were all for that fee.
