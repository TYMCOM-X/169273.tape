The changes I made were very 39-job-mix specific as well as only making
sense for 4-meg machines (and only KL's).   I'm sure we can come up
with a generalization, but it will take some time.  Thanks for the
BLOCK-IO idea - I think that would be just fine.  Even when someone is
doing BLOCK-IO to a human (IE FTYPE), it isn't interactive.  BLOCK-IO
really can't be interactive.  (oops - I speak too soon - doesn't MAGNUM
use it for screens? - oh well, MAGNUM never was interactive, either).

yes - mtg sounds good, don't know when yet

8.12.4	.CHMVP: move virtual page to a file (CHANIO fn 47)

	MOVE	ac,[.chVMP,,channel]
	CHANIO	ac,ADDR
	 error return		; AC/ garbage (is this a bug?)
	normal return

ADDR:	count,,virt-page
	file-page		; -1 to append

Move the specified virtual page(s) into the file open on the specified
channel as indicated by <file-page>.  If <file-page> is -1, the page
will be placed immediately past the current end-of-file.

If the virtual-page does not exist, or if it is part of a file or if
it is sharred, error return, otherwise, normal return.

The virtual page(s) being moved must be private and unshared.

Let us make this final for both the YAMM and for future discussions.
I started using .chVMP a while back... Greg came up with .chMVP when
he started getting it together for the YAMM.  Do we have any "real"
preferences?

     VMP   vs   MVP   ?

.chMFP - make file page
.chVMP - virtual move page
.chMVP - move virtual page
.chMPF - move page to file
.chMPV - move page, virtually

It doesn't really matter to me.  VMP doesn't mean much, but we've been
calling it that for a long time.  Oh, one more...

.chDVP - devirtualize page
.chFIL - file (as in the verb "to file", like place in a file)
.chPPF - put page in file
.chSPF - stick page in file

Subject: TRU budgets (TRUCTL and PAM)

Here's the scoop on TRU control...(air sickness bag advised):

1. TRU budgets are set by NONAME, TRUCTL or UPDLUD in the LUD.

2. When a user logs in, LOGINN copies the TRU budget into the UFD.
   Note: there is presently a bug preventing this from working for
   GAN 3 users.  This bug has been carefully researched and has been
   found to be unfixable.

3. Every 15 minutes or so, PAM (PJ) runs a job that checks for schedule
   100000.  If so, it then looks at the accumulated TRUS for all jobs
   logged in to controlled user names, and subtracts them from the
   budget in the UFD.  If it reaches zero, PAM does a HANG UUO.  LOGINN
   also checks to see if it has reached zero when logging in.

(this is slightly condensed - there are actually two variables in the
UFD - one for limit and one for TRUS left this period usualy a day)

Anyway, to my knowledge, SET LIMIT is the only access to the job TRU
limit.  There should be a SETLIM calli which sets it and returns its old
value.  And of course, the new interrupt - which if not enabled when the
limit is reached will just stop the job like it does now.  And of course
last, but not least, a new option for HIBER - sleep until tru limit
exceded.  This can be optomized - take code from TYMCHG.

Gee, I just had a thought, if you made it a frme attribute, rather than
a CALLI, you could use the existing read/set frame attribute UUO.  Then
PCOM and similar jobs could set the limit on their children and watch
for a TRU LIMIT EXCEDED halt status.

I don't know about the frame attribute stuff.  I think its all set up
to use the UPT.  It may just be easier to add it as a seperate UUO.
Since its in a job table, no problem poking it.  I guess you should
have whatever frame access you need to stop the frame.  As for relative
stuff, certainly, in fact I suspected that would be the default.  As
for allowing continue to work, that's no big deal.  It is not a security
thing where we have to protect the user from himself.  If the user gets
TRU LIMIT EXCEDED and types CONTINUE then he should get what he asked for.
I probably won't remember to call you, but I'll be in VG2 tomorrow
afternoon so I'll drop in (late afternoon).
