Tim,

  Just in case I don't talk to you in person:

Please ask Roger to call me on thursday or friday if he hasn't heard
from me by then.  He can call me at home in the morning (415) 961-1082
[Mountain-View #] or at work, (408) 447-7257 afternoon or evenings.

  I do want to talk to him, but my apprehension causes me to put it
off and to 'chicken-out' when I finally get around to trying to call.
It is easier for me for me to have someone call me, because I kinda
have a case of telephone-itis when it comes to initially talking to
people about some things.

Times?  Times?
Uh, well, uh..  Almost anytime, I guess, but probably in the

resume afterwards, pretty much making an evening of it.  Although
I guess, it could be after dinner?  I prefer the first alternative.

It depends on what is convenient for everyone.

There is a new version of FINE (CT4) on SYS: on 930.
IT has a few added things, see $S? for some more things which
you can change, including the value of <meta> or <control-x>
and one new command <^Xa>abbreviation$fullname$ which does nice
things once you've said $Mabbrev$ to set "abbrev" mode.

a couple of other things have been changed slightly...
 typing ^C or "E" when it asks for terminal type no longer
 destroys your tty setting,

 it is slightly smarter about disk errors, gives a message.

I waited for ernie to come over.  We woke jean up.  Talked for awhile, etc.
Jean went to sleep again.  Ernie & I talked for awhile.  Ernie left.
I went upstairs to sleep for about 3 hours.  Jean came up & woke me up
about then & kept me company for awhile, (i will add, keeping me awake!)
and then she had to leave to go off to do whatever & eat, etc.  I couldn't
sleep any more so, I got up.

I'm planning on inviting people over again next? ... week(s).  Ernie says
next week he should be interested also, jean won't be 'cause of her mom, etc.

Hi!
I am sure that you are well aware of most of the lackings of
EMPIRE, but... Some of the things which could be improved
are:
    Sentry armies could wake up (?Momentarily/Permanently)
	when a transport passes, or is close enough to fill.
    It shouldn't ask what to do with armies on a transport if
        the transport is out to sea.  If in sentry mode (army)
        this seems to work right if alongside another transport
        (even K doesn't make it ask if both are out to sea!)
    All multi-move pieces could (?should) act like fighters when
        you type a space, to not move -- don't ask for the rest.

Also, it is not clear that during Movement-commands if "?" works or not.
(more experimentation is needed...). and "V" (during movement) doesn't
seem to tell you if the game was saved...

When the computer surrenders and tells you about the "JE<crlf>" sector #
if you are trying to continue or anything at that point, you end up playing
on a small board (as in the LTR typeout) for each piece & the # of hits
left for each piece gets screwed incredibly high.

Last, but not least, while in editing mode, when it asks for Sector #:
if you type the wrong character, you can get an ILL MEM REF.  & it would
be nice if it displayed the sector # somewhere, the .HLP file is wrong
'cause it goes 0-1-2-3 then 4-5-6-7, not 0-9..

There have been some more changes to FINE/CT4 which I think are
complete & consistent now.

1) there is a new setable item, == Escape value (27) initially.
2) MetaPrefix is only a prefix, thus <meta><esc> is 2 separate keystrokes,
   and they may be defined as anything.

If you find any problems, let me know.  Rebinding should work now also!
but again, where the book (manual) says <escape> use the escape value,
and where the manual says <meta> use the meta value...

FINE (SYS:CT4) on 930 now checks for JP.TYM and if you're a good guy
that is, if you're setup!  Off you go.  If not, then it checks JP.MOD
and indexes into a table based on your EXEC mode and off it goes to
run SYS:EDIT10, SYS:EDITOR, SYS:EDITOR, SYS:EDITOR with whatever command
you gave to it. (i.e.  Run CT4, or EDIT, or CREATE.. etc.)

What about "SCREEN" for Screen Can Really Emulate Emacs Nicely

I actually "like" (?) SCREEN better than "FINS" Fins Is Not Supported.

SCREEN can also mean one of --

!!! FINE Users !!!!

Please copy the file (CARL)FINE.TUT into your respective directory
and run FINE {a la CT4} to edit that file.  Please make your own
copy, as it is read-only on my area.

It is a "TUTORIAL" based/converted from the MIT-EMACS tutorial which
is designed to get people "started" using <*FINE*>.

Please run through it A.S.A.P. (it takes about 1/2 hr at 1200 baud,
slightly less for those who already know something about FINE.)

Please send me your comments & suggestions.  Does it grossly miss the
point anywhere?  Is it too much to give someone to go through?
(Janice Bessling is my next test-subject {completely uninitiated})
I would like to install that with <*FINE*> for its transmittal.

Thanks!

The previous msg about fine... Do it NOW!!!  It will get you somewhat
up to speed & you should be able to give me some feedback on it.

The initial thing you must know is when FINE asks "Terminal type? "
to type the letter "P" in either upper/lower case, then type
^X^VFINE.TUT<esc>  after copying the file.

The proposed new name is "VUE", since what you see is what you have

Comments on Fine Tutorial:
   Control L does not perform as advertised.
   Exiting commands should include Control X Control F.
   Last paragraph (Conclusion) needs to be corrected--
should have you exit in
     in the same manner that you would normally use--
     I never exit with Control C's (maybe I should?)
   Next addition should discuss using marks for deleting,
     as that is such a useful characteristic.
It is certainly a good beginning.

Sharman,
	Thanks for the annotated copy of VUE.TUT.  Some of the things
have been corrected.  Others need to be re-written.  I hacked a lot
of it in at once, so the oversights were thankfully noted.

C-X C-C, C-X C-F, C-X C-S and C-X C-E need to be documented in a
straightforward manner yet.  The C-X C-Z & the C-M-<char> I agree
was an EMACS-ism not a FINE/VUE-ism.  C-M-<char> is their way of
denoting something else altogether, not unlike C-X C-<char> holding
down both the CTRL and META (EDIT) keys on the terminals.

The help text/chart you re-formatted... you should have asked first,
I copied your FINEc/k.RIB files and munged them already.  I also
moved a few commands around for more orthagonal reference.

I intend to change the internal 'help' list to use the c/k.rib
format which you have put together.  Since most people wanting help
want to know how to do something not what a command means!

Also, I dearly need to re-write the reference manual once to reflect
changes & to organize it in a better fashion.  Sections will be
completely redone to reflect what I'd like to see, rather than what
it currently is & then those changes will be made to the sources.

Especially, Reason for validation:
  for (VUE) - ? Editor sources, current!

  for (YEUX)- ? Editor development area.  Necessary so I don't

Re: How's it going?
Slow.

I went around to most of the systems and read through the stream
accounting records to see who was/has using/used CT4 since jan-1 or
however long ago the records still exist.

It is interesting to note that various people have made copies of
sys:ct4 or copied [930]sys:ct4 into their personal directories on
many of the systems.

Jim Parkhurst (tymnet)~~(now MIS tymshare) has scheduled a class for

if it is INTERNAL!.
    I've sent him mail & also left a msg with his secretary, so I
should hear back soon.  If you think it is allright, I will attempt
to have him work with me a little on the documentation, so as to
make communications better.

Re: VUE -- I need to see about setting up some kind of user forum.  If
we intend to make any changes, we have to have a vehicle to inform the
users of them, so that they do not get screwed.
    If nothing else, something which makes it clear that almost everything

I took two calls at your desk today.  (1) Bruce called.

(2) Pete Meyers [Tymcare] Called.
    Apparently, a magnum procedure problem most probably, but he was
    unable to compile a magnum procedure & was being given an error
    message which (after conferring with Chris Larue) appeared to be
    caused by something wrong with the cross-reference file of names
    which caused magnum to try to read a page from a file (temporary?)
    which happenned to be a hole, instead of a page!  I referred him
    to talk with Nick Taddeo of Magnum group...

(2a) He also seems to have a problem with MAGCON.  He's running version
     5.2 (my new one is 5.4) and while attempting to write an unlabled
     tape, 80 char records, he gets an extra record written at the
     beginning which begins with "EOV1filename.....".  Looks like a bad
     label - EOV - appended to his tape (ebcdic mode).

(2b) Re: MAGCON again, he'd also like to know if they can build their
     own translation table with one character changed to a different
     definition... How does he do it?  Can it be done.  Please forward
     this to Adele, if I don't!

33 is down so you get this letter here.

Some minor things on VUE...

You changed the message WRITE WON which is good.
The message Buffer written...Successfully is better but it caught me off
guard because I wasn't sure if you meant the buffer was saved or the
buffer was written to the file.  I checked to make sure you didn't change
the <cntl>S command.

How about

File updated...Successfully

or something like that??

While I am at it how about changing Starting...Saved
so that it tells what was started / saved??

*gasp* this got long and it is late and I should go home and finish
making a scenario so that a bunch of goons can save the world from the
mad corporate executive.

But before he goes he mentions (at the info line it says HP2621 which
is correct but TYMshare in its great wisdom renames everything so my
terminal says Model 444...

So ^O is for AUXIO and not for TYMNET?

I ask in the first place 'cause the problem that SRCDAT had with AUXIO
seemed to be fixed when I added a ^O to the @SOURCE1LOGIN section of
their file.  But I manally tried it specifying the name & I thought it
didn't work.  Anyway, you can ignore any notes you find from JMdaney about

I didn't mean it that way.  I just get frustrated and helpless feeling
sometimes when people ask me questions I cant really answer.  If I go
and find the answer (like I would if you came to me in person) I would
forget about it all and get side tracked (even though it would only take
5 mins max).  I guess I'm frustrated because of the !&^@%#&^$ mail system
which tends to be of the nature, answer it now or forget it.  In HERMES,
I leave the mail around as a reminder until I answer it.

Anyway, like I said, I'm not criticising you, I'm just talking out loud.

Some warnings: (1) the SAILIB routines have not been reworked for this version,
		so you will at least get a warning message, and the routines
		MAY not work.
		(2) GOGTAB.DEF is now very different.  To use GOGTAB entries,
		   make sure you access (JAIL)GOGTAB.DEF, not the one from
			SYS:
		(3) This compilers version number will go away, so nothing
		  compiled with it will be useable without re-compilation
		  when the new compiler really comes out.
		(4) The files on (JAIL) will go away when the new compiler
		  comes out, and the compiler and libraries are subject to 
		  change without notice (although only by bugfixes and 

What do you mean... do the operators print the requests or do I?

I spool files on 35 all the time (well when I spool things), and I presume

what's the story about rollerskating tonight?
Greg was up all night with bill over in bldg C, so he's probably
going to say NO, but that isn't definate yet.  I haven't asked him
since he arrived at 1.

Using VUE, and giving a Control J command at the end of the last line on
the screen, the diagnostic line at the end of the screen (like magic) was
now a part of my text in the middle of the screen, with a new line at the
bottom.  A control H corrected the situation, but I found it a bit odd.

Hi there!  Are you at home or at work?  I hope for your sake you are at home.
No... I am at work.  For awhile anyway.  9600 baud really helps when you
are typing in text.  I have to type more than I expected, since the file
I am copying from is on system 35 which is down for awhile, anyway, I'm
catching up on the work I missed this week due to feeling tired & just not
getting anything done.

I'm also here to receive a phone call &/or make a couple.  I am trying to
get through to a(n) (ex)friend who hasn't talked to me in awhile & try
to straighten some things out.  He (Jim) is the one who is now engaged to
Francoise & thus isn't talking to me.  [It hurts a lot, so don't pester
me about it.]  Give me a ring if you're interested in doing anything this
weekend.

If I get this stuff done (VUE documentation) today, then I'm thinking of
driving down to Santa Cruz or something tomorrow for a change of scenery.
WOuld you be interested in coming along????  I'd like your company.

it won't be before Monday!

That (going during the week) sounds reasonable.  I donno what day would be
best however.  Mondays we have a meeting, Tuesdays I have a 12-1 apointment,
Wednesdays I have skating 7-10pm w/ lesson from 10-?pm, Thursday I have the
monitor meeting at 3.  If we don't mind going a little late, or missing a
meeting, fine.

people are lucky.

Your FINE.INI file has been copied into VUE.INI on :930 only!!!!

1 change was made to make it work!

$S no longer does what you think...  Use $* from now on.
--------------------------------------------------------
Other changes to VUE, but not to your file were:

1) ^S now does Incremental searching
2) ^R  "   "       "         "
3) $S does the old style searching
4) $R does the old style searching
5) $$ <escape><dollar> does replace string (old $R)
6) $% <escape><percent> does query-replace string (old $Q)
7) $* does the parameter setting (old $S)
--------------------------------------------------------
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: MAY 12,1981 2:12
Some minor(*) changes were made to VUE which will affect users externally!
These changes are as follows:

1) ^S now does Incremental searching
2) ^R  "   "       "         "
3) $S does the old style searching
4) $R does the old style searching
5) $$ <escape><dollar> does replace string (old $R)
6) $% <escape><percent> does query-replace string (old $Q)
7) $* does the parameter setting (old $S)
--------------------------------------------------------
The status line has changed slightly, but will not affect anyone.

Some of you have VUE.INI files which must be changed.  Some of you
still have FINE.INI files which must be changed before you rename them
to VUE.INI (FINE.INI is no longer read)

For those who didn't know, VUE is the new name for the FINE (CT4) editor.

But there will be a few more eventually.  But not for awhile.

  Tried several different load strings.  First created a simple test case
from the standard bliss (system) and then the one in finexvue.  Everything
work out fine, both in Link10 and standard loader.  Then usurped a copy
of Vue fromm the finexvue directory , recompiled it with the /d siwtch
and used link10 for loading.  Ran into the same problem you had experienced
earlier today, with the ill inst.   Then used the system loader and to my
suprise everything worked, six12 intercepted the calls and broke at vue
when first called.  This leads me to believe that something is wrong!!!
with link10  and bliss!!!!????

I built a KL monitor for 56 in (OSP).  Took awhile since (OSP) contained
half /J and half /H sources.  Had /J restored from the Xmital Archive.
Anyway I just wanted to let you know that was done so we won't duplicate
effort.  (I only changes the .CMD file.  CONF56.MAC looked ok to me.)
Carl says Marconi specified a KI monitor for 56.  Anyway its telecopying

Greg,

Chances are that I won't be in at all today.
Pain isn't increasing, but it isn't really decreasing.
I also doubt that I will even attempt to drive anywhere distant,
  so i expect to be around if you need me.

I've outlined the remainder of the documentation as I see it should be
done.  Have added a lot, and will be adding a bit more than I expected.
Am up to 35 pages now, although 14 pages of that is command summary
and that will be cut by 1/2-1/4 and then tripled for 3 ways of ordering
the text.

My deadlines are set based upon a facsimile of me that is healthy and
not in pain, but I will try not to let them slip any further than is
humanly possible.

Darren's battery doesn't seem top make much difference.  I think it's
the micro-net or something dropping characters... although Darren's
battery helps it... it's only happenned 1 or 2 times, but not anywhere
as bad as it was happenning.

Talk to you later.

lying down, just difficult to type.

Yes, I am going to the IBM class.  I'm planning to see the new Fellini

9:40.  You're invited, if you want to come.

but gee, you've been rather clandestine about that.  What's the big deal?
Are you seriously interested in managing Tech Support?  If so, it'd be a
reasonable idea not to get me too disappointed you know, especially if I'm
to work for you... Anyway,  I think I'd be somewhat interested in seeing
the film tonight (although my sitting down isn't what it ought to be). {ouch}

just to keep the pain down.
   (Although I may be speaking just a little too soon.)

I should be in soon, to continue with the VUE documentation.  I am
going to change another command.  $K (Meta-K) is going away, it can
be gotten at by typing Meta-\, thus Meta-K can be used for "kill" to
end of sentence once I get that code working.

Same-same with Meta-A (ask user, I need to find anther key) and Meta-E
(call editor recursively).  These should mean go to beginning and end
of a sentence.

Maintenance has a 2-pack system which they use to run their

  They bring up the system MANUALLY, set schedule 600000 and
run "FULL" DSKCLN.   After DSKCLN is finished, they attempt to
"GFD" and they get the "Boots Loaded" prompt.

If they do not run DSKCLN, or the dskcln type is not "FULL", then
everything works fine.  Prior to /J (i.e. /G7) thy had no problems.

Any Ideas?   (This is on 56, but has happenned on the other Dallas

Re:  2nd Problem with /J
Maintenance has a 2-pack system which they use to run their
stuff on whatever system...
  They bring up the system MANUALLY, set schedule 600000 and
run "FULL" DSKCLN.   After DSKCLN is finished, they attempt to
"GFD" and they get the "Boots Loaded" prompt.

If they do not run DSKCLN, or the dskcln type is not "FULL", then
everything works fine.  Prior to /J (i.e. /G7) thy had no problems.

Any Ideas?   (This is on 56, but has happenned on the other Dallas
KL's)  [THis info is from John Coutee, not from Marconi.]

The spurious UPE is a parity error in user memory which could not be found
durring a memory scan.  Its not a real good messages, but the CEs should
be able to understand it.  It can be caused by
1. a location in user memory causing intermittent parity errors
2. a bad interrupt
It could very well be the casue of the strange behavoir with the test packs.

From: CARL

I called Darren & he told me basically the same thing.  The message was
ours and not fro the "front-end" (which I suspected, if it wasn't ours),
I'll call Coutee back & let him know what that stuff is supposed to
mean.   Any ideas abotu the DSKCLN/GFD problem?


From: WRS
Date: MAY 18,1981 23:09
Some other people have been having problems with boots loaded crashes
related to runnig DSKCLN manually after setting SC 600000.  I would
recommend as an interim solution that they not run DSKCLN in this manner,
rather that they force full using ONCDSK and the GO command (not MAN).
-Bill


From: CARL
Date: MAY 18,1981 23:15
Well, At least it isn't a "Marconi" type of problem, it's real.
Let me know if it gets fixed.  Coutee is going to try and telecopy
one or more of his "crashes" off to another system, so that we
could get a chance to look at them.  I'll keep you informed.
-Carl.


From: WRS
Date: MAY 18,1981 23:19
I'll be surprised if anybody looks at them this week.  I prefer that
he keep them on the system they crashed on - moving crashes around
leads to extreem confusion and they are useless unless he also moves the
raw monitor with them.  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: MAY 19,1981 0:55
I'll let him know next time I talk to him, but his crashes are on
the maintenance disks, which are never put up for anyone to see.
His monitor, he says was just the un-run /J monitor that we gave
to Marconi for system 54 when it was converted to J.  No changes,
no patches.  Anyway, I don't really care, I'm just passing along
what info I have.

The version on VUE on 930 has some changes to it.
One question I'd like you to address is having to do with the
centering of screens.  Remember, the tutorial mentioning that
the cursor would be left near the center of the screen?  Well,
that's merely a flag which can be set, which has been "off".
I'm considering turning it "on" as the defualt, ... what think ye?
Either way is fine, but I want the documentation to match.
-Carl.

The user can also set it using $*Center new sceens$1$
....
Other changes...  $A is now  typed as C-X Q  for query from a macro
		  $C is now  typed as C-X E  for execute keyboard macro
		  $E is now  typed as C-X *  for recursive editing
			(later to also work as C-U C-X Q, but not yet!)
		  $K is now  typed as M-\    for kill horizontal whitespace
		  C-X M is now ... as C-X (  for begin macro definition
		  $P is now  typed as C-X )  for "end" macro definition

  $A, $E, $K return "Error" now, until sentences are installed.
  $C, C-X M and $P are "redundant"ly the same until the fingers "re"learn
             a new pattern, however, they will be undocumented, or listed

VUE has changed again!  This time, the changes affect the calling
of keyboard macros (for the better [in all but one instance]).  One
change which will affect you immediately (if you use this command) is
the change to the Meta-K (<esc>K) command.  You now must use Meta-\
instead, M-K has been made illegal temporarily. (for Sentences!)

Other changes...  $A is now  typed as C-X Q  for query from a macro
                  $C is now  typed as C-X E  for execute keyboard macro
                  $E is now  typed as C-X *  for recursive editing

TVEDIT hackers:
new version of TVEDIT has 2 new features:
1. if it is run from a directory other than WRS, it will delete itself
2. its text buffer has been increased from 151 lines to 8000 lines - as
  a result, most files, up to about 100-150 pages will NEVER wrap around.

(Actually, I tickled it enough that I had to!)
Anyway, it was going off the deep end by dropping
off the end of the screen searching for a carriage-return
which was never written.  It was setting up the screen length
from a hard-variable which was wrong, before it knew what size
screen, before it knew what kind of terminal.  So, moved the
code & it works.  BUG Gone!  <Shot> with DDT!

Well, I was waiting to make sure all was ok with OSP, then when GREG

I guess I should just Delete *.* in OSFT and copy OSP into it, but I've
forgotten about how the "patch" files/mem files work, so I've been waiting
to talk to todd to make sure that that is ok.

If OSP and OSFT are supposed to be identical, (i think there-s a /J-1 or
some such out there???) then I will make the copy, otherwise, I'm not
sure what should get copied.

I think we need some accurrate document (list?) which says what should be
where.

Another announcement will be forthcoming, but chances are you will find
this one helpful in the meantime.  Due to the nature of the CT4/VUE editor,
and the problems of re-learning later, many massive changes have taken

(not quite complete) to Jim, but it turned out he left around 3 anyway.

I've left the current copy on your desk.  Not in yet are the following
Meta-X commands:  Next Window, Previous Window, Shrink Window, Enlarge
Window, Load Macro Slot, Major Mode, Set Mode Parameter, Terminal Type.
Copy Key is not on the list on Appendix B.  Appendices are not indexed
at all.  New section in Appendix A (Binding Functions and Macros) has
no descriptions.

Other than that (!) things are fairly well done.  It is 6:30, and Meg
is here, so I am leaving.  Have a good weekend.  I'll work more on
this, and the .dif file on Monday, if you haven't finished it all by
then.

Thanks GREG!  I need the encouragement.
I've really been depressed the past few days. (That's why I've been in

Note that in your VUEFIN.INI file, its SET MODE PARAMETER, not
parameters.

Ernie, whatever the correct name is is in the help message found in
the program M-X ?  types it directly from the table so the internal
document can't get too far out of date.   VUEFIN.INI was done on the spur

Bonjour,
   Once upon a time, Bernard mentioned that he was going to tell
us about some of the projects that SLIGOS was working on, including
the changes made to SCAN.MAC and WILD.MAC  (SCN7B & WLD7A).

    I was wondering if I could discover what some of those changes
to SCAN and WILD are.   Internally: I want to know if programs that
are written for the DEC TOPS-10 monitor need any specific changes,
or maybe re-compilation with a newer SCNMAC.UNV file.

   I have a few programs written for TOPS-10 and would like to use
the features that SLIGOS added for usernames.  Any information would
be helpful.  Feel free to reply to my queries in anglais or francais.
(If I don'd understand, I'll ask.)  Thanks. Carl.

  By the way, I am not in any hurry.  I would just like to someday
install some new DEC programs.

From: CARL

Re:  Shrink Window.
  It only works for multiple windows & in windows which are not
  the bottom window.
    It might be a good Idea to add.  

The old ^L command used to let you adjust the window size.  I didn't
know that anyone was using it, otherwize I'd have tried to leave it
in.  It needed some reworking, but I will plan on putting that back
into VUE.
-Carl.


From: SOCCI
Date: JUNE 2,1981 10:29
Grak. Shrinking window is great when you are at lo baud rate and are doing
large replaces, or searching a lot. Even at hi baud rate is sometimes
useful. So its definitely a good idea to add. Meanwhile, I'll just
try splitting window.

Please send mail to "VUE" or "YEUX" or both, for any suggestions or complaints
about VUE.  I'm compiling a wish list for things that people would like to see.
And as I get to them, those that seem to be most useful will be added in some
manner.  Either as major changes, (eg. the macros are a hack & need work),
or as settable options (eg. PAGE MODE, auto-save, etc.).

..other message...
  Dinner was nice, however.. I was very tired.. I also had too much to
drink.  No, I didn't get sick or anything, a few more beers and I would
have, but this morning I was quite stiff (drinking a lot tends to give
me a 'sort of' arthritis or simply 'stiff' joints. It goes away, but is
a 'pain' at times).

  I have been, as I said, quite depressed the past few (few?) days.  I don't
know what anyone can do to make much of a difference.  I like people a lot,
but...  once it gets to you, (meaning depressed or really lonely), there
doesn't seem to be much that anyone cares to do to 'help'.  Especially, the
ones who did the hurting, and they're the ones who have to help.  ironic?

C'est la vie.

From: CARL
Date: JUNE 4,1981 11:21
Documentation is on (*6news) on most systems that the new version is on.
I'm not sure if it's on 930 or not, but it will be.

C-X C-O was changed to C-X C-K to read a "killed" buffer.  C-X K (not
implemented yet) will be used to "kill" a buffer.  It will not put it
in the kill-buffer, but will simply disassociate it with your current
VUE session, such that (buffer).VUE is that buffer.

Things not in the help texts are not there because they have been
removed as commands.

Their definition of "blue-jeans" is blue-denim, thus white denim, corderoy
(however that is spelled) or anything else is fine.

There is a new version of EMPIRE on (GAMES).  The only significant
change is that it is no longer possible to accidently make
undesirable moves (e.g., dumping armies into the sea, grounding
ships, attacking your own pieces, etc.).  In fact, it is not possible
to deliberately make such moves, either.  There is one degenerate
case in which I was unable to determine whether the original version
of the program would do the undesirable, and therefore I did not
explicitly prevent it in the new version.  As an incentive for
EMPIRE addicts, whoever can successfully guess the nature of the
degenerate case AND determine the behaviour of the program in
said case wins a free lunch.  Happy EMPIREing...

On VUE:
There should be nothing missing from the META ? list.
All things on the list are installed.  All things not on the list
are not installed.  If you wish to point out differences in the
Meta-X name and the description name, fine, send them to VUE on 33 or
on 930, and eventually they will be taken care of.  90+% of them should
be correct.  Maybe 99%, anyway they changed a couple of times so some
didn't get caught.  For %2 they woill be right.  (whenever that happenns)

C-U C-X E does indeed seem to be broken.  When I get time, I will look
into it.  It seems to have gotten broken at the last minute before the
transmittal and could not hold up the release.  It will be fixed soon.
Killed buffers are the same as Olde buffers in every respect, thus, the
command was changed (C-X C-O will soon be implemented as kill blank lines,
thus it had to go away for awhile).  C-X C-K reads killed buffers and
C-X K will be used to Kill a buffer.

Oops.  Chuck was back with another question--and there is an error in the

now in VUE.  A '?' did get us the correct names, but the vue.doc needs
revising.  Specifically problem areas are "Right Margin for Justification"
and "Argument Multiplier" which are listed as "Margin for Justification"
and "Repitition Value for C-U".

VUE "was" everywhere, but the old CT4.SHR files were not "deleted", thus
the CT4 command ran the old FINE instead of the CT4.sav which runs VUE!.
So, it is now everywhere.  I just went and deleted all the old files.

Jean,
  I'm really sorry about this afternoon.  I really didn't mean to get
upset.  It wasn't your fault.  The "hassleing" over what/where to eat
lunch only bothered me superficially.  I was already upset & was trying
not to spoil things any more than they were with everything

From: DARREN
Date: JUNE 10,1981 22:12
The P034/J10 monitor has the interesting feature that WATCH, once set, can
only be cleared by command (i.e., it is not cleared when the job is created).
P034/J11 (currently waiting patiently in SYSTEM.SAV) does not have this
particular quirk.  I have been waiting with what I believe is generally
described as saintly patience for everyone to get the fuck off the system
so I can reload it.  If the WATCH display bothers you, you have two options
that immediately come to mind:
	1) type WATCH<cr>
which will clear the WATCH bits, or
	2) logoff so I can reload 930.
I am in fact supremely indifferent to your choice of solution at this point.
						/Darren


From: CARL
Date: JUNE 10,1981 22:19
...Ah... WATCH<cr> is equiv. to WATCH NONE ... now I see.
Anyway.  If you had wanted to reload it, all you need have done
was to run Takeit.  That usually gets people not doing something
of great importance OFF!
 ... By all means ...
TAKEIT!

-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: JUNE 12,1981 22:14
Mike,
	Since Greg is gone for the weekend I need someone to ask.
Do you have any idea which set of packs are supposed to be left up
on system 675 (vg-3)???

  After getting things running this afternoon, we still couldn't
get the system to come up on the "backup packs".  Todd & I found
the problem (Grrrrrr.  DSKCLN didn't have enough license!).  It is
now up & running on the backup packs, but I don't know if those packs
should be left up or not.

=Carl.


From: MCH
Date: JUNE 12,1981 22:31
Gee, I just don't know which packs should be up on that system.  I'd say
leave it running on the backup packs--but leave a big note where people can
see it warning them.  (Also maybe an access.msg.) 
What a dumb thing to have interfering with a major benchmark!!  A vote of
thanks to both you and Todd.					/Mike

From: TODD
Date: JUNE 13,1981 1:18
It doesn't matter which packs are in the VG3 sys.  The COMARS benchmark
will use another set of packs, I believe.  /Todd

From: CARL
Date: JUNE 13,1981 1:41
Well,
  In either case, I wanted to know which should be left up, just
so that the maintenance people would know.  All 512K is back up at
present.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: JUNE 13,1981 1:42
Mike,
   System 675 is back on the air.  Maintenance finished fixing the one
bad 64K board and it has been re-installed.  Hopefully it is fixed.
Memory diagnostics were running & made two complete passes before I
went over to reboot the system.  I suspect that the running monitor is
maybe a better diagnostic (assuming that the system is loaded?).

  Todd says that COMARS wil be using their own packs, so the backup or
`real` Tymcare packs won`t matter.  However, I left a big note on the
CTY.

  Also, it happenned once, but may end up as a problem?  One of the micro
nodes halted and potentially caused a few other circuits (mine anyway) to
be dropped.  I reloaded it & the KMC then had to reload the system.

No other problems.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: JUNE 13,1981 1:48
Todd,
    Maintenance has replaced the bad 64K board.  Memory diags ran
through two complete passes & then I brought up the monitor.  So, it
is up and running with 512K.  If you have time, maybe login and pound
on it a little.

I see you're back!
I trust that you had an enjoyable weekend.
Todd & I finally solved the problem with bringing up the Tymcare backup packs.
It was <stupid!>!!!
DSKCLN didn't have 'any' license, so it sat there waiting forever!
I put Todd, Darren, Carl & Lois on all three sets of packs.
(Well, you put most of the above on the 'real' packs for Tymcare.)
I put them on the backup packs.
Rocco came in yesterday to setup Ben's packs, I think for the benchmark?
Anyway, since they were up, I added the accounts & gave myself an OPER name.
Since I have to enter passwords, I didn't bother adding OPER names for the
rest of us.  All but LOIS have SETE passwords anyway.
Tell you more later.
We need to schedule more time with you and Adele and me.
Good Night!
Lois & Janice are supposed to wake me up at 9ish so I can come in to
go over the FRMOP stuff that Janice wants.
The rest of the day is unscheduled except for miscellaneous consulting.
I still haven't finished writing up the specifications for the LIBRARY
program for Scott.  Will pass it out to you, Tim, Scott, Dmitry, Lois &
Bill when it is done.  Scott & I decided to pass it out & do it 'right'
the first time.  (Even if it means it takes awhile to be 'finished'!).
I would have done some 'real' work, except that I don't trust the
network with all this line noise.  Node 1306 seems really flakey.  Since
you had trouble & I know both Mike & I did, it can't be Ma Bell (completely).
All of us (Mike, Scott, Bill & I) are all on the "96x" exchange group in
Mountain-View, so ot was feasible to assume Ma Bell has a hand in the noise.
Again, Good Night!!!

Darren,
    The File (CARL:930)EMPIRE.BAD is an EMPIRE.DAT file which appears to
"hang".  I have nearly decimated the enemy & was killing off my armies
using "random" mode.  Could you see if you can fix the problem?

Random Mode also seems to have problems.  Armies put into random mode
while completely surrounded by land (for squares & squares) seemingly
drown themselves on their first or second move.

This has the side effect of screwing the internal map?  (or so it seems),
because after a few such "random" encounters, I had a few of my ships
"break-up on the shore" while in the middle of the ocean.

     I like what I see so far in the 2020 Spooler Design Spec.
     I think it would be good to have LPREQ handle the proposed function
of LPQ on systems other than the "host" (with printer).  LPREQ could
start the telecopy frame when a user submits a request as LPQ does now.
There is still no reason for the user to wait for its completion.  LPREQ
might give a status report by starting at telecopy frame to retrieve the
spool queue from the host, waiting for its completion (with the user given
a message to be patient), and reporting the results.  Hopefully the queue

will not be so large that this is a problem.

Hi.
  Check for me on 118 to find my whereabouts, I'll probably be at
Tymshare.  I want to do a little work & I can't work with this
crummy node... "<del>" characters are too destructive & it's making
me very angry at TYMNET!
  If you're interested in trying to do anything, doesn't have to be
as big as a picnic or anything, give me a ring.  (I just want to be
doing something... life is becoming too overbearing).

Well, it depends.  I think that it's mostly bad ports into 446-7309.
Most of the time I have much better luck with the Mtn. View node (a
bit noisy, but nothing like the other).			/Mike

From: MCH
Date: JUNE 21,1981 1:52
Yep.  I'd been working coming in via 49-0330 though Mtn. View seems to
have gone down.  Coming in through 44-7309 is impossible (as you can
see).  /Mike

I renamed two of the files which you had queued to be printed on
the 118 printer into your directory on 118.  When the printer gets
regular paper in it again, feel free to rename it back to (LPQ) so
it will be printed.

I'm very sorry to hear about Ranjit.  (I really am.)  Todd had told me that
you had received some bad new, but didn't say what.  Try and cheer up.  
know it's not easy to do, but feeling bad about it won't change it.

Sure, about the bridge  (@#^&^&%$# network noise!). 

And HEY!!! I want you to know that I do think about you.  I care about
you, (now cheer up this instant, there's no use both of us being depressed!),
but I do have my own depression to fight with.  I could make you laugh, or
cry, but I can't help myself.   I almost called you this morning, but it
was too early.

The only words of wisdom I can give are, don't be alone, you'll only stay
depressed.  Go out and do something, be with people.

At least someone that can dosomething??  This is tottally unacceptable.
If <del> doesn't delete a char, it is a break or illegal char and it's
difficult to type a single line without error.  Bill's LNTEST progrm is
fine, but it types the entire line <zap> so he noisedoesn't have time to

There is a Tymnet customer service number.  Get your port number, etc.
and report it.  NOTE:  If you ALWAYS get bad service from home, it might
be TPC rather than Tymnet.  Some of the ports on 1306 (if that's the one
you're using) are bad, and others are very good.          /Mike

From: MCH
Date: JUNE 22,1981 0:56
Tonight, you're getting caught by two things:  Several of the customer
systems do their ALLFILES Sun. night.  And several systems have been off
because of the power problems.  The latter problem will eventually go
away when Fremont is a going center.  
I'll bet that they added as much stuff as they could handle during the
winter and are now finding out that they are way over what they can handle
for power and air in this heat spell.  
You could be stuck, like most MAGNUM people, with a username ONLY on 33.

I am going to write a letter to both of them and let them know that
you had called & ask them, that even if they won't talk to me, to
call you.  I feel that this whole situation is ridiculous, that I'm
the only one who is really tormented and suffering because of it.

tape drive without much success (Tuesday).  I think we now have one "valid"

Negative.  When I last used 930 standalone, there were both microcode and

also the 2nd).  Whenever someone manages to produce good tapes, it might be
wise to also make at least one backup copy of each (kept OUTSIDE the F3
room). /Darren
