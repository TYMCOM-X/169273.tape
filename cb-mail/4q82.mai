Gack!!!!  SAIL generates abysmal code....

  If count > 0 and
     0 < Index_ getgdf(count) and     ! notice the _____;
     0 neq GDFrec[Index,Request] and
     GDFMATCH and
     Rsdate leq !lh(GDFrec[Index,Date])
   then mumble;

generates: skipn rsnum;  jrst around;
           skipg count;  jrst around;
           push p,count; pushj p,getgdf;
           jumpe 1,around;			should be movem 1,index;
	   move 3,Gdfrec; move 4,index;			  jumpe 1,around;
 	     imul 4,-2(3); add 4,-10(3);

	      caml 5,RSDATE; jrst around;
	....some setup...

It ***NEVER*** assigned the value from GETGDF(COUNT) to INDEX!!!
and of course, the next 2 or 3 checks depend on that!!! YUK!

930's tape drive seems to have a problem in that it writes tapes no one

boot from tape).

Since it was recently fixed, (yesterday) and the work done on it today,
it NOW appears to read and write correctly.  Tapes written on it may be
read by the TU45 on the 2020 and vicea-versa(*).

* Under TOPS-20 the system-default blocking factor is 512 words.  PIP on
TYMCOM-X seems to only want to read 128 blocks.  So, you must change the
blocksize on TOPS-20 to 128 before writing the tape.  Otherwise, they are
compatible.

Re: LISTER/FORTRAN fix

Ummm, I have fixed two problems in LISTER, both pertaining to 1/3 page
Carriage-Control printing (VT printing).  The is "ONE" outstanding fix
which has not yet been implemented.  However, it appears the original
complaint from CEGI is really a FORTRAN-10 "bug/feature".  F40 does not
produce the same output file as FORTRAN-10.

  On blank lines, i.e. "/" carriage control, F40 produces <space><crlf>
and FORTR^aAN-10 produces <crlf> only.  LISTER expects to find a character of some
kind on the line and thus uses the CR part of CRLF as that token.  Then,
it scans for the next <CRLF>, thus combining each // into a single /.

  I will fix this in LISTER.  However, it should be noted and ducumented
somewhere for F40 ==> FORTRAN-10 users!!!!!!

(He was in the show last year.)  So, Fremont is too far a jaunt just
for fiche.  I am going to send a batch request to test it tonight
and hopefully we will see the results tomorrow.

Progress:  I have found & fixed the PERP/DEFER problem with 1983 dates.
           I have also noticed another problem (system # is read as the
           first 2 digits, i.e. 930 is thought to be system 93) which I
           will fix by using the proper GETTAB (new in /H) Hmmm, except
           under the lockheed switch since it isn't there there.

           On my own, at Mike's suggestion, I am goin gto resolve the
           problem with system to run vs. system submitted by creating
           a file (SYS)PERP.SYS which contains pointers to master-perp
           system #'s for each system (0-255).

           should be able to transmit it tomorrow, (which starts in 2 or
           so minutes)).

TYMUSE problem - Consultation with Ed Imsland .. we have narrowed down
           source location of the problem.  Ed is looking for sources &
           talking to MIS about it now.  My work is almost done there.

...OOPS!  Sorry about that.  It's the same old LINK bug which I

supposed to be:
    .JBHCR/  highest-nonzero-lowseg-addr ,, highest-lowseg-core-addr
and it generates:
    .JBHCR/  highest-nonzero-lowseg-addr ,, 0

a PCOM command file.  I've changed the command file to just do a
LOAD @file

	Yes, but it depends on the whether the sendee is at command level
or not. The way the "TALK TTYnnn" command works is that a check is first
made to determine if either sender or sendee is an Operator, and if so,
then the message is sent immediately. If neither is an Operator, then a
check is made to see at what level the sendee is working at, and if they
are at command level, then the message is sent. If neither is an Operator
and the sendee is not at command level, then a check is made to see if the 
sender has opr license, and if he/she does, then the message is sent. How-
ever, if they don't have opr license at that time, then a message will be
displayed on the sender's terminal stating "?busy". I'll put a copy of the
pertinent code on your desk.
	By the way, I'll probably want to talk with you this afternoon to
go over the changes to the SWEET.MAC program that I've made and to ask you
some questions. I've also been unable to transfer it so far to 84, and

Re: PEAK monitor command
To behave like an editor to RPG, peak simply needs to be put into
RPG and the monitor needs to be told to run RPG instead of PEAK.

Currently, PEAK does "NOT" go through RPG at all.  The monitor runs
the PEAK program directly, and PEAK reads and writes it's own EDS
and EDT files.   It's trivial to add it to the monitor, but RPG would
need some work to learn how to cope with the switches /READONLY, etc.

If you seriously want to have PEAK go through RPG, then I think that
you, I, Adele, and possibly Bill (or Scott) should go over the existing
switches which can be passed to an editor on the command line (if any),
for EDITOR and EDIT10 and PEAK, and then we'll change RPG to know about
"editors" per se, and allow you to set your EDITOR as well as to have
commands such as PEAK, MODIFY, VUE, EDIT, CREATE, MAKE, TECO do the
right thing.  We need to be able to "override" which editor also, a la
(DED)FTPEAK, (YEUX)VUE, (FTSYS)TECO, (EMACS)TECO, etc... a la...
"CTEST SET EDITOR mumble".

I am not averse to doing the RPG work.  In fact, I'd like to do it!
It would give me a change to do the groundwork for adding the stuff
necessary for "CTEST SET MAIL-SYSTEM <read>,<send>"...

Carl,
Was it you who pointed out to me that RPG passes switches of the form
"%<switch>" on to the concerned program?  It certainly works with the
"%p" switch in PEAK.

Date: NOVEMBER 18,1982 23:36
Hmmmm....  %<switch>   I think I verified that, but you noticed that
yourself, .. anyway, I'm pretty sure that PEAK doesn't go through RPG.
-Carl.


From: CARL

No!  PEAK does not run RPG (I just checked in the monitor code).
So, PEAK must handle %<sw> or ignore the % or some such!

Re: PERP, Help!

I am stymied... I need more information about what is happenning
with PERP.   The version of PERP build for Lockheed is apparently
creating the AUX circuit fine, (CREAUX returns a port), and then
the circuit is simply "going away" before PERP gets a chance to do
anything with it.

  With DDT, I followed the code, CREAUX returns a port, the first

SKIPINL-style Auxcal gets a failure return... AUXRED says that
there are no circuits.  There is very little code in between
which simply types "<cr><cr>" then "<crlf>1GPERP<crlf>" then
goes to wait for input, where it error-returns and there is no
circuit at that time!!!

  Any pointers of where to look?  What to look for?   Is the
master perp controller dropping the circuit?  None of this code
has changed!

Re: Lockheed PERP/DEFER

Whew!!!!!
Earlier tonight.. (tonight?), anyway...  I sent you mail
because I couldn't find anythng wrong with the Lockheed
version.  The circuit builds correctly, etc.. etc... then,
"magically" went away.

If I had not been "Tymshare", I'd have never found the problem.
....(which means I found it.  The lockheed version works FINE.)...
The circuit problem was that it could build the circuit out to
just about anywhere, but the sup would zap it, if it didn't go
to system 8.   By updating PERP.SYS to use system 8 for ALL users
the problems that we thought were there VANISHED!

Re: Backpressure and programs which turn it on and off

If a program (such as VUE, possiby PEAK) turns off backpressure
from the terminal via (AUXCAL (.AxRVX)) while the terminal is
backpressured (i.e. the user typed ^S before the program starts)
then there doesn't seem to be a way for the user to turn off

and the code assembles fine for the F3.  I'll leave it for Darren
or the final transmittal build to check it for the KI, KL and KS.
(There shouldn't be any suprizes.  Since I didn't change the KS
stuff and that's all that's different in the help messages.)  The
ONCDSK dialogue is now called the FILES dialogue "everywhere"!

Joan,
  Adele has pre-empted my time to work on a a routine which does
something similar to what I was talking to you about.  This means
that I will get back to you when I have the routine ready for you
to use.

  At present, you will need to provide the following:

  1. A channel (which you have already openned using "OPEN").
  2. A file-specification in the form "(user)file.ext".

eg.
  Integer Chan;
  OPEN( Chan _ Getchan, "DSK", '17, 0,0, 0,0, EofVariable );
  "string-result" _ FData( Chan, Filename );

  If Filename cannot be found, the result will be "******" otherwise
  the result will be: XXXXXX,sss,ppp,llllll,dddddd,tttttt
  where
    XXXXXX is the checksum
    sss    is the file size in words
    ppp    is the "octal" protection code
    llllll is the "octal" license word
    dddddd is the creation date in tymshare format
    tttttt is the creation time in tymshare format

any input you have as to a clean and consistant way of solving it.  If
you didn't hear all of the background, let me know and I will fill you

you are, because apologies go a long way, but never quite as far as if
it never happenned.  I'm glad that you care enough to try and keep

That is (semi)great news.  I thought you must be working on the printer when
I logged in on Saturday and discovered you were working on lpq.  It certainly
is a step from no printer at all, but the loss of data is both puzzling and
could be quite irritating.  Getting printer support surely seems to be a

I believe that I will stay home today.  I'm still coughing too much.
(hacking actually, but not the computer-ese term.)

I got up to finish my timesheet.  (Done!)  History records may be a
little long.  I didn't try too hard to make them more concise today.

Progress was made with the printer. (as you may have heard).  There
is a version of LPTSPL which talks to aux-circuits now and should
work.  However, at present we have "no" way of telling if the printer
is on-line or off-line, and so we either send data to a "live" device
or we send data to the bit bucket.  Hope to have that remedied later
in the week.  I saw "no" lossge of data during actual file output.
If the files began printing, it seems to have finished.  Zapping the
circuit and re-building it seems to affect the printer by turning it
"off-line".  {Nasty}.

More later.  See you... I'm going to try to go back to bed for awhile.
I hope to be in tomorrow... I'm scheduled for the support line in the
morning... we'll see if I make it at all tomorrow.

vivian,
  i need to talk to you about DUSAGE.  I played around a little with
a copy of USAGE1.SAI which I copied to my directory and got some ver
amazing results.

  First, I did some research and found out that you really don't
need to lookup every file in a user's directory to find out his disk
usage.  (that is, assuming that you don't care about "age'd" files).

  Second I modified USAGE1 to take advantage of this, and the speed
improvement is that instead of 10 minutes (middle of the night run)
it takes about 25 seconds.  [Nice, huh?]!!!

  Third, I have a question about the dates that you are checking.
Please come and talk to me about it when I come in on Tuesday.

  Your program works GREAT!!  Congratulations!!!

Adele,
  Progress report:

1.  The printer still needs some work.  Dennis and I will have to
    collaborate some more.  He had to leave early, so we didn't get
    a whole lot done.

2.  I've made some major modifications to dave's FILSCN routines and
    renamed them MFDSCN (since that's their real function).  FILSCN
    still exists for die-hards, but ought to go away.  My changes may
    actually slow it down a little rather than speed it up, however
    the package is much more useable and slightly more general now.

3.  I discovered that Vivian's program (DUSAGE) does not need to do
    all the work that it's been doing.  Unless we want to do file aging
    it can just lookup the UFD's in question and get the necessary
    info from the value of .RBUSD in the long lookup block.  I have a
    modified copy of her program which takes 25 seconds for Gan 3 on
    930 rather than 10 minutes.  Of course, if aging is requested it
    will take 10 minutes!

4.  Barring disaster in the morning, I should be coming in.  My cold
    is still doing better than I am, but I am at least functional now,
    which is an improvement.  (Are we going to have a meeting today?)

We appear to have a working printer.  It does go off-line, and may
lose some data if it does at the wrong time.  Dennis has set it up
to give me an indication (a yellow ball) when this happens.  Data
lossage will go away as soon as I figure out how to determine what
was actually output before it went off-line (network delays and all
that don't make it too obvious).

The "write-ring-on-the-run-button" trick will also produce reliable
printing, however it could cause a catastrophy.  The printer appears
work well otherwise.  It is now running, and files put into (LPQ)
should magically be printed.  I will put in a logging feature and
attempt to flag files which lost data, possibly for re-printing in
a later release.
-Carl.


From: CARL

Bill,
  Port status messages (tymnet dialout stuff) was never implemented
as far as Dennis can tell, so that appears to be out.  He's sending
me a yellow ball when it goes "off-line" at present.  But, that doesn't
really help determine what was printed---so I can continue exactly
where I left off.  I could print a trailer--followed by a header and
a partial re-print of the offending file, but that isn't very elegant.

All suggestions are welcome.  I'm going to find out if Dennis can send
me something to say that it is "back ON-LINE" again... but that only
solves the "when to send next" problem.
-Carl.

(PS I'm talking about the PRINTER in the lab.)


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 15,1982 2:44
Dennis,
  Polling seems to lose too much data.  I gave up and put in the
interrupt code, which seems to work a little better.  It prints OK.
It does keep going off-line and not for paper-out.  The indicator
whcih keeps lighting up is paper-Jam.

  Since it knows now when it goes off-line... is there a ball you
could send me to tell me it want back on-line???  Even an orange
ball might be acceptable (since that's what I was waiting for when
it went off-line), if just to tell me that the data which was in
the pipe is now output.

  Also, I'm not sure it is backpressuring.  It seemed to lose
data... If you stop by later today I can show you.  At one point
Ken lost 5-7 pages of printed data...

(with the polling version), however I lost a few lines... pretty much
because I sent a line and then sent more after it timed out...

Whats another message type anyway, it must be a simple thing.  There are
4 bits in a PSM, I suggest picking 4 interesting bits from the printer
status and having him send a PSM whenever any of them change.  This is
really what the message is for.  I very strongly objeqYct to sending
a yellow ball, that is gross.  The user always sees the most recent PSM
data.  They won;t pile up.  Anyway, why doesn't he just backpressure when
it goes offline.  You can always send a gobbler if you don't like it, or
zap the circuit.     -Bill

Carl, I have removed the comparisons with the left side of the ppn
from the if statements in "wantufd" in Dusage.sai.  Now  when I 
run the program with no input file, Dusage.rpt gives me a long
list of users, some of which have different gans than mine (I
have found gan 4,1,and 7 ). I thought mfdscn only allowed the
program operators gan in the search???----program operators gan in the search???----

Vivian,
  MFDSCN allows you to look at the ENTIRE disk, not just your own GAN.
You have to have that !lh( xxx ) comparison or you will get everyone
on the system and not just your own gan.  That is a MUST!, especially
if this program is to be used by COEES or any of our customers.

PS.  Why did you remove the comparisons?
-Carl.

Bill,
  I realize what the yamm and tymcom-x say about port status messages.
Dennis says that TYMNET didn't implement the message type and if we ever
want to be able to send to this printer from other than 930 (a strong
possibility when he finishes his tymnet-II code for the uNode) then it
has to be something that the network can pass and a user program can
receive on any host.
  Anyway, the printer is not on 552 and there's no message type for it
is what dennis said.  I'm sure that it could be rigged together, but that
is more of a hack then it's worth.  I will talk some more to dennis and
see what we can come up with.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 15,1982 15:19
Dennis,
  Bill really thinks we should be getting a port status message instead
of a yellow ball... anyway, I relayed what you said about it not being
implemented and told him we'de work something out.  I converted over to
intrrupts now, so you really can send me anything.  This thing about
backpressure must be solved though... data lossage is not good, especially
if it cannot be detected (as to what exactly was lost) and It is a little
ridiculous to send a character at a time followed by a yellow ball.
-Carl.

I meant that Dusage calls mfdscn using a mask(!Xwd(!lh(usegan).  I
thought that this mask specifies that only the gan (usegan) of the
program user is allowed.---Vivian

From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 16,1982 0:03
The only "real" danger is what happens if the paper does "jam" or the
printer does run out of paper.  then it will not be too good on the
print-heads.  Otherwise, unless hardware can stop it from being so
"flakey" we don't have much choice... (I somehow expect that the har-
ware people aren't going to be much help, considering the state of
two other printers -- 1 in VG3 and 1 in the MIS print-room.)
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: DECEMBER 16,1982 0:22
Vivian,
  Ok... this is the way it is.  The MFD/UFD mask word is documented
such that the use of '*' means to wildcard the entire field and the
use of '#' will wildcard 6 bits worth of a field.  Now... "nothing"
is said about other values and it may be poor taste to try anything
else.  This means that you can't ferret out a single gan using this
method (or at least not easily).

  In the case of Gan-3 which we 'happen' to be, we saw some very
special action taken.  Ascii "#" is '43, Sixbit "#" is '03 and thus
CVSIX("######") := '030303030303 or !Xwd( '030303, '030303 ).  Now
if I make make myself painfully clear, gan-3 is '000003 and we were
searching for !Xwd( gan3, '030303 ) or !Xwd( '03, '030303 ) which
is sixbit "  ####".  That is why you picked out gan 4 and gan 7 as
well as gan 3 in your other program.
-Carl.

This means that you must check for gan!

IF THE PRINTER GOES OFF-LINE WHILE PRINTING, YOUR JOB
HALTS.  THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN WHEN YOU RUN IT CONNECTED TO LPTSPL
ANT IT DOES NOT DETACH.  IF IT IS DETACHED AND YOU ATTACH IT
AND THEN STOP THE PRINTER YOU GET AN ILL MEM REF AT 2.
IF YOU DON'T ATTACH IT AND LOOK AT IT WITH FRMDDT IS IS STOPED
AT 3.

From: CARL

Dennis,
  I pretty much noticed those things you mentioned about AUXSPL.
But since I haven't been to the office for 2 days, it's been pretty
hard to diagnose without knowing the printer state.  Anyway, we
dp need to talk about what you send me and what you don't.  Bill says
that the dial-out nodes actually do send port status messages, and
maybe that is what you should send.  (the pc=2 vs 3 is an F3 bug, not
a program bug... the f3 always reports the pc as pc-1).   Anyway, that's
sure possible in an interrupt environment.  At present I didn't write
any protective code for what happens when it goes off-;ine except to
keep trying yellow-balls... I really do need an interrupt which says
it's back on-line though!!!!!

It might be easiest to give me a call.  Reach me at home this evening,
just not too late please -- before 9.  The password stuff for COEES will
require some PASCAL & FORTRAN callable routines to run the modules that
Bill is working on to do the password changes.  It would need some
coordination with Bill (and I haven't spoken to him yet), but Mike and I
think that would be a good one for you to work on.  It's also turning out
to be very high priority -- higher than the RPG stuff.  Probably getting

Ref: TITO data header garbage
It's TITO's problem, but only on typeout.  Someone originally decided
that the system version would fit into 2 words & on most systems it
does.  On 930, it doesn't, so I increased it.  It didn't work 'cause
that changed the data header.  So the last version I released I left
the data header intact, but changed the parameter to type it out right.
I obviously overlooked the same parametrer in the print directory part.
I guess that TITO will just get re-released again. {sigh}

Ken and chia have uncovered an "old" tito bug which just surfaced
again due to oversight.  I will have to re-release another TITO

Peak Lovers:
   The current version of PEAK does not lock the buffer upon reading your
PEAK.INI file.  The result you will probably see is that  a bunch of 
CRLFs will appear at the top of your file.  You can prevent this by explicitly
locking your buffer at the beginning of your INI file (using ^X-) and
unlocking it at the end of your INI file (using ^X+) (Note that you should
not follow ^X+ with a CRLF unless you want it inserted).  This is somewhat
inconvenient, but a lot more consistent with the normal execute command file
function (^X^L), such that you can execute your INI file anytime with the
same effect.

F.Y.I.  Pat Knorr called with two problems that really are old ones, but
the new version has not been transmitted.  They are getting a lot of customer
calls on the lister problem--most Valley Forge systems are running 16 (but
72 is running 15).  16.1 is only on :33.  Also TITO 16.3 has not been
transmitted yet so they are still having the problem of garbage being printed
following the header on a directory.  Adele was going to call Dave Miller re
all this, but I thought you would like to know since they are your fixes.

...which lister problem?  the day of week wrong in the header?

..... both lister and tito have been archived & transmitted ...
they may not yet "be" everywhere, but they have been x-mitted.
-Carl.

(besides, I've already told Dave Miller what the changes were &
 to put TITO out, so hmmm. guess it's best to have adele tell them.)

Yes, the day of the week wrong in the header.  A lot of people must use that
as Valley Forge Operations says they have had a lot of calls. (which could mean
almost anything).

Adele did call, and it is Ed Imsland that is sitting on them.  She is going to
try to get lister transmitted at least.

I guess, that it needs to be pointed out on the transmittal form
what kind of customer impact each change will have, especially in
cases like the most recent LISTER and TITO transmittals.

If things get reported right away, and fixed right away, but then
the fixed version gets "SAT" on, then the customers will begin to
think that we're really poor about fixing things.

I called Ed Imsland this morning and urged that LISTER be put up right
away.  I checked on three products that are a problem, TAPE, LISTER, and
TITO.  He said that he had not put them up because he was going on
vacation next week, and there would be nobody around to field questions
that came in.  I pointed out that in the case of LISTER, operations has
been getting calls from customers; therefore, at the least, it should be
put up right away.  He told me he would do that one.		/Adele

To the Section:

Beginning next Monday we will again sign for supplies to the supply room and
they will be billed back to our cost center.  I am going to stock up on a few
things this afternoon:  manilla file folders, binder dividers, pens, and
pads of paper (white, no holes--they no longer stock punched pads).

If there is anything else you need, let me know.  If anyone needs binders,
Dorothy in the library has many used ones.  I did pick up some for us.

...sounds good.  (LISTER)

anyway, while it's on my mind... There don't really seem to be
any guidelines for filling out transmittals.  We seem to end up
"imitating" what appears on old transmittals without really
knowing what/why/...etc. anything is or isn't part of each old
transmittal.

If such a thing exists?  If not, then I propose that we take
the time (now? next week...) to put together a document that
shows what "we" want to have as a standard transmittal procedure.
Especially with 2 new people, 3 new people? ... anyway, this
will then take the burden of having to re-teach the same or
nearly the same "mistakes" to the next new person, from each
of us.

And my point about including a note to software distribution
about customer impact, ought to be included in the document.

Bill,
  I read through PASSWOrd.DOC and have only one question: Is it
possible to pass the terminal to the frame/program with an indefinate
time limit?  (It's not clear).  A time limit of 0 in the !lh(flags)
ought to mean "indefinate", then it'd be a snap to call an editor or
some such program and have it exit back when done.  Also, it might be
a good idea to (optionally) print a message on the terminal "IF" the
time limit is exceeded and the terminal is "forcibly" taken back.
-Carl.

  Otherwise, it looks good... I haven't heard back from Carl Holmberg,
so I'll call him on Monday.  --Happy New Year--

  Call me if anything comes up, etc.

Bill,
  DO you have any explanation for why a job would get "killed"
due to a tymnet disconnect?  Uh... that is, a job which is setup
initially with "detach on disconnect - no time out - continue
running" in the LUD and I suspect also in the job priv word.
This has happenned to me a number of times recently on system 930.
I think it has happenned elsewhere too, but don't remember for sure.

  The last 2 times, I was editing and got either a "please log in:"
or "UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU..." ad finitum from the node, and each
time when dialing back in, found that I had the same job slot that
I previously had with no job to attach to.. a la, lost my editing
since the last checkpoint anyway...

re: microfiche

  I found out yesterday morning that Fremont Ops had notified MIS
and various other organizations that they would stop processing all
requests for microfiche after January 1st.  {I believe that we were
not included on that notification list}.  However, since we provide
our data in a different format than everyone else, we "may" be
excluded... This should be verified with Glenn Rees on Monday morning.

  I spoke with Rick Daniels yesterday (the 31st) and it was his under-
standing that the microfiche equipment will be "gone" on the 14th, so
shutting down will occur sooner, thus the January 1st cutoff date...

  Thus, if we want TOPS-20 listings on FICHE, "someone" needs to get
moving on producing the listings and output files to be written to
tape.  I am going to be busy rebuilding listings for 272 archived
FDM files, so will not have much time to devote to TOPS-20.  It would
be "nice" to get a listing of the ISI tape too.
-Carl.

Update on microfiche... until further notice, fremont ops has
directions to still process microfiche requests from the following
four (4) usernames: CARL, LOIS, KEN and ADELE.  This may all change
on monday, but as for now, that's the way it is.

Hi... Happy holidays!

I might like to arrange for some help with the fiching... on account
of the time constraints.  Let me know what can be fit into everyone's
schedule of priorities.

I've finished all of the "old" MFICHE files, and 27 of 272 products
which made a total of 90 separate fiche files so far.  I'll keep you
posted.  -Carl

See you tomorrow.

Chia,
  The TS program had an index error caused by a type-o in the
date calculation routine.  I fixed it and put the new version
up on (MPL) where the old one was.  [Isn't that supposed to be
moved to (SPL)?]  Anyway, you have mail on system 36, and it
says to look at (MPL)TS.DIF to see what I changed.  The copy
on your directory has not been updated, so please copy it again
from (MPL).  -Carl.
