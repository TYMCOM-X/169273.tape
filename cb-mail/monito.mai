Subject: BAT blocks broken 

I'm getting complaints about bad spots that keep coming up.  897 (F3) is
being plagued right now by a couple that keep getting reallocated.  It
seems that the BAT block mechanism doesn't work.  There is code in the
monitor that is supposed to put bad blocks that it comes across into BAT.SYS
so they won't be reused.  Either it doesn't know how or doesn't care.  I
suggest this might be easy to fix if it were looked in to.  Its priority
is questionable since on KI,KL they can just copy the bad pack out.  On
systems like 897, 930 with fixed media, it is more serious.  An alternative
would be to take a program which scans the whole disk looking for bad blocks
and building BAT.SYS - I started to write such a tool and its beginnings are
in (WRS)RERR.

In fact there are several programs in various stages of completeness:
   (WRS:930)
	FNDBAD		scans all UFD's for bad files (ones marked bad)
	RERR		scans structure page by page looking for hard(soft) err
	DP		prints disp pages for all files in a directory
			and some nice statistics about storrage (try it!)
	DSTAT		similar to DP but will scan whole system - some of
			the statistics seem to be broken
	BAT		lists the contents of (SYS)BAT.SYS in meaningful form
These programs were never put in (MPL) since they were never finished and
tested.

Subject: MACRO53 bug 

WAYSYS is defind in UUOCON as 400, J as 2.
SWPMXL and SWPTBL are external, defined in COMMON, with SWPMXL=7000.
At NUMTAB+13 in UUOCON is the line
	XWD SWPMXL+WAYSYS,SWPTBL(J)

Old MACRO generates 000402* 000000* so that LINK will add 7000 to 402 and
sets the LH to 007402.

New MACRO generates 000002# 000000* and the POLISH tells LINK to add 7000
to 400, store 007400 in the LH of NUMTAB+13 and in the LH of location 2.

DEC fixed this problem by defining the entries in NUMTAB as:
	XWD SWPMXL+WAYSYS+J,SWPTBL

I found the problem by single stepping the store at SY.CHL, and saw that
it was changing 2,,5260 to 7400,,5260 but MDDT says it should be 7402,,5260.

Subject: performance and 4meg 

Just thinking...I wonder how many times somebody does a linear search of
the PGY table.  I can't help but think that performance on 39 isn't what it
should be -- things get slow and I do a HOG and there isn't really anything
running that I would think should make it that slow.  A linear search could
take as long as 75 mS!  If we do one every time a page is mapped, that's
about twice as long as it takes to actually read the page off disk!!!  I
thought you might want to check it out some time.  -Bill

PS - 75 mS ~= 4096 x 2 x 9.16uS based on 12-13 memory references per loop

Just thinking.... I think that the PGY table is "cached"... does that
mean that every time it does a PGY table sweep, it clears all of cache
by putting the PGY table into the cache!

Also, what if we uncache the PGY table... does that mean that since the
KL reads 4 words at a time, linear searches would be slower if it's not
cached... 4 times slower, having to read 4 words again and again?

Suggestions?  Comments?

want it to have all the bells and whistles using SWITCH.INI it'd be
so much easier to keep LOGINN in MACRO.  I'm planning on hacking DECs
latest LOGIN and putting the pieces directly into our LOGINN to do

changing the case and re-formatting LOGINN.  Getting done...

Subject: SYSTAT and the phantom jobs (A Hardy Boy's Mystery) 

Somebody at Tymnet just saw a SYSTAT showing some job logged in to user
(INFORMATION) and GFD'd to (CNFE) - in annother GAN!  INFORMATION is the
no password account used to get network access and marketing data.  It
uses PV.RCM and PV.LOS (logout on stop).  Anyway, a scan of the stream
indicated GFD was never run from that user name.  So much for that.  But
what about the SYSTAT?

It is possible, since the SYSTAT program does not do any concurency
control (sigh), that what was seen was the result of a sequence such as:

	job 1 logs in as (INFORMATION)
	job 2 does SYSTAT
	job 2 SYSTAT GETTAB's job 1's AUN: (INFORMATION)
	job 2 is dismissed for quantum expired
	job 1 logs out
	job 1 logs in as (CNFE)
	job 2 SYSTAT GETTAB's job 1's PPN: (CNFE)
	job 2 SYSTAT compares AUN to PPN, finding different, shows
		job 1 as being logged in to (INFORMATION) and GFD'd
		to (CNFE), when in reality this state never existed.

This is really a SYSTAT TSR suggesting that SYSTAT always gettab the
universal process ID before and after gettabing all other information
about each job.  If the first process id isn't the same as the last,
it should do a SLEEP 0 and loop.  The SLEEP 0 enhances its chance of
getting all the way through the next time without being dismissed.

Unfortunately, its not that simple when talking about files, since
the file data is obtained in a different order than the job information.
A more complex scheme is required, but beyond the scope of a TSR.

Please forward this to the appropriate person(s).

I suspect that the appropriate person(s) in this case is me.  I also
suspect that this will just have to be a restriction in SYSTAT since
mucking around reading JBT tables via GETTAB works regardless of the
fact that a job is even logged in...  checking universal program idx
sounds ok, but may vary too much even for correct information about
a job ('cept for things like core and jbtnam... sigh)
  Maybe the best solution is a JOBINF UUO that returns gobs of data
about a job, potentially locking down the job's UPT to get that info
too... [futureistically speaking of course].  Anything else could put
SYSTAT into an infinate loop if a "careless" process decided to run
many many many separate programs, 1page or so, .SHR files to speed
page activation, etc...  SYSTAT might never be able to GETTAB everything
fast enough?

It's a good idea to make sure it all assembles on each processor after
any major set of changes.  BUT it is a bit of over-kill for every change.
Make sure it works on 930 and all the code works... then try it out on
each CPU.  If you change any MACROs in S, then try it on all, but just
making a code change in non-processor-dependant areas will work on all if
it works on one...  DEFINATELY make sure it works on any that we give to
ANY customer machine!!!!

Subject: FCR.E+4 crashes 

I've taken a preliminary look at all of them.  There is no set pattern
except for the function which they were attempting to execute.

FCR.E+4 is reached when there is either an FCREATE (VCREATE UUO) or
MAPPING (CHANIO FUNCTION .CHMFP) error.  In the crash case, it is clear
that the code first does a CREATE-FILE-PAGE then attempts to map that
same file page into memory.  That MAP is what appears to be failing.

I've patched all the systems which have this crash occurring to capture
the UUO AC before it clears the page number part.  Without the page #
in monitor memory it is difficult to verify that the page already exists
in memory...  I await the next crash!   {Sigh}.

It doesn't really matter what names are chosen, but I have been using a

from the description.  For instance, all STOPCDs in F3TSER, MAGSER, and FTASER
start with "MTA".  All in LPTSER start with "LPT".  Some in PICON start with
"APR" for conditions detected via APR interrupt, others have "PAG" if it is
a page fault or inconsistancy in the UPT.  Any that I put in SCNSER will use
the prefix "TTY".

For the one that are referenced via STOPCD(,XCT,name), I have been putting
"name::" in front of the full definition just to make it obvious to the code
reader that a global lable is being defined here.

Today I logged in at 11:05am.  I went into a full-screen editor, and remained
there until 1:05pm.  When I exitted, I got a directory listing, then logged off.
I immediately logged back in because I had forgotten to type out a particular
file.  When I logged in at 1:06pm, I received the message that I had mail
waiting.  It was from the message you sent at 11:23am.  I had received the
period prompt at least 3 times since the message had been sent, but in all
three cases the monitor did not tell me that mail was waiting.  I had only
one job logged in at any time.

In this case, I did not expect to see the message "You have mail from ..."
because I was not at monitor level.  The problem is that the "[mail waiting]"
message typed by COMCON just before it prints the period (or exclamation point)
is not coming out when I return to monitor command level.

Subject: [mail waiting] ? algorithm 

Instead of deciding who to send/set the mail-waiting bit for, what if...

When a message is sent, set the MAIL-WAITING bit for all jobs logged in
under that username, thus programs like PEAK,VUE,TUMS,etc. can look for
the bit and let the user know s/he has mail.

When the user runs TUMS,RDMAIL or some mail reading process, then that
process should look to see if any other frames are logged-in under the
particular username still awaiting the MAIL-WAITING typout by COMCON and
clear it for all such frames.

Thus, if an individual program sees the flag and wants to clear it, it
may without consequence, and it may also detect that some other process
cleared it, and notify the user that the previous "mail" had been read.

A new UUO or even a new privilage would not be too bad an idea... privs
needed to clear it on any frame but your own, (maybe JL or WF is all?),
and anyone may set or clear it on their own frame.

What do you think?

Did you get the "mail" prompt in the status line (if PEAK, I don't know
if VUE has this)?  I believe the problem is most likely that the message
was discarded due to lac of buffer/ring space.  I have seen this happen
before with other monitor messages (ILL MEM REF, PDL OV, etc.) -- there
is no mechanism to "backpressure" these messages since they occur at
interrupt level.  Sigh.  Let me know if you think this might be the
problem.  The solution is to (1) fix the monitor somehow (no suggestions),
or (2) change the editor to send a yellow ball and wait for orange ball
before doing the exit.  This is advisable anyway, since it is messing
with terminal characteristics.  I think PEAK already does this.  -Bill

That's mostly how it happens now:

    procedure SetMailWaitingForUser( userName )
    begin
	forEach job suchThat JBTUNM( job ) = userName
	begin
	    if JBTSTS( job ) = ^C
		then sendTalkMsg( job, "[mail from..." )
		else setMailWaiting( job )
	end
    end

Now, PEAK looks at mail waiting in JBTPRV and sets a "MAIL" prompt in
the status line.  It currently does not clear the bit, although the
new monitor does allow it to be cleared by SETPRV UUO.  The monitor
clears the bit after outputting the message (or trying).  I am in
favor of the suggestion to not have the monitor or LOGINN clear the
bit, and have RDMAIL/TUMS go around an clear it.  I'll change TUMS and
RDMAIL to do this, if you change the monitor and LOGINN.  I propose
making the existing SET-NEW-MAIL-WAITING UUO do this by taking the
sign bit of the AC field to indicate to set or clear...

	MOVE	ac,JOB
	
	TLO	ac,400000	; clear mail waiting

Joe,
  I'd like you to put together a PCOM command file, whether it be done with
some sort of TECO macro or what... but something that will produce a set of
output files *.SCM or *.DIF (or something unique?) which can then be filed
with the transmittal or the MEM file to show all the changes made to all the
source files.
  I'd like to see an INCREMENTAL differences... such that

    COMMON.MAC <= COMMON.N13 <= COMMON.N12 <= COMMON.N11 <= COMMON.N06
    CORE1.MAC  <= CORE1.N12  <= CORE1.N10
    ONCE.MAC   <= ONCE.N12   <= ONCE.N02

We see for each module, differencs from the .N00 released monitor to present:

    COMMON.DIF <= {{.N00,.N06 + .N06,.N11 + .N11,.N12 + .N12,.N13 + .N13,.MAC}}
    CORE1.DIF  <= {{.N00,.N10 + .N10,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}
    ONCE.DIF   <= {{.N00,.N02 + .N02,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}

Maybe produce a single file... (N to P)
    P034NP.DIF <= {{ COMMON.DIF + CORE1.DIF + ONCE.DIF + ... }}

At least think about it.  Because we need some sort of control over the
changes after they've been done, as a review to insure thaat we have not
added any problems by mis-typing anything.

Well, that part of SCNSER is a rat nest, after I decided I needed
to draw a picture, it became pretty clear what was happening.  I
still haven't decided why it ever works.  I do think it is the speed,
although, I think the varian is faster, never allowing the ring to
become full.  At any rate, the fix is...

	SCNSER$:
	SETOUT+0.5!  SETZM MULCNT+0

That is to say, insert that instruction after the first one in
routine SETOUT.  This just emphasizes the fact that there is no
space.  Some places check MULCNT, some check MXMCNT.  

Actually, I think it does happen with the varians, I've had an
occasional report of two character being lost, but when I checked
the black ball counts, I passed them off as some other network or
terminal problem.  I recommend this change be made to the next release
and patched on any system running Engine base.  It is very, very
safe (i.e. I don't expect it to cause any problems)

  I will look at the code and see if that is the only thing necessary
to catch/fix the problem.  I agree, that part of code is a rat's nest
and that generally defies making a simple fix. Sigh.  Let you know..
Probably put it up on system C39 asap if it runs on 930.

  Last 2 changes we're trying to put in are to make sure the STOPCD
printer stuff works right in all cases, formatted nicely, and I've been
trying to get the inactivity timeout code to be setup in all cases that
a user sets PVDINA, either by SETPRV or LOGIN or CREFRM.  The code is
in, but fails testing...  SETPRV works fine, but LOGIN doesn't.  Soon
as that's fixed, we'll schedule it up on 39.

With the typo removed, it is obvious that it references %UPT+UPTMUP twice.
The first time indirect to pick up the instruction, the second time directly
to puck up the PC that pointed to the instruction.  The KI responds to a
page failure by exectuting an MUUO in Kernal mode as a result of a Trap,
therefore the new PC is from %UPT+UPTKTR but the old PC is at 425 like all
other UUOs.

There was a comment that was eliminated when I changed HRRZ T1,%UPT+UPTMUP and
MOVE T1,(T1) to MOVE T1,@%UPTMUP.  The key thing is the "@".  Anyway, the
comments in that section of code have been updated to be redundantly redundant.

Subject: WC/JL et al, XEXEC-PCOM 

Bill,
  You brought up an interesting point about XEXEC putting whatever license
on a particular frame.  PCOM must have the same problem.  We've basically
been saying:  If I have license, I can write a program requiring it and set
a PCOM/XEXEC command file (.CTL) with that license, and then anyone using
my PCOM file would more-or-less have the license provided.   Well, as long
as I have the license, I can do that.  If someone tampers with the file, the
license goes away.   >> FINE <<

  But, what if someone "reads" the file, sees what programs it runs and
substitutes one of their own which does whatever THEY want it to do.  All
they need is WF.  PCOM v1.63 (not on all systems) and old versions of XEXEC
(again, not on all systems) supply the frame license.  The programs do all
the rest.

  We need a mechanism by which the PCOM/PERP/XEXEC program can verify the
programs that are to be run.  That's a tall order.  On the one hand, running
the current instantiation of a program is fine, checksums, author, etc...
So, I run a system program, it gets updated, should my PCOM job die?  Should
it lose it's license? (possibly causing it to die).  Should it be removed
from the queue?  [What programs does it verify? {{All,Some,None,System?}}]

  Then, the **smart** user can change the path (GFD, or GFD from a program)
and the program which gets run isn't even the one which was tested... we
lose again.

  This may be a hole we have to plug!

Subject: DELUFD 

I wrote a program called DELUFD to delete all UFDs that had zero files in
them.  Due to a bug, it deleted OSB.  I am having the COOP restore all
the directores that were deleted that had files in them (I have a SZRPT
from before and after).

Anyway, I am going to change the program so that it deletes only one UFD
at a time.  The main reason for the existance of a program such as this is
to clean up the MFD on system 95.

Subject: DELUFD 

As I recall, if we're talking about the same thing... they didn't have
a program to delete UFD's, in the case where they have a program to
just delete LUD or DUL entries.

I believe that I said, they don't really need it... what they do need is
ONE program which will ADD,CHANGE,DELETE entire account entries, or any
of the major components (LUD,DUL,UFD) so that user's could be made 
"consistant".   We've got all the little tiny programs... we need to
replace them with one program, because NOW they accidently monkey with
the components in the wrong order... and that screws things up... one
program would fixt all that...  That's all.

Sigh. /Carl
PS: If that's not what we're talking about... I stand corrected.

You do know that I did generate 36,55 and 70... and did the telecopy?

And then send all the mail.
  - Correct me, if you had to do more (generating them)...
  (yes, and I realize you put them into NEWMON, -I didn't!- )

In an attempt to clean up and organize things... M33 is being *split* into
two separate directories.  The monitor and things like MONED will remain
in directory (m33).. {includes MDDT,SYMAUX,???DDT,etc.}
  Things which are monitor utilities such as LOGINN,LOGOUT,TAKEIT,etc. are
all moved to directory (OSU).  This is an evolutionary project and will
take a little time for the dust to settle... so, please be patient...

	*** you might just add OSU to your list? ***

After some searching... I found the problems with KL halted, JSP!
Joe modified the sources to cover this and rebuilt the monitors
with CPUS.CTL.  I ran MONED1 to update things to /N24 ...

I updated both the running monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on 35, 36, 39 & 55
to reflect the changes [/N23-1] of PUSHJ P,SAVE4 ==> JSP T4,SAVE4 at
REDSBC+1 and a POPJ P, at CVPPC both in ERRCON.

The test, using S$INFO,,CPOPJ1 did not seem to work completely since it
still caused the system to go to boots.  CUPC OPS is inter-office mailing
the CTY output to me.

Subject: STOPCDs don't continue if the base gets impatient. 

We got the CTY output from C36 from when Carl was testing INFO stopcodes
on the KL.  With the latest patch, the stopcode is output correctly, and
the system continues, but at the next clock tick it notices that nonzero
has been deposited in 30, and reloads the monitor.  In the first test,
30 contained 000404,,003337 and in the second test it contains 001070,,002177.

It appears that the base got upset that KEY620 was not being updated while
the stopcode information was being output.

The long-term solution is to tell the new base code that the PDP-10 is
experiencing a stopcode, and that it should not expect KEY620 to be updated
for 90 seconds.  A short-term hack would be to modify the routine that
outputs to the CTY and have it update KEY620 while waiting to send the
next character.

Subject: Future dates! 

Osman got a complaint from MARCONI about a file in his directory which
had a date sometime in the future.  It was one of the MAGNRN.SHR files
probably copied or restored from tape into (MARCONIT).  Osman wanted
to know if we could explain how the date got set to the future...

Well,  the ENTER & CHANIO .CHENT calls both check the date value and
set it to today's date [THSDAT] if it is in the future.

But,  both RENAME (probably .CHREN too) and UPDATE-ENTER don't seem
to care at all.  We were able to set the date to any date we please
past or present WITHOUT ANY LICENSE.

This isn't really a problem, but unless someone knows of a good reason
why any file UUO can set the date/time field of a file to the future,
I vote that we should put the appropriate checks in the appropriate
places and stop this fiction before anyone else complains.
