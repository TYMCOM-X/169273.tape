How about 
    make A xor B xor C
    IV := new( [ A xor B xor C ] );
Now you have an item with type BRACKETED-TRIPLE that you can put in sets
and stuff.  Also, you can have an array COUNTS[0:itemmax], and use
    COUNTS[cvn([A xor B xor C])] as your counter.  You can't use the datum
of the bracketed-triple item, since the datum is already used for the
association.  Not really better, but it may be faster since it only searches
the associative store once.

The other thing would be
    make STOPPC xor MONTH eqv FILE;
then to increment the counter,
    set CRASHES;
    integer itemvar STOPPC,MONTH;
    set itemvar CPU;
    STOPPC := cvsi( "ILLINS+4", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( STOPPC := new, "ILLINS+4" );
    datum(STOPPC) := datum(STOPPC) + 1;
    MONTH := cvsi( "Jan84", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( MONTH := new, "Jan84" );
    datum(MONTH) := datum(MONTH) + 1;
    FILE := new( "(CRASH:39)CRA004" );
    make STOPPC xor MONTH eqv FILE;
    CPU := cvsi( "KI", FLAG );
    if FLAG then new!pname( CPU := new(phi), "KI" );
    put FILE in datum(CPU);
this gives
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINS := datum(cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesInHJan84 := datum(cvsi("Jan84",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINSinJan84 :=
	length(cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG) xor cvsi("Jan84",FLAG));
    NumberOfCrashesAtILLINSonKI :=
	length((cvsi("ILLINS",FLAG) xor any) inter datum(cvsi("KI",FLAG)));
and so forth.

Subject: demise of sys. 33:  directories to save.


Carl,

     there are a couple of directories on sys 33 that MAY have files of need
to us.  I have inventoried all directories with names of apparent interest,
and have surveyed people in the section (who are located here), to learn of
any usernames they need to remain on sys 33.  I have 2 questions for you:
1.)  Do you have any usernames on 33 which MUST stay up, other than CARL?
2.)  Do we need to keep tape or current files from usernames MATOKA and
YEUX?

     NOTE:  we are keeping library tapes of the directories containing the
the files used in the developement of much of our software.  I will have the
RIPOFF.DIR files put in my directory, initially.  As always, I'm open to
suggestions for improving the procedure.


Thanks!

I would dearly love to see SY be able to display job information only
for jobs that have been active in the last minute - this can easily
be determined by looking at JBTINA as does WHEN.  The TRU rate over
the last few seconds would go well with this one as well.  Just a thought.
I might be able to do this if you point me at the sources.  -Bill

All he knows is that OPPS needs OPER and SETOP.  He doesn"t know (and I don't
know) what program(s) the system needs to distribute the updated password file

The only problem that I have with January 18th is that it may be too
soon... because of impending disasters like the system 33 fiasco, some
of my time is being used elsewhere, including 2 days worth of packing
up and beginning to unpack mine (and part of Osman's) office for our
move to Fremont this coming Monday (the 14th!).
  I'll keep you posted on progress.  I basically have to re-read the
entire YAMM looking for technically incorrect information (ignoring
typographical errors for now) since no one else can do that at the
moment.

Subject: OPPS move to system 34

Jenny,
  While I'm thinking about this.... whatever system OPPS is moved to,
everyone at Tymshare who has a status password will need to log into
that system to change their password.  That is another reason why it
might be a good idea to keep the host number C33 around... it seems to
me that we'd be making a lot of work for Validations to move just about
every internal user, since almost every internal user has some status?

(I may be wrong about the percentage that has status, but in any case
there's a lot of usernames involved if you consider the entire OPER
status tree...)

In-reply-to: your message of 10 JAN 85 01:33:52  

Dennis,
  I would like to remind you that I talked to you about the reasons
I was not forwarding ONTYME messages to other users in this account.

1.  At the time there were only 2 active people in the account:
    OSMAN and MYSELF...
    Everyone else added was added because I pushed for us to keep a
    separate TXS account even though it was not used much.
2.  I also mentioned to you that I was waiting for certain commands and
    a user interface for TUMS (the SENDMA/RDMAIL system) on TYMCOM-X.
3.  I was on vacation at the time of said notice about the demise of
    system 33 and far away from any terminal to wit to do anything about
    about it.  So let's not use "responsibility" or lack therof in the
    forwarding of an important message as the basis for anything.
4.  The message that this is in reply to...  "identify yourself"?
    Come now... who gave you your account within TXS to begin with?

================================================================

1.  You want more distribution from ONTYME... then as of later today you
    have it, probably unfiltered... unless I can rig something to throw
    away every second message (every 2nd msg says to re-distribute the 1st).
    There are now more than 2 people in this account who are really
    attempting to use ONTYME.  Thus, I will ask you to solicit from those
    of you in Fremont, who(m) else wants to receive bulk ONTYME mail.

2.  The TUMS user interface is now both available and usable!  It has the
    ability to forward and re-distribute messages with and without comments
    by the forwarding "person".  It will be used to re-distribute messages.

3.  I'm back from vacation now... tonight was my first chance to cull all
    of the TXS.SUP mail together... sometime soon, I will re-send all
    appropriate mail to those of you who want it.

4.  Need I say more? ... I too have been very busy, tracking down software
    which WILL be affected (possibly adversely) by this system change, since
    my return and the matter of a few un-sent messages no matter HOW very
    critical they may have been has not been high up on the list of more
    urgent things to do.  I only caught this message because it was ALL in
    lower case!

Actually, I'm rather disappointed that you felt that you had to go through
all the trouble you've gone to, talking to Les Metour, etc... you knew that
I wasn't completely back yet, and you knew that I was handling the TXS
account.  If you had a question, you should have asked me, or Osman..  I
showed him how to check the TXS.SUP mail before I left, but at that time
there wasn't much but "junk mail" as far as TYMCOM-X was concerned.

Grumble grumble grumble...

   ...I'll talk to you later about this.  If you want to help with
the distribution of the ONTYME mail, you are welcome...  I've set up
and account on 930 just for TXS.SUP, called TXSSUP and as soon as SRA
gets the forms that I got Craig to sign the last time I was in Fremont,
it will be valid on the network as well.

Subject: ** MEMOHEADER file, for OnTyme acct. TXS.


As per your sugestion, I've created a file in my OnTyme acct. (TXS.D/COFFEY)
named * MEMHEAD, with the desired stuff.  Re. the company 'junk' mail on
OnTyme:  possibly easiest tack would be to leave it in OnTyme, since the
people here use OnTyme fairly regularly--just 'get' the OnTymre message
into TXS.SUP's Ontyme workspace, and send it to * ACCTUSERS (after that
file has been updated).

I'll survey the people here about what they want filtered from their 'junk'
mail.  Being across the bay isolates us, so general distribution OnTyme
message can be valuable sources of information.  I'll let you know what they
want---or the easiest solution may be just turn it all over to Lois Frost.
Her extension here is 2651.

Thanks for your patience.

I think you'll find it undesirable to keep more than about 50 messages in

you'll probably do quite rarely, (try logout).  And, maybe I'll change it
