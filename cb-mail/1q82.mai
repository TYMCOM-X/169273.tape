REMINDER  TSU meeting this afternoon at 3 in conference room 2.   --Adele


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 4,1982 20:08
Well Bill...,
  Methinks me haves found the problem with the monitor sources.  In
munching the definition of ONCDDS, me removed a calculation x/1000 *1000
in making an assignment.  Thus, instead of x == 1000 it was = 1116, so
the page/k aligned ONCGOP code was all shifted by 116 words, thus it
wasn't where we expected it to be.
  That fixed, it's loaded with LINK and running on 934.  It would be a
good idea to have someone double check with me and look over the filcoms
to make sure I didn't clobber something else.  *Don't need to lose reliability*
  The entire monitor still does not load with link or loader as is, but
there aren't any visible reasons why the files would be bad.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 4,1982 20:14
That last sentence wasn't clear.  Assembled with MACRO %53B, it doesn't
link properly.  However, it assembles and loads fine with the old MACRO
version %46.


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 4,1982 20:28
Re: more on loader/link vs the new macro assembled monitor

The problem seems to be centralized around ONCE/ONCDSK/REFSTR.
By substituting these three with rel files from macro %46, both
loader and link will load the monitor.  However LINK comes up
with 6 undefined symbols.   more later...

Did you ever track down the character lossage between two hosts

day to me.)  R S V P.

From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 7,1982 9:56
As per the great macro problem at hand,
  I think it may be "polish" related and am checking into what LINK
and LOADER expect to find.  However, since the monitor still assembles
fine using the old macro, we are not "blown out of the water".  ONCE
appears to be one culprit, passing the 128K boundary with link may be
another problem.  I am still investigating the other differences.  Will
keep you up to date with progress(?) reports.

Why are you working on PCOM before the MACRO conversion is done?  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 12,1982 12:13
Because I was told that PCPM was higher priority, and all that they
want me to do at first is to create some general release documentation
and get it ready for that (probably trim the NEWS down, since all of
that should be in the release stuff.).
  I haven't given up on MACRO conversion... Just trying to not let other
things lapse while I'm stumbling around trying to find the real problem
with it.  Adele & I have talked about it & agreed to go through with
the "brute force" grubbing to eliminate things one by one until we find
it.
  But, PCOM has been waiting for /K and now that /K is "out", we should
get PCOM ready to go "OUT" also, so that we can get rid of that abominable
COM kludge.

PS I have a couple of suggestions for PCOM anyway.... It would be nice to
have a switch that would TURN OFF the mail message at the end.  So as
not to fill up a mailbox with unnecessary mail!

in a require 1 version;.  The hack that is in there was just for experimental
versions so I didn't have to change version all the time, it may be neet but

(sys:930)ct6 is a hack to page through a text file one screen at a time.
Invoke it by ".ct6 <filename>".  It will print lines until it fills the
screen or runs into a formfeed or end-of-file.  If not end-of-file, it
will prompt with "-more?-".  Answer "n" or ^c to stop.  Control characters
are filtered to a reasonable form.  Complaints to me.

some of the modules on the fiche.  I would like your opinion (?) on
whether you would prefer more (logical) groupings, or less wasted space.

So far... I've tried to not waste space, but to keep logical modules
or vaguely related modules together.  However, they could be spread out
differently to not waste any space....

By the time you read this, I will have finished putting them in logical
groups, leaving blank space.  I will send you a list if you'd like.

Lois,
  If Bill has no objections to the new groupings, I believe that you
may now generate REAL FICHE!  Files (OSP)*.LST are all there and are
all ready for you to run FSHSPL with the real format information.

I ran FSHSPL using FYSDEB.CMD and (M33)FSHFMT.CMD and it completed
fine.  I reran it to produce just the first fiche so that I could
print it out to show you the results ( S,KLSYM,KISYM,KSSYM,F3SYM,JOBDAT )
with a main heading of "TESTING".

Whatever you do, do not re-cref or re-assemble anything with listings
for the fiche without telling me.  Especially, ??SYM.MAC, CORE1.MAC,
F3TSER.MAC, S.MAC and COMMON.MAC, all of which were edited to produce
good LST files.

a minimum of space is wasted and things are grouped nicely whereever
possible, with a few modules not exactly similar, but not grossly off
base.
  If you have no complaints, We are ready to make the final fiche.

Re: Fiche groupings... I failed to mention one important change....

I made some changes to some CRF files and generated separate CRF files
for S, F3SYM, KISYM, KLSYM, KSSYM and COMMON (removed S and ??SYM from
the listing of COMMON).  I also edited CORE1.LST which was 1 (one)
page too big to fit on one fiche! (it now fits!).

The myriad of programs ???EXE on (MPL) have disappeared and been replaced
with a single RUNEXE program to GET/RUN/MAP EXE formatted files.

From monitor, "CT3 filename/switches" will do the right thing with most
files.  FIles with non-standard high-seg starting addresses must use /MAP.
If run from the RPG starting address it tries to pass that on to the file
being run as if /RUNNOFFSET was typed.  /NORUNoffset and /NOMAP are the
defaults.  /NOMAP overrides /MAP and /RUNOFFset overrides /NORUNoffset.

Re: MACRO version %53B

Adele,
  I have found the problem with MACRO and the polish it generates.
Everything is fine, with ONE exception.  All polish in PHASED LITERALS
appears to generate bad fixup chain addresses.  Instead of the relocated
memory address in which it is located, it uses the absolute phased
address.
  Now that I know what it's doing wrong, it shouldn't be too difficult
to correct it (I hope).

Re: previous message ...
that means it is reproduceable in a small program and I have a base

  I'd like to know if you can locate the following information for me.

  o  The serial # of the PDP-10 which we have license to use DEC
     software on.  (i.e. FORTRAN, MACRO, LINK, etc.)

  o  What level of software support service we (had) have under our
     contract with DEC. (i.e. Are we allowed to submit SPR's, etc.)

  o  Who (or what department) at DEC may we contact to find out if
     DEC already has a fix for a problem in their software.

The reason I ask for all of this, is that I believe I have found the
problem we are experiencing with MACRO version 53, and it is their
problem to fix (although I may actually fix it before I send them an
SPR on it).  I'd like to submit an SPR to DEC (their TSR form) to
let them know it is a problem.  If we don't have THAT level of support,
then I will call one of the people I know from DECUS and have them
submit it, (eg. Leslie Maltz [S.I.T.] chairman of the languages group
on the PDP-10's for DECUS).

Carl,
In answer to your questions:

  q  The serial # of the PDP-10 which we have license to use DEC
     software on.  (i.e. FORTRAN, MACRO, LINK, etc.)
  a  I don't think that anyone knows, not even DEC.  Margaret Delaney
     is working with DEC now to get that straightened out, but 
     probably doesn't know yet.

  q  What level of software support service we (had) have under our
     contract with DEC. (i.e. Are we allowed to submit SPR's, etc.)
  a  We have what is called Self-Maintenance, which gets us the CUSP
     tapes, DISPATCH, etc.  I don't think we can expect a response
     to SPRs, but quite frankly, I don't know and have never tried to
     find out because we don't run a DEC monitor and so don't have an
     environment which DEC can (will) reproduce.

  q  Who (or what department) at DEC may we contact to find out if
     DEC already has a fix for a problem in their software.
  a  In the past, we have found out about DEC fixes by reading the
     DISPATCH.  I do not know who to call other than our local sales 
     rep, and I don't want to call them.


My recommendation:  fix it yourself if it doesn't take too long.  If
you must notify DEC, do it through one of your friends.  In addition to
Margaret's activities concerning getting our DEC software licenses
straightened out, contract negotiations are currently underway between
DEC and Tymshare to attempt to license DEC software on Foonly's.  I would
just as soon keep a LOW profile until the negotiations are completed.

Thanks Sherman, for the info about DEC...etc.
I had suspected as much for some of the response, but wanted to
verify.  I don't want to make any waves (however small).  As far
as DEC reproducing our environment, I never expected as much.
Even under TOPS-10, DEC doesn't have a reasonable way of doing
that.  However, reproducing a bug, is different.

I don't want to appear dense or naive about our relations with DEC.
The questions I ask are for good reason, mostly in determining my
current course of action.

Thanks again.

Subject:  Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy

There is going to be a very special event, this Saturday, February 6
from 6:00 PM to Midnight.  KCSM FM, 91.1 will be broadcasting all 12
episodes (~30 minutes each) of the Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy.
There is also a 13th episode which I have never heard, but I understand
that it was a holiday special which was originally broadcast between
episodes 6 and 7.  I do not know whether it will be broadcast on
Saturday or not.

I found it to be one of the most entertaining series I have heard in a
long time, and I highly recommend it.  Due to a serious blunder in
scheduling, I am not going to be able to hear it.  I have a tape of it,
but the tape is of rather poor quality and I would very much like to 
get a better recording.  If anyone decides to listen to the broadcast,
and has a stereo tape recorder, I would greatly appreciate obtaining
a better copy.  I will buy the tape(s) from you, or if you wish to keep
them I will be very happy to just borrow them.  (I can use either
reel-to-reel or cassette.)  WARNING:  If you tape it, don't stop your
recorder too soon.  After the credits, there is 3-5 seconds of silence and
then a "kicker" -- a one or two liner which ties in to the next episode.

If you are unable to listen on Saturday evening, and would like to hear
the series,  I will make my tapes available to you.

Carl,
Are access dates to be trusted?  Specifically if I delete files on (sys:118)
that have the default installation and access dates, am I fairly safe in
assuming they are unused?
/Lois


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 9,1982 11:56
No.
Access dates can be trusted, except on 2020's.
The reason is, that some system programs get run
and accessed before the date is set by the network
on 2020's.  Most 1-jan-64 files can be deleted, but
not all.  Make a directory of 118 (sys) and sort it
by access date, or tell me and I will... then we can
delete those which we don't need.

make the running of PCOM more understandable...

Unless you object... I will proceed with that plan.

From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 11,1982 14:50
Re: EDITOR/TYMNET problem.
A similar thing to samuel's problem occurs with VUE.  If there is too
much output, (some terminals type ^S).  Which of course, goes into
search mode.  So, VUE disables Reverse-XON or saves the state of it
upon entry, and restores it upon exit.

If this is not done, then what happens is that to use ^S without disabling
XON, the user must type ^S ^S ^Q where the second ^S is passed through by
the host and the surrounding ^S-^Q pair are lost to either the network or
the host.

Since I don't use EDITOR, I cannot conceive of a reason to need to use
^S to stop output, since clearly it shouldn't be a command unless it
can be quoted.  I guess I don't quite understand Samuel's point very well.

The ESCAPEs that the user types should when trapped, determine that the port
is backpressured and turn off backpressure somehow... seems to be the only
solution.

DArren,
  EMPIRE suggestion to get rid of the LTR readout.
    have you given any thought to asking for the production at the top
    of the screen, just after you have attacked and conquered a city.

  1) the city is then already on the screen.
  2) the player then knows where the city is without guessing.
  3) the FORTRAN I/O problem of an extra <cr> or <lf> goes away.
  4) the game never has to redraw a screen or print the LTR readout
         to get a city's production.
  5) you might even be able to use the EDIT command "Y" routine to
         set the new production type.

I had initiated the job by typing R PCOM;GETMAI.PCO, so the command line

Slightly confusing, but I can live with it if our customers can.  It might

Well,
  I think that I will have to arrange for some time on a tape drive
in connection with this TITO problem.  I looked over the code with
a fine-tooth-comb and couldn't find anything awry with the handling
of DSK input files.  Again, it appears to read the file until it
hits an EOF (except while switching tapes).  The only outside guess
I have at this point, and I may be able to test it on 930 is that
the restart block gets zeroed out on files longer than a single tape.

Will let you know.
/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 25,1982 3:09
Voila!
  No, I haven't tested my case yet... but, after some more digging
and [I was right!] some calculations... it is no mystery about why
TITO cannot handle very large files.  In fact, I'm suprised we don't
have more problems:

  1.  Tito cannot correctly restart any file after page # 65,536 if
      that much or more of the file has been written to tape.

Reason: Tito uses USETI to position the input pointer to the next
      page of the file on a continuation tape.  If less than 65,536
      pages have been written then the "USETI chan,(ac)" works fine.
      [And in fact, continuation files work.]  If a file has written
      more than 65,536 pages, then the USETI is rounded down to the
      page number modulo 65,536 and reading continues from there. [Ugh]

      In the last case, the one we've fought to find... I suspect that
      not only is Tito starting over at some point in the file, but the
      file itself will not fit on a single tape, thus when it runs over
      to another reel, it is restarted somewhere in the middle.

      If the file is 65,536 pages larger than a single reel, then at
      present, it will loop forever.  If it is less than that, it will
      loop for a very long time, but could eventually reach a point
      where the overrun would break at a point less than 65,536 and
      the file will make it to completion.

Solution: Use CHNIO .CHFSI or .CHPSI to reposition the pointer
      instead of USETI.

/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 25,1982 3:28
Adele,
  Le Voila!

I have found the long lost Tito problem.  A more lengthy dissertation
of the clues leading to it's discovery and the implied solution can
be perused in (CARL:930)TITO.MSG.

Simply stated, "USETI FIL,(R1)" doesn't work for files with more than
18 bits of block addressability.  Roughly 262,144 blocks or 65,536 of
our pages.  Thus, a file 65,536 pages larger than a single reel of
tape can hold, will loop forever with "really" out-of-order data.

Solution: Convert Tito to use CHANIO's instead of USETI/USETO's.  More
research is necessary to ascertain whether any other i/o calls need be
changed to CHANIO's.

Re: TITO problem
I've already spend about 6-8 hours tracking down & documenting the
problem.  I estimate 2-4 hours to implement the changes and make sure
that I haven't missed anything, and another (2-6) hours to test it,
assuming that I can get a system to test it on.  I need to create a
rather large file ... size of 1 reel + approx 65,536 pages.

PS.  Just creating the file will take 3.5 hrs on an f3 or KS, 2 hrs
     on a KI, and 1.75 hrs on a KL assuming that I have it dedicated.
     Then I have to read it onto tape... which will take at least as
     long...

Bill, Todd, Darren,

  I will be needing a very large file to test the problem which
operations has had with super-large files with TITO.  Is it possible
to munch a disk with TSTSUP and almost instantaneously create a
file with ONE real page (at the end) and about 500,000 holes (or
some sufficiently large integrel number of rib pages).  It takes a
dedicated KL-10 close to 2 hours per 100,000 pages if I create it
using CHANIO .CHCFP (create file page).

Besides, I have to write it out to tape and wait for that, let alone
10 hours...  I'll let you know if/when I make whatever arrangements
to test it.  Please let me know how difficult it would be.

Re: Very Large Files for TITO

It is currently deemed extremely unwise to attempt to create files
larger than about 237,300 pages, because such files will require
a three-level RIB structure, which the monitor is known to be bad
at.  If you are aware of the existence of files as large as you
indicate (500,000 pages), please point me to them so I can figure
out why they haven't caused more serious problems than giving TITO
indigestion.

Re:  TITO
	I think we can get operations to test TITO.  However, it should
be tested on 930 first to make sure it is still doing the "normal"
things right.  Dump a fair amount and do a directory of the tape.  Spot
check the checksums for some files which haven't changed while running
the test.  Try a few file recoveries.
	When you're sure it's testing OK, then one of us can make an
arrangement with Brett Fairchild in VF.  I looked on system 70 for the
problem file, and it is in the 30,000 page size range at the moment.
However, it's getting to the end of the month.  I'm willing to bet that
it will soon grow much larger.  So if you can spend the time this week
to get a version together to test, we can alert Brett in time to get
some checkout done soon.
	I'll get a project together in MTS by afternoon.  And I'm
already thinking about a new project.
	See you this afternoon.

RE: TITO
	Probably a better way than a "live" file test is to write a program
which will generate a giant file.  It could create one with holes -- maybe
only a significant page at the beginning and at the end.  The file would
have an easily computed checksum.
	Then arrange to get a directory with space and an operator to store
and retrieve the file.  If TITO passes the test, then go ahead with a file
test on MIS data.

Adele,
  I have something for you to ponder....

I made my changes and tested out a simple store and directory
of the tape... all works well on System :36

I telecopy TITO.SAV to :930 and try it, and... and... I get
that same error I told you about.  Now... The old version of
TITO (on SYS) works fine.

The place it isn't working, is acepting the device name from
the tty.  That's it!
         {WEIRD}!!!

  Can anyone tell me if the F3 handles LUUO's differently than the

From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 26,1982 5:49
Frustrated!
   I just spent about 10 hours chasing down the reason that TITO
(the new version) doesn't work on :930 or :934.  You will note that
these two machines have somethng in common.
   The problem I was having doesn't appear on 36(KL), 70(KI) or 118(KS)
and on system 36 it actually appears to work fine (store & directory).

   I am awaiting confirmation from Scott, but... TITO was dying before
it ever got to first base (before it INITed the drive), because the
routine which builds the string begins using a byte pointer setup as
"00 06 00,,-1" which is used by IDPB.  On an F3, the IBP returns a
pointer "36 06 01,,0" and "36 06 00,,0" on everything else.  Le voila!

  On an F3 the new pointer no longer points to 0, but 0(1) !!!

  The file (CARL)EMPIRE.HUH is a game I was playing and I noticed that
one of my ships disappeared (alas! a battleship).  I ^C'ed out and ran
empire again.  Fortunately, it had not saved over the "losing" version.

I moved my battleship first, and destroyed one of its troop transports.
I moved a few other peices and typed "V" to save the game during my
turn.  Then I finished my turn and setup to do the next one.

On the next turn, my battleship was the first piece to move, and the
game claims that it was destroyed by vandals (at sea, none the less).
To wit, I ^C'ed out again and renamed it.  Running empire with this
saved file results in a repetition of the vandalim.
  (vandalism, that is...)
  That was, by the way, how it originally disappeared.  HUH? what gives?
If you destroy one of his troop transports, then you lose your ship to
vandals?  That clearly isn't fair!

Re: Misc.
1) I'm going to give Bernard M  of Sligos a copy of LPTSPL so that
   they can use it on their systems.
2) Ken Be Del had called me a few weeks ago and mentioned that Mr.
   Eric Jay would be out here this week, and wanted to know if I
   would talk to him about the LPT problems on the 2020, in lieu of
   the memo I wrote (remember the one we told TRW about with the
   printer going off line & how to reload it if power was off)?
   Again, this is assuming that Mr Jay has time or need to talk about
   it while he's here.  (I said OK) but I figured I'd better mention
   it to you.
3) Yesterday, I took a couple of pseudo-support-hot-line calls and
   spent most of the dy chasing them down, including giving a good
   and lengthy explanation to one of the people from SRA, so that
   they could better interpret the ICP output they use for deciding
   whether or not a system needs more memory... etc.

  Please call Rick Daniels in Fremont and have him give me a call
about the ONCE documentation.  His documentation and mine have enough
closeness and differences that I'd really like to talk to him and
see what he really needs and tell him about side effects.

Eg. ALL of the documents need to be updated, if they reference ONCE
    or FILES dialogues at all.  Since the texts and prompts have all
    been changed.  I'm willing to read over the documentation, or
    make changes, but what I currently have needs to either be expanded

Your current version of EMPIRE has serious problems.

2) Destroyed Troop transports (its) don't seem to go away.
3) 1&2 seem related since ships destroyed by vandals happen after
   the ship has destroyed one of it's troop transports.

Re: PCOM comments.

1)  Needs to allow <CR> for log file to mean use ###PCO.LOG.
2)  /NOLOG should be the default if /NODETACH at your terminal.
3)  If /NODETACH is used, .LOGOUT should never be seen at the
    terminal.

2 & 3 are related & may not be as easy to implement.  2 is a piece
of cake, since /LOG/NODETACH is passed to the child PCOM, but 3
isn't known if you're attached or not.   Maybe it is a good idea to
let the user see .LOGOUT if he is logging, but not otherwise?

Needs discussion.  Also, depends upon whether we are going to extend
work on PCOM, or suspend it while working on the new PERP.  Since I'm
really "between" projects (due to current events), I thought I'd

I re-assembled DEC's DIRECT program and modified it to print protections,
dates, checksums and file sizes as per Tymcom-X.  Loading with the SCAN
and WILD from SLIGOS, it appears to work for all "general" purposes.  It
doesn't do nice "date" sorting that DIRIT does, but... it does do other
things.   Next time I make changes to it, I'll have it "only" type user
names for output unless it can't find one.  

Currently, it accepts usernames on input, and will type them back at you,
but if you use PPN's it will type PPN's.

One useful purpose for DIRECT over DIRIT, is that it will now print out
checksums and at the same time provide FNDFIL capability as well as most
of the DIRIT capability.

Bernard,
  I would like to see if I can find which changes need to be made
to SCAN and WILD, le SLIGOS version, to eliminate the need for the
.LOW file.  Also, the /RUN switch doesn't appear to function properly.
It accepts /RUN:DEV:FILE:[PPN] but not /RUN:(USER)FILE, and it ought
to accept that syntax.
  I have made some changes to DEC's DIRECT program and have it running
on TYMCOM-X thanks to the changes Arlette made to SCAN & WILD, but it
can still use a few more additions.  Please ask her if she knows of
any reason why /RUN doesn't work... Thanks again.
  I'll let you know if I make any progress.   (CARL:90) has a small
modification to Arlette's version of SCAN, which ought to be folded

Re: TITO update.

TITO in its infinate wisdumb appears to lose some part of the last block
which it is writing to the second (and possibly nth) tape after it has
reached the end of tape.  Why this doesn't happen at the end of the first
tape is beyond me (at the moment).

The third (and mth) tape begins correctly (?) with the beginning of the
specified block at which tito is splitting the file.  Restoring a file
from the third tape results in correctly restoring the file from that
point onward.

Looking at the end of the second reel, the data just stops short when it
fills a record and then the trailer is written, throwing away the rest of
the block it was writing.  On reading this reel, all the data on the tape
is read and and the file is "closed" with a short block.  When the file is
"continued", the USETO call moved the EOF to the end of the block, thus
filling it with zeros.  the next block is then copied correctly up until
the end of the file or the end of that tape (where I suspect the erroneous
process repeats itself).

Fix: Unknown at present.  Needs more research.  Chalked up 9 full hours
testing and proving this condition + writing the block/page checksumming
program.

I will be a little late getting there today.  Probably around 1:30ish.
I'll skip the meeting for SNARL/DSNARL until I've read the documents
and I'll let you know what my comments are later.

what category does the SNARL meeting go under?


From: CARL
Date: MARCH 17,1982 19:12
Well,  (with enthusiasm)
  Methinks that I have found the second TITO problem.  It seems that
even if the USETI/USETO problem hadn't occurred, TITO would have had
a problem on the third and subsequent reels.

  TITO didn't know how to count.  Files start at Block 1, not block 0.
So, the second tape worked by error and the third and subsequent tapes
dodn't.  VFO is again STORE-ing and RESTORE-ing the copy we made of
that file RD6EV5.MRO on system 30 and will let me know the results
tomorrow.

Good Night - and have a pleasant yesterday.

...update on tito...
Almost..
   but not quite.  The last test by VFO appeared to STORE perfectly.
However, both the DIRECTORY and RESTORE complained of not enough data
on the tape.  The DIRECTORY gave a message about the "expected" checksum
which it obtained from the tape, which matched the disk checksum before
the STORE.  The RESTORE went ok, but ADDED one extra word on output, the
checksum itself.    Hmmmm.

I truncated the file by 1 word & that checksum "IS" correct!
/Carl.


From: CARL
Date: MARCH 19,1982 5:06
Well,
   Another go around... with VFO and TITO.  More on the same fix
as yesterday.  TITO knew that files started at block 1 on tape, so
it calculated the file size to read from tape based on the count
read on previous tapes (minus 1).  However it only checked at the
very end, so when it ran out of tape data, it kept trying to write.
Thus, it read the last tape word (the checksum) and put it on disk
as data.  Then it couldn't find the checksum, so it said "not enough".

I gave VFO anotehr version of TITO to re-do the RESTORE and the DIR
and hope to know by later this morning how it went.  I tested the
new version against the third tape and against a scratch tape and all
appeared well.
/Carl

Please give me a call if you are in by 8:30.  I'm support-line person

across 2 reels & that will be it.

Re: Suggestion -- (I'm requesting feedback)

I have found that from time to time, I spend as much (at least?) time
as an hour or three a week doing "operations" kind of work in our lab.
For example:  Unjamming the printer on 118, reloading systems and the
micro-nodes "manually" (as in "not" using TAKEIT for systems).  I am
usually faced with deciding where that time should be accounted for.

I'm suggesting another "overhead" category for MTS called "operations"
so that we can account for that time, and I think it will help managers
know how much of our time is ?"squandered"? doing those things.  At
present, "lost time" and "equipment down" don't really cover that kind
of thing.

Do you agree? or disagree?

Lois,
  Could I impose and ask if you happen to have a copy of the
Instruction booklet for last year's (1980) Federal Income tax form.
I've finished doing the 1979 & 1980 parts of my taxes except that
I don't have the tax tables to look up the amount of tax that I
was supposed to have paid ...
  I'd really appreciate it, if you still have it somewhere.  If not,
then I guess I will have to see an accountant before I can finish
even the back years (short form).

Re: INITIA
Ed Imsland tells me that the last transmittal for INITIA was dated
17-Sep-80 with a date of 30-Jul-80 crossed out on the form.  That
was for version 17.0 which is the current version everywhere but the
2020's (except 118).  Do you know of any reason why that version was
not put up on the 2020's other than falling through the cracks?
   Ed says his release tape was built from the programs running on
system 33 at the time he put it together, and I guess that INITIA
was never updated, probably other products as well.  Please tell me
what you'd like me to do, otherwise I'll consider this closed... and
you can handle it.

SETOP (making it work with the new MACRO*) I noticed what appears to
be code to do that (eg. embedded non-alpha..etc.).  Uh, what have you

I won't do anything more, until I hear back from you.

  I think I misunderstood when you said to simply move the LIT and VAR

what I did or what the results were.  It has "dawned" on me that, "SURE!"
that's what we want to do anyway!  So, sometime on a "while inside" basis
it would be a good idea to do that even under the current MACRO.  I'll

ALSO POSSIBLY TAKE MORE THAN ONE FICHE TO PRINT IT, I AM NOT SURE.

PLEASE HAVE THE FICHE PEOPLE RUN A TEST...BEFORE THEY AMKE IT

From: CARL
Date: APRIL 2,1982 10:56
Uh, this isn't so "important", but I think it ought to be noted...
the mail message sent to people about files not restored because
the disk version was newer lacks a little:

  It isn't clear that the files (my list appeared sorted) were from
different incrementals, thus incremental A was not new enough, but
incremental B was newer, thus... it did overwrite the file.  So, the
message is misleading...  ...it would have been more appropriate to
say that they had not been restored from at least 1 incremental, and
that they may need attention (since evidently, they also may not need
any attention).
