I've talked to Vivian about helping you with the fiching.  Maybe she could
help build stuff and produce listing files, or whatever.

Please let me know when you will be in today.		/Thanks, Adele


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 3,1983 21:20
Tim,
  sorry we didn't get together on the fiche/lst files.  Please
do the following for me.  Create a file, called FORTRN.CAB on
some directory on :22 with one-line per file-list per fiche.
Eg.  If you have 20 files and you want them grouped 1,2,3,5,7;
4,6,10,12; 18,19,20,14,15; 8,9,11,13,17,16; ... then I want to
see a file containing:

1,2,3,5,7
4,6,10,12
18,19,20,14,15
8,9,11,13,17,16

the files may be full file-spec including username,file,ext,ppn or
combination thereof.  wildcards are not supported.  There is a new
version of the PAGE program on 930:mpl which you may copy to :22 &
run against the file-list (one file per line) however it does take
wildcards of * and #, so *.LST on one line and *.CTL or *.CMD or
FORT##.C## should work.  It counts the number of text pages in the
file so you can make sure your groupings fit on a single fiche.

Bill,
  In lieu of MIS getting things like 1022 re-built to check the node
of origin via FRMOP instead of GETTAB... I am putting a "DEBUG" version
of PCOM on my directory on a few systems which will poke the JBTLOG
bits to be a copy of the current frame's JBTLOG.  (I need to run x22
to get some work done and PCOM is the only way to alleviate tedious
typing...)  Any objections?
-Carl.

...re: PCOM ... switch selectable, of course... /ROYALTY ...

PS, what's up with the password stuff.  I've been super busy with the
fiching stuff.  The equipment is supposed to be all gone "next" friday
the 14th, so it's ...grind...grind...grind.  Oh well, gotta go.
-Carl.



From: WRS

As long as its only in your directory.  Actually, you could become a
hero and patch 1022.  But then I couldn't begin to tell you where all
the files you'd need to patch are (all the GETSEG overlays).  -Bill


From: CARL

Yeah,.. I know.  I'll lay it all out for Tim or whomever when the
fiche chrunch is over, but I suspect that since I've already found
the piece of code which needs to be changed... (UPL)RTYCHG.F4 ...
all that really needs to be done is to get MIS to get everyone to
RE-LINK everything.  Ha!

Ken, how busy are you?  As in... I need to test a program...
I think I just crashed system 38... but I'm not sure... Hmmmm.
So, I'd like to try it on 930... but with prior warning to our
customers...


From: KEN

ok, if i read your message correctly, you think you might crash 930 by

not i might complain a bit.

From: CARL

uh... well, not really. I'm about ready to keel over for lack of
sleep... and promised myself I'd put up a PCOM which let a user run
ROYALTY programs which looked at GBTLOG instead of UPTLOG... anyway
the change to pcom was a 3-line change, and when I tried it on
38, I got a "please log in:", "host down".   I am not at the office
and I am will ing t single step with DDT to just LOOK! to see if
it's a code bug.. and wait till tomorrow to actyually exct it...
930 should reload itself, but I can't promise.  I will just say that
I don't expect to kill 930, but I want you to be aware that if I
slip, it may go away... I wanted to see how imbedded you were in 
what you were doing.

the GTLOG word from the LDB in a "USER" program! Gulp!

Carl:

I finished the sfortran fiche as well as possible.  What a beast!

Greg was supposed to finish the monitor fiche, but obviously he did not
run cross, and you cannot log in later and do that as the temporary file
with the cross file list has disappeared, so I will have to start it all
over again.  Sigh!
-Lois


From: LOIS

Carl:

Would you believe I just finished compiling, "crossing" and "sweeting" the
monitor files.  I have been logged in doing fiching stuff for 12 hours--on
a long distance line (message unit, anyway) yet.  System still seems very
slow.  The list of modules from the last fiching is in (m33)fshfmt.cmd.
It was set up for the other fiche program so the list is in reverse order.

You can finish up the fiching, if you would. This system is just too slow
to justify by staying logged in (and I am too tired).  You can copy the
command file to another name, reverse it, and get it going on some other
terminal at work.  that really is all that remains to be done.

bill,
  after searching 3 units out of 22, all the while vivian was
re-entering the data for the "lost" file... vivian past the point
at which we lost data, so I stopped searching.

However, I may have a new routine to add to TSTSUP which searches
the entire structure for the rib for a specific file, and then
prints out the data-page-pointers so that one can then re-construct
or do whatever to the file.   (Re-creating a new file using the
"found" data pages may not be plausible... however maybe copying
the "old" pages into "new" pages in a "given" file may be reasonable.
...c'est la vie.)

It'll save time trying to do this by hand anyway. -Carl.

tim,
 see me asap about the 1022 xmittal..... it really should NOT, and
I repeat, "SHOULD NOT", be transmitted using the OLD royalty accounting
package.  This means "merely" (?) re-linking it with the NEW routines,
which ED IMSLAND is supposed to be making sure we have.  Otherwise, it
will just have to be re-done, just to make sure it will work with PCOM
and other such mechanisms.

Right now MAGNUM is the only program which uses the NEW royalty routines
and it is not a good idea to transmit anything else without making hte
conversion.
-Carl.


From: CARL

I realize that getting x22 out of your hair is important, but If you

re-linked.

In response to your aside:  the Fortran-10 compiler need to do
constant folding as part of it's optimization, which means that
it needs to use floating point instructions.  It is currently
set up to do them KI-KL style because double precision on the
KA's is a farce.  I think that rather than asking the compiler
to not do this correctly, you should get the F3 to do double
precision.  Or move source files to a KI or KL.  Otherwise all
other programs using the Fortran-10 compiler with double precision
will run in "tar-baby" mode.

From: CARL

Bill,
  there does need to be some kind of check for the frame going away.
If I pass the terminal to a frame, and it logs out instead of exiting
then I get a "please log in:" on my terminal and a frame running my
application which is waiting for the other frame to "exit", then It
appears to remain "hung".  Exit in child frame should happen if the
child frame logs out, shouldn't it?

From: CARL

Bill,

data, and the child frame is now cleared regardless of whether the
error return is from the GET or START routines, minimizing that from
causing a problem later.

frames running alternate copies of my main program (one assembled
under F-IV and one assembled under FORTRAN-10) so the fortran part

write up a small specification-description of what I want to see.  It
will involve calling an external subroutine with 5 arguments, and
providing a dummy subroutine so that I can see what the subroutine
expects (if it were pascal).  The arguments are "packed-character",
integer, integer, integer, "packed-char", "packed-char" (oh well 6.),
in that order.

I haven't stopped by, because you're "always" too busy when I do,
or you're seemingly preoccupied with Tim, and I don't want to feel
like I'm butting in.  The last time I did that, I got my feelings
hurt in Tim's office, so I stopped stopping by.
  I feel that you don't want me to stop by because you seemed to
always be chasing me out & I'm very sensitive to that.

...missed carl Holmberg again... he's was out of the office today.
I did talk to his understudy, but he didn't know any more than we
already know off the top of his head, so either later tonight, or
monday, we will get the info we need.

I looked at the old password program to see if it contained anything
useful and found that it was quite restrictive.  <cr> terminated the
string, <;> was illegal, <'0 - '37> is ignored and case is folded to
fit.  <esc> and <^C> are both considered as escapes.

somehow that's not much.  Usernames had more description!  A-Z, 0-9,
space, asterisk, dot, minus, slash are legal and : gets some kind of
handling, but not clear what.

Tim,
  I am scrounging for documentation or someone who knows anything
about the MDSI Pascal system.  I haven't found any significant
documentation which describes the actual subroutine linkage between
PASCAL and it's external subroutines, either written in PASCAL or
MACRO or FORTRAN, et al.

  If you know what the linkages are, or know where to look for them
I will appreciate anything that you can do for me.  This is #1
priority for me as it relates to the PASSWORD interface code for
COEES which is promised to them on Monday or Tuesday.

  Send me mail or call me, as your schedule permits.  I don't know
my schedule for next week, since I may be on jury duty... for the
sunnyvale municiple court's "on-call" juror system all next week.

zonnie,
  ...first thing, if you can find out the subroutine linkage for
external subroutines for Pascal, it will be appreciated.  I need
the information as soon as possible, like last week - soon, for
a project which needs to be given to our largest pdp-10 customer
on monday or tuesday.
  ...anything you can come up with will be helpful.  Also, it may
be just as simple to research, but what calling sequence is used
for calling routines not written in pascal, e.g. can pascal call
fortran, and if so, does it use JSA/JRA (F-IV) or PUSHJ/POPJ (F-10)
calling....
   Knowing this second item may be just as useful as the first.

You need to make sure the FAIL EXIT code gets into PERR correctly.
Try running a program that does a CALLI -147 (fail exit) and a
CALLI -142 (FAIL STOP) and see that the value in the AC is returned
in PERR.  These two may return different halt status types so you

may have to change it to check for both.  -Bill


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 15,1983 2:18
...Tested callis -147 fail exit prints msg on terminal, no return
value to PERR, returns 10407 to MERR
  calli -142, fail stop doesn't force tty msg, returns MERR 10402
and returns PERR of whatever value is specified in ac used by calli.

I will try to remember to verify that this is what the document says.
.... although it doesn't discuss FAIL EXIT vs FAIL STOP, or I don't
remember the discourse.

I'm waiting on getting the linkage sequence for PASCAL, but otherwise
the fortran interfaces are done for both f4 and f10 (same routine).
[Actually, that routine was trivial.  See F4RUN.MAC and see.]

Make sure that you assembled the changed modules in the monitor with
the old macro.  It's possible that LOADER cannot handle some of the
polish fixup code generated by the new macro.

The ill mem-ref is a sure sign of a mis-placed or mis-interpreted

Mike,
  Bill says that the new PASSWORD program is ready for testing.
The FRMRUN program and the FORTRAN interface are also complete
and tested.  The pascal interface has two options, and I'd like
to have COEES's opinion on which they would prefer:

  1)  They may use PACKED ARRAYS of CHAR, and specify that the
      external routine has the OPTIONS FORTRAN switch in the
      declaration, thus allowing them to use the FORTRAN inter-
      face "as is".

  2)  They can use STRING[nn], and I can produce a "pascal-only"
      version of the FRMRUN subprogram, deliverable in a day or
      two.   (4 hours, including testing time, I estimate actually).

  Bill suggests doing whichever is more "natural", and since neither
he nor I program regularly in Pascal, it's a toss-up as to which is
more "natural".  Instruction-space is 20 instructions per call, vs
7 per call in "Pascal" string mode.  If they intend to only call it
once or twice, I'd prefer the "ease of maintenance" version and give
them the FORTRAN interface.  I leave the decision up to you, or to
COEES.  Again, the FORTRAN interface is ready, and the pascal mode
interface needs about 1-man-day more development.

Vivian,
  I have my own reasons for writing this routine, (as in I need it
for an application I'm working on and want to see if it is any
faster than reading the MFD), but please read (SAILIB)DULWLD.REQ
and look at (SAILIB)DULWLD.SAI to see how it works.

  The calling sequence should be clear, however, what you should
pass as the PPN and the MASK may not be too clear.

DULWLD( 0, -1, PROC )   should return each and every PPN,USERNAME

DULWLD( !XWD(3,0), !Xwd(0,-1), PROC )
			should return all of GAN 3

DULWLD( !Xwd(7,0), !Xwd(0,'777), PROC )
			should return all of GAN 7 with UUNs < '777

For your program, application...

  DULWLD( !XWD( !LH( CALLI(!Xwd(-1,!GTAUN),calli!GETTAB) ),0 ),
          !XWD( 0,-1 ),  PROC );

where PROC is defined:
   procedure PROC( Reference Integer ThisPPN; Reference String ThisUSER );

and the PPN is the ppn for the USERNAME..... "easy as pie".

Bill,
  Got the info from Carl Holmberg... and he'd like us to allow the

such ought to be allowed.

  Anyway, the illegal character list becomes <;> semi-colon and <cr>
which terminate the field, null and rubout which are completely ignored,
and the escape codes, <esc-033>, <fs-034>, <gs-035>, <rs-036>, <us-037>,
<{> open brace, <|> vert-bar, <}> close brace, <~> and tilde.

Adele,
  I need to proof-read it, but in the meantime, I'd like you to
type out a copy of (CARL:930) PIP.MMO  which is an overview decsription
of what I feel are the options that I've investigated and what I feel
should be done to accomplish the wildcard changes for "COPY" in order
to really be consistant with "RENAME".  I understand that, COEES may
be just as satisfied with a half-baked version, but I don't believe
that it would be any "faster" to attempt to understand all the nuances
of the PIP command scanner, than it would be to re-write something to
do "just what we want it to do" in SAIL.

  I may have missed writing down some of the options, since a good
part of the memo was written from memory and not from triple chaecking
all of the code.  I do believe that the time estimates I once gave you
would have to be 

From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 21,1983 1:56
Adele,
  I've put together a rather lengthy rough draft of the implementation
options that I feel are available in order to effect the wildcard
change to the "COPY" command.  Please type out (CARL:930) PIP.MMO and
give it a quick review.  I'm trying to NOT spring any surprises on you,
so I'd like you to see what my current feelings on the direction that
the project should take.
  I'm not going to attempt any justification for my beliefs in this
matter other than saying that I "know" what kind of problems are liable
to crop up regardless of how carefully the changes are made.  We all
know that RPG is a can of worms, and Tymshare PIP is not really much
better.  Even DEC's PIP and COMPIL are not much better, but they do
have some of our present "bugs" fixed.
  My final comments are really how I think the project should be done,
since I estimate that going at it full tilt should take less time than
trying to make changes little by little, "hoping" that nothing else
has been broken.  I'd like to discuss what I've written, as a goodly
portion of it is cast in jello rather than concrete, and I'm willing
to listen to someone playing devil's advocate as well.

Tell me, are there any decent/interesting games floating around?  I have
been telling my wife of things such as DUNGEON, ADVENTURE etc. and she
and I would like to explore a little on the weekends.

From: CARL

...with a flash...

Yes, there are a few games around... the best place to look are
on (GAMES) ...fancy that... and there are a few on (UPL)  ..advent
for one...

DUNGEON (a la the 560 or 585 point version of ZORK) is on (SYS:930)
and on GAMES in most places.

ADVENT is on UPL,  EMPIRE is on GAMES -- it is interesting, but you
should type out the DOC file first.. it is addicting.

that should be a good start... but I'd ask not to dig into them
until after prime time, simply to decrease the frustration of the
people who are here still.

There is a version of the board game RISK, and a few TIC-TAC-TOE
games in 2 and 3 dimensions (TTT3D), etc...

Tim,
  I input PARSE.BNF and wrote PARSE1.TAB... Uh... the output is
not what I had hoped to see.  I reformatted it "PARSE1.TS1" and
it appears to believe that there is only "one" state... Is that
realistic???

  I haven't tried drawing a state diagram from it, but with only
99  (or 166?) nodes, it seems to be a bit of a question as to how
it could work.  I know that various characters are found from
various points and need to go different places...  Carl

Please comment.  This IS a question... (Make believe that I've
come into your office and showed you the output and the input &
just looked DUMB).  "Duh... duhhh..."

From: CARL

Well,
  I found a typeo that gave me garbage data, but when fixed
at least generated some semblance of a working table list.

I think I may need some help in deciphering the output, so "HELP".
-Carl

What do you need in the way of help.  Without knowing where to start, I

First of all....
  I need to be able to read the table output, and make heads out of
it's relationship to each of the states.  PTEST.LOG, .BNF, .TAB is
a smaller test case so that I could start somewhere...

I presume <x> <l> <y> where <l> is one of S | R | G
    means <terminal#> S <stack state>    -- stack
	  <terminal#> R <production #>   -- reduce
	  <symbol#>   G <state change>   -- goto  (then check convert)?

......
Second,
  P!SYM, P!SMAP, P!PLEN, P!PIDX, P!PTAB
                 P!ALEN, P!AIDX, P!ATAB
                 P!GLEN, P!GIDX, P!GTAB
  are certainly mnemonic, but I'd like a brief explanation if it
can be arranged.  I'm plodding through with the help of your dragon
book, (which I'm borrowing for the weekend, if you don't scream).

Is there a driver program for the generated tables anywhere?

.......
Third,
  Thanks for the help.. it is appreciated...  my knowledge of the
terminology could be improved (has already from reading your dragon
book for possible clues to dave's design), but I do understand the
concepts involved... to a major extent anyway.

.......
Fifth,
  PARSEx .*  (.LOG,.BNF,.TAB if any) are what I'm digging into.
   where x is "X", then "A","B","C.... as I try & try again,
   but will leave a trail if you wan t to see the progress...

Adele,
  ...I chalked up about 8 hrs in the past 2 days "learning" about
parsing, so that I could put together a reasonable state table and
better understand what is going on inside RPG, PIP and DIRIT.  My
question is:  How do you want me to report that: under prof. devel.,
or as part of the COPY-wildcard fix?  They are related, and the final
outcome of this learning is to be directed at finishing up the COPY
project, "but" I don't usually spend that much time doing research
which feels like learning, all at one shot...

Tim,
  I've managed to get some reasonable output... although I think
that I am going to have to re-think my state-table idea. I'm not
so sure the tables from an LR parser generator with more than 100
states is reasonable.
  Considering that I want to perform various functions as I
traverse the input...

  Anyway, can you point me at (and I really mean give me a reasonable
description of) the pieces of the SLR generator, driver, etc as they
currently exist.  The list of terminals which you gave me, because
they are "built-in", are really not adequate, and they are now pure
overhead.  SLR will obviously take "other" terminals and I've been
developing something using that approach... however, I need some kind
of description of what fits where in the maze of programs left to you
by Dave for the LR parser so that I can make use of parts of them.

----------------------------------------
All that I want to end up with from all this work is a finite state
machine which will parcel up the input to a program and build a
"specialized" tree which I will then traverse and perform the real
work of the program.   100 or so states seems a bit out of focus
to me.
-----------------------------------------
what I'm going to attempt is to parcel it up into 2-4 smaller parse
states and use 2-3 tables ... please see FILES.TSK on (CARL) for a
better description... it is too long to keep making huge mail messages
as my progress changes.
-Carl.

I think that the best thing to do is to come and talk to me when you get
here today.  Mail messages are insufficiently interactive.  I certainly can
point you to the correct pieces of the SLR system and even show you where
you need to poke in order to change the terminals -- Se

From: TJB
Date: JANUARY 24,1983 9:21
veral of the terminals
at the bottom of the list were added by me for my scanner generator.

Incidentally, your interpretation of the S, R, and G symbols was almost 
completely correct.
    <symbol>S<state number>  when you see this symbol (can be a nonterminal)
                             push (Shift) it onto the stack and go to <state>
    <symbol>R<state number>  when you see <symbol> (again, may be a non-
                             terminal), reduce by the production numbered
                             <state-number>
    <symbol>G<state number>  when you see <symbol> go to state <state number>

Please note that the <state number> in R is really a production number.

For more than that, I think that we need to talk face to face.

	It's time for another TYMCOM-X/MAGNUM Section Party.  This one
will be held on Saturday, February 26, from 6 p.m. until midnight or so
at the Shadowbrook Apts. common room (Soley country, maps available
upon request).  The room includes a small kitchen (fridge, stove, oven),
a few tables, and not enough places to sit down.
	It will be a buffet-style dinner, and each person or couple
attending should bring at least one dish.  Considering the season, hot
dishes will probably be most welcome.  It is also recommended that
each attendee bring some of whatever they plan to drink (using the rule
of thumb that one bottle of wine serves two people), which does not
preclude the offering of a single special beverage (hot grog, anyone?).
	If you are planning to attend, please edit (PARTY:930)PARTY.MEM,
which will also be used to indicate what everyone is bringing.  If you
can bring things like hot-plates, extra folding chairs, etc., by all
means please mark that down, too.
	People who don't have accounts on 930 can just log in to
PARTY on Tymnet, and the rest of the work almost does itself.  Any
questions or comments may be directed toward Darren Price, frequently
found at 415-321-6514 or via mail on systems 930 and 84.

  I will let you know (if possible), but I think that I may be
spending the day (Wednesday) at home, either working or attempting
to relax.  My cough has taken on a more "you need a rest" type of
rasping, so I'm going to try and take it a little bit easier.  I did
take your advise and "skipped" my dance class.

  Skipping something like that, when I don't feel it justified, is
a difficult decision, but I agree that too much physical exertion
from a weakened (even if not apparrent or realized) condition does
not do any good.  Thanks for the suggestion.

  If you don't hear from me, it is because I'm asleep, or at least
trying to sleep...  I'm awake now, beacuse my head is too alert and
won't let me, amybe in an hour or so...

Thanks for the mail.  I am in the latter stages of a cold --
just feeling tired now.  I hope your flu finishes up fast for you.
Don't forget the lunch for Scott at Houlihan's Monday.--Vivian

I'm still a bit peak-ed (however that's supposed to be spelled)
but the worst of my flu is over.  I may even do some work sometime
today, but i donno.  My concentration is not very high as yet.

Could you please give me a ring around 12 to remind me of Scott's
luncheon.  I think that it's at 1:00 but i want to make sure.  In
the meantime, I'm going to take a small nap... this being sick has
had me doing a lot of that lately.

Talk to you in awhile... thanks.  -Carl.

Carl, I have submitted DUSAGE, v 1.1, for transmission; however I have
noticed something which puzzles me.  On page 10, lines 11-13, there
seems to be a semi-colon missing at the end of line 12.
  GanTest := GanTest lsh -6;
  GanMask := GanMask lsh -6
END;

The program seems to run o k but why?  ---Vivian
(the program is in my directory under the name "DUSAGE.SAI")


From: CARL
Date: JANUARY 31,1983 21:50
Vivian,
   The missing semi-colon....  is not really missing.   That is...
the form of a statement or statement block is:

  S;    <statement> <;>

If "S" is broken into   "BEGIN  END" we have:  BEGIN END;

Furthermore, we can add sub-S's in the form:  S  or BEGIN S END.  In
this latter case, there is only a semicolon at the end of the complete
statement:   S;  or BEGIN END;  or  BEGIN S END;

Now, if we have multiple statements, we have:  S1; S2; S3;  or
BEGIN
  S1;
  S2;
  S3
END;
	Note: the missing semi-colon!   The reason is that <;> is
the terminator for the statement... IT does not, (DOES NOT) separate
statements from each other.

Are you now thoroughly confused? or do you understand?

Some languages use <;> as a separator.  Sail uses <;> as a terminator.
In fact, some languages such as BLISS, will add a "null" statement in
between the final semicolon... i.e.

  SAIL:  BEGIN S; END;      === works but so will >>  BEGIN S END;
  BLISS: BEGIN S; END;     === actually is interpreted as if you said
           ===  BEGIN S; 0 END; ===   where "0" is the null statement.

-Carl.

Uh, by the way... I didn't get to talk to you today... but we need
do decide what to do about PASSWORD and the JL stuff.  (At least for
the release... I didn't look to see what it's current state is.  Also,
need to get a memo describing the changes from the acct-sup point of
view, and the user's point of view.)  After we gave it all to COEES,
or to Angela .... , her major problem was we omoitted documentation
for how to run PASSWORD.. {SIGH}.  I'm going to make a start in that
tomorrow.  If you do anything, let me know.  -Carl.

  THANKS(?) FOR THE RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION ABOUT THE MISSING SEMI-COLON.
DOES THIS MEAN THAT:

      BEGIN                            BEGIN
        S1;      IS THE                  BEGIN S1 END;
        S2;     SAME AS                  BEGIN S2 END;
        S3                               BEGIN S3

Bill,
  ...an interesting idea...

What about having PEAK/VUE/... read a file into memory as it does
now, but actually only use memory as a CACHE.  If it needs 512 pages
to do something... simply create another address space and push the
pages that don't fit into the other address space.

It can then just MAP the pages at will, and not worry about whether
the pages fit in it;'s own address space.  Multiple buffers become even
more interesting when you merely map each buffer into a separate frame.
Then you merely map the "same" pages from each frame when you want that
buffer.

  ...hmmmmm....

Of course this may be able to be done simply by mapping the appropriate
pages into a file and "making believe" that it is another frame... which
UUO's are faster?  Mapping from a disk file or from another frame's
address space?  The other frame, of course would never "run", just take
up memory space.

  ....hmmmmm.... what other mechanisms exist for multiple address spaces?

Carl,
(Kdev1)LicSub.Sai contains a rework of your (Sailib) bestseller.  I made
the definitions of the license bits easier to read by using !bit() and
making each row in each declaration of equal length.

I also re-ordered the read- and write-license definitions so that the
composite licenses (RA & WA) come before their components.  The madness
behind this method shows up in the re-implementation of LicPrt, which I
find a bit easier to read than the previous rendition.

The text (forgive me) is in my indenting style, but perhaps you could use
the ideas in your version.

Incidentally, I didn't go a-hacking arbitrarily.  I was originally
curious as to how the definition of the license bits could be made
clearer, and hacked up a change in that part.  I then discovered that
LicPrt insisted that I had WP.  This led me to look at LicPrt.  In trying
to figure out how to handle composite licenses without special-casing and
without redundancy, I came across the idea of removing license already
reported from the license parameter, and this worked fine.

Thought you might be interested.
/Ken

Carl,
PS, there is a listing of the source in question on your chair.
/Ken


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 6,1983 0:00
Ah yes... I didn't think about that.. LicPrt was setup to rely
on the ordering of the license bits, and changing them in the
LicRd routine would have left them erroneous (as you found out).

I'll either fix it on sailib, or install your version there.  I
have no great "hatred" for SAIL indenting style different than
my own... so, if your code works, then it's good enough for me.
If I edit your version in the process, I'll probably leave it in
your style of coding, for that is how I operate.

I didn't use !Bit() simply because it hadn't searched sail.def
originally and didn't feel like rewriting the macro's.
-Carl.

While you're hacking the COPY command, do something appropriate with
?Failure(s) during /X request
It's always been a mystery.
/Ken


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 6,1983 0:34
Hmmm.  ?Failure(s) during /X request  simply means that copying
multiple files into multiple files (the standard case) didn't work.
Unfortunately, that is because of the wildcarding problem in the
Tymshare code added to PIP.  If I re-write it, there will be better
and more appropriate messages.  (It is still unclear whether I will
be re-writing it or not "officially").

I've come up with a really interesting idea... about handling
large files, multiple buffers, old or recent buffers (possibly
even between/across logins).  I'd like some discussion, if you
can manage it... maybe lunchtime (lunch also! of course) or
some such.

  My idea stems from the {cough-cough} idea ov using multiple
address spaces for holding each buffer.  Well, that's actually
a waste of resources, whereas a temporary file is "just as good"
and can be used just as effectively (at least on Tymcom-X).

Adele,
  Just as an update... the "Pascal" / Banking application problem
appears to be a problem with their application.  The consultant
that they had had written some routines to allow page-level access
to files using mapping to allow concurancy.  They seem to have an
"off by one" problem where an extra page (of nulls) is added to
the end of their file when the last record ends exactly on the page
boundary.
  I have a copy of their macro routines and am looking to see if it
is anythig that they are doing with mapping that could cause their
problem.  I'm going to see if I can put off looking at it further
until I get the password doc re-written for coees... will let you
know as soon as I know.

MFDSCN has been changed already... requiring that "any" access to
the file, other than LOOKUP requires calling the MFDSET routine to
setup the SAIL file variables.  That seems "best" under the current
circumstances.  Vivian is going to put the MFDSET call back into
DUSAGE and her new version to "insure" proper operation for this
application.  MFDSCN has also been changed to "finally" close up
it's file channels with both the no-access and no-supersede bits on
the release set.

tofind any hidden bugs that might exist. It differs from the old UNDELETE
in that you can now specify directories of files that you previously deleted.
In other words, if you want to recover only files that were deleted from
dir mpl, but not your own directory, then UNDELETE can recognize the direc-
tory specification mpl as being different than your own. UNDELETE also does
not allow you to do things that you previously did, or rather, it makes you

  where "===" means null.  The file size says how many words!  How
can you differentiate between nulls that the user put at the end of
the file and the last couple of bytes in the file.  This is important
when you decide NOT to remove nulls!

  I would like to know what the division's TECH WRITING capabilities
are, and what they are planned for in the future.  I have spent the
past 2 days concentrating "soley" on writing and re-writing the stuff
that Bill and I wrote about PASSWORD and FRMRUN.  I also recall that
I spent about 2 days getting it into "understandable" shape for
programmers, rather than wizards.  Now, it seems that ENGLISH is what
is really necessary.

  I'm not trying to make an issue out of the current state of this
particular project, but rather the state of affairs which I feel that
I am wasting my time doing something which could be best done by a
writer.  ... Likewise, other people in the section "MAY" (I'm saying
this on my own accord, without consultation) feel the same way.  Yet,
we also know that something MUST get written.

  I would like to put my 2 cents in, and ask if we could consider an
arrangement such as we have with the co-ops with some TECH WRITING
types.  Even one who does nothing but, after talking to each of us
about what needs to be written up, and then having the program author
review it for content and meaning.

  Maybe even someone in the division already?  But, I doubt that
getting documentation on our support stuff, and especially TYMCOM-X
stuff is not very high priority, (even if it is for COEES).

Re: PASSWORD / FRMRUN

Mike,
  I've just about completed the new "english" documentation on
both FRMRUN and the original PASSOWRD specification.  There have
been no real changes to the calling sequences and the new stuff
should be more human (and manager) readable.

  One thing troubled me with the error status codes which Bill
put together for FRMRUN which I would like "permission" to change.
I am "asking" because, it means a change in the error code which
is reported by the program, and I'm trying to have the LEAST real
impact on COEES.  I feel that the change will make understanding
how to interpret the error codes more clear and will cause the
people at COEES no discernable problems.

  Again, the changes ONLY affect the interpretation of the error
code, and nothing else.  However, I need to have you check with
Angela to see if it is OK to make the change NOW, before I give
them the REVISED documentation, so that I can give them a revised
subroutine as well.  (Before it gets imbedded in their code!)

  I'll put a copy of the NEW documentation on your desk to read
over, so that you can "bless" it when I come in this morning.
-Carl.

PS.  I have not (YET) mentioned this to Bill, since I don't have

Another change to MFDSCN has been made.  Code improvement.  The new
version will reside in (CARL) until all current transmittals are
complete.  Then, I will move it to (SAILIB).  [Vivian, please let
me know when DUSAGE has been archived, and before your next version
is released].

Adele,
  I have a small (but not really simple) SAIL program which seems
to  have problems.  It gets an "ill mem ref" for a location that
appears on the stack (data) while in the middle of a RECORD garbage
collect.  SOme re-working of the code where the GC occurrs makes
the problem "go away", but there should be nothing wrong with the
original code!  I'm going to see if I can solve the problem, but if
not, since Scott is gone, I'd like to know how you would like it
taken care of. -Carl.


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 14,1983 0:51
Lois,
  You mentioned something about Scott (possibly coming by this
morning, or something like that)...

  If this is so, could you please tell him that I have a SAIL
problem that I'd like to show him.  It may be my "lack" of
understanding, but I do not think so.  I think I've run into
some kind of record-garbage-collect bug.

  If he'd like to look at the problem --- It's in (CARL) in the
files USEBAD.SAI & DULTST.REQ, DULTST.SAI.  A modification to
USEBAD.SAI called USEOK.SAI works but is combersome !!!

  If we can't solve it ourselves, then I will talk to Adele about
talking to Scott... but I figured that if he was to be around...
well, maybe... if he didn't mind.  -Carl.


From: LOIS
Date: FEBRUARY 14,1983 12:44
Carl:

Scott took a copy of your mail message, and copies of the files you said
were causing a problem, but in order to analyze the problem he needs to
know:

1) What exactly was the problem?

2) Since the source file that is supposed to work, now is a .rel file,
it is not very useful for comparison purposes.

CARL, WHAT CHANGES DID YOU MAKE IN DULWLD.SAI?  I HAD TO USE YOUR

CHANGE(S) DO TO DUSAGE?----VIVIAN


From: SDANIELS

(1) what is the bug?  (2) the source for the "good" version is overwritten.
-Scott


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 14,1983 16:27
Scott,
  Sorry about the mishap with the bug report.  I SAVE'd the core
image over top of the .SAI file...   There is a new copy of BOTH
USEOK.SAI and USEBAD.SAI on my directory.  DULTST.REQ/SAI is also
needed to re-compile.

  The problem is that it gets a "data-dependent" ill mem ref while
deep inside the record garbage collect routines.  It goes deep-six
at the HOLD_ NEW!RECORD(USER); statement.   Call me x 7257 for more
discussion and info. /Carl.

To the Section:

Those of you who have not already found out about SAI: not being defined
on 118 need to be aware to run a sail program you need to first define
SAI: PS:<SAIL>,SYS: for SAIL to be able to find the runtimes.  Ellen is
keeping 118 standalone as she chases a bug, and therefore the config.cmd
file that would establish system wide logical names is not being read.

Incidentally she would like people to use 118 as the bug occurs mostly
with the system being reasonably heavily used.  Your terminal type is
tym444.

I'll give everyone instructions for reloading 555 (the tymnet base for
118).

  I thought that there was a subroutine package that Dave put

about it, where it is, what it's called, etc... ?

-Carl.


From: KEN
Date: FEBRUARY 17,1983 21:29
Carl,
I thought so too, but likewise, I couldn't find it.  Take a look at
(PEAK)REDISP.SAI.  I modified it to use DED.DEF, but other than a few
control character definitions, which can be obtained from (SAILIB)SAIL.DEF,
it is supposed to be somewhat stand-alone (I infer).
/Ken


From: CARL
Date: FEBRUARY 17,1983 21:34
I looked around and found (DWS)RDISP.SAI/REQ ... that is however an
"almost" exact copy of (DWS)/(PEAK) REDISP.SAI using SAIL.DEF etc.

I will be looking at it to see if I can find anything so special that
isn't in the FINE redisplay algorithm.  Maybe I'll re-write it.  Have
you given any more thought to changing the BUFFERING scheme completely
in PEAK, as in to alleviate the checkpointing problems?

I seem to have been dropped from the PEAK loop of late, but that's just
because I've been too much in and out.

Ken, Take a look at FOO. on my directory and maybe edit it or

print-out routine.  I think I will be reading the file using
some sort of mapping technique, with a page-by-page (file-page)
skimming to count pages and/or print out the data handling all
phases and switches I can think of to be reasonable.. i.e. taking
care of indenting, vert/horiz spacing, restarting at text-page N,
...etc...  Maybe to replace the way SPOOL works, maybe just to
install in LPTSPL/AUXSPL, but aminly to make a separate routine
which does it.

copies of each of the 5 or 6 (I've lost count) edits to the sources and
making sure that nothing else was broken in the process, preparing the
transmittal and building everything necessary for software transmittal.
  I expect this all to take 1 complete day (or 2 days with interrupts).

During interrupts I will attempt to ready the time estimates for the

UNDEL program, and if you don't believe me I'll show you the original source
listing.
	I am going to bring up for a vote at the meeting today whether to
eliminate the need for inserting filespecs with the /purge and /recover
switches.
	From talking with people about undelete, and from seeing your comments
I think what people need is some documentation on using UNDELETE so there is
no problem with correct syntax. Nothing has existed up to this point which
I feel has caused some confusion.
	I appreciate your taking the time out to try UNDELETE and I'll talk
to you about it later.

bike it in to work, but no guarantees.  I'll try to get
whatever I can get done, barring problems with node 2243.  I'll
let you know as soon as I know.

  I don't mean to make excuses, but the "simple" problem with
my car and the enormity of the problems caused by not being
able to get it fixed has really unnerved me, and as such I just
need to calm down (easier said than done).  Talk with you later.

Andy Rooney speaks:

  o	Did you ever notice how nice the "!Bit()" macro from
	(SAILIB)SAIL.DEF is when you want to tickle that special bit in
	your favorite word?

  o	Did you ever notice that in MACRO it's so easy to say things like
	"37b11" (meaning of course [003700,000000])?

  o	Did you ever notice how difficult it is to say such things in
	SAIL?


Well, I found this rummaging around in the trash bin outside of Lake
Tymshare, and it frankly changed my life (do you care?):


	define
	  !Bit (X, Y) "<>" =
	  <
	    ifcr (length(cvps(Y)) thenc
	      ((X) lsh (35-(Y)))
	    elsec
	      (1 lsh (35-(X)))
	    endc
	  >;


In the monadic case, this macro exactly duplicates the older version of
"!Bit()", and in the diadic case, it imitates MACRO's handy notation.
To wit: 

	!Bit(11)	=>	[000100,000000]
	!Bit('37, 11)	=>	[003700,000000]

I use it every day now, and I'm a richer individual because I do.

To Andy,

  This !bit( of, information ) that you speak of IS somewhat of
a revelation.  It looks clean and actually useful.  It might even
be reasonable to put it into SAIL.DEF on (SAILIB)...  However, it
has been shown that you can say the same thing using the "old"
version  (i.e. 37b11) simply by saying:

    '37*!bit(11)

This was pointed out to me recently through an obscure means of
coding used by a sail "initiate" who thought you had to say:

    1*!bit(11)

and I, thought i was just "good documentation"!  Ha!

create a new page at the end of the disk file; but I can't seem to get
the data into the new file page. How would you go about this?  (You might

    Create file page at the end.
    Map the CFP page.
    BLT the data from "Map the page." into the new page just mapped.
Unmap both pages .. or whatever...

at this point regardless of the "mapped" ness of the pages, they are
in the file (that is open still)  Close the file to make it permanent.
The file must be openned in append or update or enter/supersede mode.

Greg,
  now that you must specify the "username" on the file-sp
part of the command.. eg.
      UNDEL /PURGE (user)file.ext

  if you delete files from 5 or 6 directories, then you "must"
purge them directly.  There is no way to simply say purge or
undelete them all at once.

	The following changes are proposed:

	1.) When a deleted file is to be recovered, and there is more
	than one deleted file with the same name, then the recovered file 
	will be the one with the most recent creation date.

	2.) When doing a purge or recovery and no files are specified, i.e.,
	the user only types a <ret>, then the purge or recovery applies to
	all files marked as deleted in the user's directory, irregardless
	of which directory they were deleted from. I.e., purge and recover
	will work like a /list does.

	3.) Use of the word "ALL" denotes *.*, i.e., it will affect all the deleted files in the specified directory. If no directory is specified, then the 
	user's logged in or gfd directory becomes the default.

If this still isn't agreeable to you, or if you want other changes, tell

the same name that were NOT recovered? If there are, for example, 3
deleted files in the user's directory all with the same name, and the
user recovers the latest one with a /r <filename>, 2 things will happen:
1. undelete will report to the user that the other two files cannot be
recovered due to a file already existing with that name, and,
2. the other two files will just sit around in the directory taking
up space until they are expunged.

it has a scanner, can verify that it's a TITO format tape and
does a couple of things like REWIND & UNLOAD, with hooks for the

I've had some problems with SAIL not properly reading the tape on
TYMCOM_X, and the manual says that I'll run into the same on TENEX
(A.K.A. Tops-20)... that has been the major holdup so far.  Tops-20
at least has "sticky" tape density and blocksize which we don't have

Carl,
wheni I kill a running PCOM job due to early errors, the child frame does
not go away, retains a hold on open files, and indicates through SYSTAT
a job name of EDIT10 (in ^C state). I have to manually kill the frame
before re-running the PCOM job.
/Ken


From: KEN
Date: MARCH 18,1983 17:54

Incidentally, I figured out that the fact that the child frame was running
EDIT10 was due to the fact that SAIL had thrown up and gone into EDIT10 on
its own.

  Anyway, don't bother changing it on "my" account.  A comment though,
about steps for installation.  At one point you mention using this
TELECOPY program.   Please note:  TELECOPY must be installed first!

  And along those lines... TELECOPY will not work unless it can find
and can "read"  (PJ)JOBS.DAT with some kind of a system number in word
2 of the file.  Difficult to copy to system X54 when (PJ).UFD wasn't

I did not include any instructions for checking (pj)jobs.dat.  The only case
that I have ever had to set it up myself was that rush job when 108 was
pseudo-74.  In every other case of a new system, jobs.dat has been in place
and functioning.  As long as telecopy (and not (spl)copy) is used for the
spfix files you can tell if telecopy is not functioning--and then that must
be first before the SPOOL install.

The name of the file is an old one (original file is about 18 months old--
that was the latest revision after watching Vivian try to follow my
instructions, and finding them far from complete enough.  Personally I
found it rather neat, though I must admit SPOOL.INS might be more self
explanatory (but then, that looks like spool instructions).

Ok, ... I thought that I saw Stand Today... maybe it was yesterday.

I just had a thought... about BLISS-36.  Since DEC has a version
for both TOPS-10 and TOPS-20, I was wondering... since we can't have
"sources", it might be reasonable for us to try to obtain a TOPS-10
version.  (It should "run" on TYMCOM-X in seconds flat, without any
modifications) -- (whereas I think that the TOPS-20 version uses the
command JSYS, etc...).

  Is there any intereset other than "mine" for such a "get"?

there 'is' another version for TOPS-10.  I think this needs to
be discussed more with Adele.
  Today, she asked me to make a list of TOPS-20 products from DEC
which are aptly TOPS-10 products also, and could (should) be kept
up to date with TYMCOM-X, since they can be used there.

  This was prompted by my "concern" for things like MACRO/LINK, etc
on TYMCOM-X, and that they are the same product on TOPS-20.  I'll

I am writing UNDELETE so that when the user types "undel <cr>"
it will recover all of the deleted files, but if there are different
versions, then only the most recent one is restored. Do you think this
should also work for the /purge command as well? In other words, should
only the most recent file be purged (in cases where there are different
versions of the same file), or should every file be purged regardless
of whether different versions of the same file exist or not??

...it seems reasonable to purge all the files, regardless of versions,

You might take a look at PEAK.TAB, or at FILES.DIR in directory (VIEW).
I will try to update it with "interesting" files from time to time.

PEAK.TAB is a condensed version of your PEAK commands, with routine
         names and key bindings.  (if no key binding, it has the name
         repeated in the key field.)

I will be munching up the commands listed for VUE, et al to similar

It will make it easier to get listings of the proposal and the commands
separately, easier and more manageable.

Re:  FRMRUN with SAIL

It just doesn't work!  (period)

There is nothing that I can find wrong with the code.  It works just
fine with FORTRAN and with PASCAL.  The place that it dies is during
the process of writing the TEMP-FILE.  Apparently, something with
letting the monitor allocate a buffer ring for the buffer it's trying
to use for writing the file.  Almost right after doing the "OUTPUT"
everything seems messed up, including space used by DDT when stepping
through.

Possible reasons for blowing up?  Collision with SAIL I/O names or just
plain messing up SAIL's memory allocation are both suspect.  I don't
think that it's worth anybody's time to find out, since it's rickety
enough to just re-write into SAIL and then SAIL will be "happy".

PS.  Except for some linkage problems, I've already re-written the
     whole thing into SAIL, albeit a fair amount of start!code.

	A new version of UNDELETE awaits you on (sys). As per our dis-
cussions, it now contains an "ALL" feature so that it will recover or
purge all of the deleted files that belong to you in your directory.
In other words it's equivalent to "undel/switch *.*"  You still have the
option of specifying other directory names.
	It also returns the feature of allowing no switch or file spec
to be entered, but with one drastic change: If the user has more than
one deleted file with the same name, it will only restore the most recent
version of that file. This applies whether the user says ALL,nothing, or else
gives individual file specs.
	A word about the proposed /quiet switch. It can probably be im-
plemented, but note that "/q" is already a valid command when the user is
in interactive mode--it means quit. If I add a /quiet switch, it means that
the user will have to type out the entire word, either "quit" or "quiet",
or else the command will be ambiguous. And considering that all of the other
commands (switches) can be uniquely identified by one letter, don't you think
this might cause some consternation?
	Try it out and let me know what happens or any other comments you
might have. Also let me know what you decide on the /quiet switch.

be nice.   /fast and /list -- /nolist ought to be able to modify all

Greg, Re: UNDELE .. next time make sure the license and protections
are correct when you move something to SYS.  Ususally, ALL RUN RUN
or ALL RD RD is what they get.  You had to have RF license set to use
UNDEL, until I changed the protection.  -Carl.

Greg,
  Due to the interest in UNDELETE and it's probable broadcast to
the world at large, you might mention it to Todd, that I suggested
that maybe GFD and LOGOUT, "should" tell you that you've EXPUNGED
your "deleted" files when they are run.  (Especially GFD!) If so,
then it would be nice to "total" the amount and report that also, but
under NO circumstances should either GFD or LOGOUT type out the
file names!!!!!!  - Carl


From: CARL

re: Status report & schedule

PCOM now has 3 major bugs fixed, and except for spurious detached
jobs left running LOGOUT (whenever PCOM hangs itself for any reason,
it forgets to clean up after itself), there should be no major
problems "known" at this time.  As per previous mail, 1.60 is up
for field-test.

My car is still in the shop, (they didn't have enough time to fix it,
>>they have to take the tank out completely to fix it, then put it
back in<<, so it's back at the dealer again today), so I won't expect
to be in before late afternoon "IF" at all.

FRMRUN needs some documentation sprucing & maybe a little discussion
between the two of us about "license".  -Later

I've done some thinking about Goals, but nothing is on paper yet.
TTR (tito tape reader) is now at the top of the list, with everything

	I encountered a problem with (spl)findit. I ran findit and at the 
filename prompt I gave it lic###.*. It then returned all of the filenames
and directories containing a file with these specs. Everything was fine.
At the next prompt I entered filename setety.* and it immediately printed the
message "No files found to match: SETETY.###". However, after exiting the 
program and doing a directory of (m33) I found the SETETY files.  The same
thing happened in reverse when I first ran findit and at the prompt entered
setety.*. It found it in directory m33 and osb, and then reprompted me for another file name. This time when I said lic###.* it immediately told me no files
to match and reprompted me. Is this a bug or am I not using the program
correctly?

all files and I'd like to have some time to do this.  If need be,
just the DEC-05 and DEC-21 "should" be enough, with the JAN-02 as
a final check.   I made some massive changes to a program between
DEC-16th and DEC-25th (I think) and need to look over what is left
on the all-files, hopefully they are readable.

at 3:20 this morning to have them come to look it over when someone
came in in the morning.  I spun the drive DOWN, since it was flashing
the "ready" light, and I pushed the PROTECT button.  I didn't attempt
to clear the fault or anything else.  I felt it best to leave in in
that state for maintenamce.  See you later, and have a pleasant

 *** PLEASE *** watch the protection and license that you put on the
programs that you put up on (SPL) and other "library" areas.  You put
FIND.SAV on SPL protected ALL RD NO, such that ONLY gan 3 could use it.

I have a DO LIST that looks at my GFD'd dir, then my logged-in dir,
then SPL, MPL, SAILIB, ... in that order.  When GFD'd to non-gan-3
directories, it found the program you had in SPL  **protected** so it
skipped down to the FIND in (SAILIB) which said, "FIND has been moved
to SPL".

  Since I "KNOW" that I have SPL in my do list FIRST, this was VERY VERY
VERY AGGRAVATING!!!

  I've renamed your (SAILIB)FIND to (SAILIB)TSFIND, and replaced it
with a copy of (MPL)MPLSPL, which will run the right program in SPL
after giving a "WARNING" message to the user.  See me if this is NOT
satisfactory.  Or, delete it, and replace it with your own program
again.

From: CARL

Lois,
  I've renamed (SAILIB)FIND.SAV to (LOIS)LLFIND.SAV and replaced the
(SAILIB) version with a copy of (MPL)MPLSPL.SAV.  First of all,

  begin
  print("FIND has been moved to (spl)",'15&'12);
  call(0,"EXIT")
  end

isn't very nice.  It ought to at least TELL you, and then RUN the new
version on SPL.  I wouldn't have bothered, except that the copy on SPL
was protected ALL RD NO, and when I GFD'd to a non-gan-3 username, I
said "DO FIND"  and mystically got the (SAILIB) version which just
dumped me out to monitor with a nasty "FIND has been moved to (spl)".

My do list says:  DEF,LOG,(SPL),(MPL),(SAILIB),.....
  the version on SPL was protected ALL RD NO, and thus wasn't found
  then RPG continued on to SAILIB, and that version dumped me out
  to monitor.  I'd have never noticed it, "IF" I didn't GFD without
  setting license!

Sorry to complain, but I was VERY aggravated at the time, and would
not have liked it, if I couldn't have gotten around it!   Anyway,
enough screaming.  If you have any complaints about what I did, please
send them to me. /Carl.


From: LOIS
Date: APRIL 2,1983 9:24
Carl:
(spl)find.sav is protected all run run everywhere except 930--why didn't you
just change the protection on 930?  I put up the version on (sailib) as
Mike requested; i.e. just to give the message that find had been moved
to (spl).

Anyway, I suppose it doesn't matter, but it would be nice if you ask first.
-Lois


From: LOIS
Date: APRIL 2,1983 9:29

Further--I did change the protection on (spl)find.sav originally.  Remember
that the present version on 930 is Brian's new version--he just forgot to
declare it all run run when he put it up.

-Lois


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 2,1983 18:15
Ref: (SPL)FIND

It really doesn't matter.  I know that you put up the SAILIB version at
Mike or Adele's request, and that it was well over a month ago.  I made
the change to 1) make it easier to adjust if something went wrong and
2) because 2 pages per "moved" program is better than 13 or 21.  Your
tiny SAIL program loads the entire PRINT package from SAIL and takes up
13 pages on disk.  And 3) because it was aggravating to have to go around
looking at protections and programs just to run it from another PPN.

I sent you the mail, so that you would know that it changed, and WHY.
If you want to put your version "back" you can, that is why I renamed
it to your directory as LLFIND.  Originally I sent mail to Brian, then
cancelled it, in lieu of the broadcast mail that I sent everyone.  OK?
I just wanted you to know what happenned since you were the AUTHOR of
SAILIB:FIND.

Re: SPOOL stuff

   Last friday morning, I noticed CTMKTG7 nosing around again, so I
sent a talk msg asking if he was looking for something in particular
and could I help him.

   Well, it seems they have been having problems with SPOOL pickup
addresses for one of their nodes and for "their" CENTER requests on
system 59.  I had CTMKTG7 (Peter Stratman) send me an ONTYME stating
what the problem was and what other information he was having any
problems finding.

   I would like to try and get the 3 of us together, sometime on
Monday to discuss Peter's request(s) so that we can do what "little"
we can to help them out.  Node and printer address stuff is one
problem they are having, some of which is what I want to discuss, and
the other problem they are having is trying to get SPOOL, SPFIX, et al
to run on 3 digit hosts.  I don't propose that WE do anything to get
SPOOL et al to work on 3 digit hosts, but at least point CEGI in the
right direction so that they don't wallow in that weird WEB of programs
we so dearly call "SPOOL/BATCH".

   1/2 hr or less should be plenty of time.  /Carl.


From: KEN
Date: APRIL 2,1983 18:39
Carl,
Yes, I'm aware of the /Lic default; I just wouldn't know if it works.

Incidentally, the version of PEAK soon to be put in SYS: (1.1(101)),
"fixes" all known violations of good taste related to buffer channel(s)
and Tymcom-X paging calls (ie VClear and VCreate).  I eliminated all
redundant buffer channels and changed the paging startcode to reliable,
readable SAIL chanios.  At least one occurence of "VCreate error ..." was
fixed by this, and I haven't seen IO to Undesigned Channel for a while.

Carl,
Are you aware of a difference in behavior in the SAIL macro-expansion
facility while in startcode?  I seem to be imagining that compile-time
values (eg cvsix("DSK")) are not being properly substituted in startcode.
/Ken


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 2,1983 18:48
Yes, I know that there are some differences.
  It is probably NOT in the macro expansions, but more likely
  in what the assembly-code generates.  eg.

cvsix("DSK") is { XWD  'dsk',0 }
and MOVSI AC,CVSIX("DSK")  generates  MOVSI AC,0
however MOVSI AC,( CVSIX("DSK") ) may generate MOVSI AC,'dsk'

Notice the difference?   Does this help?


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 2,1983 18:53
...but actually, I think it generates MOVSI AC,0(lower 4 bits of expression)
where the (xxxxxx) is the index ac field.


From: CARL
Date: APRIL 2,1983 19:05
Ken,
  Take a quick look at page 29 in the sail manual... instructions take
the form of:

    <label>: <opcode>  <ac!field>, @<simple!address> ( <index> )

Page 29 also has the syntax and description of what is allowed in a
simple!address. Page 32 reminds us that it is NOT 'macro' or 'fail'.

On looking at the above mentioned, I see the problem.  The solution was
