I can't argue with that - it is clearly the right way to do it.  Can you make
it a .SHR file, please, and then put it in (XEXEC:39)MEXEC.MAC and

If LOGON gets "No such username" while trying to set special command processor
to (XEXEC)MEXEC (XEXEC does not exist on 58), it aborts with a fatal error

  Carl,
  Did Craig give you that software change request from Dan Wedge
  pertaining to f40 link ?? If so, Any status?
  jon
...
Jon,
  I don't recall receiving any requests from Craig.  Dennis mentioned
something to me about Fortran-10 & Link (I think), but I'm pretty sure
that this is the first I heard about F40 & Link.  My understanding is
that the 3rd phase of the F40 compilation is completed by special codes
in LOADER, and I do not know if LINK-10 handles that properly.  That is
the main reason why LINK-10 has not ever been considered as an official
replacement for LOADER.
  This entire issue needs further examination, and I will need some
clarification of what Dan Wedge is requesting and what he really needs.

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The security and integrity of our corporate information and 
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the    
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.
 
We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:   Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,  
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This   committee   developed  this  policy  for

               GENERAL POLICY ON NETWORK SECURITY
 
 
  I.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this policy is to provide safe-
      guards for the security and integrity of corporate informa-
      tion and customer information in our custody.  This policy
      is to be implemented by management and employees through
      appropriate administrative procedures and safeguards.
 
      For clarity, this policy will be separated into the 
      following categories:      
 
                    A.  NETWORK SECURITY
                    B.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES FOR CUSTOMER DATA
                    C.  PERSONNEL POLICY
 
 II.  POLICIES REFERENCED:  None 
 
III.  SCOPE:  This policy applies to our information and
      data and our customers'data that is stored and trans-
      mitted by TYMNET.
 
 IV.  A.  NETWORK SECURITY:
      
      Data security and network integrity are vital to our 
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.
 
      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.
 
      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:
 
          1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES
 
          2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
               COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS
 
          3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
               CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
               CHARACTER
 
 
          
 
     
          4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
               OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
               ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
               OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
               EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

          5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
               TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION
 
      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.
 
      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used 
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.
 
      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:
 
      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.
 
      Customers are required to use network security features 
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.
 
      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:
 
               1.  They are using the available features and
                   controls
               2.  They are committed to prosecute violators 
 
      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.
     
 
 
      C.  PERSONNEL
 
      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.  The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the
      procedures required to safeguard information.
 
      Computer access and privileges for each employee will be
      limited to those necessary for his/her job function.
 
      Maintaining the security of corporate assets is a part of
      everyone's responsibility, and execution of that 
      responsibility will be considered part of everyone's job
      performance.

Bill,
  It wasn't that I wanted anything special for ONTYME users of TUMS.
It was more like, someone setup in the (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT file found some
"new" ONTYME commands and setup things like command mode and alternate
prompts.  When the TUMS-ONTYME pulling program ran, it got confused and
it seemed like no one else in the file-list got any ONTYME mail until I
looked at the MAIL.LOG, noticed the problem and checked each user-ID on
ONTYME until I found the problem.
  I think the "pulling" program should break the circuit & continue with
the rest of the list whenever it gets really sick or confused...

Normally ONTMTP will just build another circuit, but if it doesn't understand
what the problem was, it can't really continue without fear of looping.  It
could all be made a little more intelligent, but I think you know...  Right
not it thinks the only thing that could cause a timeout is an Ontyme or
program problem so it decides to try again next hour.  I'll keep it in mind.

CARL,
I DIDN'T GET YOUR INFO ABOUT TUMS, SENDMAIL, ETC.  IT ALSO SEEMS
LIKE YOU DIDN'T GET MY LAST MESSAGE EITHER.

AS STATED BEFORE, A MICRONODE ON AN F3 DOES NOT READ THE RINGS,
THIS I DONE BY THE F3 MICROCODE.  THE INTERFACE TO THE F3
FROM THE MICRO-NODE IS JUST A 16 BIT REGISTER WITH 2 CONTROL BITS.
THE CODE YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IS THE TYMSRV.MAC CODE IN TENEX WHICH
HAS BEEN DOING RECOVERY FROM NODE AND HOST CRASHES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
I DO HAVE A PAPER COPY OF THAT IF YOU CAN'T GET ONE ONLINE.

Dennis,
  Sorry about the confusion... missing messages, etc.   I realize that
I seem to mis-comprehending something about the F3 bases, and when I
do understand it, it will knock me over, but...
  I know HOW we are currently synchronizing with the base when the host
comes up... it assumes the base is UP & RUNNING and it does the thing
with the 300 zeroes.  I'm assuming that that is how we would re-synch
by resetting the interface & sending the 300 zeroes and waiting for them
to be accepted (returned?).  What I'm having difficulty understanding
[WITHOUT SEEING THE TYMSRV SOURCES] is how the TENEX F3s know that the
base went away & they need to re-synch.  That's where I'm confused.
I'd like to see your paper copy of TYMSRV.MAC, thank you.  I can only
expect that they  use some kind of timeout & I'd like to know exactly
what they do to determine the base has gone, (or come back up).
/Carl

PS: Part of why I'm interested in this is not only to get F3's to make
    a graceful recovery from base crashes/glitches, but to be able to
    come up and handle the resynch at once-a-tick time instead of
    holding everything up until the base resynchs.

      data and our customers'data that is stored and trans-
      mitted by TYMNET.
 
 IV.  A.  NETWORK SECURITY:
      
      Data security and network integrity are vital to our 
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.
 
      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.
 
      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:
 
          1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES
 
          2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
               COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS
 
          3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
               CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
               CHARACTER
 
 
          
 
     
          4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
               OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
               ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
               OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
               EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

          5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
               TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION
 
      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.
 
      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used 
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.
 
      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:
 
      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.
 
      Customers are required to use network security features 
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.
 
      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:
 
               1.  They are using the available features and
                   controls
               2.  They are committed to prosecute violators 
 
      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.
     
 
 
      C.  PERSONNEL
 
      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.  The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the
      procedures required to safeguard information.
 
      Computer access and privileges for each employee will be
      limited to those necessary for his/her job function.
 
      Maintaining the security of corporate assets is a part of
      everyone's responsibility, and execution of that 
      responsibility will be considered part of everyone's job
      performance.

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 18 Apr 85 11:29:00 PST

Dennis,
  Sorry about the confusion... missing messages, etc.   I realize that
I seem to mis-comprehending something about the F3 bases, and when I
do understand it, it will knock me over, but...
  I know HOW we are currently synchronizing with the base when the host
comes up... it assumes the base is UP & RUNNING and it does the thing
with the 300 zeroes.  I'm assuming that that is how we would re-synch
by resetting the interface & sending the 300 zeroes and waiting for them
to be accepted (returned?).  What I'm having difficulty understanding
[WITHOUT SEEING THE TYMSRV SOURCES] is how the TENEX F3s know that the
base went away & they need to re-synch.  That's where I'm confused.
I'd like to see your paper copy of TYMSRV.MAC, thank you.  I can only
expect that they  use some kind of timeout & I'd like to know exactly
what they do to determine the base has gone, (or come back up).
/Carl

PS: Part of why I'm interested in this is not only to get F3's to make
    a graceful recovery from base crashes/glitches, but to be able to
    come up and handle the resynch at once-a-tick time instead of
    holding everything up until the base resynchs.

Carl,
    The TENEX code times out if it doesn't receive a message
in 60 seconds. The micronode code sends a type 1 message every 10
seconds if there is nothing to send.  If you did the same you
could detect the crash of the node.  The 300 zeros are to make
sure we haven't hung on a partial message.  The zeros are ignored
if they are not part of a message.  After the 300 zeros, then you
should go to automatic mode (resetting the ring pointers if the
micro-code doesn't) and just wait.  The reason we may have
gone down in the first place may have been a bad message from
the F3 which makes us do a one minute timeout, so make your code be
patient.  You do have to send the "specify host ports" 41 message
as the first message.  This is actually what gets to stop throwing
stuff away.  After that everything should be back up.

Subject: Micronode printer project

Dennis,
  Do you know what ever became of getting a working printer connected to
a pdp-11 base and being able to build a circuit to it to print stuff...

  I'd like to try setting up a terminal on one of the 554 ports, or on a
line coming out of one of the micronodes over here (if it needs something
special) and set my spooling program up to output to it.  There isn't any
"REAL" problem with addressing... (I was using :LP1@554, but can just as
well use :TRx@554)... My problem is that I want to be sure that the line
is setup properly for backpressure, or any otehr problems it may have on
the terminal side.  Right now, if I build a circuit, it picks 9600 baud
and I'd like to be able to select the speed, or run it at 2400 or 1200
instead of 9600.
  So, what can I do?  What are my options?

Dennis,
  Thanks!!!!!  That is exactly what I wanted to know.  Do you know of
any reason why sending each of those 300 zeroes can't be done at the
60th of a second clock tick.  I tried it, and it didn't seem to work.

SUBJECT:       NETWORK SECURITY POLICY
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The security and integrity of our corporate information and 
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the    
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.
 
We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:   Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,  
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This   committee   developed  this  policy  for 
my endorsement.  I strongly support it and the need for 
attention and vigilance in insuring that it is implemented.  
We  will be following this policy with appropriate procedure  
and auditing activities.  In particular the Personnel Security
Agreement for employees will be forthcoming in the near 
future.  There is much you can do at department level to insure
compliance with the policy.
 
Remember, safeguarding corporate assets is part of everyone's
job.
 
Questions about this policy should be directed to Wayne Bartlett,
Director, Data Security, at Orchard Parkway, San Jose.

                    Subject:  Company Property, dated 15 December 
                    1983.
 
 
Effective Tuesday, 23 April 1985, security guards have been 
posted in VG l, 2 and 3 between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 
8:00 A.M. Monday through Friday and 24 hours per day Saturday, 
Sunday and holidays.  The presence of a security guard during 
non-working hours will help assist in the control of McDonnell 
Douglas property and will create a safer working environment for 
employees who work after normal working hours.
 
The security guards are employees of California Plant Protection, 
Inc., (CPP) and will be uniformed in a blazer and slacks with the 
CPP emblem on their blazer pocket.  These guards have been hired 
to control MDC's assets leaving these three buildings and to 
provide security to employees working at night and/or on the 
weekend.
 
Reference (a) will be strictly enforced by the security guards to 
control all MDC property leaving VG l, 2 and 3.  A copy of the 
Property Removal and Return Authorization Form must be left with 
the guard or the receptionist in the lobby of the building from 
which the MDC asset is being removed.  No property may be removed 
through any other exits except the lobbies in VG l, 2 and 3.
 
Please disseminate the above information to all your managers and 
supervisors as soon as possible.  The security guards will 
enforce the control of assets, and no property will be permitted 
to leave VG l, 2 or 3 without proper authorization in writing in 
accordance with Reference (a).  Copies of the Property Removal 
and Return Authorization Form are available from Barbara McIntyre,
Ext. 6777, Fixed Asset Accounting.
 
Please call me at Ext. 6548 if you have any questions regarding 
the above.

Subject: TRW's host 33 on TRWNET. 

	They have a public network username, TRWNET.  It had been on
host 32.  It was moved to host 54, about one month ago.  They use the
network host for storing backup copies of files from their host 33.
Last week, when trying to TELECOPY a file from their host 33 to username
TRWNET on public network host 54, they received an unprecidented error
message that concerned them:  "MUST COPY FROM OR TO SYSTEM 123".

	TELECOPY on both public network hosts appears the same (same
checksum).  Do you know of some file or process which might have existed
on host 32 or somewhere esle in the public network which translated
reference to their host 33 to our host 123?  It appears that this had
previously been done, somehow.

	An alternative would be to convince them that Tymnet host 123
is, in fact, their TRWNET host 33 or the access to it.  They are
difficult to mollify, I understand from the A.C., so restoration of the
original automatic translation might be the preferable solution to their
problem.  Your recommendations would be welcome.

Thanks!
Dennis

I doubt very much if there is a problem with TELECOPY.  I'd more than
expect that something else is wrong (unless their copy went bad?).
Host 123 must be something on their network, since 123 is (was) a
supervisor on our net...

The procedure they should use is to use the GATEWAY command to get to
our network and then to one of our hosts.  The host number used in the
GATEWAY command is the host that they should be using to send/receive
data files, and 33 is the host they are sending/receiving from on their
network.

If this continues to be a problem, then I suggest that you get a username
and a password from the TRW A.C. so that we may login to their system and
try to copy stuff.  Please find out what monitor TRW is running, so we
can determine whether we need OPER privilages or not.  If they are at-least
running /J we are OK. (I think).  Anyway, as part of your packaging, are
we going to be sending TRW updates?
  I'd like them to have a /N10 monitor, or at least a /N with the right
fixes patched.  This requires a new LOGOUT as of /K.... etc.

I've just looked at the HELP output from TELECOpy.  Damn, I didn't know
about many of those capabilities!  I now know about the GATEWAY command.
I'll look into it further.  Thanks!  /D.

MAIL WAITING: why set the bit if the

Sorry for the 40 char lines.  I'm using

Craig,
  I would like to sign up for one of the 1-day MHP classes now, or in
the future, as time and resources allow.  This may be a good time with
their MHP for non-managers.
