Carl,

My VUE.INI file contains commands which are supposed to re-bind some
of the FINE commands.  Most of the work fine, but META-Z (reverse
scroll) sometimes gives me an ERROR rather than reverse scrolling for
me.  By sometimes, I mean always during certain sessions.  I.e.  if it
starts out giving ERRORs it always gives ERRORs, while if it starts out
reverse scrolling it never gives ERRORs.  I am not entirely certain,
but I believe that I have experienced both behaviors on 930 (there is a
small possibility that I may have experienced one behavior always on
one machine only).  Any ideas what is going on?

Thanks ... /Sherman

I try to work with VUE. The current version, version 1 does not works with
VT100 in ANSI mode. It works in VT52 mode but its slowest. I have an old version
(version 767) in SLISYS:90 wich works much better with this terminal. I suppose
the bug is when redefining scrolling regions. In all case and all versions,
multiple windows does not works when we redrawn the screen. If you have no time,
can you tell me where the error can be and we can try to fix this here, in P

I have updated the sources on (M33) to reflect all recent patches
that want to be in F33's monitor.  Specifically:

IOCSS - Add BFICLN fix which forces "previous context user" before trying to
clear user's input buffers, thus preventing STKAC crashes.

SCHED1 - Change AOS BADSS to STOPCD at PAGWK1+2 in yet another further
attempt to track down JBTPGO loop bug.

UUOCON - Always allow (SYS) programs to write to the CTY.
Logoff programs that SETNAM to EUTHAN (giggle).

FILRIB - Add hack at RIBEX2 to insure correct value for RIBSZS before trying
to expand RIB (to be removed when problem has been diagnosed more thoroughly).
Also count number of times each of the RIB expansion routines is called.

Note: the PAGWAK patch has been installed in SYSTEM.SAV on all KI's
and KL's (except D56, which was down).  There also exists a patch which
Ernie installed on C22 which eliminates block I/O buffer contention if
the host has a dedicated base (i.e., no other host connected to the
same base), which I don't believe has been added to the source and
probably shouldn't be just yet.
The only remaining bit of business is Todd's J21-1 patch.  Whenever
this has been added to the source, the F33 test monitor can go out.

 Have you read my mail about VUE ?

From: CARL
Date: JULY 29,1981 3:44
Bernard,
  Je have read votre mail, mais je have not done anything avec VUE since
June 1.  Je sais about trois ou quatre problems, mais je have been busy.

Avec VT100 terminals en ANSI mode, et en VT52 mode there seem to be many
problems avec le speed.  VUE turns "off" backpressure when it is started
et restores it (if it was set).  Le VT100 expects to be able to use XON et
XOFF and "that" causes the majority of the problems.

  Je n'ai pas un(e) VT100 a le moment, mais je can try whatever you are
doing and see if je can find a place to begin looking.

  Je plan to re-write quelque sections of le programme in the near future.
Mais je n'est pas planning to re-write the screen portion until version 3.

  Je n'ai pas tried multiple windows a le (la?) VT100, thus je cannot know
how well they work.  If you can make a short list of things for moi to
investigate, je can answer votre questions more easily.

Carl,

Bravo for your french.
I have some problems with VUE but I have no requirement for you to fix this.
I propose to look in the code if I have time and suggest solution to you, like
I do when I have some problem with the monitor. There is problems with XON/XOFF
but there is other problems with use of partial scrooling. I make a list of
what exactly happens in the next days. There is no urgency for this but we
have a new application to devlop in one month and i look what editor to teach
at this news internal users. I want to "seduire" people with PDP10 and software
on it. A video editor is a good approach to do this but it is not imperative.

I have an INIT program called LOGON which reads my SWITCH.INI and
sets the appropriate auxcals.  You may set you terminal to exactly
like mine by typing:

	.GF CARL
	.RUN LOGON
	.GF

The functions are as follows in this order (the order is important!):
	TTY LC,  TTY DEFER, TTY WIDTH 80, TTY BSD, TTY CRLF,
	TTY BACKSPACE, TTY ?(.AXRVX), TTY NO FORM, TTY ERASE,
        TTY NO DELAY,  TTY RBS (.AXRBS)

The only case when I come back over two characters is in monitor mode with

You have the same version as on P90 in (slisys:930) but without TECO.ERR and
other utilities on (SLIUTIL:90). This can be more easy to you.

From: SLISYS

ok, you do  "EVhp$" I try with "EVcrt$".
I have been some similar problems with VT100 also and I have changed some echo
caracters. I try to modify this and also a problem with ^D (delete word) which
works as delete word also after ^R. Now the only method to insert ^D is 4i$
which is not easy.
-Bernard.


From: CARL
Date: JULY 30,1981 6:19
Bernard,
  It probably is because of the "EVhp$" ...  although the documentation
gave me the impression that most of the terminals worked the same as
"EVcrt$" ... C'est la vie!  .... Anyway, if you are adding terminals,
it would be nice to have the HP-2621 added specifically, since it may
not be the same as the HP2640 (I think that is the one in the table?).
There is a file (CARL:118)HP2621.TXT which has the cursor commands listed.
I can copy it to 930 or 90 if you cannot read it on 118.
-Carl.


From: SLISYS
Date: JULY 30,1981 15:51
Yes, i can add HP2621 but i can not read on 118.
The bug is the cancel rubout sequence is:
	<backspace><space><backspace><backspace>
The good sequence must be only <backspace> (<backspace><space><backspace>
works also but is not usefull).
This happens on HP and CDC.
I fix this before tomorrow.
-Bernard.


From: CARL

  No need to hurry or worry with the delete problem on TECO, I was
just bringing it to your attention.  (CARL:90)HP2621.TXT has the
hp-2621 information in it.  Thanks.
-Carl.

P.S.  Do let me know about your problems with VUE.  I noticed that
you have 3 different versions on :90.  The one on SYS: is the same
as that everywhere else & is the one I am most interested in, but
you should not have had any difference between that version and the
just slightly older version.  I made no changes to the VT100 code.

TECO bug on cancel delete sequence is fixed in TECO.SHR on (SYS:90) and
(SLISYS:930)
Also ^D works like another ordinary control character after ^R.
There is a bug not fixed but knowed (my english is not sure ,known is
certainly better): the sequence: ^R<any char><esc><esc> does not works good
in any crt mode the result is good the first esc act as an ordinary char.
but the double esc act as a terminator and the command is executed immediatly.
In tty mode, this works good but ^R^R<any char><del><esc><esc> nead a third
esc to be executed.

You have to read ^R<any char><del><esc><esc> in place of ^R<any char><esc><esc>

The escape sequence used for HP2621 are the same as for HP2640. The other
possibility are not used. I have not inserted a new terminal but i can insert
the label HP2621 which point to the same table if you want.

Darren,
  The old RMXKON crashes were deleted at burlington, however, they made a
tape with the 38 crashes from last month.  I've sent a batch request to
Operations at Valley Forge, to try to locate the tape (it was taken there
since 654 was unavailable through the network).  I've also notified Dennis
Allen that we'd like the tape located.

  You might check system 1051 when it is up (it's down now) and see if there
are any over there.  These are the only two sites which I know of that have
had the RMXKON crashes prior to bills patch.

Date: AUGUST 10,1981 13:12
To start CHKPNT, R(MPL)RUNCHK.  If XEXEC crashed the system, it shouldn't
be up anyway (beware it detaches).  Anyway, I killed CHKPNT b+[cause I 
didn't want anybody writting on the disk.  Rule #1 which may never be broken
unless the consequences justify the risk...

NEVER WRITE ON THE DISK, OR RUN ANY PROGRAM WHICH WRITES ON THE DISK, OR SET
SCHEDULE 000000 FOLLOWING A CRASH WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY DSKCLN'D.
for a definition of properly DSKCLN'd, see (WRS)DSKCLN.DOC,
note that "programs which write on disk" include programs which exceed the
size of physical memory available to user programs, thus causing swapping.

I have patched the Burlington system so that the crashes at RMXADD+34 will
no longer occur.  I have also removed Bill's earlier patch wihch forced
page-aligned transfers.  There remains a problem wherein an exec mode page
fault occurs while in the ECC-correction code, however, this seems to
occur occasionally on most 2020 systems and there is no overt reason to think
that it will occur more frequently on S654 than anywhere else.  In my
opinion, Burlington may safely be put back on the air on their own system
at any time.

Not exactly part of the meeting, but in ref to calling ray donahue
it may be of interest to note that he has been found guilty of snarfing
software from 118 and possibly other places from gan 3 usernames.

In particular, ZORK with loading/patching instructions & re-transmitted
to many hosts as DSKMON.SHR/.LOW/.INS ... can be found on (DONAHUE) or
(OPER) as some program with a .SHR file with 57 pages of length.  Either
you, mike or sherman can tell him not to do it again... etc.

Also, the serial number patch... I believe there is something that you
have discussed, or already have added? that says what kind of hardware
the crash was from, eg. KI,KL,F3,2020... If not, it would be nice to
consider that as part of the serial number, to help insure that we don't
try to run KI software on a KL, etc.  (as we don't have any other real
control, except that the software 'might' crash).

nobody looks at it yet (CRSHID, etc) - between that and the serial number, we
should have a much better way of tracking crashes and matching them to symbol
files.  -Bill

Have you heard about the 24 problem regarding INITIA?  I don't have any guesses
as to what it would be at this point, but suspect that it is just a timing
problem - taking longer than expected to sync with node or such.  Anyway...
have you found the 2020 INITIA sources that everyone is running - its a
little more urgent now than the previous casual request.  -(oh no Mr.) Bill

Re: PCOM/ACOM/...

I need to talk to you about PCOM and /K and its potential use by other
people in the company.  I realize that nothing is guaranteed until /K
and maybe not even then,... but there are obvious reasons for trying to
allow other people to use it (when it's available) so that we don't have
50,000,000 people trying to write it themselves & coming to us with all
their problems.
  It also seems to be th eonly easy way to automate TYMCARE's EndOfDay

It should be safe to install both RMXKON patches in a /G monitor (I think).
Incidentally, have you heard anything about when Burlington is going back

finally done.  Ask Adele, she might know more from the TYMCARE meeting
last thursday.  Do you want the BADECC patch put into 675?

Do you know if fayez (370) has had any crashes for either RMXADD or
BADECC reasons?  (/G monitor there)  If so, then I'll patch it, else
maybe we can let it go until it gets a /J monitor (or /K).

Adele,
  I think that I will need a project heading for Initia, possibly one for
FILDDT ... unless you would prefer them to appear under IX,X,XX support?
That will tend to have a good percentage of my work if so... You decide.
Also, I will put the LOGOUT/GFD work under firefighting since that was
a fire.
-Carl.

Also, it isn't really support, but a possible project to try and sort out
the differences between the x's and xx's to make them as compatible as
possible.  At present, they aren't.


From: DARREN
Date: AUGUST 18,1981 5:23
I don't think we should care very much about 675 - with all the various sets
of packs floating around, it's unlikely that it runs the right monitor most
of the time anyway.  I don't have the exact numbers handy, but I recall that
Fayez has had more of the BADECC-type crashes than all the other systems
combined.  Not recently, I don't think, but still... /D

	I think the latest TITO sources are on (gadol:930).  They should be
checked against the latest transmittal to be sure before we alter any code.

	Wow! What do think the large file problem is?

	One of those different versions of TITO is the copy I had loaded
with the debugger yesterday -- so it's certain to have a differenct checksum
and shouldn't count.  I saw the TTY listing on your partition, and I don't
know why all the different ones.  Anyway, it's certainly time to change
the version number.

	I will probably put in a project to investigate the incompatibilities
between the X's and XX's.  If that results in work on specific programs, I'll
probably open up specific projects for them later.  Let me know what your
estimate is on total work on INITIA and FILDDT.  I might make them projects;
also we have to sort out some relative priorities here -- a lot of things seem
to be piling on before current ones are finished.

About 2+ but < 3 hours spent looking so far.

For TITO, about 3 hrs spent looking at code in TAP.MAC, but nothing looks
to be out of place.  (TAP.MAC) seems to do all the wild-card disk lookups
for files.  It does an extended lookup for each file and appears to stop
when the "IN" uuo in combination with the "STATx" uuo returns bad.

	TMS is having a problem on system 56 with the directory TMSDOC1.
Here's what I've found out so far.  There is one file in particular that
is bad -- tcal.mem.  I read all the files in the directory with CKSUM, and
it reports a system error on tcal.mem.  However the FNDBAD program doesn't
find it (or any other files in TMSDOC1), and the DELBAD program won't delete
it (and says it is a non RIB problem).  In addition, there seems to be a
problem with creating more storage on that directory.  For instance, RUNOFF
gets an ILL MEM REF when trying to process either "editor.rno" or "edit1.rno",
but I can run RUNOFF from my account and access the files in TMSDOC1 and
it goes OK as long as the output file is not in TMSDOC1.  I can also copy
files from TMSDOC1 successfully.  TMSDOC1 seems to have enough storage.
The only thing I could think of regarding storage is that perhaps RUNOFF
needs a large workspace -- I doubt that though.

	Could you take a look?  Pass it on to Bill's group if necessary.
The contact from TMS is Pete Myers (201-825-1100 or send mail to myersp:56).

SPOOL.GDF, spool.fdf, spool.map

I think that blank ones (no length) can be created with FET, and that should
work.  Otherwise, some existing files could be copied from another system.

Dearest Adele,
  I have another treat for you.  It is so wonderful, >hack< and so very

On 118, with fresh files, I can't get Dick Rawson's FORTRAN problem to
re-produce using the version of 5.6 that exists there.  Hmmmmm.

-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: AUGUST 25,1981 0:37
And the checksums match on that version of 5.6 spool as per the last
transmittal that jean put through.

methinks something is fishy with the files involved, rather than a
spool problem per se.  You were able to replicate the problem yourself
as I recall.  We will have to try that again.

A FORTRAN question:
  When using fortran carriage controls while printing, there are a few
'strange' codes which do things such as skip 1/2, 1/3, 1/6 of a page
(i.e. '2', '3', and '/' in particular).  Well, my question is... 

   "Do these skip 1/nth of a page from where they are, or do they skip
to the appropriate channel for 1/nth of a page stop, like some sort of
Vertical Tab skipping down to a Vertical Tab Stop???"

Also,...

   "Do you know the difference between '-' for triple spacing and '.' for
triple spacing with form feeds every 20 lines (20*3=60) printed???"

Re: Spool bug fixes.

So far, I have made four changes to fix potential problems in SPOOL,
and have tested the ones that I have the knowledge to follow through
on.  However, that is not all of them:

1.  Fixed  bad coding inside fortran line counting routine which lost
    the return address for the subroutine call while processing a '+'
    carriage control character.  {TESTED}

2.  Fixed mis-calculation of lines for off by pagesize modulo spacing
    to allow users to get 'free' pages every so often.  {code works,
    but I don't know where the spool accounting info is, so that I can
    verify that the records are written correctly!}

3.  Developed a check for 'empty' files which prevents anyone from
    passing an empty file off to spool at the 'request' level.  This
    is to prevent problems with spooling empty files to/from tape.
    {TESTED and it works!} 
4.  Fixed loophole where a user could specify a large page size while
    using standard forms and oly get charged for a 'few' pages while
    actually printing "MANY".  (I made the physical page size "stick",
    such that billable lines/pages are matched against that figure
    instead of what the user may have specified.)  {NOT TESTED, because
    I don't have any data files large enough that It would prove the
    point, and I don't know exactly where the accounting info is kept.}

I suspect that SPFIX or some such has some facility for checking these
records out... anyone have whatever pointers/programs I need to finish
checking out the fixes. ???

I am still checking into the GERMANY problems with the printing phase.

Patch #1 above fixes the FORTRAN option bug.

Bravo on the SPOOL fixes!

The accounting information . . .  The easiest way to check may be to run the
SPFIX "compare" option which checks SPOOL's data bases against the batch
files in (*1BATCH).  It puts out a report of the records which differ and
then fixes the (*1BATCH) files.

But beware!  There has been a bug in SPOOL for a long time (unless you just
fixed it) which results in a few of the counts being different (between SPOOL's
data bases and the (*1BATCH) stuff) for remote requests.  This is one of the
reasons that SPFIX is run near month-end.  So if you find some differences,
look closer before assuming it is a newly introduced problem.

The actual files with the SPOOL charges in them may be any of the following
files in (*1BATCH) whose formats are basically the same:
	rmtsss.mmm, parchg.dat, or splchg.dat
			/where sss=system no.  and mmm=3-char. month
(Mike, Lois -- please correct me if I'm wrong.)  I think that parchg.dat
and splchg.dat harbor the transactions for the operator adds postage charges
with RCHARG or BCHARG.  There is some documentation on the format of these
files in the cabinets under BCHARG.  It may also be on-line (Mike -- do you
know where?).

Re:  SPOOL accounting

To check it out, you need debugging versions of both Spfix and Spool.  
Using SPOOL, you can print the requests--easist way to get a full-blown
test is to ASSIGN TTY LPT and get the request printed on your terminal
(saves messing with a printer).  
Then you can use the COMPARE command in SpFix to see if there are any
inconsistencies, though as Adele pointed out, we suspect some in Remote
requests anyway, so no big deal for those if they are off by small
amounts.							/Mike

Did you know that:
1.  Spool doesn't count fortran lines correctly.
2.  Spool doesn't handle printing fortran lines correctly in "all" cases,
    but it does seem to be ok for most non-fancy printing.
3.  Lister doesn't handle fortran controls to the printer correctly.
4.  All of the above can only be determined by trying each one out on
    multiple machines using different printers and using dsk as an
    alternative so that you can see the data.
5.  Even if the program handles the printing correctly (which they don't!)
    --none-- of our printers are setup properly to handle the fortran
    printing in the first place.  The carriage control tapes on our printers
    (including the ones in our cupertino center) only use channels 1 and 8,
    i.e. top-of-form and single-space.
6.  As per (5), the printer hangs if you try anything real, such as printing
    directly to a printer from a fortran program, because the printer loops
    through the carriage tape looking for a punch in channels 2-3-4-5-6-7, etc
    and of course, doesn't find anything.
7.  There is a GOD.

2.  Spool doesn't handle printing fortran lines correctly in "all" cases,
    but it does seem to be ok for most non-fancy printing.
3.  Lister doesn't handle fortran controls to the printer correctly.
4.  All of the above can only be determined by trying each one out on
    multiple machines using different printers and using dsk as an
    alternative so that you can see the data.
5.  Even if the program handles the printing correctly (which they don't!)
    --none-- of our printers are setup properly to handle the fortran
    printing in the first place.  The carriage control tapes on our printers
    (including the ones in our cupertino center) only use channels 1 and 8,
    i.e. top-of-form and single-space.
6.  As per (5), the printer hangs if you try anything real, such as printing
    directly to a printer from a fortran program, because the printer loops
    through the carriage tape looking for a punch in channels 2-3-4-5-6-7, etc
    and of course, doesn't find anything.
7.  There is a GOD.
    (There must be, for this company to still be making money!)

Well,
  SPOOL has been around since at least 1975 or early 1976.  LISTER has
probably been broken for much longer than that.  NOONE has made a point 
in all that time of complaining about FORTRAN printing just not working
at all.  So either our customers don't complain (hard to believe!) or
they must not use fortran carriage control very much.  I don't think it's
worth worrying about very much.  I know it's very frustrating, but since
we haven't had lots of complaints, it just can't be causing users a lot
of trouble for whatever reason.  				  /Mike

P.S. SPOOL is a known Turkey.  LISTER is one of those things that has been
hacked into near-oblivion.  A good example of hack maintenance, and why
we try to be careful when we make changes to programs.  ('Cause if you
don't, you wind up with messes like LISTER).

From: CARL

Well, at least SPOOL will count lines properly now.
(It might even print them properly, when I finish fixing the 72 lines

The following numbers have been added to (M33)PHONES:

Bubbnet 3/1 1160	415/446-7300,7301,5141	(private use only!)
VG2 lab net 103 554	415/446-7296		(emergency use only!)
VG2 lab net 3/1 554	415/446-7297		(emergency use only!)

Feel free to use the Bubbnet lines when the normal Tymnet rotaries are
busy or when ever else you feel like it.  They are strictly for our
section and Natalie's section (I suspect they'll not use it much).

Please only use the Nexelis lines for emergencies!  I have made a 
special agreement with Dennis to let us use the two numbers connecting 
to the 554 Nexelis node in the VG2 machine room so we can access 930
when Tymnet is down, out or shut.  They may be used to access 930 when 
firefighting if it is impossible to access it otherwise.  Please do not 
use them for normal development, etc.  

If we have problems with the other ports being busy, we can make 
arrangements to get more phone lines.  One option is to have everyone's 
terminal line connected to a modem as well so each person would have 
his own "private" number to access Bubbnet.

Note:
  1. these numbers do not hunt in spite of the fact some of them appear
	in sequence
  2. 3/1 is a Vadic 3 in 1 modem - will work with 103,212,912 and Vadics
  3. 103 is your typical run-of-the-mill 300 baud modem


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 8,1981 4:16
I noticed that one of the 554 lines was a 103 (300 baud) line.  Is that going
to be upgraded to a 912?

also, I'll check on it,but from bubbnet, I believe that 118 is host 67
so it might be worth our while to see if we can be validated on bubbnet
via our regular usernames.  We can always use "probe" since it has a well
known password... but that's not a good idea.

No.  It would have to have a second node to do that.  The same way that

Why doesn't VUE complain if the .BAK file already exists rather than just
clobbering it as it does now?  This is most unpleasant program behaviour
for those of us who are in the habit of naming previous versions of files
with the extension .BAK.  Also, why does it leave the MAIN.VUE file around?
Is there some good reason why it doesn't clean up after itself?


From: CARL

I don't know of any editor which uses .BAK and tells the user that it
is overwriting it, however since it doesn't overwrite it until you exit
or save your current state ($X Save File, ^X ^S), I guess I can have it
tell you so that you don't clobber yourself.

As far as MAIN.VUE, and cleaning up after itself, no reason except that
it was written that way by the FINE people to leave MAIN.FIN and I just
changed the extensions to VUE.  When I rewrite that part to do a couple
of things correctly that is's doing wrong now, I will make it clean up
after itself.  I also have to fix it so that more than one user in a single
account can edit a file (even different files don't work at present) let
alone files with the same 'first' name.

Hi!  I do hope that I didn't wake your husband last night when I called.
I was about to hang up as he answered, so my apologies if I did wake him.

I'm sending this note as both an 'apology' (if needed) and as a reminder,
(as if you needed reminding)... in case you logged in before you cane into
work.

  I remembered that Barbara had liked "On A Clear Day" and thought that
you might have the music for that show lying about somewhere (neatly put
away somewhere, so organized you are...) and wondered if you might be
so kind as to let me borrow it to use to audition with.  (otherwise, I
guess I could spend part of tomorrow out looking for a copy of it...).

  Anyway, I almost auditioned tonight (last night), except that (as you
may hear soon enough), I went to Kirk's to get a quick bite before heading
off to the theatre, & just as I was leaving, I ran my car into another one
waiting to make a left turn leaving the golf course.  What FUN!  Anyway,
I'm still a little shakey, noone was hurt, but... OH MY.. WHAT FUN!!!...

  If you don't have the music, don't worry... I may try it anyway.., or
see if it can be bought.. I'd like a copy of the music eventually myself
to go with my 'xerox'ed script.

I now have three outstanding requests & I guess need confirmation from

what is/will be the support status of ASP.  Since it is being used, Mike

the level of support we will provide.  Jacques need to know, so as to
determine whether to document it in the 2020 manual.

Re: ASP support
So, class III... fine, should it be put into the 2020 guide that Jacques
is writing?  It is being used, for 24, both tymcare systems, and I suspect
on one or more of the other 20's.  (Although there are only a couple more).

I talked to Dennis Allen, and they have written operator cook-book directions
for ASP, and depending upon what we'd like to see in the 2020 manual, if
anything, then we should decide.  Maybe it would be best to bring this up
at the monitor meeting (since Mike might want to discuss class III vs. it's
in use and depended on by various people as their only backup.).  I'll leave
that up to you... whether to add it to the agenda or not.

Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not advocating that it be supported at all.
I realize that it was a hact that only Ernie touched, but I'm supposed to
give an answer to Ben & Jacques that we're not going to be changing our
minds about in the near future.  (I'm in the middle of this & I don't want
to be. -- Mike said to check with you... but...).

Dennis Allen is checking with Sal Barbagallo about whether or not it would
be ok to maybe give some of that to Jacques... I'll let you know... The

things too... things I recall you were spending a lot of time on with

Re: ASP in 2020 manual.

As per WRS, the ASP program is a class III support project,
and although it is in use at present, it needs a lot of work
before it should be anything other than class III.  Thus, it
should not go into the manual that Jacques is writing.

Comment:  Since there are also other programs in this class that
are in use, it might be a wize idea to have Jacques have a separate
section for Utilities, which would be update-able for products as
they become supported.  Thus, we do not spend inordinate amounts of
time deciding if a utility is supported, just because it should be,
rather than because it really is.  (eg. ASP).

I will tell Jacques that ASP should be left out of the manual at
this time...  same same to Ben Russell, until such time as the work
necessary is scheduled and completed.

You can phone if you want more information, or just show up for the class(s)
you are interestid in.  Monday's class begins next week, the other two started
this week, but it won't matter.

Did you try out for "Kiss Me Kate".  Meg felt her dancing went well, but not 
her singing, and that there were alot of good dancers.  I guess she will know

  Ah well... Yes!  I did go over on Wednesday to audition.  I called
the library in San Jose (after stopping at the Sunnyvale library first,
and finding that none of the smaller libraries had any music material,
??? I'm not sure...), and they had just what I was looking for.  So I
went down & picked up the musical selections book they had and went off
to audition, again arriving about 8:20.  

  Gee!  Was I nervous! ... Anyway, my singing was nervous and not as
good as some that I had already heard...  I don't know what anyone else
thought of it... The people said that they liked my voice..

  I think the reading went much better... I'll let you know what I hear
from them.

  In any case, not as bad as I had thought it would turn out...

      I really can't complain.

Mike indicated  that an experimental monitor was required to run PCOM and that
you would probably be setting it up on 654 for us.  If you do, please establish
it as (sys)tstmon.sav so that we can change the running monitor back and forth

you doing working (or are you working ) on a Saturday night.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 12,1981 21:52
Who Me?  Working?  No... you must be kidding.

Yes, I did hear about the audition.  I didn't make it into the show.
But, I was asked to show up monday night to talk to the tech director
to work on the show.  So, unless something drastic happens, I'll most
probably work on the show anyway.

  How did Meg do?  Do you know if she got into the show or not?

  I'm just tying up my phone line while I clean up my apt.  Gee, it
hasn't been cleaned in a month.  However, I will probably go over to
the center to test out my new SPOOL, to see if I broke anything.  I
really can't test it easily on 118, since the carriage controls are a
little different.  (only slightly).

  Why do you ask (about working?), is Saturday any different than any
other night of the week?  [Besides, I'm broke... I didn't get to the
bank this week, so I have to last on $4 till monday, and $3 of that will
probably go for skating on sunday night. {Sigh}]

Saturday and Sunday--which is very nice!

Hope your SPOOL works.

Well,
  you always get messsages in parts if you try to read them while they're

Yeah, Saturdays are different, but when you don't have anything special
planned, or anyone close to go out with, even just to keep company, it
doesn't make much difference.

It gets lonely, unless I work or something.  I'm not sure that I'm the
'go out and meet new people in strange places' type.  Maybe, if I go
with someone that I know... but,  I guess you know what I mean anyway.

Re: SPOOL /CENTER vs. /REMOTE,NODE=nnnn

I realize that this is an absurd question... but rather than attempt to
explain what I think I understand, could I ask both of you to comment
briefly how that works.  I realize that /center/remote is a bit field
which controls what happens to a request... but I'm not quite sure that
I understand how it knows about which CENTER its to be printed in, eg.
DALLAS, CUPC, FREMONT, etc...  Such that what 'would' happen if you
asked for something on F33 to be printed at CENTER without FREMONT in
SPOOL as a print lo{ation?
-Carl.


From: MCH
Date: SEPTEMBER 13,1981 16:12
SPOOL (using NODPRI) defaults to remote printng (provided the node you
come in through is defined there).  Using that, the address is looked
up in PRIADR.  But if the node is not defined, then SPOOL goes to the
center.  Using CEN forces the request to the center.  The node=nnnn
in effect says "pretend like I'm coming in through that node and treat
me accordingly".  (So in the special case where you use an undefined
node number you wind up spooling to center anyway).         

Without Freemont in the table, all that happens (fortunately in this
case) requests will still go to the center.  But the user won't be
given an address or phone number.  This is blind luck in this
particular case.						/Mike

From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 13,1981 19:12
Thanks,  I suspected most of that, but wanted confirmation.  Let me make
sure I do have it right...  For any node, not in PRIADR it defaults to
CENTER, otherwise it will try the print location assigned to that node.
Such that, normally from node x, it goes to center 'cause x is not in
PRIADR, but if I'm in NY one day and use node y which says spool it to
NY node z, then automagically it will appear in NY even though I may have
forgotten and really wanted it to CENTER.  Of course, NODE=Z and CENTER
would over-ride the defaults.

	A spool CENTER request is printed on the computer on which the
request was spooled or on another in the same center (if the operator puts
the request on tape).  A REMOTE request is queued for a particular
printer location based upon the user's login node.  The NODPRI file contains
this mapping, so that SPOOL makes the proper defaults.  The user can direct
output to a different printer location by using the NODE switch.
	CENTER implies the system printer, whereas REMOTE implies a remote
printer location.

Re: Ranier Bank problems

I talked with Neil Holman today, via Gary Wolf and found out what the
story was with INITIA, etc.  They had some kind of problem today
with bringing up the system, I suspect something wrong with accessing
disk, or some such.  I told them to have DEC come out and check over the
disks again, since they were having some problems a few weeks ago.

As per INITIA, that one time, that they crashed after Darren had put a
CRASHID on sys, they received :24's "initialization failure" message, and
Ben talked them through KMC loading...

  Since then, that problem HAD gone away.  The "initialization failure"
problems that we were hearing about through Ben were from, Ranier Bank
not waiting long enough for the Host to synch with the Net, and when they
would login, they would have to set the date & time.  That's it.  Gary
is supposed to keep me up-to-date on their ?disk problem, and I will let
you know if there's any other problems.

I keep hearing things from our 2020 sites, (eg. Dennis Allen, Ben Russell)
about waiting for "impending" software releases.  In particular, both on
:24 (Otis) and :654 (Tymcare) neither group seems to know anything about
the release/transmittal of the RELOAD program that LOIS worked on while
Greg was still here.

  I realize that this is an "Ed Imsland"/"Saltyron's Group" type question,
but... I'm interested if someone could follow this up and find out about
RELOAD's transmittal.  Dennis Allen said he received a TSR back from his
people which said "INQA 30-Jun-81, OUTQA 30-Jun-81, SPP" but they do not
have anything else.  (In particular, this was the DSKCLN-mode fix to the
RELOAD program).

  We need to do something to standardize out X-XX's to run as similar as
possible software so that we do not get into a "Lockheed"-type support
problem.  We already have "too many" differences which aren't documented
now.

Tymcare seems to never have gotten any info about it either...

Re: Tymcare request.

Bill, we have received a request from TYMCARE, via Dennis Allen & Sal
Barbagallo via written memo (at my request) for a test monitor for
system 654 (Burlington) along with the current "preliminary" version of
PCOM (including any available documentation: internal or external).

They are basically needing a PCOM-like product to allow for the END-OF-DAY
process which they are trying to automate.  Since they are off-the-air at
burlington until they finish doing the end-of-day stuff, this is somewhat
important to allow them to have a "test" system.

They understand that it is only a test monitor and should not be used for
any tuype of production...

I need to know what kind of changes need to be done to the configuration
files as per PTY's, etc..  also, where is the "best" copy of the PCOM
stuff to let them use.

Lois, ... I'd like you to follow up on this, since I have been busy trying
to get SPOOL off my back.  Let me know if there are any complications?
Eg. Making a monitor from (m33) for 654 with ++PTY's added, etc.  The
memo's that you ran off the other day for Mike and I have the directions
for what filename to put the monitor into on 654.

out of a large number of spool requests, we may only find a few which

Re: ONCDSK

II looked at ONCDSK to see if there was anything that we could do
easily about the "DSKCLN"/"DISOLVE" problem.  ONCDSK is only gotten
to by typing FILES, and it does a bunch of preliminary setup before
you do any of the commands.  To make DSKCLN work from "outside" of
FILES level, I believe that that stuff must also be done before just
duplicating the DSKCLN code.

The other alternative would be to (temporarily) do what we did for the
REFRESH code.   I'd be willing to do that, or to even figure out how
to fit DSKCLN into ONCE...

Anyway, let me know if it's all right to start looking into that, since
it should be a trivial enough patch.
-Carl.


From: WRS
Date: SEPTEMBER 21,1981 1:28
Probably the way to put DSKCLN into ONCE is to have the FULL command set
a flag somewhere that gets looked at at the appropriate time.  It doesn't
need to do all the stuff that ONCDSK does since it doesn't need to read/
write the home pages.  In that sense, it will not exactly behave like the
DSKCLN command in ONCDSK which we will still want to keep around.  The
FULL command will force FULL DSKCLN this bringup only, whil DSKCLN in ONCDSK
forces FULL the next time, even if the packs get unmounted and moved.  The
FULL command would behave exactly like GO except that it would always do a
full DSKCLN regardless of what was specified earlier by the monitor or ONCDSK.
(thats one project: add FULL command to ONCE)

The other project is to change all the commands in ONCDSK to print a brief
explanation of the function performed and then ask for are you sure.  eg:
>FILES
*DSKCLN
ALTER DSKCLN MODE, ARE YOU SURE?
Also, change all ONCDSK commands to require exact match (no abbrev).  
[when I say all I really mean all except LIST and HELP]
(thats project two: add confirmation to ONCDSK)

The last project is to add confirmation to FILES command in ONCE.  eg:
>FILES
COMMANDS IN THE FILES SUBSYSTEM MAY PERMANENTLY DAMAGE THE STRUCTURE
IF USED IMPROPERLY, ARE YOU SURE?
(thats project three: restrict ONCDSK access)

Gee, I think thats everything, feel free to look in to any or all of these
as you feel up to it.  You should talk to Todd about how to best do the
FULL command.  Please check with me when you decide what to do (will also
want hour estimates).

RE: ONCE/ONCDSK

ACCESS"...

Sounds reasonable.   6 hrs is probably a good estimate also.
1 hr of research so far indicates that.  Just need to decide
what is best way... Will also be moving REFRESH patch to one
central place.  Lack of understanding the last time has it in
a few places inside conditionals for each cpu & it could be
moved outside to the very beginning without any repercussions.

Will let you know when done. tc.

Could you please restore the files from the last VUE transmittal into
directory (YEUX) on system 930, and let me know when this is done?

I suspect the version number of the transmittal was 1.0  but am not
sure.  However, there has only been 1 transmittal, so that should be
easy enough to find.

Re:  Yesterday...

Lois,
  as far as the situation back east goes, the only people that really know
much of it are you, bill and greg to varying degrees, (I think in that order).
That is, you know more than anyone else does...  Other people know that there
was something between me and the girl on my dartboard, and others just know
that she (on the dartboard) was some girl I "used to" know.  The subject does
come up, and I do sometimes say something about it, but I tend to evade really
giving any details.  Most people have heard the same glossed-over version a
few times.
  otherwise, people may know that I'm upset from time to time, and that's it.
If there's more than that going on..., I really don't know.
  (oh yes, Janice knows about as much as you do... hardly any more)

  It really is upsetting, and I'm sorry, but nothing I seem to have done
really helps.  This whole thing just happenned at a "bad" time.  I had spent
almost 6 years with very little (moUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU(moUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU(moUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU(moUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU(yMxD?ky|`+~~`Gt~ ... (I just lost my connection) ...
   I had spent almost 6 years with very little (mostly None) help trying to get over other emotional
hurts.  I was finally beginning to feel that I had some friends that cared.
That was after 10 years total time...  So when all this happenned, it just
threw out everything I had accomplished, making everything just HURT more
and more.

  I know that Francoise and Jim aren't responsible for that and it's just
so difficult, because they did help make everything fall apart, just because
of a BIG misunderstanding, which no one cares about.

  OK?   Look, I'm doing everything I can to keep from being overwhelmed
(however that's spelled) by it all, but there isn't a lot anyone else
can do until it stops hurting...  except try and make me feel wanted,
and to just be my friends.

  That's about the jist of it, and I'm sorry.  I can't ask anyone to do
those things, because It's both embarrassing and unless I tell them WHY,
it gest misunderstood.

Adele,
  Re: SPOOL

  The patch I suggested works, but in testing it, I found another bug
or (possibly feature) which exists in spool as already running...

It seems to ignore SPECIAL FORMS unless you explicitly use the PRINT FORM
command.  If there are 2 kinds of forms and you say print, then after
it asks what kind of paper and you answer SPECIAL, it goes and prints
on whatever hte other type of forms is.  If you don't read it carefully,
oooppps!  you've just printed some regular request all over your special
forms.

Now that that is a "KNOWN" problem.... I think it ought to be fixed if it
can be done in one day... that would help save the company lost of $$$ in
lost revenues due to operations screw-ups, and forms lossage while spooling.

Your opinion?

because my expectations about things like that seem to be much higher

Mostly, I don't know what to say to show that I appreciate it.  Thanks!

we still have nice weather.

Lois, do you still have the (MPL) (SYS) (...) directory listings we
started to look at/talk about at our last unit meeting?

From: LOIS

Anytime Monday is fine with me.  Yes, I still have the directories.

What did you do about system numbers on 118 when you were working on
spool.  Did you just use 18?  System 74 was brought up, but the network
wouldn't recognize it (so you couldn't log in) so its name was cahnged--
oops changed to 108, which creates problems for spool.  Does spool ever
check the system number anywhere?  I think not, but spfix does.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 26,1981 20:23
Well...
  118 got truncated to 18 on system 118.  I suspect tha same will happen
on system 108 .. ie. 08 or simply 8.  Did they give any details about
why 74 was not recognized by the network.???

I don't kow what SPFIX will do...  I never tried it on 118.

Have you heard any more about 819 or 38... otehr than 74 not working?

From: LOIS
Date: SEPTEMBER 26,1981 20:37
Carl,
Sherman asked that all of GAN 3 directories be put on the new system,
and suggested system 36, which is why that is there.  That is why you
have all your stuff from 36 on 108.

I do not know why the network did not recognize 74, and Adele, Todd,
and bill also do not know.  Operations is supposed to contact network
control about it.

Risk does not seem very exciting.  Where is Zork?  Does it have any
instructions?  Risk did not, which made it slightly confusing.

Bill,
  In reference to the PICTURE files which I was printing... I looked
at the file itself and could find no reason for it to glitch.  It also
did not glitch in the same place on either printout.  (I checked very
carefully).  I am beginning to wonder if there is a problem with the
printer or the printer driver while doing simio...  I'll look into it
a little more and let you know what I find out.
-Carl.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 28,1981 20:33
...In fact, it doesn't even glitch reliably in the same place using
the same program... TYPE directly glitches differently than TYPE doing
the conversions to an output file then printing the output file normally.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't mean to jump to conclusions, but I suspect that my suspicions
about LPTDRV may not be tooooo unfounded.   Please include that with
your other printer driver/simio problems to peruse.

Scott,
   was there ever a definitive attempt to write down what the
acceptable format of a SWITCH.INI file was?  If so, do you have
an on-line document of the sort?  If not, will you please read
my feeble attempt in (CARL:930)INI.FMT and comment on it briefly.

I'm considering writing a routine to return a string which is the
result of scanning SWITCH.INI for a particular product name with
and without a modifying option.  (Possibly even processing the
info such that the option line merely "modifies" the defaults that
are given as "unmodified" product-name lines).

The user would then have the responsibility for munging the string
himself in whatever way desired, but won't have to hassle with
getting the info out of the SWITCH.INI file.

All has been "quiet" as compared with Friday.  I don't know how much you
became involved, if at all... but with the exception of the TYMCARE
people not being able to get onto 934 (because the network thinks it
is a customer site... non-tymshare) all seems to be shipshape.  We are
going to have Ed Gaucci change the status of 934 to make it a regular
Tymshare host (as per Bill) ... Lois is taking care of it.  ... Did you
ever get to the tymsheets done for the past couple of weeks?  Dave has
reported that his are done, but you might double check before you go
ahead and process them.
  We really need to have them a week ahead of time... I think.  That way,
you can fill them in as you go, rather than wait till the end of the week
or till a week or so later... check with bill, but I think that the only
problem there is "emergencies" and I suspect that that's easy to work
around.
-See you tomorrow (today) sometime.
--Carl.


From: CARL
Date: SEPTEMBER 29,1981 1:17
As per my "week ahead of time" message, it really ought to be stated
separately.   Since we're not supposed to be working on projects which
aren't on the charts already, I propose that if we have the TIM files
a week ahead of time, then we can fill them in as-we-go.  If something
comes up to work on during that week, it is misc, or general support, or
fire-fighting/problem-solving.  If it carries into the next week, then
it ought to be decided on as a valid project, and then any "new" time
spent on it gets classified correctly.  Thus, the number of projects
should remain relatively small except for "scheduled" things, and separate
items which we could go back and "break-out" before the TIM file is processed.

Let me know what you think of the idea, and if it is possible to get things
to a point to distribute the TIM files ahead of schedule?

The ucode tape that Lois generated today may not include Ernie's
latest mods.  In fact, it may be the same as 420, but with new 
creation date, etc.  The reason I'm thinking this is that the

Re: SPFIX

I wouldn't spend any great deal of time on this, but SPFIX doesn't put
the command that the user enters, into the SPLLOG.mmm file.  It would be
nice to see both the entered command and the output instead of just the
output.

Also, the HELP text from "?" ought to be excluded, since nothing is being
done, just typing a help text... and unless you're super familiar with
the options, you might type it a few times... thus it appears an awful lot
in the log file.
