Dennis,

Let me introduce myself via Ontyme. I'm Greg Marus, and I work primarily
with our Japanese affiliate, Kokusai Tymshare, Ltd. (KTL). Recently,
with all the changes going on related to the Tymnet-II conversion,
KTL has had a number of problems, one of which involves a program called
BIONIK. BIONIK is a katakana-compatible version of the BIONIC program.

I spoke with Carl Baltrunas about the problem, and Carl said that he and
you were the two people who might be able to look at the thing to
try to get it in line with the new bases, HSA, etc. Carl said that he
would give you the gist of our phone conversation when he next saw you,
but he didn't know if that would be soon or not, so I'm sending you this
memo to give you at least a little warning and background.

I'll include both of you on any further correspondence with KTL about
BIONIK, and I'll pass on to you a memo I got from KTL today which
contains the source code for (what they think is) the current version
of BIONIK.

Any help you can give on this would be greatly appreciated; they've
had customers undable to use BIONIK for a while now.

Thanks and best regards,

Greg

Carl, Dennis--per my memo J84843, here is a copy of the latest memo I got
from Japan re BIONIK. The original message number was A77317. Again, thanks
for all your help.

GREG,
     
I HAVE FOUND SOURCE OF BIONIK TODAY.    
THIS SOURCE PROGRAM'S TITLE IS " TEST INPUT FROM 2780 USING NETWORK   
REMOTE BATCH". 
I THINK THIS IS SOURCE OF CURRENT BIONIK.    
BUT PLEASE CHECK.   
AND PLEASE CONTACT WITH MR. PHIL SPIES AND CREATE 
APROPREATE BIONIK OBJECT.
I WILL ATTACH THE SOURCE.
     
THANKS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kamoi-san, Saeki-san,

Thank you for your memos on BIONIK. I am sorry it has taken so long for
me to do anything about it. All I can say is that it has been an
extremely busy and difficult week for everyone here in the U.S., also.

Today I talked with several people about the BIONIK (and BIONIC)
situation. For everyone's benefit, I would like to sum up a few
points:

1. Kamoi-san, I think that Phil Spies is not the person who is responsible
for BIONIC--I think that Carl Baltrunas (and maybe Dennis Coffey) are the
people who work with BIONIC. I spoke with Carl today, and I have passed
copies of your memo on BIONIK source (A77317) to Carl, Dennis, and Gary.
I am also copying Phil, Gary, and Dave Smith on this memo, because all
the products--BIONIK, BIONIC, new HSA, and the base--all have to work
properly together.

2. Gary Masters reports that there are still BIONIC (as well as BIONIK)
problems. Gary says that, with the new HSA, BIONIC works sometimes, and
other times does not work. (He says that BIONIC will work properly all
the time if you come through one of the old HSA nodes.)

3. Aki Saeki says that BIONIK will not work, either through the new
HSA or the old HSA. Aki says that he was able to get BIONIK to work
once, when he tried it at about midnight JST (=0700 PST). This situation
                                                                Page  2

has been going on for about a week--i.e., the problems started at the
end of the last weekend in November.

4. Just some speculation on my part:  one thing that both the BIONIC
and BIONIK problems have in common is that both programs do not fail
100% of the time. Perhaps there is  something in the critical path
(host-base-network-HSA node) that breaks down now under "heavy" loads--
perhaps a timer or some kind of counter?

5. Something else about the BIONIK problem to me seems very strange:
according to KTL, they are having the problem on all hosts, both
when they go through the new and old HSA in Tokyo. However, I just
checked with operations, and found out that host 57 still has it's
Varian base, not a Tymnet-II base. This means that KTL can try to
use BIONIK (which has not changed) through a Varian HSA node to get to
a PDP-X with a Varian base--and BIONIK still fails???

Aki--can you confirm this point for us?

Anyone--can anyone think of something else that has changed recently
that could cause this? If we could pinpoint what is fouling up
BIONIK even in a Varian-Varian path, I think we might have a clue to
all the BIONIC(K) problems.

6. One more question for KTL and for Gary: what exactly do you mean when
you say that BIONIC(K) doesn't work? Does it disconnect? Does it hang and
not do anything? Does it transmit garbage? Or what?

7. KTL-san--now that you have the source code for BIONIK, you can try
to make some test versions that will work properly. If you want to
change the code, compile it, and test it, you may be in the position to
solve the problem yourselves. (In fact, I am not sure if it was TUS or KTL
that modified BIONIC into BIONIK several years ago.)

Carl and Dennis--with all the changes being made to the net, the bases,
and HSA, I don't think we can bank on KTL making the fix themselves. Maybe they
will get lucky, but maybe they won't. Anything either of you can do to get
BIONIK up and runnning again would be greatly appreciated--KTL has customers
out there who need to use BIONIK in production systems, so the matter is
quite urgent.

Look forward to hearing from everybody on this one.

Thanks and best regards,

Greg

Bionic does not work in the following manner...

If one watches the batch run from the remote end the run appears to
go normally up to and including the point where the "FILE NAME" is provided...
this should be followed by receipt of "READY FOR INPUT" from the host... 
instead what is (sometimes) received is

READY FOR INPUT 
 
 

0 RECORDS INPUT

and of particular importance is that these two records are received in the SAME
block... since the remote station is dependent upon receipt of either the
"READY FOR INPUT" string or its terminating (EOT) as its signal to begin
transmitting data any, situation in which the signal to begin transmitting
data and the notification that no data was received are received by the
remote station at the same time although presumably NOT sent by the host 
at the same time would appear to be the result of variations in network
performance.

Some additional comments on the BIONIC problem...

BIONIC does work with OLD Varians, but somewhat differently than I remember...
following receipt of READY FOR INPUT and the transmission of the data file
I have received several (4 I believe) 80 character lines (apparently the first
several lines of the file being transmitted being echoed back to me preceeding
the (n) LINES INPUT message... the data transmitted was received intact... 
apparently part of it went to two places.

BIONIC appeared to work fine from the period when Phil Spies included the
YELLOW BALL patches intended to fix a previous BIONIC problem until the
aftenoon of Nov 27th... upon return to work on Dec 2nd I recompiled and 
loaded the then current versions of the server slot as well as the BBXS slot.
Changes had been made to both since the previous version I had been testing.

All reported observations are using the 3780 mode of bisync
 
 
Greg, please distribute this to all individuals being copies on the BIONIC
problem... if Terry Silva is not on your list please add her... EDI.T/SILVA

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Kamoi-san, Saeki-san,

I just got through meeting with Gary Masters; Gary was running some
tests on BIONIC. I think everyone would be inter in the results,
which have raised some interesting questions.

1. Gary was testing userids on hosts 34 and 57, the hosts with KTL
customers. Host 34 has a Tymnet-II base, and host 57 still has the
Varian base.

Gary was using a PC emulating a 3780. He had a test file with 100
records. He tried using both old HSA and new HSA.

On both hosts, using old HSA, the BIONIC sessions terminated normally.
When we came in through the new HSA, the file was closed too quickly;
the remote terminal was still sending data, but instead of going to
the data file, the host was trying to interpret it as commands.

I'm not sure if this is related or not, but this looks very much like
the MOVETERM problem Tak Yasuma reported today in his A79655.

2. Some questions for KTL:

        a. Aki, can you confirm or deny Question 5 in my memo J85041?
        Does BIONIK fail even when you have old HSA and a Varian base,
        such as the one on host 57?
                                                                Page  2


        If you can find any combination of node, base, and host where
        BIONIK works, I think you should just move your customers
        there.

        b. Just to see if it would complete cleanly, we tried running
        BIONIK, but we could not find a copy to use. KTL, can you
        tell us on what username the current version of the BIONIK
        object code is? We want to try it, even if it is not working.

        c. Now that you have found a copy of BIONIK source, have you
        been able to modify it so that it will work? (If so, we will
        be very interested in the U.S. and Europe, because we still have
        BIONIC problems.)

Look forward to hearing from anyone with anything to contribute.

Thanks and best regards,

Greg

Greg,
  It appears that whether KTL has a copy of the BIONIK sources or not,
they should probably NOT have to modify BIONIK in order to get it to
work using both the new HSA and new base.  If the OLD HSA works fine
with either the new or old base as Gary Masters has demonstrated with
BIONIC, then it is apparent that the problem is in the new HSA not doing
something that the old HSA does.

If BIONIK works with the old HSA and the old base, thn it should work
also with the new HSA and base when the HSA people (Phil Spies) and the
new base people (Phillip Auyeung) have their code working together.
[In this case it appears to be the new HSA... sigh].

I just talked to Dave Smith and he showed me a trace of base/host traffic
where the 10 is appearently not honoring the quota rule I mentioned in
the previous memo.  The code is clearly there, so it might not be working.
-Bill

It still seems that the base does not have the ability to honor the quota
since it doesn't buffer and the dispatcher doesn't honor quotas.  ???

Carl,
Thanx for the note on BIONIK and new HSA--KTL has sent me a couple of other
memos indicating that they've come to the same conclusion that you did.
Looks like you can relax on this one for a while, pending further
chaos out of NTD and Tymnet...best, Greg

Peter,

Carl Baltrunas tells me that he has patched the current P034/K Monitor on host
S90, to fix the character-loss bug.  This patch will allow host S90 to work
with the new base.  I'm sure that if Carl where not in a class he would be
giving you this information himself.

The P034/P monitor is not urgently needed for host S90, and thus other
software need not be changed to accomodate the new Tymnet-II base.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I recently spoke to Carl Baltrunas about the BIONIC(K) situation. Here
is what he told me:

1. Carl is in the process of rewriting BIONIC. In the new BIONIC there
will be a katakana option, so there will be no separate BIONIK program.

2. In the new BIONIC, the syntax will be slightly different:

Old BIONIC:     -R BIONIC
                RUN

New BIONIC      -R BIONIC
                KATAKANA
                RUN

or

                -R BIONIC
                ASCII
                RUN

or

                -R BIONIC
                RUN

The default is ASCII, so the last two options work the same. However,
                                                                Page  2

ASCII-KATAKANA is a toggle, so you can move both katakana and ASCII
files in the same BIONIC session.

3. The ASCII option creates 7-bit files. The katakana option creates
9-bit files with 8 bits of data.

4. Carl is hoping to have the new version of BIONIC up and working
by 12/16, PST. There is a chance, but no guarantee, that it may be
working earlier when the network conversion goes through on 12/15 at
0300 PST. You will just have to give it a try early 12/15 JST, and see
what's working. Carl says he will send an Ontyme to everyone as soon as
he has it ready.

5. Carl mentioned one other possibility that you could use in the meantime,
and while your customers are changing the syntax in their job streams.
(Carl also said that there was no guarantee that this would work, but you can
try it:) Since you did find a copy of the BIONIK source, you could try
making a version of BIONIK with a sleep call in the earliest part of the
program, and give ta very high value for the sleep parameter. Carl, like
Gary Masters, believes that a lot of the trouble we are seeing are from
differences in timing, where one process starts and the other process is not
ready for it yet, or has timed out.

Good luck to everyone; Carl, we look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Greg

To KTL:

Did you get the message I91505, sent on December 16 PST? (It was sent to
the HSA world, but without  the CC option, so I don't know if you got it
or not.)

In it, Linda Maurer said "The fix to the BIONIC software was not successful,
but the fix to IHSA was successfully tested by EDI and KTL."

This seems consistent with your statement in A84367 that you are no longer
experiencing the problem of Item IV-2 in A80524, which was the
BIONIK-BIONIC problem. Can you confirm that both BIONIC and BIONIK are
now working properly?

The last I heard from Carl Baltrunas was that he intended to do a BIONIC
rewrite, but it looks like things have changed. I tried to call Carl today
but could not get in touch.

To Linda and Phil:

In I91505, re ECHOFL: "EDI's temporary  fix was successfully tested. NTD
will provide a permanent solution as soon as possible." KTL has also had
                                                                Page  2

problems with ECHOFL. Will the EDI temporary fix be propagated? If not, is
there some way KTL could get a copy of it? This would fix at least one
of many problems they are still experiencing.

Look forward to hearing from everyone.

Thanks and regards,

I spoke to Carl Baltrunas about the status of BIONIC(K). He said he had
patched the old version of BIONIC so that it would work with new HSA,
but had not touched BIONIK.

That is because he is still planning to do a complete rewrite of
BIONIC, and give it a katakana option, as described in my memo J87151.
Carl says that he will send you an Ontyme with the information
on how to get this new version of BIONIC as soon as it is ready for
test. This may happen during the business day, December 19 JST, so
be sure to check KTL.TOKYO frequently today.

(ISIPR.G/MARUS, KTL.TOKYO, KTL.OSAKA) as soon as you have anything?

Thanks,

Subject: BIONIC rewrite status 

Greg,

  I've completed a version of BIONIC which handles both ASCII and KATAKANA
in the normal non-HSA mode.  I have been unable to do any testing using an
HSA so I cannot confirm whether it works properly or not.

  My new version implements the "fix" that P. Spies, D. Smith and I agreed
on last week.  However, I have heard conflicting reports about whether the
"fixed" version of BIONIC actually works with the new HSA code.  I haven't
connected with P. Spies to discuss these reports in the past 3 days, so if
you can send me an ONTYME to TXS.C/BALTRUNAS requesting a copy of the new
BIONIC and a "test" directory or system to try it on, I'll be happy to
prepare a pre-release version.

The ASCII file mode writes 7-bit characters 5 per word.  The KATAKANA file
mode writes 9-bit characters (8 bits from the BLOCK I/O buffer and the 9th
is always 0) 4 per word.  If this is NOT what you expect, please inform me
prior to requesting the test version.

Thank you all for your patience.

Preliminary tests show it works fine after my few penciled-in changes.
It is ready for testing by the consumer.  I will try to talk to Phil
Spies and Dave Smith before giving this to anyone to insure that there
is no "other" problem which we are unaware of.

Carl,
Thanks for your good news on new BIONIC.
     
The current BIONIC via new HSA has still problems which were
appeared with old HSA.   
Sometimes it is OK, and sometimes it is NOT OK.   
     
So we will try your new BIONIC, please let us know the instruction,   
and the directory which it stroed in.   
However, we have no responsibility of official test for the code, so  
we can only try it and send some report to you .  
     
Anyway we will happy to try it.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Last night (December 19 PST), I was working with Ray Rana and
Hank Hummeling (Hitachi-San Jose), and Makoto Ogura (KTL). Hitachi
was having some strange problems that I thought other people on
this list might find interesting.

As I understand it their HINET-W application uploads and downloads
files from C34. The application sends messages back to the Hitachi-San Jose
device when everything has terminated properly. The messages include
information such as the name of the file where the data has been stored,
the record count, etc.

What we saw last night was the upload part of the application working,
but not all of the messages from the application would come back out to the
Hitachi device.

When they first called me, they said that they had successfully moved data to
C34, but the file had gone to a temporary storage file called
(HAL)ROMBUF.DAT. The test data that had been sent to ROMBUF.DAT was supposed
to have been sent to a file called SJXG.nnn (where nnn is an
application-generated sequence number); SJXG.nnn was also supposed to be
in another directory. The message identifying SJXG.nnn and giving its record
count did not show up.

Later, we tried loading some real data to a file called GMARUS.001. (We
                                                                Page  2

picked this naming convention because we weren't quite sure what was going
wrong, and did not want to lose track of the file, or risk having another
file overwritten.) Ray called me to say that the session had not terminated
properly, and the file had not been transferred. However, I logged in
interactively and found the GMARUS.001 file there on HAL:34.

A couple of comments and questions:

1. Ogura-san: I am not that familiar with the HINET-W application, so what I'm
saying here is based on what I saw and what Hitachi could tell me. If I've
made any mistakes in describing it, please let us know.

2. Carl, Gary, Phil--do we know of anything that could cause the "eating"
of host or application messages that would normally be sent back to the
customer device?

3. Especially in light of the experience with the GMARUS.001 file, we should
be a little skeptical about customers who "can't get in" or "can't move files."
Some of these people may be relying on the messages that they would normally
see at the end of a clean transfer, and not bothering to log in interactively
to do a DIR. Hitachi reported that, from their end, it looked as though the
GMARUS.001 file transfer had never taken place.

All for now,

regards,

Greg

Subject: Bionic release %1(1) 

    The BIONIC rewrite is complete!  It has been placed on directory (SYS) on
systems 34, 55 and 57 for testing by all concerned parties.  I ran tests this
afternoon and could not get the new version to fail with (and without) the
new HSA.

    The features of both BIONIC and BIONIK are incorporated in the new
BIONIC program.  The new calling procedure is as follows:

            Katakana mode              Ascii mode     (default)

            -R BIONIC                 -R BIONIC
            *KATAKANA                 *ASCII          (may be omitted)
            *RUN                      *RUN
            OUTPUT TO FILE: filename  OUTPUT TO FILE: filename
            READY FOR INPUT           READY FOR INPUT

            (if through an HSA interface, 4 blank lines are printed)

            .... data transferred here ....

            nnn RECORDS INPUT         nnn RECORDS INPUT
            -                         -

ASCII mode is the default and simply calling BIONIC in the old way (by
omitting the command "ASCII") will create an ASCII mode file on the disk.

In 2780 mode (through an HSA), this version of BIONIC will wait for the
first end-of-file indicator (EOF) after the filename is sent (the HSA sends
a yellow-ball through the network) for up to 5 minutes.  After receiving
the EOF, BIONIC enters block mode and reads data until the HSA sends the
second EOF at the end of the data.

In non-2780 mode, this version of BIONIC reads data until the base times
out (a 16 second wait with no data).  A ^Q is sent just prior to the text
message "READY FOR INPUT" and a ^S is sent after just prior to the message
"nnn RECORDS INPUT".  (Note: For non-2780 mode, there are no differences
in operation between the old version of BIONIC and this version.

Please ONTYME me with the results of your testing so that this version
may be propagated to all PDP-10 hosts.  Thank you!

    The new bionic is installed into (system) on 34 and 57. And it doesn't
 
    work by bysync terminal!!!!.
 
         Install into (system) the OLD BIONIC until Monday morning in Japan
 
    time.
 
    I would like to question about thie matter.
 
    1) Did you check the new BIONIC using bisync terminal before install??
 
    2) Do you want to do ALPHATEST using Customer's terminals ??
 
    3) Also do you know the ECHO CONTROL of Tymnet comletely??
 
    4) Also do you know the difference between Async terminal's data format and
       Bisync terminal's data format???
 
    The above item 3) and 4) is required for if you don't.
 
    The current new BIONIC is better than nothing!!!.
 
    and Don't install into (system) without any BETATEST.
 
REGARDS.
Aki

======== URGENT !! URGENT !! URGENT !! ========================= 
     
Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC in C34, and also was suurprised 
to find that (SYS)BIONIC on C34 and C57 were replaced as new ones.    
Are they well tested ?? I don't think so.    
     
From the observation of my so many trials, I found as follows.   
     
Trials via new HSA  
------------------  
     
        Any command for new BIONIC can't be accepted and BIONIC  
        replys "Unrecognized command, enter ? for help" for any input.
        So I can't do transmission and even can't do QUIT from BIONIC.
     
        At last night, BIONIC works well except the problem which we alrady
        reported about it, but this morning no BIONIC inthe 
        world works. I supporse there is some problem in command scanning  
        portion of the code.  
     
        PLEASE GO BACK (SYS)BIONIC TO OLD ONE, and KEEP IT UNTILL YOU CAN  
        GIVE US THE CODE WITHOUT PROBLEM.    
     
Trials in ASYNC
---------------
     
        Sometimes BIONIC closes just after "READY FOR INPUT" without  
        waiting data input, with following messages.   
     
                BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                0 RECORDS INPUT    
     
        BIONIC echoes some lines of input data and not echoes some lines   
        in one trial with any change ofinput mode.
     
     
About display of messages
-------------------------
     
        Please display messages in uppercase letters from BIONIC,
        because some our CRT can't display lowercase letters, which   
        is used for current messages.   
     
Best rgards,   
Makoto

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


FYI--

Due to the severe problems with the newest version of BIONIC
(checksum PEDMUM), Ihave asked operations to restore the previous
version of BIONIC (checksum VISMUJ) to SYS on hosts 34 and 57.

This was in response to telephone and Ontyme requests from KTL
(ref A88225 and  A88226.) KTL's reason for wanting the old version is
that it apparently worked at least some of the time for some of
their customers. They are not able to get the  new (PEDMUM) version
working under any circumstances from a bisynch terminal.

I asked operations to do the restoration rather than going through
regular channels (whatever they are these days), because KTL could
not run the tests until the late Friday PM (PST) release, and they
have customers coming up late Sunday PM PST, Monday AM JST. Operations
were the only people around over the weekend.

Carl, Dennis, Gary, can I make a suggestion: how about moving the
PEDMUM version of BIONIC to FTSYS? That way, a customer anxious to
try to use the new version could alter his command file to get to it,
but a customer who is having luck with the old version won't be forced
                                                                Page  2

into doing any testing while we are still having problems.

The SYS:55 version is still the new PEDMUM version.

Look forward to any new developments or suggestions.

Thanks and regards,

Greg

Carl,
     
I tried your new BIONIC in (UPLKT:34).  
     
I tried   
     
   1. Transmission into ASCII file under default mode ( without ASCII 
      command)  ...... 5 trials    
     
        3 trials: abort with display    
     
             ILL MEM REF for page 000400 at user PC 001102  
     
        2 trials: BIONIC close just after READY FOR INPUT without waiting  
                  data input and displayed   
     
                  BLOCK INPUT ERROR.    
                  0 RECORDS INPUT. 
     
   2. Transmission into ASCII file with ASCII command  ..... 5 trials 
     
        4 trials: Abort with ILL MEM REF .......  
     
        1 trial : Can't send data with BLOCK INPUT ERROR.....    
     
   3. Transmission into Kana file with KATAKANA command   ..... 5 trials   
     
        In evry trial, I could send kana file and BIONIC closed normally.  
     
        However, a problem , I found in the sent file. 
     
        When I send data in following manner,
     
        <Stx>AAAAA(Irs>BBBBB<Irs><Irs>CCCCC<Irs>DDDDD<Irs><Etx>  
     
        I expect followings in a sent file.  
     
        AAAAA<Cr><Lf>    
        BBBBB<Cr><Lf>    
        <Cr><Lf>    
        CCCCC<Cr><Lf>    
        DDDDD<Cr><Lf>    
     
        However actually I got
     
        AAAAA<Cr><Lf>    
        BBBBB<Cr><Lf>    
        CCCCC<Cr><Lf>    
        DDDDD<Cr><Lf>    
     
        One empty record (<Cr><Lf>) was ignored.  
     
About trial 1 & 2   
     
  After aborting with ILL MEM REF ...., I found the file was not closed    
  normally and was not able to handle it with display **FILE BEING    
  MODIFIED**.  
  So I supporse there is some problem in file closing portion under ASCII file  
  handling mode.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ogura-san,

Thanks for your report on the problems with the new BIONIC.

I spoke to Carl Baltrunas today. Carl says that he had tested the new BIONIC
on host 24. He tested it there because he knows that the very latest version
of the base code is on host 24.

We'd be interested to know if KTL still has the same problems on host 24 also.
Carl has validated UPLKT on host 24, so you should log in and try BIONIC
there. On host 24, the (SYS)BIONIC is the new version.

Look forward to hearing your results.

Thanks and regards,

Greg

Just for everyone's information...

Gary Masters and I just tested the new (SAIL) verison of BIONIC,
on hosts 34 and 55. Gary was using 3780 protocol on his IBM PC.

Results: we got the combination of:

READY FOR INPUT



0 RECORDS INPUT

on all tries.

Hope this is of some help in the diagnosis.

Regards,

Greg

This morning, I tried your new BIONIC on C24, I was informed that is the   
newest version of it. However the result was the same as    
yesterday's. I did 5 trials under ASCII mode, and .... 
     
        4 trails : fail with ILL MEM REF .......  
        1 trial  : fail with BLOCK INPUT ERROR......

Gentlemen,
     
I would like to summarize and report to you regarding many problems   
which occured from last Friday evening(jst). 
This summary is only problems which I have got now ( monday 
24 dec. morning ..jst ). 
     
The environment are as follows:    
     
    1. HSA terminal for test ......DATA-100 of our office   
                                   ( connected by hardwire )
     
    2. The node code of HSA is version 1.05 ( released date dec. 19 pst)   
     
1. Bionic and Bionik of old version
     
   As you know, This program does not work.  
   The problem is that the file does not close when the transmission  
   from terminal to host was completed. 
   It does work occasionally. 
     
2. New Bionic  
     
   ASCII option:    
               please refer Mr. Ogura's ontyme ( msg# A89114)    
     
   KATAKANA option: 
               It seems that the program does works apparentlly. 
               But, It seems that the "blank" records are not transmited.  
     
3. Punch and Kpunch (pdp-10)  
     
   This program does work but does not work occasionally.   
   According to monitor of Data Scope,  
   Sometimes , the sequence seems to be changed in some place ( host or    
   base or node ) as follows: 
     
   (1)  <stx>(dc2)data<irs>data<irs><etb>.........
     
   (2)  <stx>(dc2)<irs><etx>....<eot> <stx>data<irs>data<irs><etb>.....    
     
   The case (1) is same as VALLIAN node and the program does works.   
     
   The case (2) is that the actual data is removed from punch selection.   
   In other words, the program does not work.
     
4. When the terminal was disconnected from node by power off of terminal   
   or modem reset or etc. ,   
   The logged user is not diconnected ( or logoff ) from host untill  
   the center operator execute "kill jobs" by our request.  
     
    a. We can't execute "kill jobs" from async terminal.    
     
    b. The user-id's setting is "logout on disconnect".
     
5. When we entered "WHO" command from HSA terminal ,   
   The answer from host are not printed / displayed on the terminal.  
     
6. MOVETERM    
     
   When this program is used, "EOT" sequence from node to terminal    
   is not constant. For this reason, the data can't receive into disk.
   In a reverse, the msg "OUTPUT BEGIN" of moveterm receive into 
   disk.  
     
   And receiving "EOT" from node in bad timing causes terminal down.  
     
As i mentioned above , I have so many problems in current systems.    
Please find the reason why they occure and fix them as soon as   
possible. 
Or We will lost all HSA user in Japan.  
     
Thanks.   
kamoi
     
p.s. I don't know logic and timing of "EOT" transfer(in/out)
     through HSA node .  
     Please explain us in detail.

Just for everyone's information, I thought I would pass on a brief
status report before everything closes down for the holidays here in the
U.S.

Today I called both Y.S. Lines and Hitachi, with the follwoing results:

Dean Pichotto of Y.S. Lines was not in today, and I had no messages from
him. I assume (I hope!) that he eventually got a line that wasn't busy.
(Ref A89102 from Tak Yasuma.)

I tried to call Ray Rana of Hitachi, to let him at least try the
(FTSYS)BIONIC on host 34. Ray was not in, and Hitachi said that everyone
had the rest of the week off. Carl, I'll call them back the week of the
30th, if we still need to ask them if we can borrow their terminal for
you to work with.

McDonnell-Douglas is off from Wednesday, December 25 until Sunday
December 29. During that period, I will drop in to the office several
times to check Ontymes.

Thanks and regards

Subject: Bionic release %1(2) ** BUG FIX ** 

To all concerned:

		    *** Merry Christmas ***

I would like to thank Mokoto Ogura for testing the new BIONIC and finding
the ILL MEM REF caused by an off-by-one oversight on my part.  This bug
has been fixed in version %1(2).  Please, I would like you to try this
new version again.  It is located on (FTSYS)BIONIC.SAV on systems 34, 55
and 57.  It is also on (SYS)BIONIC.SAV on system 24, (OHTA)BIONIC.SAV on
system 57 and (UPLKT)BIONIC.SAV on system 34.

To Phil Spies:

    The problem cited with blank records being dropped as they pass through
the HSA seems to me to be a bufferring problem.  Please take a look to see
if this in in the HSA code.  (Multiple <irs>'s).

To Mokoto Ogura:

    This should solve the ILL MEM REF problem you saw.  (The ILL MEM REF
occurred after you had already processed 4 data pages and was the next
data byte on the 5th page).  It will not solve the problem of "blank"
lines, i.e. <stx>data<irs><irs>data... (see note to Phil Spies).  Please
make a test on both system 24 and your production system(s).  I do not
know what is causing of the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR", but I have noticed that
it occurs consistantly only the "first" time I try to run BIONIC.  Every
additional time,  BIONIC works ok.


    Let me know the results of any further testing.  Thank you all.

Carl,
     
I tried your new BIONIC on host 34 and 24.   
     
Trials via Async    
----------------    
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (FTSYS)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
     
        I tried 10 times in one session and get   
     
          6 trials : Ok  
          4 trials : NOT Ok with  BLOCK INPUT ERROR.   
                                  0 RECORDS INPUT.
     
     
Trials via HSA 
-------------- 
     
        Tried by (FTSYS)BIONIC on C34 and by (SYS)BIONIC on C24. 
     
        In both code, the situation seems to return to the last  
        Saturday's which I mentioned in my OnTyme (A88226). 
        Any command for the BIONIC on (FTSYS:34) or (SYS:24)
        can't be accepted, and the BIONIC replys "Unrecognized command ...."    
        for any input at "*" prompt.    
     
     
Carl, I beleave you had already tested it well, especially via Async. 
So I can't understand why such a problem appeared......
     
        By our location, by some routing of network, or by just a program  
        error ..... etc ???   
     
One question: in the BIONIC, does the same command scan routin analize
a command via Async and via HSA-Bisync,  or two routins, one for Async
and another for Bisync, are ready for the code ?  
Because I wonder why the BIONIC can recognize a command via Async and can't
do it via Bisync.   
     
     
In Japan, our office is closed during the next week by NEw Year holidays.  
However, I will ready to test it when you send another version of it. So   
please send an OnTyme to KTL.TOKYO and make a copy to KTL.OGURA, which I   
will check by appropriate timing at home.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,

  I cannot be sure how your Bisync equipment works, but it is possible
that when a line of data is transmitted, it is padded to a standard size
such as 80.

  I simulated this action with BIONIC version %1(2) by adding blanks to
the end of my command line.  I also received "Unrecognized command,...".

  There is now a new version, %1(3), which contains code to remove both
leading and trailing blanks from the command line.  Please test this new
version when you have time.  It is in all the proper places on systems
34 (FTSYS)(UPLKT), 55 (FTSYS), 57 (FTSYS)(OHTA) and 24 (SYS).

  *** Have a happy New Year Holiday ***

CARL: 
 DOES THE NEW BIONIC IGNORE TRAILING BLANKS ?
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE COMMAND SCANNER IS PROBABLY ATTEMPTING
TO MATCH THE DECOMPRESSED BLANKS WHICH HSA OUTPUTS WHEN
TRANSLATING 3780 TYPE RECORDS WHICH ARE PADDED WITH IGS
CHARACTER SEQUENCES. WHAT ARRIVES FROM A CONSAT OR OTHER
ASYNC I/F IS :
RUN<cr>
FILENAME<cr>

WHAT MAY ARRIVE FROM HSA IS :
 
RUN                                                                <cr>

DATA...
 
   SOME 3780 TERMINALS AND SOME 3780 EMULATORS PAD RECORDS TO
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHARACTERS USING THE IGS CHARACTER SEQUENCE.
HSA CANNOT IGNORE THESE COMPRESSED BLANKS AS SOME HOSTS NEED TO
SEE THE CORRECT NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN EACH RECORD. IF THIS
INDEED A BLANK COMPRESSION OR EXPANSION RELATED PROBLEM, OU
WILL HAVE TO IGNORE THE BLANK PAD WHEN SCANNING COMMANDS.

Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC.  
     
Via Async 
--------- 
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 11 times in one session and got ...    
     
        6 trials : Ok (1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th trial)  
        5 trials : Not Ok with BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                               0 RECORDS INPUT.   
     
        And I found the sequence of OK/NOT-OK is the same as yesterday's.  
        However I don't know the sequence has some meaning or not ....
     
Via HSA   
--------  
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 10 times and  
     
        5 trials : Ok    
        5 trials : Not Ok    After EOT sending from terminal,    
                             the host replys nothing.  
     
        - "Ambigious command ......" message 
     
          When terminal send R (UPLKT)BIONIC with some trailing blanks,    
          BIONIC replys above message as follows. 
     
     
          Terminal sends 
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs><Etx>  
     
          Response from node(host), echo and others    
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<--- 56 blanks ----><irs> *        <irs>Ambi 
          gious command, please re-enter.<irs>*<irs><etx>   
     
     
          I also know that, in the New BIONIC, blank(s) input at "*" prompt
          causes the message. 
     
          This is not a problem for my current operation, but how can I    
          understand it ???   
     
     
        - In evry NOT-OK case, I can close the BIONIC by additional   
          operation as follows.    
     
          Term     Last data record ... <irs><etx>       <eot>   
          Node                                     <ack>        ..... 
     
                ....... No response from node .......  
     
          After 10 min.  
     
          Term    <enq>      <stx><-- 80bytes record --><irs>      <eot>   
          node          <ack>                                <ack>    
     
          So I send one more dummy text after actual data, BIONIC closed.  
     
          I don't know about the ball-logic, but I guess, in somewhere,    
          the first EOT is eaten by someone and BIONIC does not know  
          about it.

Makoto,

    I have fixed the problem of blank records causing an error message
when entering commands to BIONIC.  I believe that I have also solved the
problem behind the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR." message.  Apparently some things
do NOT work as they are documented to work.

    I have put my newest trial version, %1(6) [version 1, edit 6] in the
(FTSYS) directory on systems 34, 55 and 57, in the (SYS) directory on 24,
in the (UPLKT) directory on 34 and in the (OHTA) directory on 57.

    Please run your tests on this version on systems 24 and your production
systems.  If the tests are successful, then I will release this version to
the (SYS) directory as soon as possible.  If the tests fail, then I would
like you to run your tests on another internal system which has a different
type of TYMNET-II base.

    Thank you very much for your attention and co-operation.

    ****  Happy New Year Holidays ****

Carl,
     
Today, I tried your new BIONIC in UPLKT:34 through HSA, and found interesting   
matter.   
     
- I made trials under following 2 methods.   
     
        Method-1 : Send data , which you can see (OGURA:34)TEST.128, 128 char   
                   * 100 recs, with blank compression (by Igs).  
                   This file contains 2 all-blank records which are   
                   compressed as   
     
                        <Igs><7F><Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs>    
     
                   per a record.     (Total 128 blanks/rec) 
     
                   In past 2 weeks, I tried under this method.   
     
        Method-2 : Send the same file with truncating traling blanks. 
                   Under this method, the all-blank record is sent as single    
     
                        <Irs> 
     
- And as far as I know, Phil's OnTyme (I95298) is not reflected for KTL's  
 HSA yet. 
     
     
At the trial   
     
In method-1     5 trials 
-----------    
     
        2 trials : Ok    
        3 trials : fail with the same situation which I mentioned in my OnTyme  
                    A90038, 28-Dec-85. (No reply from node after data sending)  
     
In method-2     10 trials
-----------    
     
        Every trial is OK !!     However the all-blank records are ignored.
     
So, from the observation, I thought IGS cause some problem, and I tried    
another data which did not contain blank compression. You can see the file 
(OGURA:34)TEST2.128, 128 char * 100 recs.    
However it was not OK. BIONIC did not reply after data sending. So IGS may not  
be a cause of the problem.    
     
Then I guess a single IRS has some meaning at Terminal-BSC-HSA-Base-BIONIC ???!!
And please remember my OnTyme (A88428,23-dec-85), in which I reported the  
same experience under katakana mode of your BIONIC.    
     
However, I'm not sure, in this kind of problem, what number of trials is enough 
for the test. Even in the method-2, I don't know 11th trial may fail or not.    
     
     
And I also tried (UPLKT:34)BIONIC via async 10 times, and found every trial
was OK. I didnot experience which I got in past trials via async.
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

SERIOUS PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THE CONVERSION FROM TYMNET I TO II HAVE    
BEEN OCCURING SINCE LAST MONTH.    
WE RECOGNIZE NOTHING IS SOLVED YET.
WE WOULD LIKE TO SUMMARIZE THESE PLOBLEMS AGAIN AND LIKE TO ASK YOU   
TO SOLVE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
     
( PROBLEMS )   
     
  1) NETWORK/HOST DOES NOT RESPOND OVER 20 OR 30 SECONDS FROM SENDING 
     "USERNAME;PASSWORD" TO RECEIVING THE ECHO.   
     USER'S TERMINALS AND COMPUTERS CAN NOT LOGIN CAUSED BY TIME-OUT. 
     
  2) BEFORE DATA TRANSFER USING MOVETERM OR BIONIC, USERS TERMINALS   
     SEND A COMMAND (FOR EXAMPLE: "SEND" WHITCH MEANS UPLOAD).   
     NETWORK/HOST DOES NOT RESPOND OVER 24 SECONDS FROM SENDING A
     COMMAND TO RECEIVING THE ECHO.
     
  3) IN THE WAY OF DOWNLOAD, NETWORK/HOST SEND "EOT"   
     TO USER'S COMPUTERS AND THEY HANG UP.   
     
  4) EVEN THOUGH SENDING LAST RECORD WITH (USING BIONIC),   
     FILE ON TYMCOM X IS NOT CLOSED.    
     WE DON'T KNOW WHERE "EOT" GO AWAY. 
     
  5) EVEN THOUGH USER'S TERMINALS OR MODEMS POWER OFF, 
     THE LOGGED USER IS NOT DISCONNECT (LOG-OFF) FROM HOST UNTIL 
     A CENTER OPERATER KILLS THE JOB.   
     
ALL OF THE ABOVE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN OCCURING SOMETIME IN THE U.S. ,   
EUROPE, AND JAPAN.  
WE THINK THERE ARE CAUSES OF THESE PROBLEMS IN HSA OR NETWORK BECAUSE 
1),  2),  3)  AND 5) OF THE ABOVE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN OCCURING ON  BOTH 
TYMCOM  X  (BIONIC)  AND 370 (MOVETERM) AND BIONIC WAS  WORKING  WELL 
BEFORE THE CONVERSION.   
OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO USE ALTERNATIVE METHOD AND WE ARE GETTING  
TOWARD CLOSE OF BUSINESS.
BECAUSE  THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE A SURE IF THEY CAN MAKE A  CONNECT 
WITH OUR NETWORK EVERY DAY FOR INSTABILITY OF OUR NETWORK.  
THESE PROBLEMS BROKE OUR CUSTOMERS' RELIANCE ON OUR SERVICE AND US,   
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR SEVEN YEARS.   
ANYWAY, WE STORONGLY HOPE TO SOLVE THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
COULD YOU TELL US WHO WILL SOLVE THEM WITH RESPOSIBILITY AND WHEN/HOW 
THEY WILL BE SOLVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ?    
     
BEST REGARDS,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Ogura-san,

I have been speaking to Gary Masters and to Jim Buck of Toshiba in
Los Angeles.

According to Jim, Toshiba has been having problems with their application.
I have asked him to send me a hard copy of his session so that I can
qualify the problem a little more. However, he did read to me over the phone
some of the problems he was seeing.

His process apparently runs normally until the X host sends a "ready for
input" to the Toshiba terminal. At that point, our host sends an EOT.
They see the system do the "RUN (JISTAR)CHK" and "RUN (JISTAR)TRDS", but
no data is sent, and the Toshiba terminal then disconnects.

1. Jim said that this problem had been reported to Japan. Do you have
any information from Toshiba-Japan about what has been going on?

2. Gary says that what Toshiba is seeing is not the same BIONIC problem
that other BIONIC users have now. However, since we have been having a
lot of problems with BIONIC, I am still very suspicious. Could I ask
you to do something for me?

Would you please create a program that is exactly like the production
program that Toshiba uses, except have it call (FTSYS)BIONIC instead
of (SYS)BIONIC? Even if it does not solve the problem, it will help to
                                                                Page  2

see if the two versions fail in the same way.

Please let me know what you call this new program, and any other
information Toshiba would need to test it. (For example, if it is called
from another menu, let us know the proper option.)

3. Jim also says that on the disconnect, an error message shows up on the
CRT, but does not print out. I have asked him to run the system again,
and write down the error message, and send me the hard copy. As soon as
I see that I will send you another Ontyme.

Thanks and regards

Peter,

Many thanks for staying on top of things with Hitachi. My understanding
of the situation is that the file closing problem is indeeed a BIONIC
problem, and many users all over the world are experiencing it.

If Hitachi calls you again, you can let them know that the proper
people--Gary Masters, Carl Baltrunas, and Phil Spies--are working on it.

Ogura-san--I just spoke to Gary Masters, and he said that when BIONIC
hangs, breaking the line forces the file to close properly. This explains
what we were experiencing in San Jose with Hitachi, when I had them
force the files into GMARUS.001, GMARUS.002, etc. If this is still
what you are doing for Hitachi-San Jose, maybe you could suggest to
Hitachi-U.K. that they try something similar, at least until BIONIC works.

(Peter, my understanding of the application is that after a file has been
loaded to the host with BIONIC, the application takes over and copies and
renames the file to other userids. If the only way that the file will
close is to force a line drop, then there is no way for the latter part of the
operation to take place. Here in the U.S., Hitachi is forcing their data
into files named after me--so they won't overwrite anything else in the system--
and Mr. Ogura in Tokyo is moving them manually to the proper names and
directories. Correct, Ogura-san?)
                                                                Page  2


Thanks again for you support to Hitachi--hope you had a good holiday
season and will have a prosperous New Year.

Thanks and regards,

Greg

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Peter,

Many thanks for staying on top of things with Hitachi. My understanding
of the situation is that the file closing problem is indeeed a BIONIC
problem, and many users all over the world are experiencing it.

If Hitachi calls you again, you can let them know that the proper
people--Gary Masters, Carl Baltrunas, and Phil Spies--are working on it.

Ogura-san--I just spoke to Gary Masters, and he said that when BIONIC
hangs, breaking the line forces the file to close properly. This explains
what we were experiencing in San Jose with Hitachi, when I had them
force the files into GMARUS.001, GMARUS.002, etc. If this is still
what you are doing for Hitachi-San Jose, maybe you could suggest to
Hitachi-U.K. that they try something similar, at least until BIONIC works.

(Peter, my understanding of the application is that after a file has been
loaded to the host with BIONIC, the application takes over and copies and
renames the file to other userids. If the only way that the file will
close is to force a line drop, then there is no way for the latter part of the
operation to take place. Here in the U.S., Hitachi is forcing their data
into files named after me--so they won't overwrite anything else in the system--
and Mr. Ogura in Tokyo is moving them manually to the proper names and
directories. Correct, Ogura-san?)
                                                                Page  2


Thanks again for you support to Hitachi--hope you had a good holiday
season and will have a prosperous New Year.

Thanks and regards,

Greg

Greg san, 
     
I'm sorry that I'm too busy to send a letter per a item.    
     
Toshiba   ref J93432
-------   
     
By this moment, Toshiba HQ does not contact me, so I think they don't know 
the problem you mentioned. In their system, the same terminal (hard   
and soft) is distributed to USA, Japan, and west germany, So I will contact
Toshiba HQ on the matter and check it for the system in Japan tomorrow.    
And tomorrow, I will also make another version of TRDS, this is a main
program for their application.
     
Breaking line  ref A93483
-------------  
     
Thanks for your explanation to Peter. However I have a question on BREAKING
LINE which you mentioned in the Ontyme. What is it in BCS communication, and    
how can I impliment it for BCS, especially by VS3780 ? 
     
     
Showa-line and MDS  
------------------  
     
Please check MDS' current status about accessing to tymshare system, and let    
me know it. Because sometime MDS seems to get a file without application   
or seems to be able to get no files. Showa-line want to know MDS' status   
exactly.  
     
     
IDI's manual in english  
-----------------------  
     
I know well that you are also very very busy. So pleasee let me know when  
you can semd it back. Because we must write another manuals for another IDI
versions in english with  refference on your script as a base.   
     
     
As time is being, reliability on tymshare and tymnet, almost Japanese think
Tymshare equal Tymnet, is being lower and lower !!
Some client told us he would start to plan to replace his system from Tymshare  
to GEISCO's. I think almost user who faced current problem think about
the rplacement but don't touch the matter yet. More than 1 month since the 
problem starts, is too enough for the users. 
Everything which we are now experiencing helps GEISCO. 
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: BIONIC %1(6) Release 

Greg,
  After the last set of messages and my own testing, I feel that the
current version, %1(6) of BIONIC solves all of the known problems on
the PDP-10 side of the DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST-BIONIC connection.

It does not address the one request from Kamoto Ogura that all messages
be in UPPER CASE.  That will be fixed in release %1(7) which I will put
into (FTSYS) after we are sure that all the HSA concerns are fixed and
their new code is running in all the HSAs.

I believe that anyone using BIONIC from (SYS) is still using the oldest
version which I DO NOT expect to work properly.  We need to agree on
whether the new version can be placed in (SYS) before I have it released.

I want to avoid the problems and complaints that occurred with the first
test version %1(1) that was put on (SYS) by customer request.  So, let
me know and I will put version %1(7) out for final testing before its
release.

Greg-san, 
     
Thanks for your support on the account. 
     
This evening, I could catch Mr. Nakamura of Toshiba HQ, he is in charge of 
the system in Japan, and talked about the problem. At the conversation, he 
said he was reported on it by Jim, but know no details of the matter. 
     
Anyway I made a new version of TRDS. Please use XSEND subcommand for the   
application(TRDS) instead of SEND subcommand.
     
SEND invokes (SYS)BIONIC and XSEND invokes (FTSYS)BIONIC.   
     
And Mr. Nakamura also said Jim knows how to operate his DS990 for
XSEND command. 
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Carl,
     
This evening, I got your letter, A95887.  Regarding the Ontyme,  
please remember my OnTyme A93053 which was sent at 05-Jan and I reported no-    
close problem at %1(6) in that Ontyme.  
     
To make sure, just before I tried (UPLKT)BIONIC, it is still %1(6) !!, at our   
RWS and got the same problem which meant that BIONIC did not close the
specified file after sending completion, at the first trial.
     
So we still have a problem at BIONIC operation, however I don't know the   
problem is in BIONIC or it hide behind DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST connection.
     
Anyway what I can just know is BIONIC worked without problem at the last   
summer, and now BIONIC still does not work normally, and    
our boat is sinking day by day.    
     
However I think release of %1(6) may not cause worse situation than the    
current one.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto
