Bank account + todays deposit shows $7,599.  Probably means RENT (500) not
cashed, and the 200 for speeding will drop it to just under 7K.  Add that to
the 7.8K at Merrill Lynch (rounding up) to 15K + 4K (flooring check) and the

Stephen,
   You contacted a friend of mine, Cheryl Marinelli, about attending
the management skills workshop scheduled for this November 5th (?) and
mailed her a packet of information to fill out and return before this
weekend.

   I'm sending you this ONTYME because she received the packet in the
mail on friday which does not time allow for her to return it completed
by mail.  Since my understanding is that the workshop would be held this
Monday or Tuesday, I would like you to contact me via ONTYME or Cheryl
by telephone to let us know when and where the workshop is being held and
where Cheryl or I may drop off the completed packet in person.

   I may be contacted via ONTYME at TXS.C/BALTRUNAS, in my office in VG-2
at ext. 7257 in the afternoon, or at home (415) 961-1082 in the morning.
Cheryl Marinelli may be reached at (415) 961-1082.

   Thank you for your help in this matter.

   $$$ Money $$$

At this point, I still don't know... papers are still sufficiently missing
such that I don't know yet how much cash we actually have.  There's 813.93
difference between my bank statement of 1/25 and what the bank reported to
me on 2/6 and checks written which "may" have been cashed totalling close
to $890.  I will check the balance again today & see what the have before I
deposit the two checks that I have.  Maybe it will give me a better idea.

Good news is that we are still solvent.  Given their balance, assuming that
all of the checks have been cashed, including this month's mortgage check,
we have at least 1K... and I'm depositing minimally 600 and keeping 'bout
140 for gold skate cash/expenses.

We also have 900+ in Merrill Lynch... so, the next question is, when do you
get paid (or did you already) and where are we going to put your check, or
the remainder of your money after you pay off your dress/hoisery ???

Dear Chicken,
  You really should stop being so afraid.  It is very unbecoming of you
and leaves you in a terrible position.  Now, straighten that back, lift
that chin, put a smile on that face, lift that bale, tote that barge...

  Anyway... calm down and take things easy. ** NOTHING ** is all that
critical that you should get all that upset at the moment.  Everything
will turn out ok...

  Ok?

I'm sorry.....I really am. But I have no choice. The only way I can get what
I want is by withholding something you want. If you want whatI have badly
enough, you'll do what you know you have to do to earn it. Otherwise, you
are affording a full-time housekeeper. I'm really sorry but, since nothing
else has worked at all, and since this has only been working marginally, 
things are going to have to stay this way until there is a signific
ant,
sustained effort on your part to assume some of the responsibility. The
sooner this happens, the sooner your problem will be resolved. It's up to
you, babe. I love you, but you drive me nuts. -Mee

Look, you can be as *SORRY* as you want.  You aren't withholding something
that "I" want.  If you want to miss "our" mortgage payments, then continue
to put on this foolish tirade of yours.

I'm tired of being told that I'm not doing anything.  I'm doing as much
as I've had the time to do.  Just because I sleep 3-4 hours skewed from
the time that you do, does NOT, mean that I have 3-4 hours more time to
do things in.  In fact, it's more difficult to do things that make *NOISE*
because I'm trying to "let" (not the right word) you sleep!

If you don't wish to give me your paycheck for deposit to "our" account
then, after tonight, you may have the chore of doing the bills and trying
to pay it on one salary.  You are withholding from YOU just as much as
from ME.  No one asked you to be a full-time housekeeper.  No one expects
you to do what you keep pushing yourself to do. No one expects you to get
yourself so upset over things NOT done.

If you want to treat me (I dare say wrongly) because of your idea of what
can and can't be accomplished within a finite time, then you are asking for
all the pain and grief you are causing both of us.  I'm upset.

I don't get much done when I'm upset.  So, you LISTEN... if you keep this
up, then I will NEVER get anything you want done, because I will always be
to upset to do anything.  I'm trying to do as much as I can.  If you think
I can do better, I'm sorry.  Your fantasy is never going to come true.  At
the moment I also have other handicaps that I never had before, so again
all that you are doing is provoking what you don't want.  'Nuff said.

Again... I'm NOT getting anything done, NOT because of spite.  I just
physically get too upset to do anything.  And that's the way I am at the
moment.  (And you want me to come home?  You must be kidding).

I've told you what I want. It is not unreasonable.
If you don't pay your bills, your credit rating is going to be hurt, not mine.
So you're making an idle threat. Fine. Don't pay your bills. Where does that get you?

"I've told you what I want. It is not unreasonable."

...and I've told you how it is.  I'm not Superman...  I can only do so
much, and no more.

What you "WANT" is unreasonable.  You want everything always put away
in its place.  Well, everything doesn't have a place... and that doesn't
mean "THEN, THROW IT OUT".

You want something?  Then don't cut off your nose to spite your face!
You get upset about "the mess"?  Well, SO DO I.. and I get even more
upset when you "push" all your little games trying to get me to do more.
I "AM" doing more... and more... and more...

Except when I'm too upset to do anything... then practically nothing
gets done anywhere... not at work, not at home, not anywhere.  Maybe
my paralysis from getting upset is a throwback to what happenned to
me six years ago... all I know is the HELL that it causes...

You want something?  Then calm down, and stop making me upset, then
maybe we'll get more things done.

You are just as guilty, when you "leave" somethingthing just "to see"
how long it will take me to get to it.  I DON'T DO THAT TO YOU.  All
that does is upset me...  Maybe I don't say anything, but it still has
a negative effect, and fewer things (maybe none) get done.

I was all ready to come home and finish cleaning up... then as I was
about to leave, I got your mail message.  (Sarcasm?  I hope your're
proud of yourself, because YOU KNEW that that's what would happen to
me.  And if you didn't, then that's proof that you're not listening.
Because, that IS what I've been saying for the past "n" months!)

Thanks for making a HELL out of my evening.

You may well feel that I'm responsible for what happenned yesterday
morning.  But my perception is that you started "picking" at me, to
which I disagreed, to which you started your "thing" about public
arguments.

If you don't want a public scene, then don't "pick" about things that
you know I'm going to EXPLODE about in public.  I don't have to give
a damn about what other people think.  I used to... until I needed some
help; then I was abandoned by *EVERYONE* that I cared about.

"They" (anybody) don't care one iota about you, or me.  If you think
they do... you're dreaming.

Most of those people still won't even talk to me.  I don't know how to
STOP caring, so it "eats at me" and "tears my guts out", and it doesn't
take much to set it off.  Your "DON'T WANT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC" line
is what's setting it off right now.  I don't know what you expect to get
out of me by pushing me that way; you know it doesn't work; yet you keep
trying it.

You hurt me very much just by "picking" at me in public.  Oh it's great
to get other people to gang up on me too when you're mad.  But I can't
take it... not as teasing... not for real.  I was teased too much, all
of my life and I CAN'T tell the difference anymore.  That's why I have
so much trouble with telephones and everything else.  I can't bear even
to think about being treated as an outcast by people that we "hang-out"
with.  If you get some morose satisfaction out of that, then fine... but
leave me out of it; or you'll just have another scene, because when I
get that upset, I just can't control it...  IF you push me, I'll push back!


I'm not going to hit you, or beat you, or batter you --- EVER!  and if
you give your friends the impression that I do, then I don't want anything
to do with those friends (or you, for that matter).


I'm not going to argue about who hurt whom...  you never heard all of
the story about what happenned, and what never happenned, but apparently
everyone seemed to think something did... but I've felt just as bad, all
day, as I felt during all of what happenned then.

You don't know how bad you hurt me yesterday...  and you better hope
that you never really find out...


...just remember, there are some things that make you so upset, you shake
all over... well, this is one of the things that does that to me, so I
don't want to hear one word about "pouting" or "sulking"...  I don't want
sympathy, pity or that kind of attention, I just don't want to be treated
like you've been treating me.  I can't help it any more than you can...
