Subject: hotline log

I don't find any entries in the Hotline log since (before in file) 14Jun84.
Is that because nothing has happened or nothing has been logged?
I like the idea of a computer accessible log because I can get to it from
all over and it is a permanent (more or less) record.

If you kill or otherwise destroy the child frame, it appears to never
send the ^D at the end of the mail message when it logs back in to
send mail.  It seems to be okay in all other cases.  While you're in
there maybe you should allow it to use the new mail system.  -Bill

How about always sending TUMS mail if the file (MAIL)MAILER.SAV is
runnable.  Then we change RPG to always check for TUMS mail after it
checks for normal mail, and if present, runs (MAIL)RDMAIL to display
it.  Then people can use the new mail system without even knowing it.

     Peter, reference your Ontyme of June 20th on subject "Erroneous
     details on SLIGOS host 90".
 
     I have now had a meeting with the Tymcom X group and MIS (accounting)
     on this subject; the results are not necessarily positive.
 
      1.  When a PCOM job is run the "originating node of entry" is set to
          zero, because a node cannot be identified, as it is not an
          interactive session.
 
      2.  A node number of zero is automatically defined as a U.S. node
          number.  Hence, any job run during your evening hours is inter-
          rogated and understood to run during prime time.
 
     This would happen for any client using PCOM.  Usage of Perp and Defer
     are handled correctly because we take advantage of a specific Europe-
     an Perp processing host.
 
     This problem is not easy to resolve; it will require a change to code
     associated with the Tymcom X monitor.  Carl Baltrunas is aware of
     what changes are necessary, but timing on a fix has alternatives:
 
      1.  Depending on research which Carl will undertake it may be possi-
          ble to make changes to the next release of Tymcom X monitor code
 

 
Tymcom X details related to PCOM jobs                               Page 2
 
 
          (version N, due for release during next few weeks).  This would
          likely mean that very little testing could be done in advance,
          which leaves things a bit to chance that other problems could be
          presented.
 
      2.  We could wait and make the code changes in a later version of
          the monitor, likely due about October '84.  This would allow
          proper testing and limit possible exposure to other problems.
 
     The decision to be made depends on how serious this problem is to
     Cegi Tymshare.  We realize the accounting is being reported incor-
     rectly, but you do go through certain processes which alter the
     accounting for clients in your territory.  Is it possible for you to
     find an interim solution through your own accounting?  If yes, then
     it would be wise to wait until the release in the 4th quarter.  If
     you do not have a way around this problem then I would suggest we try
     to make the change as soon as possible (again, if Carl is able to
     ascertain that it's possible in a short time frame).
 
     Another alternative which is possible, but likely places a large bur-
     den on the MIS accounting group, is to re-run the CT accounting each
     month, after replacing a node of zero with a known CT node number.
     This alternative could present problems if anyone at CT is using rou-
     tines (assembler code) which eliminates node-of-entry in some fashion
     or another.  It is my feeling that this alternative would delay
     month-end accounting for CT, which would not likely help the 'cash-
     flow' situation.
 
     So, this is the state of the problem at hand.  We look forward to
     your comments and thoughts.  I'll keep you posted on Carl's progress
     as it relates to the above.  Regards. Ken

Subject: Crash Analysis

The most recent crash analysis done was to trace the problem on system
930 with the tape drive crashing the system every time TITO tried to do
a tape directory.

Symptom:  RUN TITO and do a DIRECTORY ALL command
	  System crashes at EXCMPE+3, exec page failure

Tracing:  (reverse order)
	  EXCMPE: determine if exec & crash if a hard page failure
	  PGFAIL: come here when hardware detects a page fault
		  (trap locations stored in EPT+500-504)
	  OD.RF+11 was where the trap occurred, at interrupt level
		  in module F3TSER.
	  OLDRW1+?? was where the EPT map pages were setup for the
		  tape read transfer, at UUO level in module F3TSER

Problem:  Exec page fault was caused by "not enough" pages setup for
	  the transfer of tape data into the users buffer, or so it
	  seemed.

	  Actual cause was that the EPT map slot entries for the user's
	  data buffer were shifted, so that when the data was BLT'ed
	  from monitor space into user space through the EPT mapping
	  the pages were off by 1.  This was done at interrupt level.

	  At uuo level, when the EPT pointers were setup, a byte ptr
	  was used,  POINT 18,EPT+<%ONC/1000/2>,-1+18*<<%ONC/1000>&1>
	  which (for all intents and purposes) looks correct.  The
	  problem was that the third operand of the POINT pseudo-op
	  is taken as decimal, thus:  -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^D1000>&1> was the
	  calculation used instead of -1+^D18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1>.

Solution: Change the formula to -1+18*<<%ONC/^O1000>&1> and re-assemble
	  the monitor.

Time frame:  All of this took about a week digging through various
	     modules and comparing F3TSER with MAGSER and FTASER as
	     well as following the code through ONCE startup and using
	     executive DDT to look at the EPT map slots and user buffers.

/Carl

PS:  I, (Carl) did most of the digging, showing Osman, step by step
     as much as I could.  This just happenned to be a very OBSCURE
     bug, and it's lucky that nothing else was affected.

Darren has sent me mail (logged in as Darren:39) asking how to
transfer files from 930 to Tolerant using TUMS.  I answered,
but I also changed his MUD password, and deleted his oper name
on 930.  You might want to keep an eye out for him, this all
sounds very strange.  If its just something harmless, one of
us can send him the file.

May I suggest setting up a new GAN on 930 for guest accounts.
Put ex-gan 3 people in it when they quit so they can still log
in to send mail or whatever, but won't be able to read/write
access all the sources or private directories.  (remember, most
of the accounts like M33 are setup to let any GAN 3 user GFD).

TYMSHARE ACQUIRES PRODUCTION CONTROL SERVICES, INC.


     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 9, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc. announced
that it has acquired the major assets of Production Control
Services, Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif.  Terms of the acquisition
were not revealed.

     Production Control Services, with sales of $1.5 million
in 1983, provides repair and support services to the computer
industry.  The company repairs and sells spare parts for a wide
range of disk, tape and memory products made by Ampex, Cal Comp
and other original equipment manufacturers.  At the time of acquisition,
Production Control Services had an inventory of $20 million.

     By merging Production Control Services into Tymshare's
Computer Systems and Support (CSS) division, it is expected that the
combined operation will post sales of about $18 million in 1984,
according to John Swarbrick, vice president of CSS.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field maintenance,
equipment staging and field engineer training for computer equipment
                                                                Page  2

and related peripherals from such companies as Digital Equipment
Corp., Honeywell and IBM.  These services are used by Tymshare
internally and also are available under third party maintenance
agreements for customers throughout the country.

     A new leader in the certification of removable media disk
heads Production Control Services has under development a
portable disk head certification unit for use in the field.
The device will result in significant cost savings to users 
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, 
and by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.
Swarbrick said the new portable unit will be available in the
fourth quarter of this year.

     Tymshare, Inc. offers a broad range of computer services,
and is part of the newly formed Information Systems group of
McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

Subject: COEES Sail problem

    Carl, Jon, whomever:

    A fellow calling himself INSD.J/O'CONNELL ((201)981-2879) called
    me from Newark New Jersey or some such place complaining that
    COEES is having trouble recompiling their SAIL INIT programs on
    :29, even though said programs reportedly compile fine on :36.  A
    clue is that they use (FTSYS)SAIL.  My guess is they include some
    horrible module which on :29 was not compiled under the same
    version of the SAIL compiler as the one on :36.

    I looked at the version of SAIL on both systems, and find no
    discrepencies.  Since it's not my job to handle this kind of
    stuff, I'll let you deal with it further.

TYMNET VERIFIES ADDITIONAL PC COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE PACKAGES

     SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6, 1984 -- Tymnet has verified seven
additional software products that add terminal emulation capbabilities
to personal computers.

     Until recently, personal computers could not access a
wide range of business applications via low-cost, dial-up ports
on public packet networks.  PCs could access only those services
designed for use with ASCII-compatible asynchronous terminal
devices.

     Vendors now are developing software that enables PCs
to emulate certain intelligent terminals that are supported by
TYMNET's(R) 3270 service.  TYMNET allows a number of smart
asynchronous terminals to emulate IBM 3270s, including Digital
Equipment Corporation's VT100, Lear Siegler's ADM 3A, and the
IBM 3101.  A PC that can emulate one of these terminals can
thereby access an array of 3270-compatible applications and
facilities via TYMNET, in addition to ASCII-compatible services.
Tymnet's verfication service includes evaluation of such
software.
                                                                Page  2


     One of the products recently tested and certified is the
Crosstalk package by MicroStuf of Atlanta, GA.  Crosstalk consistently
has been rated the most popular communications package on the
market by Softalk magazine.  This package enables IBM PCs to
appear as members of Digital's VT100 terminal series.

     Three other software packages that enable IBM PCs to
emulate 3270s have been tested and verified as TYMNET-compatible.
The packages are VTERM by Techland System of New York, NY,
TYM/COMM by Tymshare, Tymnet's sister company based in Cupertino,
CA, and BLAST, by Communications Research Group, Inc. of
New Orleans.

     TELETERM, by Telexpress, Inc. of Willingboro, NJ, permits
the Tandy TRS-80 to emulate the Digital VT100.  This is the first
package that has been verified for the TRS-80.

     The VT/E000-3-01 by P2/I of Albuquerque, provides VT100
emulation for Fortune 32-16 micro-processors.  It is the
first package verfied on the Fortune system.

     In addition, Forte PC 78 by Forte Data Systems, Inc. of
Santa Clara, CA, has had its PJ3278 and PJ3279 package verified.
This enables 3270 emulation with the IBM PC.

     Other personal computer communications software and
hardware packages currently are being tested in Tymnet's
verification program.  Vendors of PC communications software
who wish to participate in the program are asked to contact Tymnet
Public Network Services Product Marketing Group, 2710 Orchard
Parkway, San Joe, Calif., 95134; phone (408) 932-5071.

     Tymnet, Inc., a McDonnell Douglas company, operates TYMNET, one
of the world`s largest public packet data communications
networks.  TYMNET provides local access from more than 500
locations in the United States and from some 50 countries.
The company has installed more independent data networks than
any other public supplier.

Subject: Hotline Log Program

Dear Carl,

     I have managed to fix the problem which made it impossible to use

the DEL key on my Hotline program.  The problem was in the macro

"bs", which I had defined as follows:  bs = <('10)>;

The following SAIL code:  If (C neq bs) then
                            Print(bs);
                          Print(" " & bs);  Which is only executed

in the event that C = '177 or '10, did not work because (C neq bs) always

returned false and the neccessary bs was never printed.

     The problem was solved  by changing the macro definition of bs

to bs = <(null & '10>).  With C declared as an integer, bs must be a

string in order for things to work out.

                              Regards,
                              Helge

    Yes, it's true!  The latest version of Peak, though lacking the
    incredible WARPLD fast-start feature, does have timer-generated
    checkpointing, and therefore spends the bulk of its time in TI
    (rather than SL) state.  This should result in a greater rapport
    with the Tymcom-X scheduler, making the Peak experience a bit
    friskier in loaded situations.

    Let me know if you notice any problems arising from this giant
    leap in Technology.  Use SENDMA.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In anticipation of the physical inventory of fixed assets, please review the
two sets of instruction prior to the tagging of assets.

1.  PHYSICAL INVENTORY OF FIXED ASSETS - INSTRUCTIONS

In an effort to correct errors in the Corporate Fixed Asset Records (PIMS),
we have requested that each office location take a physical inventory of
specific assets, as indicated in the attached instructions.

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS INSTRUCTION PACKAGE IS COMPLETELY READ BEFORE

YOU BEGIN TAGGING AND RECORDING ASSETS.

If there are items or concerns not covered by these instructions, please call
or ontyme (before you begin tagging):  Ellen Martino (408) 446-6521

TAGGING AND RECORDING.


Complete instructions for taking the inventory are attached.  In brief:

1.  We have purchased pre-printed tags to be used in the inventory.  An asset
    control log sheet has been designed for recording the tag numbers and
    asset descriptions as outlined in this memo.

2.  The surface of the asset must be cleaned in order for the tags to success-
    fully adhere to the surface.  A fast drying agent such as rubbing alcohol
    or Windex should be used to clean the surface first.

3.  When applying the tag, go over it with your thumbnail to ensure that it 
    is firmly attached to the surface.

4.  There are nine pieces of information to be filled in on the asset control
    log for each item inventoried:

	a.  Name:        printed name of person doing the tagging.
	b.  Date:        of tagging
	c.  Location:    location numbers as indicated on the enclosed
                         inventory information form.

    e)  For tags that have been destroyed, please account for them on the
        asset control log.

    f)  Tymshare's assets that have been loaned to consultants must be
        brought in for tagging.

                  TAGGING OF THE NEW FIXED ASSET EQUIPMENT PURCHASES

As we conduct the physical inventory of Company Fixed Assets, it is equally 
important for new capital equipment purchases to be tagged in an accurate,
timely manner.  The tagging system that you are using for the physical 
inventory will, therefore, be continued as a means of maintaining and
controlling accurate property records.

Attached is the procedure for tagging new equipment purchases.  ONLY THOSE 
IDENTIFIED AS CAPITAL ASSETS (FIXED ASSETS) ARE TO BE TAGGED.  The current
capitalization policy states:

  "As of January 1, 1984, all new asset purchases with an individual cost
  of $400.00 or greater and an estimated life in excess of one year will be
  capitalized.  This applies to only company owned equipment, not equipment
  that is on lease or on loan from a vendor."

If an item, as defined above, is going to be purchased, a requisition form
authorization for capital expenditure form, (and numerical analysis form
if over $35K) must be completed and approved per the purchasing and
capital spending policies.  The asset must be coded to the proper 16XX
property account number on the forms.

After you have received a purchase order and requisition back from
purchasing, check the account number again to make sure that the item(s)
were approved as capital equipment.

Upon delivery of the equipment, place the tag on the equipment and fill
out the asset control log per the attached instructions.  Send the
original asset control logs once a month to:

     Tymshare, Inc.
     Fixed Assets Department
     Attention:  Fixed Asset Supervisor
     V61-A02
     20705 Valley Green Drive
     Cupertino, CA 95014

     Copy:  To be retained at the assets location

We hope that through the use of this tagging policy, our future physical
inventory will be clean and less painful.

FIXED ASSET   -   ASSIGNMENT OF ASSET TAGS - PURCHASED CAPITAL ASSETS -
                                   INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE:

In order to maintain and control accurate property accounting records, all new
capital asset property must be tagged upon receipt from the vendor.  A copy of
the tagging record must be sent to Corporate Fixed Assets.  The tag number will
be added to the property record in the Fixed Asset (PIMS) system.

FORMS

Asset Control Log and Tags

I.  Upon delivery from the vendor, each new capital asset must be tagged and
    recorded on the Asset Control Log.  New Capital assets are defined as 
    property that is Tymshare owned, has an individual cost of $400 or more
    and a life greater than 1 year.  This includes swaps or replacements for
    existing equipment.  Fixed Assets must be informed of any swaps or
    replacements from a vendor.  Each tag contains a machine-readable number
    which will be read during our annual physicals with hand-held bar code 
    readers.

    a.  Pressure sensitive, pre-printed tag numbers will be provided by
        either Fixed Assets or your Division Controller.  Use left over tags
        from the current tagging process first.

    b.  Asset Control Logs will be provided by either Fixed Assets or your
        Division Controller.

II. Instructions for tagging and recording assets:

    a.  The surface must be clean in order for the tags to successfully
        adhere to the surface.  A fast drying agent such as rubbing alcohol
        or Windex should be used to clean the surface first.

    b.  When applying the tag, go over it with your thumbnail to ensure that
        it is firmly attached to the surface.

        DESTROYED on the Asset Control Log.

    d.  The tag is to be attached to the outside of each asset in an
        accessible place.  Use a flat, smooth surface on the back of the

    The unclean intelligence, fortunately, is confined to the routine
    T!GetC, which gets the next character(s) from the terminal.  The
    reason for its existence is that we must simulate a SAIL polling
    point in order to perform a checkpoint while we are in terminal
    input wait.  If you are curious about the mechanism, take a look
    at T!GetC.

    Sorry about the mess.

JEFFERY BAER JOINS MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FINANCIAL SERVICES
STRATEGIC STUDY TEAM

     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 19, 1984 -- Jeffery Baer has been
appointed to the financial services strategic study team
for McDonnell Douglas Corp.  Information Systems Group, which
was established shortly after the acquisition of Tymshare by
McDonnell Douglas.

     The team is responsible for identifying markets and
opportunities in the financial services industry, one of the
areas McDonnell Douglas is investigating in its plans to build
several industry-specialized information systems businesses.
The objective is that each of the selected industries will
generate annual sales of at least $1 billion in 1990.

     Prior to his appointment to the team, Baer had been
president of Tymshare's payment services division.  He was
responsible for TeleCheck Services, Inc., and point-of-sale (POS)
services.  TeleCheck, based in Denver, provides guaranteed check
acceptance services.  POS, based in Fremont, Calif., provides
credit card authorizations, electronic draft capture and other
                                                                Page  2

related electronic payment services.

     Baer, who had been president of TeleCheck when the company
was acquired by Tymshare in 1980, received a B.S. in hotel
administration from Cornell University in 1970.

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services, and is
part of the McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

The message to operations managers reads very well from my

Sounds real good, hope evrything works to COESS's satisfaction.
Voew, if it is beeing check every clock tic no wonder why system
would be slow if lots of people have set TRU limit, if no body sets it
I think it wouldn't matter even every clock tic(execute one instruction),
Oh well looks like you are doing some real work while some of us goofing
around. I started the program (special command mode) it is very 
intersting and learning lot, hope to finish it next week.
Have a good evening and see you Monday.

I take it that the sources containing the current interrupt code
are losts.  Who wrote that code?  Why is Tim Brengle involved?
It is not up to me to locate the sources.  This is not a union shop.
We will work together on the problem, but as you know there is
no one to pass it off to.  Therefore I expect you to carry the
TRU limit solution through to completion; not just strictly the
monitor part.

TYMSHARE'S IBIS DIVISION ADDS THREE MAJOR FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS TO ITS ROSTER OF CLIENTS

     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 23, 1984 -- Three major international
banking firms have signed contracts with Tymshare's International
Banking and Investment Systems (IBIS) division.

     IBIS(TM) is a total software product designed to meet the
trading requirements of the international banking and investment
community.  It runs on the Digital Equipment Corp.  VAX equipment,
and allows banks to link into the Tymnet public packet data
network to communicate with their data centers.

     The three banks are Credit Agricole, First American Bank
of Washington and the Bank of Bermuda.  In addition, Skandinaviska
Enskillda Banken of Sweden, already an IBIS user, is bringing
IBIS to its offices worldwide.

     First American Bank, based in Washington, D.C., will have
installed two VAX computers and IBIS software at its newly
opened New York office.  The contract is valued at about 
$1 million.
                                                                Page  2


     Credit Agricole, one of the largest banks in France, has
installed the complete IBIS product line in its offices in
Chicago, New York and London.  It will be used for international
foreign exchange trading, money market trading, commercial
loans and interbank checking and accounting.  The first system
will be installed in Chicago at a cost of about $500,000.

     The Bank of Bermuda, the largest bank in Bermuda, will
have the system installed on VAX 780 computers at its headquarters
offices at a cost of about $500,000.  In addition, the bank
will retain IBIS to provide ongoing consulting.

     Skandinaviska has installed VAX computers programmed with
IBIS software in its New York office, and plans to include
Frankfurt and Hamburg, Singapore, Luxemburg and London in a
worldwide expansion effort.  The cost of the complete installation
will be more than $1 million.

     IBIS is an integrated system built on a foundation of
modular packages than can function independently, or be
integrated into a whole.  It automates front office trading
and lending as well as back office accounting functions.

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services, and
is part of the  newly formed Information Systems Group of the
McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.  Tymnet, also a McDonnell
Douglas company, operates TYMNET(R), one of the world's largest
public packet data communications networks.

TYMNET CERTIFIES ADDITIONAL X.25 PRODUCTS COMPATIBLE 
FOR USE ON ITS PUBLIC DATA NETWORK


     SAN JOSE, Calif., July 16, 1984 -- As part of its ongoing
effort to support X.25 protocol, Tymnet has tested and certified
16 additional X.25 products compatible for use on the TYMNET(R)
packet data network.  About 100 products now have met the
requirements of Tymnet's certification program.

     One of those products, the integrated business exchange
(IBX), is the first PBX device that has been certified on the
Tymnet network.  Produced by InteCom, Inc., of Allen, Texas,
the IBX is a switch that permits simultaneous voice and data
exchange.  The switch is designed to be transparent to protocol,
and, in addition, features protocol conversion processes.

     Once the system is installed, users dial out to connect to
the InteNet packet controller, which switches the data to
X.25 protocol.  Using this protocol, the terminal has access
to the Tymnet network.

                                                                Page  2

     With the addition of X.25 implementation, InteCom can
offer its users greater flexibility in accessing any host,
terminal or printer, and provide broader data base accessibility.

     Also verified for use on TYMNET is the Hewlett Packard
HP2334A cluster controller.  The cluster controller contains
eight to 16 ports, which when connected to a terminal can
access TYMNET.  Data is converted from RS232 to X.25 protocol,
and transmitted over TYMNET, at a lower cost than using
multiple leased telephone lines.  The HP2334A can handle
up to 16 terminals, and is one of the few Tymnet-certified
products that will handle block mode as well as character mode
transmission.

     Additional X.25 products that recently have been certified
by Tymnet include:

     Amdahl:  4440 Network Concentrator.
     Altos Computer System:  Altos X.25.
     Cableshare:  CSI-X.25 Data Concentrator.

     A complete listing of Tymnet-certified X.25 products may
be obtained by calling the Tymnet Public Network Services
Product Marketing Group at (408) 942-5061.

     Tymnet, a McDonnell Douglas company, operates TYMNET, one
of the world's largest public packet data communications
networks.  TYMNET provides local access from more than 500 locations
in the United States and from some 50 countries.  The company
has installed more independent data networks than any other
public supplier.

We will get additional people to handle the Applications/Languages
load and Jon or I will contact Tim Brengle re old F40 sources
if necessary, i.e. Ken Holcomb is a dead end.

Good work that P034/N04 is in the hands (fingers?) of the customer!

Please read (fletcherc)hotlin.mem  for the text of what I will be sending
to Artson Answering Service to begin on 1 August
Also please note that we will be getting Phil French to modify the
26kl Tops20 microcode to support TYMCOM-X and can anticipate having
it ready for testing with TYMCOM-X in September. I have been meaning
to mention this to you.

Subject: p1.sai (Hotline program)

Greetings Carl,

     In my spare time I have made some minor improvements in my P1.sai

program.  In the first place, In the interest of compatibility, I have

substituted (SAILIB)sail.def definitions for my own definitions at the

top of the program.  Secondly, when the program is running and it asks

the user to enter the date, if the user just types the carriage return,

the system date will be inserted into the file; otherwise another date

can be inserted as before.  I am working on getting this to work on the

time-of-day as well.  The only problem is that when I run P1.sai, I get

the following message: POSSIBLE COMPILED CODE-RUNTIME INCOMPATIBITITY.
                       CONTINUE IF YOU DARE
                       Called from 4430  Last SAI call at 777777.

This message appears three times in succession as I advance by hitting

carriage return.  After the messages, the program runs as designed.  I

would be interested in hearing your thoughts as to why I get these

warnings and whether or not they can be supressed.

                                Regards,
                                Bill Mortensen

Hi Carl..

	I couldn't find anything wrong with any of the files. Called back
to Christ Altman and let her know what I did and asked her to give us a
call if any more problem. She said DEC will be doing a PM tomorrow and
hopefully they might find something wrong with the hardware.

	I am not sure what you are really asked me to do about the
COEES's TRUINT.MEM this afternoon but, I looked at it for 2 hrs and did
absoletly nothing. Made 2 files in my directory TRUIN1 and TRUIN2,
look at them and see if that's what you wanted (don't think so). I
don't want to be unpolite but since you know exactly what you are
asking, it might be faster and better if you finished it.

	I will call you if something comes up URGENT. 

Osman..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THE FOLLOWING WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS TODAY.  PLEASE POST AND DISTRIBUTE.

USAIR JOINS MARSPLUS RESERVATION SYSTEM


     CUPERTINO, Calif., July 25, 1984 -- Tymshare, Inc., a McDonnell
Douglas company, and USAIR, Inc. have signed an agreement making
USAIR a participant in Tymshare's multi-access reservation system,
MarsPlus(TM).  MarsPlus enables USAIR to offer direct access to its
reservations system from travel agencies and corporate travel
departments throughout the United States.

     MarsPlus is a service that allows unrestricted and equal
access to each subscriber airline's reservation system.  It
provides unbiased information from which to select flights, shop
for fares and produce tickets from each airline's reservations
terminal.  Northwest Orient, Piedmont, Ozark, Republic, Pan
American, TWA and Eastern also participate in the system.

     Through MarsPlus, USAIR's reservation system will be
available via Tymnet, the international data communications
network.  Using inexpensive dial-up terminals (or personal
computers with modems), users can view each MarsPLus airline's
flight information and fares and also make reservations.
                                                                Page  2


     USAIR bookings through MarsPlus have increased steadily
as the airline has grown.  The addition of on-line access will
make it even more convenient for agents and travelers to book
flights, and will provide more accurate and reliable reservations
services, said Jose Ferguson, manager of MarsPlus marketing
and sales.

     "USAIR participation adds considerably to our system and offers
us an opportunity to expand the MarsPlus network in markets of
mutual interest," said Ferguson.

     MarsPlus is the primary reservation system in more than
400 U.S. travel agencies and corporate travel departments.
It is the only reservation system offering real-time access
to the carriers' own data bases, but is not operated or
controlled by an airline.

     MarsPlus is operated by Tymshare Travel Management Services,
a division of Tymnet, Inc. of San Jose, Calif., and of
McDonnell Douglas Informations Systems Group, St. Louis.

    After our last live discussion, involving yourself and John
    Wilkes, I checked with my boss and he said he did not have any
    openings except for experienced language types and Unix/C major
    product designer(s).  He suggested that I suggest you look at the
    wall in the cafeteria.  It's his best approximation to current
    knowlege.  Remember that NTD seems to have a Tech Pubs group of
    some kind, as well as the Tymnet group to which Pat Morse
    defected.

    NAD sucks.  I'm not scheduled for ISIS programming class until
    October, by which time I'll be senile.  The guy I'm learning from
    is difficult to understand.  The design of the engine is bizarre,
    and probaly qualifies as Cruel and Unusual.

Subject: p1.sai (Hotline Log Program)

     Carl,

          Since my last communication, I have made the following change

     to p1.sai:  when the program prompts for the name of person taking

     the call, if a <cr> (only) is then typed, the name of the person

     who is logged on for that session is inserted into the log file.

     Note:  When p1.sai starts to run, it lets the user know by printing

     the date,time, and user-name, before asking for any input.  The 

     user can then decide whether to use the shortcuts when date/time/

     name-of-person-taking-call prompts appear.

                                   Regards,

I don't seem to be able to do anything right lately, so I'm giving you a choice:I can either return to Walnut Creek, or you can change your behaviour. Look,
I know we're each under a lot of pressure lately, but each other is the last
person either of us should be taking our aggressions out on, don't you
agree? You may not have noticed it and you may not agree, but you have been
raising your voice to me a good deal more often lately, usually for no good
reason. I'm not saying I've been the easiest of persons to get along with latelyeither, but if the stress is getting to us both this much, maybe we need to
get away from each other. It just seems like lately you are tending to holler
many times when it simply isn't called for. If I bother you that much, I'll
leave. It's up to you.

Operational changes for TYMCOM-X release P034/N


    The P034/N release of TYMCOM-X contains several changes which may
  affect current operational procedures.  The changes are as follows:

    A.  Defining a structure.
	All references to swapping space has been removed.

	1.  There is no active swapping list.
	2.  The TYPE and CHANGE SWAP commands have been removed.
	3.  The question "PAGES FOR SWAPPING ON UNIT" has been removed.
	4.  All messages about units in swapping list and units having
	    swapping space have been removed.

    B.  Changing a system number.
	Hosts connected PDP-11 or micro-net bases are no longer
	restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.  The system
	number may be set to any number between 1 and 99999 on any
	KS-10 (DEC-2020 or Tymshare SYSTEM-XX), Foonly F3 (SYSTEM XXV)
	or Foonly F4 (SYSTEM XXVI or XXVI-KL).

	Note: Hosts connected to VARIAN bases (KI-10 and KL-10) are
	still restricted to system numbers between 1 and 255.

    C.  Bringing the system up on the console terminal.
	The function of the CONSOLE command has been modified to allow
	the system to be brought up on the console terminal in ANY mode.
	This command sets a flag which tells the system to ignore the
	network and the base and to ONLY talk to the console terminal.
	When the CONSOLE command is given, the system responds with:

	  Console selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

	Previously, the CONSOLE command brought the system up on the
	console terminal in MANUAL mode only.

    D.  New "NETWORK" command added.
	This is the default.  After the CONSOLE command is given, the
	system will come up using only the console terminal.  If it is
	desired to use the network instead of the console, this command
	must be given before typing GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY.  When
	the NETWORK command is given, the system responds with:

	  Network selected.
	  Please type GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY to bring up the system.

    E.  Various messages have been changed in ONCE and INITIA in order
        to make it easier to diagnose startup problems. 

        As an aid in updating documentation, the following help messages
        have been copied verbatim from the monitor sources.  Please see
        that your staff understands the wording of each text and that
        the procedures and documents using portions of these messages
        are updated to reflect the changes.

ONCE DIALOG:
    ONCE> HELP

    TYPE     Report information about the system.
             TYPE CORE   - the default minimum core available to users.
             TYPE SYSTEM - reports the system number.

    CHANGE   Change information about the system.
             CHANGE CORE   - changes the default minimum user core.
             CHANGE SYSTEM - changes the system number.

    FULL     Bring up the system with a FULL DSKCLN.  If there is any
             question about the integrity of the file system, then this
             command should be used in place of GO.  Unless authorized,
             DO NOT enter the FILES dialogue to set the DSKCLN type.

    GO       Bring up the system with the default settings and start
             the auto-restart process.

    FILES    Enter the FILES dialogue.  This is the subsystem of ONCE
             which is normally used ONLY for restructuring or repairing
             the disk file system.  The commands in this subsystem could
             damage the file system if they are used incorrectly.  If you
             are NOT sure of what you are doing, DO NOT enter this section.

    READONLY Bring up the system SHUT for emergency examination.
             Writing on the disk is prevented until DSKCLN has been run.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    CONSOLE  Allow the system to be brought up on the CONSOLE terminal ONLY.
             The system MUST be reloaded before it can be brought up on the
             network.  This command should be followed by a command to bring
             up the system (one of: GO, FULL, MANUAL or READONLY).

    NETWORK  Allow the system to be brought up on the NETWORK (default).
             This allows normal access to the system and overrides any
             previous CONSOLE or NETWORK commands.  This command should be
             followed by a command to bring up the system. (see CONSOLE.)

    DDT      Enter executive DDT.  To be used ONLY by software wizards
             for emergency patching and examination of the monitor.
             UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU NORMALLY USE THIS COMMAND!

    MANUAL   Bring up the system in the SHUT state for DEBUGGING ONLY!
             The auto-restart process is not performed.
             Note: You may not UNSHUT the system until DSKCLN has been run.

    BOOTS    Crash the system with "BOOTS LOADED" immediately.

For KS-10 only:
    KMC      Bring the system up loading the KMC-11 but without the
             rest of the automatic restart procedure.  This must NEVER
             be used for a restart after a system CRASH.  ONLY to be
             used when the system has been taken down gracefully and
             DSKCLN has already been run.

      1.  Glad to hear that PERP is working again.
 
      2.  Robert Klute has given David Miller the software "key" to defuse
          the 1022 timebomb.  However, having just spoken to David Miller,
          he's not certain whether he can disable the timebomb before it
          explodes tonight at midnight (well into your day Wednesday);
          right now David is trying to reach Robert Klute about this.
 
      3.  Your point about correct contacts is well taken:  to all the
          recipients of this message please note that PeterPeterPeter StratmanStratmanStratman

3.  Miscommunication and lost time regarding X/XX monitor release L
 
 
          Since over two years have transpired since the last monitor
          release, David Miller isn't sure how it was done in the past any
          more for C-T.  His suggestion:  he would like to handle this
          situation partly as he does for each U.S. host, namely:
           a.  (SYS)BACKUP.SAV is copied to (SYS)OLDMON.SAV .
           b.  (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV is copied to (SYS)BACKUP.SAV .
           c.  The new N monitor (replacement for L) is telecopied to
               (SYS)NEWMON.SAV .
 
          Note that then it would be up to the discretion of the local C-T
          operations staff to actually load the N monitor for each host.
 
          If my memory serves me, there used to be problems in this
          approach where C-T intentionally shut down certain XX's during
          the California workday.  It might be appropriate for C-T to pro-
          vide a list of all XX's which should receive the telecopied mon-
          itor, and in case David can not reach certain hosts, alternate
          host-username combinations to which he can telecopy the monitor
          files.
 
          In any case, may I suggest that this be worked out by Messrs
          Miller and Stratman.
 
     Best regards,
 
     - Peter  (IOD.HQ)

{2}  The fact that Carl may have incorrectly or confusingly addressed cor-
     respondence to CT on this matter, and that he still uses an exotic
     ONTYME name from an unpublished group is the natural consequence of a
     consistent lack of cooperation within Dick Ouellette's group toward
     repeated requests from Les Metour and myself for respecting Tymshare
     norms of communication via ONTYME.  Clair Levin, who recently worked
     in the field and understands the value of coherent and up-to-date
     ONTYME directories, is trying to help resolve this impasse.

Effective 7/1/84, the Payment Technology Department (PTD) will report into 
the Payment Transaction Services Division (PMTS).  Formerly part of the
Network Technology Division (NTD), PTD provides technical development,
support, and operational services for PMTS.  PTD is responsible for host
systems on Data General, Hewlett Packard, and IBM hardware, as well as a large
commitment to Tymnet based technology.

PTD Department Manager Joseph Oren reports to PMTS Division Manager Robert
Howell.  The newly consolidated organization will benefit from more closely
coordinated activities.  PMTS looks forward to continued rapid growth and
expanding opportunities, an environment which demands a synergy of efforts
between sales and marketing, on one hand, and the technical on the other.

PTD offices are located in Irvine Ca., Fremont Ca., and Chevy Chase Md.
Reporting to Joseph Oren in PTD are managers Joe Lusker, Alan Monath, 
Barry Ohara, Ed Quigley, Charles Regalia, Girish Shah, and Dan Thomas.
PMTS extends a warm welcome to these and other PTD personnel.  They bring
with them the talent and dedication which has been and will continue
to be a key element in the success of PMTS.

     With some embarassment I would like to correct some errors in my pre-
     vious memo to all of you.
 
      1.  The monitor release in question is N, which is to replace
          release L; the title of my memorandum was misleading.
 
      2.  Clare Levin has pointed out that as of yesterday there is now a
          *** DIRECT.DBSD, edited by Jan Turriff.
 
      3.  Although Carl Baltrunas sits near the DBSD group (managed by
          Dick Ouellette), he is no longer a part of it (as can now be
          seen by scanning the contents of *** DIRECT.DBSD), although he
          still works on Tymcom-X (and -XX) support; hence the continued
          use of the TXS.- account.
 
     So I am guilty of some miscommunication myself!  Sorry for any incon-
     venience this may have caused you.
 
     Best regards,
 
     - Peter  (IOD.HQ)

Subject: TRULIM/FORSE sources to match (SYS:26)LIB40.REL

Well,
  After a week of scrounging, with little or no "luck", I found a
source file which generated a binary .REL file the same size as the
one included in LIB40.REL on system 26.  In a stroke of luck, it was
found that although it didn't match, the only difference was the
version number in module FORSE.  I changed the version, re-assembled
it, and VOILA!!!!  FORSE.MAC which generates the proper .REL file!

  A similar comparison shows that no changes were made to TRAPS.REL
(which contains TRULIM) and the ancient source that I found is still
valid.

  One last note:  System 26 has a different LIB40 than that of most
                  of the rest of the world, so I still need to perform
                  a cursory set of tests on system 26 before we give
		  it to COEES for testing.

  Delay!  System 26 has been down from 11pm til 5am for the past two
          days, so the testing will have to wait until this afternoon.


PS:  Jon, feel free to contact Angela and tell her she will have a new
     FTLIB40.REL for COEES to test by tomorrow (Thursday) morning at
     the very latest.  If all goes well in my testing, sooner. I will
     try to call her sometime Wednesday afternoon.

/Carl

If it pases their tests, I will have to build them a separate version
to use on their production systems.

     Eric, reference your Ontyme of July 6th on subject laser printer
     accounting.
 
      1.  Product codes do not presently exist for laser printing.  Howev-
          er, it will be no problem to add required new codes to the
          appropriate price codes.
 
          You mentioned the unit of accounting would be the printed page.
          The regular printing charges are based on two items: number of
          pages and I/O.  Do you wish this new service to reflect only the
          one product code, or both?  We can implement new codes fairly
          quickly, once we know how many are required.
 
      2.  Tymcom 370:  I have talked with Dick Rawson on the subject.  He
          has supplied me with a 3 page document by the name of 'Support
          Services Accounting BRS', dated November 23, 1982.  Yesterday I
          mailed a copy to you; this may be the same document you refer-
          enced in your memo.
 
          Dick stated he did not believe any changes would be required on
          his side other than understanding the mechanism by which you
          would be implementing the laser printing capability.  By this he
 
 

 
CT laser printing accounting                                        Page 2
 
 
          means that proper communication should take place so this new
          capability, once defined, is understood by all concerned.
 
      3.  I have had a brief discussion with Carl Baltrunas regarding the
          Tymcom X environment; this is a more complex issue and will
          likely require more time to evaluate and implement.  Very hon-
          estly, I am quite confused on what changes are required and how
          they would be implemented, but I'm certain Carl will assist as
          required.  I'd suggest the Tymcom X implementation wait until
          successful completion on the Tymcom 370.
 
     I look forward to your response, specifically with respect to item 1.
     Best regards. Ken

             Block I/O.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  Peter,
 
  I  have noticed  in  the  documentation files  for  the  last couple  of
  releases of the Tymcom-X monitor, that no  block i/o ports will be nego-
  ciated with  the Tymbase of 2020  machines. This restriction  for 2020's
  seems to be the  result of problems with block i/o  on one of Tymshare's
  customer 2020's.
 
  This surprises me a bit, and I would like to know the following :
 
  1.  What symptoms did these problems present  to have caused the modifi-
      cation to  the monitor. ( We  use block I/O frequently,  without any
      trouble ).
 
  2.  Will this restriction be applicable to  monitors created for CEGI in
      the future ?
 
  Thank you, and regards,
 
  Peter.

THE FOLLOWING WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS TODAY.  PLEASE POST AND DISTRIBUTE.

SAMIR KEBBE JOINS TYMSHARE'S IBIS DIVISION AS DIRECTOR
OF CONSULTING SERVICES


     CUPERTINO, Calif., August 6, 1984 -- Samir Kebbe has joined
Tymshare, Inc., a McDonnell Douglas company, as director of
consulting services for the International Banking and Investment
Systems (IBIS)(TM) division based in Lyndhurst, N.J.  He reports
to Adnan Elassad, president of the IBIS division.

     Kebbe will be responsible for the administration and
direction of consulting and support groups for IBIS, a total
software product designed to meet the trading requirements
of the international banking and investment community.

     IBIS is an integrated system built on a foundation of
modular packages that can function independently, or be
integrated into a whole.  It runs on the Digital Equipment
Corp. VAX equipment and automates the front office trading and
lending as well as back office accounting functions.

     Kebbe, who has more than 26 years' experience in the field
                                                                Page  2

of domestic and international banking, was previously vice
president and deputy chief of operations of UBAF Arab American
Bank of New York.  There he completed a full conversion
the Arbat system to the IBIS system for the money market, foreign
exchange, precious metals, customer information file, loan,
demand deposit account, call accounts and general ledger
departments.

     Kebbe holds an accounting degree from Ste. Comptable de
France, Paris, and a business administration degree from College
des Frere des Ecoles Chretiennes, Cairo.

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services, and is
part of the newly formed Information Systems Group of the McDonnell
Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

SUBJECT>   RECOGNITION EVENTS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


In 1985 there will be two major events to recognize and reward
outstanding 1984 performance of ISG Blue Sector personnel.  The Blue
Sector organizations are McAuto, (which includes the recently integrated
INSG and International organizations from Tymshare), MDSH, plus
Financial Services, National Computer Operations and Finance &
Administration from Tymshare.

The first of these is the Professional Achievement Symposium.  We
are pleased with the positive feedback received on our first Symposium
held in New Orleans last month and consequently want to publicize our
commitment to institutionalizing this event.  The 1985 Symposium will
be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the famous Caribe Hilton Hotel from
15 May through 18 May 1985.  All Blue Sector personnel, other than those
on sales quotas, who were with the company or an acquired company before
1 September 1982 will be eligible for attendance based on professional
contributions made during the period 1 April 1984 thru 30 March 1985.
Additional details on the selection process will be communicated in the
near future.

The second event is the annual Marketing Achievement Club.  As in the
past, all Blue Sector sales personnel who qualify through achieving
their 1984 sales quotas will be in attendance.  The 1984 Marketing
Achievement Club will be held at the Royal Waikoloa Hotel on the Big
Island of Hawaii.  The dates are from 23 February through 27 February
1985.
                                                                Page  2


Given that previously separate McAuto and Tymshare recognition events
will now be conducted on a Blue Sector basis, groundrules and
procedures are being formulated that reconcile differences in the way
the individual organizations previously managed these events.  In this
process we are trying to incorporate the best ideas from all the
previous events to make our future events better than ever.

We all recognize the Blue Sector and the ISG have committed to ambitious
goals that will challenge us individually and collectively in the months
and years to come.  The Marketing Achievement Club and the Professional
Achievement Symposium are rewards for those who contribute
significantly to our success.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     I am pleased to announce three recent promotions at Microdata
Corp. that will, I am confident, have a beneficial effect upon
Microdata's continuing growth and success.

     First, Michael P. Coleman has been promoted to Vice President,
North American Sales, and will be responsible for a national and inter-
national sales and marketing organization, which includes Microdata
branch offices, as well as a dealer/distributor network, throughout the
U.S., Canada, Australia, Latin America, and the Far East.

     With more than 20 years' experience in the  computer and electronics
industry, Mike joined Microdata in 1981.  He played a major role in
Microdata's outstanding sales performance for the past three years,
including record-breaking revenues in 1983.  In addition he success-
fully spearheaded Microdata's thrust into the Fortune 500 sector,
where several major corporate accounts were secured.

     Secondly, William A. Schrader has been appointed Vice President,
U.S. Development, responsible for Microdata's Irvine Engineering
Division, which has extensive hardware, operating software, and periph-
eral equipment programs underway.

     Bill joined Microdata over 10 years ago as a Project Engineer,
and played a principal role in several major hardware development
programs, including the company's M9000, state-of-the-art 32 bit
                                                                Page  2

super minicomputer.

     Finally, Paul W. Wiedenmann has been named Executive Vice
President of Microdata, responsible for managing the day-to-day
operational activities of the company.

     Paul started with Microdata in 1978 as Vice President, Finance and
Administration of the International Division; in 1981 he was named
Vice President, Finance for the entire company, and later promoted to
Senior Vice President, Finance and Administration.  He has exhibited
traits of commitment, teamwork and capability, and has distinguished
himself among his peers on the Senior Staff as a significant contributor
and an effective leader.

     In the last six months I have assumed a broader role as a member
of the Executive Board of the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems
Group with responsibility for three operating units of Tymshare.  The
appointment of Paul Wiedenmann as Executive Vice President
will assure that Microdata continues to move on its aggressive path,
and will allow me as President and Chief Executive Officer to remain
involved from a strategic standpoint.

     Please join me in congratulating Mike Coleman, Bill Schrader
and Paul Wiedenmann on their promotions.

Ron, reporting directly to me, brings with him responsibility for
all Tymshare International activities.

Although the Tymshare and McAuto IPM entities will remain physically
separated throughout 1984, the synergies and mutual expertise and
resources of these two organizations will immediately be applied to
realize the combined potential of this new organizaton.

Subject: P034/L25 on D23

Lois had made an L25 for 23 before she left and told Stephanie in Validations
it was in her directory.  I sent mail to OPER on 23 asking them to come up
on it when convenient as it was necessary for security considerations for the
INFORMATION account that is being moved to 23.  Anyway, it crashed with
10 AUG 0801 D23-P034/L25 $? #761-KI CRA001, StopPC/ERRCON:ILLINS+2
today and Tom Marconi called me since I had sent the mail.

Do you want to just give them an /N monitor to replace /L25 with and forget
about the crash unless it happens on /N?  Tom was leaving for a week.  If
you want to talk to somebody, call Ed Barron, otherwise, they'll continue
to run on /L25.

As for the security issue, what they need is LOGOUT ON STOP.  Since they're
in Restricted Command Mode, anyway, its no big deal if they had to run on
/K?? for a while if you'd be more comfortable with that.

Someone might consider making a new monitor for C33.  The

This allows for -14 aux circuits.  Seem to be getting alot of

There is no problem.  I know the current processor for 33 will handle
128 ports (127) since it occasionally runs 39.  Only bases running the
old code to support two CPUs on one base have the 96 port restriction.
Supposedly there aren't any of those left (for performance reasons).

  Ken,
 
  As far as we can see, the patch made to the monitor on host P90 has been
  a success.
 
  I have  checked with Philippe  Lefebvre, and  he has confirmed  that the
  'Detail' files for  his customer now indicate that  PCOM originated jobs
  are accounted for using the correct product codes for TRU, connect time,
  etc...
 
  This means that  we would much like  to have this change  applied to the
  next version of the monitor.
 
  Our thanks to all concerned for their assistance.
 
  Regards, Peter.

Subject: DSKCLN and CLRALC

Somebody really needs to fix DSKCLN so CLRALC is unnecessary!!!  Since they
did the all files restore on 39, and ran CLRALC, of course, every file in
the whole bloody system has an access date of 12 August.  CLRALC can't be
changed to not access files, since that's the only way to clear the ALC bit.
****A*R*G*H****  And they STILL want to hire Ernie back as a consultant! ****
Please don't let it fall through the cracks, the change to DSKCLN would not
be too serious, or at the very least, something could be changed so CLRALC
didn't have to change access dates.  I mean really, what are they there for?
We might as well just take it out and save the overhead!  ****B*E*L*C*H****

Subject: DSKCLN & CLRALC

...creation dates...

I don't know how much it would take, or if this would solve the problem.
Just listen a second...

 DEC has 2 creation dates in the RIB.

 o  One is the one everyone looks at, dirit, etc... it is the creation
    date for the data in the file and can be set to any date current or
    past by a non-privileged process, just like our creation date.

 o  The other is the internal creation date-time of the file itself.
    That is, when the file was actually created on disk.

Back to TYMCOM-X...

    If CLRALC (and/or TITO) were changed to update a date-time word to be
kept in the structure's HOME page whenever they were run, or an incremental
dump was taken then DSKCLN could check this date against the internal
creation date of each UFD/file just as it now checks the ALC bit against
each UFD/file to determine whether it needs to do anything.

    After an all-files restore, all files would have an internal creation
date-time sometime between when the restore began and when it ended.  If
we assume TITO can set the new restore/incremental date in the HOME page
when it is done, then DSKCLN wouldn't get upset, and CLRALC wouldn't need 
to be run, and the access date on the file wouldn't be changed.


What do you think?

Subject: clralc

That's one solution that would clearly work, but it sounds like alot of
work to implement - change TITO, Monitor, DSKCLN.  I think a simple change
to DSKCLN to call a routine when it runs out of core that goes and deletes
all of the "CLRALC packets" packets from the chain of fixup blocks (thus
freeing hoards of memory, and sets a flag which serves two purposes:
  1. the routine which normally writes "CLRALC packets" would become a noop.
  2. after DSKCLN is done and starts to process the fixups, it would do a
     loop that fakes having a "CLRALC packet" for every file in the system.
This would make DSKCLN slow (as slow as CLRALC), but only in the cases where
one would have to run CLRALC.  Also, this has advantage that it is self
contained in DSKCLN.  Also, come to think of it, TITO is not the only case
where this problem can occur.  Anytime the system goes down after a huge
number of files have been created shortly prior to crash, DSKCLN is in
danger of running out of core.  This could happen as result of some MAGNUM
or random user program.  Maybe a program going wild and looping creating
empty files.  -- Give it a think and maybe give me a call.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     I'm trying to determine the total number of original 35mm slides
that Tymshare LOBs use in a calendar year, for the purpose of evaluat-
ing potentially more cost-effective methods for Tymshare personnel to
create slide presentations.

     If the company's total slide volume is sufficiently high, Corp-
orate Communications would be able to offer all internal requesters a
computer-generated slide imaging service.  If we did offer such an
option, I'm confident that we could deliver the finished slide in the
same timeframe as most outside vendors, but at approximately 1/4 to
1/5 of the cost.

     To complete my research, I would appreciate receiving an OnTyme
(CORPCOM.P/BERGERSEN) with answers to the following questions.

     1)  What is the total number of slides you have created for
1984, year-to-date?

     2)  What was the total number of slides you created in 1983?

     3)  How many presentations do you make, using slides, per year?

SUBJECT>   CONTRACTING PROCESS IN ISG-BLUE SECTOR


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


     Some contracts which involve significant dollar values and/or
substantial risks are being negotiated and consummated without being
adequately reviewed by ISG or MDC attorneys.  This practice needs to
stop and will through appropriate adherence to the provisions of this
AB.

     It is necessary that legal input and review be done in the early
stages of the negotiation or contracting process.  Legal review of a
green sheet in the later stages of the process is not effective unless
you are willing to accept the risk of major delays or in some cases
absolute turndowns.

     The following newly instituted process takes effect immediately:

     (1)  Any Blue Sector contract involving a dollar value
of $2.5 million or greater (and this value shall include any anticipated
add-ons or additions reasonably contemplated) shall have legal input
in the contracting process.

     (2)  Any contract which may subject ISG/MDC to unusual risks shall
have legal input regardless of the dollar amount.  Examples of
unusual risks could be:

                                                                Page  2

          (a)  Equal Employment Opportunity compliance clauses (or
other labor related clauses), which are other than the standard
Federal Government EEO requirements;

          (b)  Federal, state or local government provisions made a
part of the contract (which may affect our standard contract provisions);

          (c)  Liquidated damages;

          (d)  Warranty clauses - includes the removal of any standard
disclaimers as to implied warranties;

          (e)  Consequential or incidental damages clauses including
removal or impact on disclaimers of consequential or incidental
damages;

          (f)  Compromise of any MDC or ISG proprietary rights.

     Exceptions to the requirements of this policy shall be:

     (1)  Any subsidiary or business unit which should be exempt - to
be determined by Bob Fischer and Stan Bjurstrom, the ISG-Blue Sector
Chief Counsel.  Exceptions should only be requested when alternate
arrangements for accomplishing a similar legal review (e.g., reviews
by outside attorneys normally done) are in place.

     (2)  With respect to pre-approved pro forma contracts (turnkey
systems or others); any deviation from the standard clauses which have
legal significance must be approved by the ISG-Blue Sector Counsel
or his designee.

     It shall be the responsibility of the ISG Business Unit and
applicable ISG contracting unit to contact the ISG-Blue Sector Chief
Counsel's office in order to ensure early involvement of the lawyers
in this process.

     It will be the responsibility of the ISG-Blue Sector Chief
Counsel's office to provide expeditious attention to these contracts
so that the contracting cycle is not unnecessarily extended by this
process.

     The legal input into this process need not be a separate review
or activity but should be accomplished as a working part of the 
natural sales and negotiation process.

     In almost all cases, a way to overcome legal concerns and do
business with customers in terms satisfactory to them will be found.

It is absolutely essential you follow this process so we will know
the risks we are assuming in achieveing our business objectives.

I know of program that pass stuff to other programs in registers over
a RUN UUO, or in a child, followed by a start FRMOP.  But, I can't think
of anyone caring what is in it after a command has been issued.  Might
as well give it a whirl.  

While you're in RPG...
   1. at the en of processing the MAIL command, attempt to run (SYS)RDMAIL
	at start +1
   2. if MAIL command given when no mail exists, print NO MAIL only if
	(SYS)RDMAIL can't be executed.
This ought to be pretty easy and safe.
-Bill

PS - you could also add SETPROC MAIL=(SYS)SENDMAIL to allow a user to
use another mail program, but I see little value in this, in fact its
almost undesirable.  It really should be a different command.  -Bill

SUBJECT>   REORGANIZATION OF CORPORATE MARKETING


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I am pleased to announce organization changes, effective immediately,
within McAuto's Corporate Marketing.  The purpose of the reorganization
is to consolidate and realign functions to be more responsive to the
needs of our users.

The following is a list of the individuals who report directly to me
and a brief description of their responsibilities:

     Technology Directions, headed by Barry Flachsbart, was recently
     restructured in the following manner:

     -  Technology Exploration:  Dave Carmichael

     -  Technology for Application Development:  Jerry Swanson

     -  Technology Assessment and Standards:  Bob Scheller

     -  Technology Exchange:  Les Schneider (acting)

     -  Special Projects:  Jim Blouin, Roy Engel, Dave Smith

     Sales Promotion and Administration, the responsibility of
     Lowell Grissom, is reorganized as follows:
                                                                Page  2


     -  The Sales Promotion Department is formed under the leadership
        of George Oelze to enhance our direct contact with prospective
        customers.  Reporting to George are:

        (1)  Trade Shows, Exhibits and Guest Services:  Al Schikore.

        (2)  Telemarketing:  Carol Hassinger.

        (3)  Brochure and Gift Distribution.

     -  Lowell Grissom continues to be responsible for Sales
        Administration, Recognition Events and Meetings (Pat Davis),
        and Corporate Marketing Administration (Gary Henderson).

     Marketing Communications, under the direction of Wells Huff, will
     consist of the following activities:

     -  Advertising Coordination:  Bob McEvoy.

     -  Public Relations and media relations:  Oscar Stepanek.

     -  Internal and External Communications, both print and video:
        Bob Moody.

     -  Special Assignments:  Roger Dahms.

     Planning and Acquisitions, the responsibility of Dick Schenk, is
     organized as follows:

     -  Strategic Planning:  Dick Schenk (acting).

     -  Business Planning:  John Malsberger.

     -  Acquisition:  Mike Czwornog.

     -  Marketing Policy:  Dick Schenk (acting).  This new department
        includes Les Krone and Tom Morrison.

     Marketing Services, headed by Bill Winter, will be composed of the
     following functions:

     -  Marketing Research:  Mario Sarabia.

     -  Library:  Jenny Preston.

     -  Marketing Publications, including brochures, presentations, and
        documentation:  Bill Praeger.

     -  Marketing Education:  Bill Winter (acting).

These changes will enable us to enhance Corporate Marketing's quality
of service to our McAuto users.  They are also intended to provide
emphasis and responsiveness for our coordination activities throughout
the Blue Sector.  Finally, they will enable us to improve our interface
and communications with other Marketing and Planning organizations
throughout the ISG.

                  TYMSHARE MANAGEMENT SEMINARS
                  ----------------------------
  
                (MANAGEMENT I AND MANAGEMENT II)
 
These workshops emphasize management philosophy and practice.  
The seminars are designed to produce an active exchange of infor-
mation among the participants while simultaneously providing 
proven techniques and approaches to handling management responsi-
bilities in a variety of organizations.
 
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:
-------------------
 
     -Provide an understanding of Tymshare's management philosophy 
      and a comparison of the corporate philosophy with 
      individual approaches/techniques.
 
     -Create an active exchange of information among managers and
      supervisors.
 
     -Develop/enhance basic individual knowledge and abilities in 
      management responsibilities from a corporate perspective.
 
     -Create a common understanding of the job of management.
 
     -Assist participants in identifying and planning personal 
      career development.
     
     -Define and further develop managerial needs and abilities 
      within the Information Systems Group.
 
NOTES:
------
 
These two seminars are very similar to the Tymshare Management 
Seminar offered in 1981-1983.  Several topics are covered in both 
seminars, although at different levels of detail and with 
different focuses.  Management I is a somewhat more elementary 
course than the original seminar, and provides more detailed 
information on the basics of being a manager or supervisor.  
Management II is somewhat more advanced than the original seminar 
and assumes that participants have mastered the basics of 
supervision.  Individuals who take Management I in 1984 should 
not plan on taking Management II until at least 1985.  (Course 
content detailed on the next two pages.)

                       PHASE I and  PHASE IV
                       ---------------------
                       (Two new ISG Programs)
 
These programs were developed by a task force of McAuto managers and 
trainers with assistance from Zenger-Miller, a Cupertino-based 
management development and consulting firm.  Phase I is the first of 
three 3-day courses designed for first level managers; managers who 
participate in phase I will be scheduled to attend phase II six 
months later, and phase III eight months after that.  Phase IV is the  
first of two 4-day courses designed for second level managers 
(managers who supervise other managers). Participants in Phase IV 
will be scheduled to attend phase V approximately six months later. 
 
Phases I, II, III, IV and V are part of the new ISG Management and 
Professional Development (M&PD) program which began on May 2, 1984.  
It is based on needs identified in the 1983 Yankelovich, Skelly and 
White attitude survey done within McAuto, and is modeled after 
similar programs at IBM, HP, 3M and GE. The M&PD program is designed 
to provide managers with the skills necessary to meet the 1990 ISG 
goals.  In time, these seminars will replace Tymshare's Management I 
and II seminars.
 
The workshop staffs for these programs are comprised of two ISG 
"Management Chair" trainers (experienced line managers), and a 
nutrition/exercise/stress/health consultant.  The course is 
"residential" -- accommodations (two to a room) are on the 
conference facility site.  This is an intensive course (7:30 am to 
7:00 pm), which does not allow time for participants to do work 
related to their regular job.  All workshops will be held near St. 
Louis. 
 
The only costs charges to a participants' cost center are for travel 
to St. Louis.  All costs for meals, lodging and trainer fees are 
charged to a central ISG budget. 
 
Descriptions of these courses are detailed on the following two 
pages.  To enroll in either of these seminars, type
":EXEC *** MTPD.ENROLL". Enrollment forms must be Ontymed to 
HRD.TRNG at least six weeks prior to the preferred course date.

                COUNSELOR SELLING SKILLS
              
                ------------------------    
 
 
This Wilson Learning Corporation seminar has been conducted in 
recent years for the Computer Management Services Group, and is 
now available to selected sales personnel in other Tymshare 
organizations.
 
Counselor Selling is divided into five sections including the 
ORIENTATION which introduces sales people to the practice of 
seeing things from the buyer's point of view.  Participants build 
skills in helping customers work through the four phases of the 
selling process:
 
     - In the RELATING Process course participants gain in-depth 
       skills for overcoming the most difficult obstacle to 
       selling - NO TRUST.
 
     - The DISCOVERY Process aids salespeople in developing 
       listening and questioning skills so they can conduct 
       accurate needs analyses and overcome the obstacle of NO HELP.
 
     - The ADVOCATING Process teaches salespeople how to develop    
       strategies for presenting to various kinds of buyers.  This 
       segment of the program helps salespeople overcome the 
       obstacle of NO NEED.
 
     - The SUPPORTING Process enables salespeople to ask for the   
       order - and to ask again, if necessary - to support a buying   
       decision and overcome the obstacle of NO HURRY.
 
Each participant receives pre- and post-course feedback.  Wilson 
Learning will provide each salesperson with an anonymous, non
judgmental statement on his or her performance compiled from 
profiles filled out by five clients that the salesperson selects 
before attending course sessions.  Post-course feedback profiles 
are also provided for each participant in Counselor Selling.  
These forms can be given to clients to obtain feedback on how 
newly learned skills are being applied.
 
Counselor Selling gives salespeople the competencies they need 
to:
 
     - Increase volume per sales call by better identifying   
       clients' and prospects' real needs.
 
     - Increase penetration of existing accounts by overcoming   
       the obstacles to a purchasing decision.
 
     - Avoid slumps and personal plateaus by analyzing and improving   
       their own performance.
 
     - Overcome call reluctance by exercising increased self-  
       confidence gained from understanding the buyer's point of   
       view.

     - Increase enjoyment of making calls by knowing how to be on   
       the side of customer - knowing what it takes to build a   
       "win/win" relationship.
 
     - Increase total sales volume by using the appropriate   
       skills required to support a buying decision.
 
     - Build a better and more long-term clientele by understanding 
       how to establish comfortable buying relationships, built 
       on trust.
 
     - Reduce the time spent building credibility in the mind of 
       the purchaser by knowing what steps to take to establish a 
       knowledgeable image.
 
     - Project the image of a dedicated, professional problem 
       solver - a counselor - whose first priority is to meet the  
       client's needs.

      THE PRODUCTION MACHINES HAVE NOW BEEN RUNNING, 
      WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS UNDER THE N-MONITOR.

      I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT COEES SOFTWARE, FROM NOW ON MUST 
      RUN UNDER THE N-MONITOR AND/OR ITS SUCCEEDING VERSIONS.

      CARL BALTRUNAS DEVELOPED A SOFTWARE FOR THE COEES APPLICATION
      WHICH DEPENDS ON PARAMETERS GIVEN BY THE N-MONITOR.

      THEREFORE, OPERATIONS SHOULD BE TOTALLY AWARE OF THIS FACT. ALSO,
      IF THE PRODUCTION MACHINES COME DOWN FOR MAINTENANCE OR
      ANY OTHER REASON, NEVER BRING THE SYSTEM UP UNDER ANY  MONITOR
      PREVIOUS TO THE N-MONITOR.

      PLEASE, LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

      THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

I just received word from Lloyd Claytor that system 56 was down
a lot during the period 6aug -17aug.  Did you receive any calls
for assistance during that period?

Subject: System 56

Craig,
  For the time period that you mentioned (aug 6-17) we have not received
any calls from Dallas Ops about system 56.  OSMAN has been getting the
"crash mail" sent by OPER for each crash, and most of the crashes and
system hangs have been due to hardware, specifically memory problems.

  There were a couple of FREE CORE WAIT hangs, which we have known for
a long time as a problem on system 56.  It isn't clear to us whether the
new monitor is more susceptible than /L or /K.  We know that they cannot
run with 4-Meg under /K without a lot of effort on our part to determine
the value of FRECOR (trial and error, lots of crashes later... it may
stay up) for that much memory.   /L and /N dynamically allocate FRECOR
for the amount of memory on-line and for all our other systems has been
very reliable on 4-Meg of memory.

F.Y.I. - History...

  System 56 is the TYMNET order-entry system all running applications
written in MAGNUM.  MAGNUM is notorious for having many many open files.
Open files use up monitor free core, and when too many files are opened,
the next job needing free core goes into free core wait.  Since it is
not clear whether the system ever recovers from this condiion, we are
certain that this is the cause of these crashes.

  Operations prefers to run on the /K monitor although we have repeatedly
asked them to run /L or /L21.  Now that /N has been transmtted, we hope
to convince them to run /N since we cannot adequately support their /K
monitor, and cannot hope to solve their free core problem unless they
run /N.   The clear-cut solution is for them to not open so many files,
thus they won't run out of free core.  Unfortunately... that means less
jobs or something like that.

  They have run the newer monitors, but after some number (3?) of any
type of crash they resort back to the /K monitor, even if all the crashes
on the new monitor are due to hardware.  We don't have enough information
on /L or /N to diagnose anything.  Maybe you should talk with Tom Marconi
or Ed Barens...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the next 4 to 6 weeks there will be a major reorganization of OnTyme
IDs involving the INSD and McDonnell Douglas accounts.  New accounts
are being set up to reflect the new groupings within ISG.  Details of
this reorganization will be provided within the next 2 weeks.  However,
we are going to make one change immediately.

The first group to be changed will be what is now know as Applied
Comunication Services (ACS) (Director, Phil Marson).  This group is
probably more familiarly known today as INSG Marketing.

This change will be taking place over the Labor Day Weekend and so will
be in effect first thing Tuesday, September 4.

Later this week, a new directory (*** DIRECT.ACS) will be established
and sent to you all so you may see exactly which individuals are affected
by this change.  Likewise, those names will be removed from *** DIRECT.INSD.

Many of the files currently stored as shared (**) under INSD will be
converted to *** files so easy access to information will not be disrupted.
This too will take place over the coming weekend to be in place Tuesday
morning (9/4).

(NOTE:  Members of ACS:  You will be receiving a separate communication
with details pertinent to you on this change via inter-office mail.)

Subject: MAGTAB changes

Jon,
  I talked to Dennis Coffey and found that he has put the version of
MAGCON.DAT that he needs in each of the directories that requires the
changes.  I've put installing it on SYS temporarily on "hold" simply
because everyone else using MAGCON would be affected by the changes
and we haven't had any complaints from anyone else (at least none that
I know of, have to check the MAGCON files which are now in Fremont in
the BLACK FILE CABINET).

  Therefore, unless you feel that it should be installed immediately,
I think it can be deferred until we have the man-power to check out
the tables on each system and what use MAGCON gets, and by whom, before
we make any table changes on SYS.

  I'll mail the info that Craig mailed to me, back to you so you can
put it on file (BLACK FILE CABINET) until such time as it is ready to be
installed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


A new command is available which will shorten the display of your In and
Out Lists.   The command is     :SET LISTS SHORT/LONG

Issuing the command :SET LISTS SHORT will result in the following in 
response to message list commands:

 :IN

 A16498  23 AUG 84 23:08  24 AUG 84 09:10   OPERA.LOG


As you will note, aside from compressing the columns, it also places
the NAME/SENDER column last (where the default displays this as the
second column).

To reset to the default, issue the command :SET LISTS LONG.

Those of you with long In/Out Lists, this will speed up the display for
you.  You might wish to build this into your profile/init file.

NOTE:  THIS COMMAND IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE 2 INTERNAL ONTYME HOSTS -
       832 AND 2261

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Video conferencing has been available for MDC use for a 30-day test
period--30 July through 24 August.  During this period over 150 hours
of meetings have been video conferenced.  It has been determined that
this service is suitable to MDC needs, and scheduling of the video
conference rooms is continuing, pending installation of permanent
equipment.

Video conference rooms are located in:

     St. Louis, MO -- HQ Building, West Conference Room, Level 2

     Cypress, CA -- Building K34, East Wing Conference Room, Level 2

     Vitalink facility -- 1350 Charleston Road, Mountain View, CA

The transmission cost -- which turned out to be about $60/hour during
the first 30 days -- will continue to be charged to Corporate.  The
continued use of this video conference system is encouraged for meetings
that would normally require travel.

Arrangements can be made to video conference between any two locations --
St. Louis, Cypress, or Mountain View -- by contacting central scheduling:

incorrect number, we'd like to know if 415-829-4632 is correct.

  It's been sooooo loooong since I've been near PCOM... I suspect that
39 is running the same version as 930.  If not, maybe it has been fixed.
Version 1.63 is the latest version, I think...

  That's what's running on both 930 and 39.  I'll have to investigate
that problem along with others... send me a list of problems that you
know of for PCOM, and after I get the monitor fiche done I'll get to
work on it.  (PS. That means I think we have a fiche program, but it
requires one final test-run.)

Ok, that's the only bug I'm certain of.  There is a problem I experience
from time to time where it doesn't clean up right.  It has something to
do with killing the parent frame (PCOM) I think, but I'm not sure.  I'll
try to be more aware and let you know if I can reproduce it.

On the fiche, Omar want to make SUP fiche so I told him to call you to
find out the procedure.  If you need a guinea pig, he can be one.  Thats
Omar Serang <OSerang@897>.

Of course, I'd like a couple sets of monitor fiche when you make them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


THE FOLLOWING WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS TODAY.  PLEASE POST AND DISTRIBUTE.

TYMSHARE ANNOUNCES FIRST NETWORK SERVICE DESIGNED 
EXCLUSIVELY FOR FINANCIAL PLANNERS


     ATLANTA, GA., Sept. 10, 1984 -- A network service, designed
specifically for financial planners, has been made available
exclusively to members of the International Association for
Financial Planning.  The developer, Tymshare, Inc., of
Cupertino, Calif., is demonstrating the system at the IAFP
Convention and Exposition today.

     The service, which will be carried over the Tymnet, Inc.,
public data network, will include Finsystem(tm), a comprehensive
financial planning tool, and Client Tracking, a management
service, along with a number of previously announced planning
aids.

     Using the network, financial planners can link into
Tymnet to access these services, to review business and
financial data bases, and communicate electronically among
themselves and with IAFP headquarters in Atlanta.

                                                                Page  2

     The newly announced Finsystem is Tymshare's fully
integrated financial planning system designed for professional
financial planners.  A flexible planning tool, it can be
applied to all major areas of financial planning--the normal,
healthy asset-accumulating years, estate and retirement
planning, and the consideration of disability.  Finsystem
provides tools to gather data, prepare financial reports,
perform calculating, analysis and modeling to support
investment recommendations and other planning services.

     Client Tracking, a Tymshare product, is a data base
management system.  It enables planners to review and quickly
revise a client's personal financial profile in response to
changes in such things as economic conditions, family
circumstances and tax laws.

     The package also includes OnTyme(R), Tymshare's easy-to-use
electronic messaging system, and Tymquote, Tymshare's
securities data base, which provides portfolio management
plus stock quotations on a 24-hour delay basis.

     NewsNet, an independently owned comprehensive data base,
also is integrated into the system.  NewsNet contains 112
financial bulletins that are easily accessed.  They include
The Stanger Report, Tax Shelter Insider, Ford Investment Review
and The Wall Street Monitor.

     The Tymshare service is available to IAFP members for
an initial subscription fee, with additional maintenance and
"as use" charges monthly.  A single monthly bill will be sent
by Tymshare with a comprehensive invoice detailing every
charge for services used.  Each customer's invoice will be
sent by electronic mail.

     "It is a highly useful service to our members," said
Roy Autry, IAFP's director of professional development.
"Together with Tymshare, we developed the components of a
system designed to meet the most important, most immediate
needs of planners."

     Tymshare offers a broad range of computer services,
and is part of the newly formed Information Systems Group
of the McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.  Tymnet, Also a
McDonnell Douglas company, operates TYMNET(R), one of the world's
largest public packet data communications networks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As you know, Paul W. Wiedenmann of Microdata has been functioning as
the Gold Sector Coordinator for Finance and Administration.  With his
appointment to Executive Vice President of Microdata, it is no longer
appropriate for him to fill the sector role.

I am pleased to announce the appointment of Charles H. Ridings as the
Gold Sector Coordinator, Finance and Administration, effective immediately.
This assignment is in addition to Charlie's responsibilities as Group
Vice President, Finance and Administration of Tymshare.  He will
maintain two roles, reporting to Bob Fischer and to me for the respective
responsibilities.

In the new position, Charlie will coordinate with Microdata and
Tymshare personnel in the sector on a dotted-line basis with regard to:

     A.  Sector-level budgeting, forecasting, financial planning, and
         reporting.

     B.  Coordination of internal automated systems and internal systems
         standards.

     C.  Gold Sector policy formation and coordination, and communication
         with the sector and the ISG management, accordingly.

     D.  Sector-wide activities in the areas of facilities and other
                                                                Page  2

         common activities where joint or shared action is beneficial
         to the sector or to all of ISG.

     E.  Acquisitions and mergers.  Charlie will work with me and the
         line executives regarding any such activities, and he will be
         available to the Blue Sector in this regard as well.

Charlie's new role and responsibility should assist all of us in better
coordinating with regard to ISG considerations.  If you have any
questions regarding his role or your interaction with him, please feel
free to contact me directly.

Please join me in welcoming Charlie and in offering him your full support
in his new role.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


An ongoing need exists to protect all government classified information
and unclassified technical information from unauthorized access by
foreign sources.  The definition of "foreign", as used in this context,
refers to all countries other than the U.S.A.

To fulfill this requirement for security, the following conditions are
in effect immediately:

     a.  All employees must receive a Security Briefing from the MDC
         Security Dept. prior to:

         (1) Any foreign travel/assignment on company business or on
             personal time, including vacations; or
  
         (2) Attending a symposium, colloquium, conference, etc., where
             foreign nationals are likely to attend.

     b.  For those employees who meet the conditions as described
         above, a Security Briefing is required once every twelve
         months.

To obtain the briefing, contact the MDC Security Department in St. Louis
at least ten (10) working days in advance at (314) 232-4730.  In the
                                                                Page  2

majority of cases, the Security Dept. will mail the briefing
material and certificate to the individual needing to be briefed.  The
individual returns the signed certificate and, upon return from travel,
phones Security.

Your cooperation is requested.

    Ray..

	I noticed the same thing about the 2 crashes on D37 and the 
    one on D25, picking address bit 14. Possible that this could
    be a software problem, since everything on earth is possible.

	You might have already noticed that other then the two systems
    in Dallas D25 and D37 running the P034N monitor, there are 3 systems
    in Cupertino "BLDG C" running the P034/N04 monitor. These 3 systems
    are all KL-10's and run with 2Meg of memory. They have been running
    the new monitor for over a month now without any problem similar to
    the one experienced on D25 and D37.

	Just to cover all of the variables, in the next few days we will
    bring up N monitor on a 4Meg KL-10 and monitor its performance.
    Hopefully this will give us more information as to where the problem lies.

	I am not pointing finger at anyone or anything and I don't have
    any fence to separate the hardware problem from the software one.
    If there is a problem, hardware or software, it needs to be solved,
    all of our efforts (Operations, Maintenance, Software) should be
    put together to resolve the problem. So far I have a mixed feeling,
    hopefully time and experience will change that. I appreciate all
    the support and help you have given me.

When I broadcasted the message announcing the deletion of
the generic logins, (EMSAA, EMSBB, etc.), UNFORTUNATELY this
did not reach all concerned.  As a reminder, please take note of the  
following:

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 10, 1984, THE GENERIC LOGINS, EMSAA, EMSBB, EMSCC,
EMSDD, EMSEE, EMSFF, EMSGG, EMSHH, EMSII, AND 0001 WILL NO LONGER
BE VALID.

EACH ACCOUNT HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE NETWORK LOGIN, WHICH DUPLICATES
THE ACCOUNT CODE.  FOR EXAMPLES,

        EMSINSD      for     INSD.userid
        EMSTYM       for     TYM.userid
        EMSACS       for     ACS.userid
        EMSSTD       for     STD.userid

This afternoon, the validations program took effect, disallowing
any user to log into a system with a generic network login.  With
this, please try to get the word out to your account users should
they phone asking for help.

Many thanks for your continued support.  Should you have 
questions, feel free to OnTyme me.

Subject: FRECOR numbers

Craig,

  The results of our investigation so far is that we have some
conflicting yet interesting values for FRECOR for various memory sizes
for the /K monitor, and we show the reduction in actual available free
core for additional memory with the /L & /N monitors.

  The following table shows our sample of various CPU types with various
monitors.  FRECOR is the hard-coded value, BLKS is <FRECOR div ^D145>,
*145 is the number of blocks in FREPTR times ^D145, FREPTR is an AOBJN
word showing -<#blocks>,,<start addr> for monitor free core and MEMSIZ

  We have not yet found the amount of FRECOR needed per file or
per frame (for MAGNUM), and thus do not yet have a suggested value
for LOGMAX for system 56.  I will let you know as soon as that
information is available.

/Carl

PS. Note that there is much more available FRECOR for /N than for
    any of the old /K monitors.  However, this is apparently NOT
    enough for so many MAGNUM jobs.

Very interesting tables.  Nfrecor seems to peak out with 1.75meg
and go down from there.

However, according to tables N monitor for 4 meg system has moe
frecor than K monitor for 3meg system, yet DAllas seems to have
more frecor problem the N than K.  HMMMMM.

Dear Carl,
     For some reason, directory "sailib" on system 56 consists of only
two files: module.def and rndio.dcl. I need sail.def but I don't have
enough license to copy sail.def from another system to SAILIB on system
56.  I would appreciate it if you could do this.

Subject: PCOM's yellow balls

Diagnosis: acute jaundice
This is very interesting.  I knew from previous experiments that it had
something to do with the way the program exits, but I never knew all of
that.  I added type 3 to your program for "EXIT" as opposed to "EXIT 1,".
It does a RESET and, no surprise, works fine.  The part I find most
interesting is that not only do you not get the orange ball back, but you
don't get the prompt, either.  Even of further puzzlement is the fact that
the RESET UUO simply loops through all the open channels doing RELEAS!
What state is the job in while this happens? (I seem to remember TI)

Well, there are different flavours of RELEASE, I think.  RESET probably
does the one that aborts a supersede.  That might have something to do
with the different effects.  Does the RELEASE have to be followed by an
EXIT 1, or does EXIT or OUTSTR have the same effect?  I guess you want to
use EDDT to find out what it's waiting for while this is going on.  Or
maybe DDT actually - you'll want to look at the stuck job's UPT but since
it won't be running at the time, you won't be able to easily see it with
EDDT.  The prefered procedure for looking at other job's UPT's in a
running monitor is to get their disk address from JBTCTX and super map
them.  There is a nice routine to do this in the DEBUG module due to Art.
It works something like this, but you'll have to look at the comments in
DEBUG to be sure...
    !GET (SYS)SYSTEM
    !DDT
    JOB! <target job number>
    J! <target job number>	; probably only one of these is necessary
    DEBUG$:    MAPUPT$G		; maybe it wants MAPUPT$X or PUSHJ MAPUPT$X
Now you can look at the job's UPT as you would in a crash...
    %UPT+UPTJOB[ <target job number>	; to verify it worked
Since UPTs are mapped by the monitor by the real paging system and not the
PCB system, this ends up actually sharing memory with the monitor's copy.
The problem with RIBs and UFDs does not exist.  Note - you can even write, so
be careful!

First thing is to find out where it was when it put the job to sleep.
Hopefully by looking at that code and its comments, some massive enlightenment
will transpire and the solution will suddenly be obvious.  (I've always
been an optomist)  

Don't forget that when you're using DDT to look at the UPT, you'll have to
use FILDDT to look at the job tables - you'll need 3 terminals or a MUX.
Let me know how it goes - a very curious problem.  -Bill

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


All requests for public file updates should now be initiated
by the new prompted routine, *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE.
This routine will prompt you for the necessary information
to update your public file, for instance *** DIRECT.XXX.

The 'form' will automatically send to both Catherine Derby,
Secretary - Electronic Messaging Marketing (and also ACS.SUP),
and me.  Catherine will assist me in updating your directories
and other requests for public files.

To initiate the exec, type :EXEC *** FORMS.OT/PUBLIC/UPDATE,
and answer each prompt.  A confirmation will be sent, as usual,
to inform you the update has been completed.

Most of you are aware of your host number, but for the new
Account Supervisors...

    Host 2261 = TYM.SUP and NTD.SUP
    Host 832  = All remaining Account Supervisors

Should anyone have questions, feel free to OnTyme me.

     Bob, I am still awaiting response from you on the initial 2 items:
 
      1.  If we can set up Tymnet branch 228 with default price codes for
          TNSC; specifically if the PDP10 service can be set up with price
          code 37 as default for branch 228.
 
          I'll likely change the existing branch 37 price code back to
          standard TUS rates later this week.
 
          A problem will not present itself unless TNSC assigns a new
          billable CID, in which case the price code assigned will be
          standard TUS PDP10 rates, rather than the 'special' TNSC rates
          set up under price code 37.
 
      2.  Transfer of PDP10 Oper names from my manager name to someone in
          the Tymnet operation.  I'll do the following this week:
 
          Set up Oper name Barbour with Manager license, reporting to me.
          Re-assign all TNSC names to report to Barbour (you presently
          have license assignments which are equal to or greater than any-
          one at TNSC).
 
          You must supply me with a Manager at Tymnet to whom we can
          re-assign your name.  Carl Baltrunas can handle this easily once
          we know the proper Manager name to whom you will report.
 
 

 
General items regarding transfer from IOD to Tymnet                 Page 2
 
 
     Obviously, I look forward to your reponse upon your return from Asia.
 
     A couple other items have come to my attention:
 
      3.  I have received the July Computer Resource usage report for
          International Division.  Both TNSC Cost Codes (5013 and 5113)
          are included on this report although they were to have shown up
          in Tymnet's report for July.  I have notified Teri Leeth to make
          the proper adjustments for the August cycle.
 
      4.  Leslie Bush of Accounting Control has contacted me regarding the
          "TNSC Private Network Clients" which are assigned billable
          CID's.   It seems these clients did not go through the "change
          district" mechanism in August because they were questionable to
          A.C. and Tymnet Accounting (Jinny Leland).  Leslie informed
          me the change will take place this month, therefore effective
          October 1st.  I have informed Leslie that they should contact
          you if questions arise regarding thse clients or the invoices
          from the PDP10 system.  You'll likely receive call from them.
 
     All for now, Regards. Ken

33, or 930.  I've looked--in fact, I've looked at all his directories--
and found very little beyond a set of INIT-type files in any of Tim's 
directories on any of the systems.

Tim told me you would be the one who knew where the file '##1022.HOW'
might be found.  Can you direct me where to look?

Thanks!!  . . .Dennis

Suppress access date update won't work as its currently coded.
CLRALC is a kludge and should be replaced, not made to work.
Put it in DSKCLN...its easy - all the code is there, just call
it at the right times.  I'll explain sometime.  I'll try to give
you a call tomorrow, things are real hectic.  -Bill

  Reference: Ontyme A39696 from IOD.HQ on 09-25-84.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  Peter,
 
  In reply  to your memo  concerning installation procedures  for TYMCOM-X
  monitor releases,  let me point out  that P90 is, until  further notice,
  entirely managed by SLIGOS.  Consequently, I am unaware of the installa-
  tion procedures that have applied for this machine in the past.
 
  For Cegi's XX's, the procedure that has been used in the past for system
  software and which I would like to  continue using in the future, is the
  following :
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                    -1-
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        Cegi-Tymshare software installation procedure.
        ==============================================
     1. Telecopy by TCMS of the necessary files,
        to directory SYSINST on each of our hosts,
        (59, 83, 92, 170, 184, 264, 301, 443).
 
     2. Ontyme to CT.TECHSERV,
 
          TO: P. STRATMAN
          CC: E. JAY
 
        This message should contain the following information:
 
          . Version of the software concerned, and
          . filenames used.
 
     3. CT personnel will then, as appropriate, install
        the software, or recycle the system for a new monitor.
 
 
  Please note that this procedure is valid for Monitor and Monitor-related
  software, as well as for other  system software. The exception is MAGNUM
  which, due to  the size of the  files concerned, is copied  from P90 and
  installed by CEGI.
 
  Best regards, Peter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It has abruptly brought to my attention, the following problems with
Mc Whorter Accounts we handle.

     1.  The Yellow and blue slips you have been receiving are Invoices
          and Credit Refunds.  PLEASE process all these to me for immediate
        payment.  I know some of you do not realize this and have been
      tossing them in the garbage/trash can.

     2.  All McWhorters Invoices and Credit Refunds need PURCHASE ORDER
        NUMBERS.  If you are picking up the merchandise or trying to
          return it yourselves, please either have the Requisition number
        or Purchase Order number Referenced.  MC WHORTERS SHOULD NOT 
        BE DOING ANY TRANSACTION WITH OUT THESE.  Without this we are
        unable to get cost center coding and approvals to pay the
        Invoices and refund the Credits given.

     3.  We have the following THREE McWhorter Accounts PLEASE USE
        ACCORDING TO YOUR NEED/DEPARTMENT.

            DSD/EPM USE ONLY        ACCT #012667

            TYMNET USE ONLY         ACCT #009624

            ALL OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING TYMSHARE   ACCT #008138

     4.  Please forward all Invoices Credit Refunds and Purchase Orders
        to me, DEBBIE BOITANO,  Mail Stop VG1-B16, Phone x7953.  I am
        Located in Corporate Accounts Payable.

Mc Whorters accounts are allowing a discount if paid Promptly.  We are
losing this discount since all acounts are 45 days or worse in
Delinquencies.

I dunno, it works, its an ancient patch, actually.  I suppose you should
give me a call before you do or say anything.  I think you really should
know about this before something unpleasent happens.  I'll be in the
office this afternoon, page me if necessary.  -Bill

Sue Bachmann called for some assistance today.
Mallinckrodt decided to increase the number of dial up lines on their
microde by 4 recently and the micronode started failing.  She has
contacted Dennis Ernst and he suggested adding another micronode to the 2020.

She and her manager are very interested in keeping Mallinckrodt happy
until they buy a VAX next year, so concerned in fact, that they are willing
to send ( and pay for) a TYMCOM-X person, a MAGNUM person, and a TYMNET
person to ST. LOUIS to meet with the customer, present the solution to their
near term communication problems, and make sure they will be well cared for
until the VAX solves all their problems.

I suggested that these three people should get together in ht
the bay area first to propose a solution and look at it from all three
angles.  It is also possible to video conference between MCauto ST. Louis
and Mountain View.

Are you willing to travel to St. Louis for possibly the 8-9 October to
meet with Mallinckrodt and visit McAuto on the side?

I don't think a meeting in ST. Louis is really necessary either
but it might be a useful boondoggle.  You are right we have to find out
how many MAGNUM jobs they want to run.

Will two micronodes be a first? or any problem at all..
