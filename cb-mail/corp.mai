is rerouted to the proper location.  Often, however, this mail 
is returned to the sender.  Incorrectly addressed mail usually 
results in delayed communications and unnecessary costs 
including additional mail handling plus, in some cases, 
duplicate postage expense.

To facilitate the delivery of mail for ISG employees in the 
IRVINE/NEWPORT BEACH area, it is requested that all such mail be 
addressed as follows, regardless of organization:

Subject:  RESIGNATION OF GARY E. LIEBL



I sincerely regret to announce the resignation of Gary E. Liebl, 
currently the Group Operating Officer of the Information Systems 
Group, effective Thursday, October 17, 1985.

Gary has accepted an appointment as President, Chief Operating 
Officer and member of the Board of Cipher Data Products, Inc., 
of San Diego, California, a leading supplier of magnetic tape 
peripherals and controllers.

During the time we worked together as ISG executive board 
members and, since June, as the team leading the ISG, I have 
developed great respect for his capabilities and for him as a 
person.  He will be greatly missed, and I am sure we all wish 
him much success in the future.

Prior to his present ISG position, Gary was President of 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company and President of 
Microdata Corporation.  Gary was also appointed a Corporate Vice 
President of MDC in July 1983.

Gary's departure makes necessary some alterations in the senior 
management structure of ISG; those changes will be announced in 
a few days.

SUBJECT>   HEALTH PLAN INFORMATION


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the past few weeks, many of you have had questions about 
your new health benefits.  The most frequently asked questions 
are answered here to help everyone understand these new plans.  
Other questions may be referred to your Human Resources 
Department:
 
     Southern California             (714) 250-1000
                                      Ext. 2184 or 2239

GENERAL AMERICAN PLAN
 
 
WHEN ARE MY ISG BENEFITS EFFECTIVE?
 
If you were an ISG employee prior to 9/30/85, your benefits 
become effective 9/30/85.  If you were disabled or on a leave of 
absence on that date, your coverage will be delayed until you 
return to work.
 
 
I HAVE A DEPENDENT WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED ON 9/30/85.  IS MY 
DEPENDENT COVERED UNDER THE OLD PLAN OR THE NEW PLAN?
 
                                                                Page  2

If a dependent was confined in a hospital or convalescent nursing 
home prior to 9/30/85, he/she will be covered under the old plan 
until discharged.  The day after discharge, the dependent will be 
covered under the new plan.
 
 
DO I HAVE TO SATISFY AN ADDITIONAL 1985 ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE WITH 
GENERAL AMERICAN BEFORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE?
 
Deductible expenses incurred between 1/1/85 and 9/29/85 under 
your previous health plan apply toward General American's 1985 
deductible.  If the deductible on your previous plan was less 
than General American's, you will need to satisfy the difference.  
This information was sent by the previous carrier to General 
American on 9/30/85.
 
NOTE:  Under the General American Plan, deductible expenses 
incurred during October, November or December apply toward the 
following year's deductible.
 
 
WHAT DO I DO WITH BILLS INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85 THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN SUBMITTED?
 
All claims must be submitted to your previous carrier as soon as 
possible.  Send claims to:
 
     Former Tymshare/Tymnet employees:
 
          New Systems Inc.
          P.O. Box 11290
          San Francisco, CA.  94101
 
     Former Microdata employees:
 
          Northwestern National Life Insurance Company
          Regional Claims Center
          730 Fairmont Avenue - Suite 202
          Glendale, CA  91203
 
 
HOW WILL GENERAL AMERICAN KNOW ABOUT DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES I 
SUBMITTED AFTER 9/30/85 FOR EXPENSES INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85?
 
Keep your copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form which 
accompanies all claim payments.  Attach this form to claims you 
submit to General American so that you are credited with the 
proper deductible amount.
 
 
WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PCS CARD?
 
Your PCS card(s) will be mailed by the end of October.  Until you 
receive your card, you must pay for the drug.  Keep the receipt 
which itemizes patient's name, doctor's name, prescription 
number, date, quantity dispensed and amount charged.  You will be 
reimbursed the charge for the drug, less the appropriate 
deductible ($1.50 or $3.00) by attaching the receipt to the PCS 
                                                                Page  3

claim form.  Claim forms are available from the Human Resources 
office.  This form requires information found only on your PCS 
card, so wait until you receive your card before submitting the 
form for reimbursement.  This procedure applies for drugs 
purchased for dependent children over age 19 or from non-
participating pharmacies.
 
 
HOW DO I FILL A PRESCRIPTION THROUGH THE MAIL ORDER OPTION?
 
You will receive a mail order form for the America's Pharmacy 
with your PCS card.  You may order by mail the amount prescribed 
by your doctor, up to a 6 month supply, by paying only one 
deductible.

INSURANCE?

description.
 
 
WHAT IF A NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY?
 
Second opinions are not required in emergency situations.
 
 
ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL CLAIM PROCEDURES?
 
Yes.  When you get a second opinion, get a special sticker for 
your claim form from the Group Insurance Office or your Human 
                                                                Page  4

Resources Office.  The doctor giving the second opinion must 
complete and sign the sticker for the second opinion to be paid 
at 100%.  Separate bills for tests related to the second opinion, 
require a similar sticker for reimbursement.

To:       ISG Lists A-E; MDC Plant Lists A-C

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.



*Chart not transmitted via OnTyme



ISG-85-162
Page 2


    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will contin take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162
Page 3


Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

If you elect family coverage, consult your Group Insurance 
Summary Plan Description for the definition of an eligible 
child.  The benefit payable depends on your family makeup:

     SPOUSE ONLY       SPOUSE & CHILDREN       CHILDREN ONLY

         60%             Spouse - 50%               20%
                          Child - 10%

Enrollment cards can be obtained from your local Human Resources 
Office serving your area.  Completed cards must be dated during 
the month of November 1985, and forwarded to your Human Resource 
Office no later than November 29, 1985.

APPARENTLY ALL THE MACHINES WERE NOT COUNTED DURING THE INVENTORY IN

A DATE SHIPPED COLUM, THIS SHOWS THE DATE THE EQUIPMENT WAS SHIPPED   
FROM MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE SOME REMARKABLE MACHINES LISTED THERE   
223 OF THEM WERE SHIPPED IN 1985 AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM, THEN THERE   
192 THAT WERE SHIPPED IN 1984 THAT WE CAN'T FIND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO  
BELIEVE THAT MACHINES THAT WERE SHIPPED FROM 1 TO 22 MONTHS CAN'T

     I am requesting your assistance in order to supply some answers to
     Cegi Tymshare (France) as it relates to an accounting project they
     have underway.
 
     CT plans to do their own accounting for hosts which belong to them
     and are located in St-Cloud, France [hosts S90 (KL10), S51 & S53 (IBM
     4341)].  This will allow our MIS Dept. to discontinue month-end
     accounting for these hosts.  The statements and questions below
     have been taken directly from a memo sent to me by Eric Jay, and
     related to Tymcom X, Validations and the Tape library.
 
     I have spoken with Jan about the validation issues; Jan, CTOPSMGR
     is already valid on host 74.
 
     Regarding item b. The 2 user names are valid on 930 and OPER names
     exist also.  I am interested in your comments about Perp, Telecopy
     and PCOM.
 
     Bob, I require your comments about item d.
 
     The actual message follows:
 
     b.  TYMCOM-X:
 
      o   Raw accounting files generation and  format as documented in
          the "Info"  database on system 930.  For this we  need user-
          names:  CTMKTG1  and CTMKTG7 to  remain validated  on system
          930 and oper names STRATMAN and  JAY valid with a READ-FILES
          license

 
Request for assistance                                              Page 2
 
 
 
      o   PERP, TELECOPY, PCOM
 
          Our new  accounting system needs  these utilities  to remain
          supported  (by  MDC)  or replacements  made  available  with
          advanced notice or early warning of their discontinuation
 
     c.  For general validation information we need
 
      o   Continued  access  to  X22 databases  on  system  74  called
          (CUD10)USERDB.DMS and (CUD10)ADDRDB.DMS
 
      o   Username CTOPSMGR validated on system 74
 
      o   Read-files license on system 74
 
      o   advanced notification  of any changes or  discontinuation of
          service that might happen on the above X22 databases
 
     d.  Tape library database
 
      To perform Tapes accounting, we need  access to the central Tape
      library on host 74 (username TAPELIBE, X22 files) and notification
      of changes or discontinuation of service.
 
     ** end of partial message from CT **
 
     I look forward to your comments on the above, either via Ontyme or a
     phone call.  Best regards. Ken

  SUBJECT:   PUBLIC NETWORK CODE SYSTEMS
 
  ===============================================================
 
  We  are  now  targeting implementation of the  four-host  public 
  network  code system for the weekend of  December  13-15.   This 
  would  mean that effective Monday,  December 16,  the  following 
  systems will be used as outlined:
 
             D25        TO BE USED BY HQ AND FIELD AS THE
                        PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR GENERATION OF
                        ALL CODE FOR NODES WITH NUMBERS
                        BELOW 4000.  ALSO TO BE USED BY
                        NETCON AND FIELD AS THE PRIMARY
                        SYSTEM FOR LOADING CODE FOR NODES
                        BELOW # 4000.
 
             C70        TO BE USED BY THE ABOVE FOR THE 
                        ABOVE REASONS WHEN D25 IS UNAVAILABLE.
 
                        TO BE USED BY TYMNET OPERATIONS
                        AS A BACKUP SYSTEM FOR NETSTATS.
 
             D54        TO BE USED BY HQ AND FIELD AS THE
                        PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR GENERATION OF
                        ALL CODE FOR NODES WITH NUMBERS 4000
                        AND ABOVE.  ALSO TO BE USED BY NETCON
                        AND FIELD AS THE PRIMARY SYSTEM FOR
                        LOADING CODE FOR NODES 4000 AND ABOVE.
 
             C33        TO BE USED BY THE ABOVE FOR THE
                        ABOVE REASONS WHEN D54 IS UNAVAILABLE.
 
                        TO BE USED BY PMTS AS THEIR PRIMARY
                        SYSTEM FOR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
                                                                Page  2

 
 
  Validations  has validated those usernames submitted to me  over 
  the  past  two months on D54 and other systems  as  appropriate.  
  Please verify that you are valid where you need to be.
 
 
  
  It will be your responsibility to transfer your own files to the 
  appropriate  system and delete files no longer necessary  (i.e., 
  no longer need to keep files relating to nodes below 4000 on C33 
  after December 15).
 
  We  will work with operations to copy the TYM4000 directory from 
  25 to 54 and 33 (then deleting it from 25 & 70); and copying the 
  TYMNET directory from 25 to 70.
 
  Beryl Agua will shortly publish the new backup procedures  which 
  reflect the above configuration.   These procedures require that 
  each  Region (or Area) have a central directory available on all 
  four  systems  which will be used to store  all  field-generated 
  code for backup purposes.   These directories will also serve to 
  eliminate  confusion  in  locating  code  for  'on-call'   field 
  personnel.    Please notify her by Friday, December 6 as to what 
  those central directories are.
 
  We  will be closely monitoring the use of these four systems and 
  request your cooperation in minimizing the use of aux ciruits to 
  go from system to system.  This, while convenient, unnecessarily 
  ties up job slots/ports on multiple machines, blocking access to 
  others who may need it, and slowing down responsiveness.
 
  We  sincerely  hope  this new arrangement  will  improve  system 
  availability and response time.

Subject: Change to the Node Naming Convention

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Node naming convention is being changed to include a number for the ap-
propriate region. The break down is as follows:

                WNFE = 1
                CNFE = 2
                ENFE = 3

The district is also being changed in some cases to fit more closely with the 
city. The breakdown is as follows:

** WNFE **

Old District       New District          
   Letter             Letter             District (City)

     A                  C                China Basin
     S                  S                Santa Clara - South Bay
     S                  E                Santa Clara - East Bay
     L                  L                Los Angeles
     T                  T                Seattle
     V                  D                Denver
     X                  P                Phoenix


** CNFE **

     C                  C                Chicago
     M                  S                St. Louis
     D                  D                Dallas
     H                  H                Houston
                        U                Austin
     H                  A                Atlantic





Old District       New District
   Letter             Letter             District (City)


** ENFE **

     B                  B                Boston
     N                  N                New York
     P                  P                Philidelphia
     W                  W                Washington










The break down will be as follows, the first six (6) characters will still be 
for the Company name or city if Tymnet, the underscore will change to the number 
that corresponds with the appropriate region, the second to the last character 
will be the district letter from above, and the last letter will correspond with 
the software type of the engine. The breakdown of software type is as follows:

          A = Async Tymsat or Consat
          B = Base
          I = Isis (regardless of engine i.e mini-engine, micro-                 
              engine, etc.)
          S = Switcher
          U = ATC


The node name should look like the following:

         DALLAS2DI   this would be a Tymnet node in Dallas (DALLAS),
                     which is CNFE (2), the district is Dallas (D),                                            
                     and the engine is running ISIS software (I).

---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
The Wilson Learning "Counselor Selling Skills" program, used 
extensively by the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, is now 
available to all ISG employees. 
                                                                         
Counselor Selling is a CUSTOMER focused program, rather than being 
product-focused like the Xerox-based programs.  It teaches how to 
build relationships with potential customers and how to achieve a 
MUTUALLY AGREED UPON UNDERSTANDING of their situation PRIOR to 
discussing the features and benefits of one's product(s).  It focuses 
on creating a "win-win" environment where the prospect WANTS TO BUY, 
rather than trying to "sell" the prospect.  Participants receive pre- 
and post-course feedback from potential and actual customers of their 
choice.
 
The seminar will be conducted by Randy Lipson, trainer for Bob 
Donoghue, Inc.  Randy has 23 years of sales experience and is former 
PSS-II & III trainer.  Employees' cost centers will be charged $710 
for their participation in this four day seminar.  This seminar is 
scheduled for the following dates: 
 
                 Oct. 21-24                  San Jose

***************************** MEMORANDUM *****************************
 
     
   DATE:  AUGUST 19, 1985                                                  
                                                
     TO:  ALL EMPLOYEES (PLEASE POST)                       
 
   FROM:  STEPHEN REYNOLDS, MANAGEMENT TRAINING
          AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (MT&PD)
 
SUBJECT:  MT&PD MANAGEMENT TRAINING SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINDER 
          OF 1985.                                                     
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
Given current initiatives to reduce costs within the ISG, a number of 
questions have been raised about programs conducted by MT&PD.  The 
following summarizes the status of these programs.
 
     1. All "Phase" programs in St. Louis scheduled between August 19 
        and December 31, 1985 have been cancelled.  A full schedule
        of Phase seminars is planned for 1986;  allocations for 1986 
        Phase slots will be made early in 4Q85.
 
     2. All San Jose MHP seminars will be held as scheduled, allowing 
        all Bay Area managers and supervisors to be trained by
        December, 1985.  The September MHP for New York has been 
        postponed until 1Q86.
 
     3. All other MT&PD programs will be held as scheduled, so long as 
        minimum enrollment requirements are met.  (A complete
        schedule is available on ONTYME; type :READ *** MTPD.SCHED)
        Enrollment in any MT&PD seminar (which includes a cost 
        recovery charge-back) requires written approval of your
        manager.  In some divisions additional levels of approval may 
        be required prior to confirmation of enrollment.
                                          
If you have any questions about MT&PD programs, please contact us at
408/446-7813, HRD.TRNG (ONTYME), or VG2-A04 (inter-office mail).

Subject: REDUCTION IN FORCE 

SEPTEMBER 20, 1985  
     
     
TO:      ALL FIELD OPERATIONS LOCATIONS 
     
FROM:    CURT MILLER, VP-FIELD OPERATIONS    
     
SUBJECT: REDUCTION IN FORCE   
     
PLEASE SEE THAT THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM VERN HART, PRES-FIELD  
OPERATIONS, IS POSTED AND/OR DISTRIBUTED:    
     
     
DEAR FIELD SERVICE COMPANY EMPLOYEE:    
     
WHEN YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING 
THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS A REDUCTION IN FORCE.  THE LOSS OF A JOB, OR
THE THREAT OF IT, IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER TO EVERYONE.
     
MANY OF YOU HAVE MADE USE OF "OPEN LINE" TO EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND 
TO ASK QUESTIONS.  I WISH TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE DONE SO AND TO  
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR SHARING YOUR FEELINGS.  EACH QUESTION OR  
CONCERN WILL BE ANSWERED INDIVIDUALLY AND, IN ADDITION, THE RESPONSES 
WILL BE SUMMARIZED IN COMPANY PUBLICATIONS FOR THE INFORMATION OF ALL.
     
SINCE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, I WILL   
NOT, IN THIS LETTER, ADDRESS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE RECEIVED
EITHER THROUGH "OPEN LINE" OR IN PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS.  MY PURPOSE  
HERE IS TO SKETCH OUT FOR YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
NEED FOR A REDUCTION IN FORCE AND THEN TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON WHERE WE ARE    
GOING AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING TO GET THERE.
     
THE PRESENT BUSINESS SLUMP IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CERTAINLY NOT  
NEWS TO ANYONE.  IT BEGAN TO DEVLOP LATE LAST YEAR AND HAD GROWN TO   
SERIOUS PROPORTIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER.  ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS
HAVE EXPERIENCED ITS EFFECTS, INCLUDING IBM, DEC, ATT-IS, HEWLETT
PACKARD, DATA GENERAL, AND WANG.  ALL HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEIR 1985 PLANS  
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  MANY HAVE TAKEN COST REDUCTION ACTIONS RANGING
FROM REDUCED WORK WEEKS AND PERIODIC SHUT DOWNS TO REDUCED WAGES,
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE, AND PLANT CLOSINGS.
     
A KEY PART OF THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ISG STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DIVERSIFY
ITS OPERATIONS BY ESTABLISHING ELEVEN BUSINESS UNITS WHICH, BY WORKING
TOGETHER, WILL ADDESS A MULTIPLICITY OF MARKETS.  IN A NORMAL YEAR, THE    
EXPECTATION IS THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS MIGHT HAVE A RELATIVELY   
WEAK PERFORMANCE BUT THAT THIS WOULD BE OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCES OF   
THE OTHERS.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE OVERALL RESULTS FOR ISG IN THE SECOND  
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WERE EXAMINED IN JULY, THE REVERSE SITUATION WAS 
FOUND.  WHEREAS A FEW UNITS WERE DOING WELL, THE MAJORITY WERE FALLING
SHORT OF PLAN AND THE OUTLOOK WAS NOT GOOD.  
     
AS A RESULT, EACH BUSINESS UNIT, INCLUDING THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY, 
WAS GIVEN A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TARGET AND ASKED TO DEVELOP PLANS 
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  
     
EVEN THOUGH THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY WAS ON PLAN THROUGH THE END OF  
JUNE, IT WAS APPARENT THAT OUR PLANNED REVENUE GOALS FOR THE LAST HALF
OF THE YEAR, WOULD FALL WELL SHORT OF PLAN.  WE CLEARLY COULD NOT AFFORD   
TO SPEND ON THE CURRENT RATE, AND THEREFORE, THE ELIMINATION OR  
SIGNIFICANT CURTAILMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS WHICH WERE NOT    
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, BECOME NECESSARY.  WE ALSO FOUND
THAT NORMAL BELT TIGHTENING WOULD NOT PRODUCE THE REQUIRED RESULTS TO 
MEET OUR NEW GOALS AND THEREFORE, A REDUCTION IN FORCE BECAME NECESSARY.   
     
IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE ACTIONS TAKEN, THOUGH PAINFUL, WERE A NECESSARY
CORRECTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL KEEP US ON COURSE TOWARDS 
OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF BECOMING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO THE OTHER    
ISG BUSINESS UNITS. 
     
MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE REDUCTION IN FORCE, HAVE, QUITE   
NATURALLY, EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO WERE AND FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE   
WITH THE COMPANY.  LET ME SAY THAT I KNOW OF NO ONE IN MANAGEMENT WHO 
WILL CONTEMPLATE A REDUCTION IN FORCE WITH ANYTHING BUT THE GREATEST  
RELUCTANCE.  I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE SENIOR STAFF AS WELL AS MYSELF  
WHEN I SAY THAT.  AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL TODAY, THE FORCE REDUCTION WE 
HAVE JUST MADE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO THE PRESENT NEED.  THAT IS NOT TO
SAY THAT CONTINUED ACTIONS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE SALES AND 
CONTROL COSTS.  QUITE THE CONTRARY IS TRUE.  TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGETS, THE   
COMING MONTHS WILL REQUIRE EXTRA EFFORTS AND ELIMINATION OF ALL  
UNNECESSARY COSTS.  I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL MAKE THOSE EFFORTS AND
THAT OUR COST CONTROLS WILL BE EFFECTIVE.    
     
WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED AT THIS TIME IN DETAILED PLANNING FOR 1986.  MOST 
INDUSTRY OPINION SUPPORTS A VIEW OF A CONTINUATION OF SLOW COMPUTER   
SALES THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF 1986.   THEREFORE, WE ARE    
DEVELOPING PLANS WHICH TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND WILL CAREFULLY CONTROL   
OUR GROWTH TO MITIGATE AGAINST ANY FURTHER NEED FOR A FORCE REDUCTION.
     
FOR THE LONGER TERM, I BELIEVE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE    
OF THE UPTURN WHEN IT HAPPENS.  BY THE END OF THE DECADE, OUR TARGET IS    
TO AT LEAST DOUBLE OUR REVENUES THROUGH EXPANDED SALES TO OTHER ISG   
BUSINESS UNITS AND TO ADDITIONAL OEM CUSTOMERS.   
     
IN EARLY 1986, ALMOST ALL OF MANAGEMENT WILL BE ENGAGED-ONE WAY OR ANOTHER-
WITH HELPING TO DEVELOP A LONG-RANGE BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE OUR 
GOAL OF PROFITABLE GROWTH.  ESSENTIAL TO THAT STRATEGY IS THE INVOLVEMENT  
OF EVERYONE IN THE QUEST FOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS THROUGH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.    
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE ONLY COMPANIES WHO CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM   
EMPLOYMENT ARE THOSE WHO CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY PROFITABLE.  IN OUR HIGHLY    
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY, THE SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES WILL BE THOSE WHO FOCUS ON  
QUALITY, WHO DELIVER PRODUCTS WHICH CONFORM EXACTLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS,   
ARE COMPETITIVELY PRICED, ARE DELIVERED AS COMMITTED AND ARE PROFESSIONALLY
SERVICED. 
     
WITH YOUR HELP, I BELIEVE WE WILL MAKE OUR COMPANY A GREAT SUCCESS.   
     
     
     
VERN HART

RE:    MICOMS.85265


THE LATEST VERSION OF MICOMS, MICOMS.85265 WAS RELEASED SEPTEMBER 22, 1985.
I WAS SO INVOLVED IN PREPARATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY THAT DOCUMENTATION
ON THIS VERSION WAS NOT SENT TO THE FIELD.  I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS DELAY IN
SENDING OUT DOCUMENTATION.

THE MOST NOTICEABLE CHANGE IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT SCREEN AND THE FE
SCREEN WITH A SINGLE USER SCREEN.  THIS WILL BE MORE EASILY DOCUMENTED,
MAINTAINED AND TAUGHT.

THIS USER SCREEN HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

1.	THE DATA BASE MAINTENANCE SCREEN IS NOW ITEM 4 RATHER THAN ITEM 7.

2.	THE INQUIRIES WHICH WERE INCLUDED ON THE FE SCREEN ARE NOW A SEPARATE SCREEN-
   ITEM 6.

3.	THE PICKING, SHIPPING AND RECEIVING ARE NUMBERED IN CONSECUTIVE ORDER 11, 12 AND 
  13 RATHER THAN 13, 14, 12.

4.	THE ABILITY TO UPDATE CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, MODEL DATA AND MODEL PART DATA HAS BEEN
  REMOVED BUT INQUIRIES FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION IS CONTAINED ON INQUIRIES SCREENS.

5.	THE MASTER PART DETAIL SCREEN HAS BEEN GIVEN UPDATE ABILITIES FOR THE PHYSICAL
  INVENTORY.  THIS UPDATE ABILITY WILL BE REMOVED AFTER THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY
  IS DONE.


THE INPUTTING OF MODEL AND MODEL SERIAL NUMBERS IS NO LONGER REQUIRED 
INFORMATION FOR MARS.

IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME.

         ISG Lists A - H

         DEFERRAL OF ISG MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

CC:      Business Unit Coordinators



One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's
operating  results month by month.  In so doing, we have determined
a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the
full  line of Phases will be in production for the ISG beginning in
June.

The  revised  schedule  and allocations will be available from your
business  unit  coordinator  on  April 8.  It is important that you
continue   to   plan   for   your,   and/or   your   subordinates',
participation  in  the  proper  Phase.  Advance planning allows for
timely  notification  of  participants and for time to complete the
required prework for Phase attendance.
