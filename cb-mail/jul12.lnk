Hi.  I'm talking to the sherriff.

sec on phone

so what happened?

I was doing the short drive home.  Just at the crossing of Sunnyvale-Saratoga
I was stopped by a sherrififf who was at the Donut Wheel.  He noticed the
expired tags and nthe expired livcense, called in to discover that there was
a WARRANT out for my equipment violation.  He diecided to not take me to jail.  So now I need to fix things up (as if
I didn't before).

well, what do you need to do?

He said that all I needed to do was to go down to the San Jose Sherrif's
office and post the bail.  But the person that I just talked to at the Sherrif's
office told me that I need to contact the Gilroy court and find
out from them what I need to do to clear the violation itself first.
Then posting bail will clear the (sec)

Why don't yuo call me when you're ready?

Stan came in.  warrant and then the DMV cam take care of the
registaration and my license.

On tHop of tohwa tmuch is bail?

$50.54

oh.  I thought you were going to type $500.00!

Fortunately not.  On top of that I paniced this morning because I managed to
wash one of my contacts down the drain.  The reason that I was so late is
that I managed to fish it out and clean it up enough to wear.

You're gdoing real good, kid.

YIe onlpy. broke one ouf our bgood bowls last night when I got home.

Sounds like we are a heck of a pair...

Some good news, though.  Virgil has been working on getting Kermit up
on Mike Nason's rRainbow, so it is only a matter of a very short time
until Violet can communicate with the outside world!

You there?  I see.  Please beep me.[H[2J
Beep?Some good news, though.  Virgil has been working on getting Kermit up
Mike Nason's Rainbow, so it is only a matter of a very short time
until Violet can communicate with the outside world!

Just talked to the Gilroy court.  They need the case number and suggested
that I get the DMV to print out my driving record 'cause that will have
the numbers on it.  I feel like I am running around in circles!

You are!  Why donesn't the DMV, Gilroy and the Sherrif all get
together and talk to each other.  Doin't you feel like you're
trying to be an interpreter for all three?  How frustrating!

WEExactly!  Frunstrating is the correct word.  Actually, "Frustrating"
is, not frunstrating.  It seemd s like I am going to have to go to the DMV
and stand in line for a couple of hours in order to get the numbers
that the gilroy court needs, and then again when everything is cleared up
so that I can get the registration and license.  Oh, Bother!

So, what have you learned from this?

You must be a teacher!  I have lkearned to not let things like that
go for so long unattended.  Right, Ms. Dunham?

That's right, Johnny!  BGood Boy!

Thank you for not using Timmy.

You're welcome.  No comment on the ontyme, or did you read it yet?

I read it, just hadn't gotten that far in the converstaation yet.

oh.

The time andsuch for the appointemment with Jim seems fine.  And I will
pay $35, so as to let you pay $30 the time after.  Ok>?

If you want, and thank you.

I do want, and you are welcome.  The machine is going to go down for
a few minutes soon.  When it does, you can read the OnTyme that I have
already left, and I will come over there and talk to you.  Ok?

Ok.  I need your advice on organizing this *!$?*# picnic.  Stan and
I do not agree, it seems.


HHappy to help.  ILY

ILY2
Really?  That is neat.

Nah, I was jjuust joking...

><pout>

You <pout> very well!

Thanks.

you're welcome.

*sniff*

you *sniff* very well, also.

*SMACK*

MMMMmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!  I don't need to tell yu how weellll you do THAT one!

But I like to hear it!

You whine  very well, too.

hi.

Hi.

sHoewc .a re  yIo uh?a
ve a 
couple phone calls to make.Looks like I do too!

Calling Argonaut Deli...

any news yet.?  I'm trying to find a soports place in the yellow
pages that rents equipment.  Any other ideas of [pplaplaplaces I could check?

How about Abbey rents or something like that?

Is that the name?

ASbbey Rents.  I think so.

no luck so far...still checking...where are they at?

On Stevens Creek Between Lawerence and Saratoga

Abbey Medical?

Might be related.

I can rent one through the Parks and Rec,.  Talking to the lady now...

Yes?

Well, aren't you excitied that I found a place to rent from...and it's
through Parks and Rec, too!

Yes!  How much?  And will it be free-standing?

I'm hon hold waiting for the lady.

Any luck (sec)

Ok, ready for this?  The rental fee is $5 per net and $5 per gball (which 
we willnot need)  The desecurity deposit for just the net is $30 which is
refundable.  There are NO poles that come with it.  There should be 
bpoles there at the partk behind the big baseball diamond she said.  She
said we were ewelcome to find our own poles or use a 2 x 4 (?)(  to improvise
so we could have the net right there in the area with us.  Suggestions?

Hang a sec.  Need to thimk.

Be right back.  Going to personnel to get a list of the head count.

back.  Can you talk?

Noittt yet.

Thjere is no Abbey Rents, just Abbey Medical on Stevens Creek Blvd.

Must be that what I remember isd in San Diego.

i guess.  any luck on the argonaut deli?

Yep.  In a sec.

Should we shoot for the 29th of July thebn?

Firiday?

yes.  whadt do you think?

A good idea.

Shall I call back to reserve the big diamond?

You should.

what about the volleyball net?

Interested in the "official" headcount I got from Perosonnel?

Yes.  Yes.

I should reserve the net too?  What about the po.leles?

A good question.  Is it important to have them near us?

I fell that it is.  It'll keep peopl


I feel that it is.  It'll keep our group that much more together rather than having
100 people spread all over the park...

A good point.  But then it seemd that we have to craft them
ourselves...

yes...unless someone has a net we could borrow...

couldn't we buy a couple poles from a hardware store and usNe themo to string
up the net with??

The problem with that is stability.  How do ywe get them sunnffieciently
weighted to not fall over the first time the ball hits the net?

I dunno.  Maybe we cshould approach Stan with this problem.  He
volunteered to be on this committee too...

Sounds good..   Deligaste!

phone...

what time is it?

3:47

                          ** HEADCOUNT **


          Dick Ouellette's Group:  37
          Ken Jones' Group:        56
          Ken Holcomb's Group:     04
          Dave Morley's Group:     12
          Laz and Me:              02

          Ann Hardy's Group:      106 (!)
          Walt Eissmann's Group:   35



comments?

about 240?

i guess so, I didn't add it up.  but it'll probably be just the top 5
listed.  possibly Walt's group, too, but most likely not ann's


111?

hello?

Hi.

are you mad?  You sound like you just slammed your finger in your
drawer or something?  Did you sit on a tack perhaps??

No.  I have just been trying (somewhat unsuccessfully, obviously) to
maintain two converstaions taat once.

oh.  I didn't realize you were still on the phone.  Still Argonaut Deli?

Not on the phone.  John Crane is here.

oh. sorry.  I'll catch you later.

Wait.  About done.,

Call me please when you're done.

 I'm here.

He just left/

  "He took one swift soundless stiep towards her, and the next second
she was in his arms, held in a possessive, vice-like grip that threatened to
crucsh her ribs.  If she had wanted to struggle it would have been pointless,
but somehow the idea of resistance -- even a token resistance -- (sec.)
didn't enter into her head.  This was what she had been born for, this was
where she belonged -- in the strong and infinitely comforting circle of
Ramiro's arms.  And there was a kind of exquisite relief in feeling that she
had come home at last.)"   .....

In the cuircle of his arms?  Not his legs?

I didn't know that they put that kind of stuff in Harlequins!

they do!  it's not that bad, is it?

Not really, I guess.  Especially when cmompared to some of the things
that I used to read...

still on phone...Bill...

AAAARRRRRRGGGHHH!

yGeRRRRpRR!
GRRRR
R
RRRRRRR
calm down...good boy, good boy...

Tell him that your bodyguard takes a dim wview of his shabby treatment
of special women.

okay...

His response?

j./k.

K.KJ.K. about telling him?

yes..  He's gone now.  He asked when I'd be free( this eweek so I rattled
off my schedule to him:
   tonight - volleyball
    tuesday - dinner
   wednesday - ballet
   thursday - aprt t with Jim
   fri - spa

So, that deflated his bubble...


Who dinner Tuesday.?  I remember -- Dave.  GRRRRRRR

...duh...goood tim, you're quidkck.  Is there some reason why you
keep forgetting about Dave?

I think you already know the answer and the reason for it.

I think I do too.  By the way, you have a very sexy growl...


Thank you, I think.  If you agree to go out with Bill (what's-his-name)
very soon, I think you are making a mistake.

Better than rotting away in my apartment, though.

Are you sure?

thanks, pal.

Huh?  I was making a joke, and it seems that you didn't understand.

It didn't sound like a joke...I can still herrar the tone in your voice.

It was a joke!  Shall I call you and tell you ask you so that you can hear it?

no.  i belie ve you.

I am not sure that I believe that you beliveeve that ...  huh(?
(I think I got lost in there.  Lemme try again )please spare me!
How about a strike instaeasd?

very funny.  you have to give me another chance to beat yuou at bowling.

Fair enough!  What about at raquetball?  Have you given up on beating
me there yet?

No...never...so what do you think about abortion?

Looks like that one came in from left field.

it did.

Why do you ask?

just curious.  i want to get to know you ANS YOUR VIEWS.

(sorry....didn't mean to yell)

hang a sec

ok.  And to change the subject...

huh?
Besdies being curious, I suspect that you were just trying to change the
subject as well.

no.  I really am interested.

My answer is not easy to express in words, 'cause I am confused about it.
I think that abortion is murder, and yet I also knowe theat there are a
large number of children that are "mis-timed" or unwanted.  It is hard
to believe that a child born into a family that doesn't want it can thrive
very well.  But he/she should have the chance to live.

You can see that I am somewhat confused about it.

I guess the smaame goes for me too.  I go round and rund in circles.
For the most part, I feel it is murder and that the woman should take
rsponsibility for what she has done.  The only situation where I
have no qualms about it is if a woman has been raped. I don't kthink
I could ever go through with it if I had to.  I'd be scared to death
to begin with, I'd feel guilty for the rest of my life, and I don;'t
know if I could go against GOod that much.

Sounds like your feelings are very similar to mine.  I have spent a lot
of time thinking about it and stiill no unequivocal answers.

next subject...

Your're on.

what?

I ewas waiting for you to choose a topic.  How do you feel about birth
control in general?

Well, since you brought it up...did you know that I'm not on anything
at presetnnt.  I coldn't decide whether to stay on the pill or not
and I waited to so lso long that my decision was made for me since I had
skipped so many days without taking them.  I dunno.  What do you think
about it?

I kinda suspected that that was what had happened.  Let's just say that
I am not terribly surprised.  I asked you first.

Are you terribly angry?  I wish that there was something as convenient
as the pill for both sexes.  I don't think it's fair that women
should have to take all sec. ok  the responsibility.

I am not at all angry.  It takes not one iotat away from the fantastic
evening and night that we shared.  'Nuff said about that.  I agree that
it is totally unfair that the woman needs to be concerned and the male can
wander around without a care in the world.  What should we do about it>?? 

sec...times up...Do YLM?

yes...Lots?yes.

I don'tE xknow what we shouyld do about it.  I guess wait until sceience
comes up with something.  What do YOU think we should do abou ti?

it?

I am unsure.  For us specifically, it may be important to do some research
as to methods that will work for US.  I am amenable to almost anything,
just so long as I can still snuggle you.  And make love to you sometimes --
when you want to and are in the mood.

sec...Are you excited about tonight?  Any idea about the format
oif the class?

And, is it important for you to eat before the class?

The boston cream pie is still delicious.

yes.  no..yes


yes...no...yes... *(in answer to your previous questions)
and thank you.  I will bake it for you often i fyou like, along with
other scrumptious goodies.

I LIKE!  Any further comment on the previous issue?

Any suggestions as to what you have in mind.  I don't mind experimenting.
I think the biggest problem wfor us will be that it will greatly
inhibit outr spontaniety.

Good girl!  TI was unsure how to spell that one too!  Seriously, there is still
a set of at least three solutions which do not grteatlkeatlkly affect out spontaniety.
1) Vasectomy (I understand thatN Ot here WaArYe re!versible forms)
N2)O!  NO!  NO!  NO!

Listen for a sec.  I am just laying out what I understand to be our chouiices.
We can make judgements on them later.  Ok?

ok...

1) Vaswectomy  (I know of at leatst 2 poeple who have had them recveresed)
2) THhe Pill
3) An IUD

oh well.  Babe, I need to go so I can eat and change and get back
here by 7:30 okay?  Walk wme out to my car and we can continue the
discudssion tonight if you wish?

Sounds wonderful.  I'll be there in just as long as it takes for me to gather
my stuff and walk over there.  What are you going to wear tonight?

I'll tell you when youy get here.

Good enough.  On my way.

Hi.

hi...just finishing doing Laz's mail...

Wanna wait until all done with that?

yea...it'll only take a sec.  okay?  I'll beep ya.  Where are you
in The Promise?

Perfect.  Page 152.

what's happening?

Nancy/Marie is walking in Santa Cruz with Peter and has just dsaid
(for presumably the first time) that she loves him in her own
peculiar way.  He repiled:  "That'll do for now."

(repiled?)  I wonder what he piled the first time that he needed to
repile it?  A bit later she confesses to him: "(Wrong place).  She now
has sometinh

     ** GONG THAT MAN!! **

She now has something up her sleeve.  "Gong that man"?????

YUes.  Didn't you ever watch the Gong Show?

Not even once.

Just got off the phone with TOP.  Lunch is all clear with us for
today.  He was very understanding when I told him that I needed to
take care of someone else rather urgently.  Does it tell you al little
of howw much I love you that you are that important to me?

Yes.  You are he best and thank you.

And you are she best.

Ha Ha!  Funny...really funny... (Oh, gawd...)  J.k.
So, help me think of a place to go for lunch.  I don't really 
want a sandwich again, and Chinese food doesn't really sound appealing
today.  Any ideas?  

What about Luther's?

hmmm...that's a thought.  

How abhouuht Germania?

Good idea but I don't really feeel like driving all that way... (picky\
today, aren't I?_

Reasonable.  Not picky.  I L Y.
How about Chili's?

I guess what I really feel like is something light like Colonel
Lee's but again, I don't want to dfrive that far.  Wonder if there's
anything like that around here?

Lemme think...How about the Ginger Jar?  Could get soup and salad or something 
like that.  They have good Monte Cristos...

....PIZZA??....

That's light?

well...so it's nort exactly light...  Hmmmm... Me LIKE Pizza!!

Hoe w about Chuck E. Cheese's?  MIght be fun to play for a whiule...

Or BullwOirn kSlteu'fst Pizza on the Ccorner of homestead and stelling?

Try that again, please

hang please...phone.
Goodbye cruel world.  I did not staeal that horesrse!  SPROING   GAAAAK.
(I hung.)

What??  I said we could go to Stuft Pizza on the corner of Homestead
and Stelling...

Don't feel like Video Games, huh.?  Ok.  I LIKE Stuft Pizza, except that
it is a Pizza Peddler now.  Went from Stuft to Pyramid to Pizza Peddler all
in less than a yesar.

Oh.  I didn't realize that.  Is it any good?

Still the same pizza as near as I can tell.  Therefore it is still good.
Sounds like a pretty reasonable idea to me.  Wanna grab the pizza and go
somewhere that we can snuggle your head into my shoulder?

Like where?

Isn't there a park not too far from there?  I remember going there once
with you not long ago...

...phone I fiugredigured.

laz

Oh.  Did I tell you that I ran into him (not literally) while Wweanandering
Vallco after getting my harir cut?

Please beep.  My nose just l;et go again...

no.  what did he wsay?  Is your nose alright?  (Such a nice nose...)

Nose is ok now.  Nice nose, huh?  Wish you had been around to tell
me that when I was a teenagere struggling with my apparent bad looks.
I just said hello, and he said "How are you doing?" in a tone that
indicated te wasn't really interested in the answer.  We skoojhook
hands and opparted.  To be fair, it was obvious that he was looking for
someone or something, and was in kind of a hurry.

oh.  I can hear him now...  nice man, though...

Agreed, but I am unused to being treated like a salesman that he doesn't
really want to see.  I didn't attach any big negativcee to it, 'cause like I
said, he was in a hurry.

Is lunch decided then?  Shall we call ahead?  So we don't starve while
waiting for it?

All seems settled except about the park.  Calling ahead is a marvy idea.

marvy?  on the phone again...

Yes.  Maryvy.  What about the park?

I'd rather just talk there...

The only drawback (for ME) is that I want to hold you.  If you don't
want or need that right now, then talking there is groovy.

groovy?  Have we slipped into the past about a decade and a half?

Not that I know of.  Why do you ask, fair maiden?

Pardon me:  Why asketh thou, fair maiden?

Nature calls.  Back in a min.

You there?
phone
Oh.   Sorry.
what kind of pizza do you want?

First:  Was I right in my assumption tahat you are not necessarily in
need/want of being held?

Don't they EVER let you off the phone?!?
sec, pls.

Sometimes I get imappatient.  Sorry.

that's okay.  I want to be held in your arms but at the same
time don't feel like it.  I guess I need to be taken care of
in a different way...

Want to Fcall aheaard  out.and order the pizza?  What kind?
It doesn't matter to me as long as it is edible and deoesn't have
fungi on it.

Far out.  If you can somehow get a handle on how you DO want to be
taken care of right now, I would love to volunteer for the job.
Seeing as how you never seem to get free of the phone, maybe I had better
call.  Anything else that you don't want on it?  How do you define
"edible"?

sec....OK.  Thanks for taking the time every once in a while to let me
know that you are tied up.  It makes the waiting weeasirer.


               "Fungi"

              1.  olives
              2.  mushrooms
              3.  anchovies
              4.  onions (although sometimes they are okay)
N
o
 comment on how you want to be taken care of?

It is a small and will be ready in 15 minutes -- before we can reasonabley
get there I think.

MMMMMMMMmmmmmmmm...  Me Want Pizza  NOW!!

On my way over.  Two stops to make first:  my bank and your bank.  Right?

right.  bye.

Your car (so we don't run out of gas?)?

ok.  how long are your  going to coast in Nellie, anyway?

Gett ining cash now so that I can put ssome in her today.  Just didn't
want to take the time before we eat, so will do it immnediately upon
returning.  Meet with your approval?

ywes.  awaiting you patiently...
You?  Patient?  GUFFAW/.   (J,.K.)

Are you coming over or shall we spend all lunch ohour on :930?????????

Hi, doll.  I missed you

hi.  i midssed you 2.

Marie just came back from her southwest trip and is looking tin the moirror for
the first time with out tape or bandages on her face.  She is crying.

That's a neat part, huh?  Can you imagine what it would be like to look into
the mirror and see someone else?

Believe me, I have TRIED to imagoine it more than once.

what's that supposed to mean?

I think you know.  Don't you?

I wish you'd stop that.  I think your VERY sexy and EXTREMELY handsome!
And I love you!

Thank you.  I wasn't always so.

why not??

I used to have a nose that was too big and suffer forrom terminal acne.

Looks like you grew into your nose quite well and that the acne cleared up.

I love you.  More than you can possibley imagine.

I have quite a vivid imagination....

Not big enough for this.  Not nearly.

ily2...more than you will ever know.

I ernarnestly hope that I learn to know a significant portion of it.  Already
it is more than I think I deserve.

When can you leave work in good conscience?

at about 5 minutes to 5.  when will you leave?

p'bly abotut 10 minutes before you do.  Sound reasonable?

yes.  will yousave a spot for us by the fierre?

Unless you get there first and then I would like you to save us a spot (SHOOT
THAT MONKEY)?!

ok...i always wanted to have a monekkey for apet, did you know that?
I wanted one REALLY badly for a LONG time!

What kind of monkey?  I didn't know or even suspect that .

I don't know what kind.  A chimp, I guess.  I think my parents
thought I wasnus nuts, it was a real obsession for years.

Why?

I don't know./  I never got a younger brother or sister, so I

This time I feel like I managed to get rid of mhim sooner than he wanted.
I think I should work on that more.

Oh.  Don't you enjoy talking to him?

Sometimes, but to tell the truth, I much more enjoy interacting (!!!) with you.

(!!!!!!!)

You wanted a chimp for a younget brother??

well...why not?

Probably smarter than the younger brothers that I had.,..

hummm...  I don't know if they would agree with you.  Did you notice the time?

Yep.  Think that it is about time to push, especially since you will only
have a limited time with me.  Bye for now?

For now...see you in a few minutes at Peppermill.

Want me to order a Tom Collins for you there>??

ok.  and I'll order a Kaluha and creme for you?

HI.

hi.  I feel like an enormous weight has been lifted from my 
shoulders...I got Laz's taxes out of th e way and managed to
talk to him, too!

I am proud of you!

Thank you, thank you (as the curtain slowly is drawn closed...)
Why did you move it up tomorrow Tuesday night to 5:30?

I am not sure.  It felt right.

Well, it's original, I guess.

What's original?

How long di you think it will take?  I'm hoping to run to
the spa tonight after Jim's.  I don't know if I will make it there
in time to do much or not, though.

The people at Family Fitness said that it would only take about 20 minutes, but
I suspect it will take a half-hour at the least.  How is this appointment
related to the sapapa after Jim's toinight?

It's not, I just threw two thoughts together.

Careful.  I confuse very easily.  Wanna hear about the dreams?  Did you
look at your mail before linking up?

No.  Should I knownow?  How long will DeAnza take?

Which "no" (there wer e two distinct questions there)?  You should read
the mail now.  I have no idea at all how long De Anza will take.  Worried?

No.  I'll be back in a sec, then.

hi.  My terminal got hung up again.  I don't know why it
keeps doing that.  

What do you mean by "hung up"?

It won't let me type anything (no characters show up) or every time
I hit a key, it beeps.

Strange...I used to have the problem with characters not showing up
because I made a lot of mistakes when logging in and tried to use the 
backspace key to fix them.  But that wouldn't explain the beeping...
Is it Violet that is doing that?

yes. it's violet.  And I'm in the middle of ontyme when it does that,
not logging in.

Stranger still.  Wonder what she thinks is wrong?

i dunno.

Oh, ewell.  I am just biding my time until Rick Hunt gets here (supposedly
about 10 am), then I have to talk to him for 10 or 15 minutes.  Then at
1:3011:30 or so I am to interview another candidate for my job as Technical
Instructor.  Then another one at 2:30 or so.  *sigh*

Busy day.

Only sort of.  More like "jhurry up and wait".

oh.
I'd much rather take you to the beach and play hookey...

oh.

In fact, sometimes I think that I am not cut out to work.  Feels like I
should be kept by some rich (or very nice) lady, or otherwise be a
man of leisure.  Ever have that kind of feeling?

Spmometimes.  It ddoesn't last oo long, though.  I don't think I'd
be very happy that way.

I agree.  It would probably be nice for the first couple of days, and then
get unbearabley dull afterwards.

Do you want to be rich

Yes.  But I will never completely stop working.  There is too much that
I like to do.  I get a real charge out of completing things.

interesting...

Do you want to be rickh?

I dunno.  It's not that important to me.  At least not now.  I just
want to be comfortable.  I guess I feel that there are a lot more 
important things in the world than being rich.

Most of what I want is to be able to afforsdd to do anything that I want.
And to never have to tell you that you can't hcave something that you
want because we can't afford it.  Know what I mean?


sec...waiting patiently...

I guess so.  Being told no is not the worst thing in life, though.
I abwill be fthe first to admit that it's not one of my
favorite words to hear, but...

Agreed.  I just want to ensure that if there are no reasons for not doing something
something, that money sdoesn't get in the way either.

why?

It is sort of like this:  we go somewhere and see this really wonderful
painting that we really WANT to put over the couch in our living room.  It
is perfect for our decore and we talk about it for some time.  You love
it so much that we ask the artist sitting there how much it cousts.  When
we get the answer, we know that there is no way that we can put this PERFECT
thing in our home -- and only because it is too expensive.  All the other
things are right -- but the money gets in the way.  See?

I can understand that.  I just don't want my whole life scentered around
getting rich (i.e. The business, which is what this is boiling down
to).  If it's going to be centered mostly around one thing, I sure
don't want it to be that.

That's a big 10-4!  Wholehearted agreement!  I want to BE rich, not to go
through GETTING rich.  The lobby just called and Rick is here.  Can I liknk
back up to you when he has left?

yes.  I don't understand what you just said, either.

I'll explain.  Just as soon as he has left.  Ok?

ok.

00000         YOU'RE MISSING THE SHOW!  YOU SHOULD BE ON THIS SIDE OF THE
   BUILDING!  THE BLUE ANGELS ARE DOING PRACTICE FLIGHTS...

Still?

YES.  THERE GOES ANOTHER ONE!

Be right there.  No need to shout.  On my way...

WHAT'D yoiuu end up doing last night?

<*SMACK*>
thanks.  smack to you too

I think it's about time for me to invet in a cameras..  

There are some good (and cheap) ones in the catalog.

what's "cheap"?

Anywhere from $18 for the basic stripped down model up to about
$40 for the autowinder model.

What kind do you have?

The $40 autowinder.  It let's me take oppictures faster.

I should have known...

Wja"t do you recommend.  I don't eaxactly want the abc type of camera.

ABC?

the basic kind.

Well, you should look ath  the catalog.  There is one for about @22 that
has a telephoto lens built-in, I think.  That might be best.

$22 I??   IIf  thiitn'ks  likes oo.n
e 
I had before, no thanks.

I don't know what you had nbefore.  What doid you have before?

It has a d a telefoto lense on it and was probably around $20.  It
was a Kodak but the picture quality wasn't too hot.

I'll look at this one, and let you know.  Ok?

I have a coatalog.  I can check them out and see.

Mee too.  Want me to do it and give you my recommendation?

Okay.  What do you think about the Kodak Disk camera?

I know a couple of people that have had them and they both say the same thing:
since the negatives are so small, the prints ALWAYS come out blurry and
grainy.  And ther e is virtually no chance of geting an adequate en largement/.

Oh.  Well that won't do then.  Maybe I should go to a camera store
and tell the man what I want and the price range.

Might be  a really good idea, as long as you expect to pay a premium for the
convenience.  It is a really good way to find out what is available, and 
then you might pursue? othere means of gettting the same stuff.  (:930
went a into slow mode for a se, there)

Why would I have to pay a premium to talk to the man and tell him how
much I wanted to pay and what type of camera I wanted?

In genereal, the merchandise in most camera stores is quite a bit more
expensivcve than identiacal items available elsewhere.  So you would get
something that was in your price range, but there might be ways to get
the same stuff even cheaper.

Where is elsewhere?

Sundry mail order catalogs, discount houses, even department stores or
Longs.

I have given up on mailorder catalogs, as I'm sure yu can understand,
and I will probably check at consumers.  San Jose Cameria on Hamilton
is supposed to have the lowest prices around.

Great!  Then they would be very unusual and a good plavcece to check out.

Maybe I'll stop by obver the weekend.

MightW hbaet  at liomte  oifs    huh?

Might be a lot of fun.    No w what erwere you trynig o ing to say?

What time is it?

10:53

Are you busy?

No.  But very hungry.

Why?

"don't turn me away i" is on the tape now.

sec ok?
Of course.  Phone?

That reminds me, I still have your scisp $1 bills.  You'd better
get them from me today, or I can't guarantee where they'll go.

How about if I put them in the envelope in my desk?

yes.  good idea.

I'll grab them when I give the money to you from the bank run.
See you in a bit?  I'll leave thoiis linked up and hope for messages
to be left on the scremen...

hint  hint.  Okay.  See ya then.

{H[2JBye for a sec.



So, who's getting married tomorrow?  What time do yuo want to leave for
racquetball?  Right at 12:45 prompt?  It looks like the Blue Angels have
landed.  *Sniff*  I meant to bring a banana to eat today but I
forgot it at home.  Oh well.  I had a pdream last night that Michelle
and Eric were eating my bananas!  I had just went to the store to 
get them, too.  Probably wbecause the night that I really DID go to
the store, they couldn't believe I was going to drive to an Alpha Beta
just to buy bnananas.  They gave me a hard time.

Beep me when you return?

Your "24H HOUR" teller machine was "closed temproarilyorarily", so I did the
deposit at the walk-up window.  Which also means that I couldn't make
the savings withdrawlal that you needed.  How about at fter raquetball?
Jaci Ward and Raphael Ruiz are getting married tomorrow.  JaciI met Jaci
through Scott Daniels (who was involved with her at the time) and we
struck up an independent friendship.  She talks even more and longer
than either John Crane or Eric!
I would like to be out of the building by 12:45.  Ok?
I have a banana that you could eat....(here is that laugh again)there is that laugh again). I
promiste to mnever goiive you a hard time about running out to the stroetore
just to get a single item.  AFair enough?

<*BEEP*>
fiar enough

Thanks for getting the sandwich.

Are you there?  Yes.  Yeou are welcome.  Comment on being out of here
by 12:45?

yes.  good idea.  Did you get a sandwich too?

Yep.  Corned beef and swirdds.  And a Diet Coke too.

yummm...

Any comment on my favorite Elton John song?  Have you ever heard it?

no.  it seems very morbid, considering everything thats happening niow.,

It isn't morbid at all.  It makes me laugh.  Especiallyt when I am taking
myself too seriously.

oh.  i guess i just don't take that subject as being funny.

I can see that.  I think.  Threats and all...

yes.

Sorry if Iw struck a nerve.  

what were we talking about before Rick camr?

Being rich versus getting rich.

explain, please?

Ok.  I want to be rich enough to do all the timngs that I want to do
(like we talked about before), but I don't want to concentrate on money
to the exclusion of all else in order to get there.  It is sorta like
I want someone to wave their magic wand and suddenly I am rich.  That
way I never have to worry about acquiring it, just spending it.

unfortunayttely, thart's not goinh to happen.  what then?

You are talking all the fun out of life?!!

what bthen?\

Then, we will go on as best we can.  Saving whatever we can,  Caring more
for each other than money.  IIf the Business seems like a reasonable
thing to do part-time for some more income, then we might do that.  I
haven't been looking that far ahead yet.  I know that we can get by
pretty comfortably on just what I make.

Does that mean the business is not an autromatic imnnheritance  (sec.) with
the marriage vows?

Not unless we want it to be.  I was/am unsure how you feel about it.

So am I.   Ther are some times (like at the meetings) when I feel
really against it.  I don't really enjoy listening to people "writing
off" others just because they chose not to cdodo it.  I think it's
very cold and uncaring.  It seems sometimes like that's all they talk/joke
about.

I think iI know just what you mean.  I ahhad the same objection when it seemed
that I was being told to flush long time friends just because they said
"no" to the business.  I have kept touch with them anyway -- and it turns
out that that WASN'T what they were saying at all.  I really don't know
how to completely "Wwite somerite someone of"Ff" that I have know n for any appreciable
length of time.

There was one meeting I was at, and I swear I almost strangeled who
ever was talking.  He was talking about "being a man" I guess and
not letting your wife/anyone else tell you what to do.  He said something
like, "For instance, if you were presented the opportunity to move
to another state in your job, would you ask you wife?  No!  You'd just
move."  What a bunch of bullshit.  What man whould decided something\
like that without talking it over with his wife?  The sad thing was,
I looked over and you were all into it, too.  You seemed to
agree with him at the time, but I knew that wasn't the real you.

I remember the time pretty well.  It is something that I learned erarly
on in the Business:  how to hear what he is trying to say with out getting
hung up on the words or examples that he is using.  I was agreeing with
what I thought he was trying to express: don't let people take your
dream away from you.  Don't let your wife push you into a life of
mediocrity just because it is easier than putting forth the effort.
I remember being offended at the time too.  The re is no Man that I
know of that would accept a transfer like that without consulting his
wife first.  And I promise you that I neve rr will.  I NEED your input and 
advice.

Well, I can't believe he sttood up there on stage and said that., used that
example.  It's got tho be the ppoooorest example, if he didn't really mean it.
It's just a lot of things like that, though, and hearing people tell you
to forget your friends if they say no because "you don't need them".
(I've heard that one a lot).  I thifelt a lot of people get swept away
with the idea that was presented by the Business and they end up
become very self centered and materialistic (not a very good choice of
words, bear with mne).greedy?    Well, I was trying not to be so
blunt.  I also don't know that that word allplies to those that I did 
meaet and interact with in your line.  In other lines of the business,
that's very true.  I always felt lthat (and this is what it all boilds
down to, I guess) if you're going to put in that much time and effort
-- calling people, having meetings, going to meeting, product call-in 
and pick up, etc. -- it should be put into something that benefits
a lot of people... like the church.  Ya know what I mean?

Perzactly.   T h e only  Perzactly?  Perfect+exactly
oh.  sorry, go on, please.

The basic reason that I joined our line of sponsorship at all is that I
felt that the emphasis in our local area was really aimed at helping
people.  I guess that rates right up there as one of the realy inmportant
concepts about me -- I like to help people.  The main thrust was not
just to make money -- although that is there too -- but to help others
take akhold of their fincaacnesnancesfinances and get to where money doesn't drive
thieir life.  And to be rewarded ONLY for when you can do that successfully.
In my person al experience, and with those few that I have sponsored, I
never tell them to flush their friends.  If the friends are not interested
in the business, then just don't do business with them.  But don't
throw them away unless the y throw themselves away.  Know what I mean?

I don't really see how you can honestly believe that the group is aimesd
at helping people.  I can see that you do it not just to make money
for yourselvef, but to help others.  But when you bring someone to a 
meeting and they tell you all that and the whole day is "How can I get
richer faster?" and not how can I help out others.  I guess it's a very
fine line and you can look at it both ways.  I'd rather be in
something and work on something that wasn't souch a see-saw
of give and take.  You know wha tt I mean?

Yep.  I guess that since I have chosen that my emphasis will be on
helping other people, I get out of the meetings means of doing that.
But I can understand what you are talking about.

My interviewee is waiting.  I'll get back to you as ssoon as we have
finished, ok?

ok.  Have fun!

[H[2JWhy do you suppose I walk out of the meetings with a different
outlook than you?  

Could it be that you expect to get different things out of them?

I don't know.  I just qalways leave feeling like all they talked
about was, like <II said before, how to get rich quick.

Do you think it would be wothrthwhile to talk about this some more?

I guess so.  If ti's ait's going to be a significant part of our livfe.

It might be.  But only if you are comfortable with it.  I wouldn't
let something as crazy as this get between us.

Isn't that on the line of letting your wife talk yu out of
something.

Not the way that I see it.  I feel that it is something that
might be a viable alternative for us, but definitely not the only
one.  So ,  I will look at it carefully and at your reactions
and feelings avboubout it.  Ultimately, I will make the decision, but it will
only nbe after getting your input.  Anything eelse would be sheer
craziness.  On my way over now, since it is 12:48/.  Bye for now.
Thanks, you're sweet.  bye.

Hi.  Do you know how much I love you?

hi.  yes i do.  do you know how much i love you?

Sometimes.  There is a special light in your eyes -- like this morning.
I just hope that I wasn't misinterpreting a look of abject pain...

no, you weren't.  The light was there.

Sure it wasn't a reflection off the window?

Could have been....I guess you're right ...it was.

OOOOOOh.  You're not supposed to play tha t game better than I do!!

Opps.  Oh well...

Tell me all about the beach?  Or is that possible thhere?

Well, the beach actually starts at Moffet  (or the story does anyway)
and Iit's pretty long...it's up to you.

Tell me about it.  I have all the time in the world.

How nice!  Well, Meep and I got to Moffet around 11:00 (we actually got
in around 11:45...Mobs of people there!).  We had to walk tfor a mile to get
there from where we parked.  We brought a cooler with drinks and
sandwiches, etc.  and both lugged in two bags filled with various
paraphenilia.  As Meep says, next time we'll leave our apartment behind!
We were pretty pooped by the time we got there.  We spread out our
blanket and began to bask in the sun while waiting for the show 
to start.  We started talking to this guy who was fright in front
of us with his parents (who are from Germany but have been out thhere
for about 30 yearss.  Very nice people).  Thw show was terriffic!
The Eagles who flew also were really neat as were the other plans
that did stunts there.  It didn't feel super hot until the very end...
then I felt my skin cooking.  There wasn't a whole heck of a lot I
could do though, there was no shade around.  The blue angels
finally did their thing and were magnificant.  The stunts they did
would take your breath away!

<any comments before I go on?>

Was the guy in front of you interesting?  Or just his parents?

\BBoth, I guess...

Can you tReell me about the Eagles?

Well, their planes were painted the colors of the rainbows on the wings
and underneath side.  The rest was white...VERY PRETTY.  The re were
three of them and did stunts kind o ff like the blue angels but not

as breathtaking.  They did a lot with colored smoke up in the air.  Oh,
there were parachuters there too.

(talkimgng to Eileen Riorden)

okay.  let me know when you're done and I'll go on with my story.
Just finished.  Interesting...  Tell me more about your story.

Well, we had been talking to this guy for just about the whole day;
he seemed really friendly.  When they were getting ready to leave
he asked Meep and I if we wanted to go to the beach the next
day (Monday).  Meep already had plans (She bought a waterbed,
by the way) but I said I'd go.  So they left and we left a little later.
There were just TONS and TONS of people leaving fso we stopped 
under a tree in the gass and sat for a half hour and then began outr
trek back to our car (ONE MILE AWAY!).  WThe show was over at 4:00
and we got home a little past 6:00.  Not bad, huh?  We were going to
go to Eric's party but Meep felt like she was coming down twith 
a cold so she slpeept for a while and I did the same and told her
to wake me up when she was ready to go.  Well, I fell asleep and
woke up at 10:15 p.m. when Rob called Bob  Bob Cal called (so I'm not very good with names...
what can I say?).  He's they guy from Moffet that we met.  We set
a time to leave in the morning.  He asked me if I was afraid of
heights (I'M PETRIFIED of heights).  So what did I say?  Oh, just
 a little.  why?  He asked if I like to climb go climginbing on rocks and I
said that I hadn't done it in  a while, but sure, why not.  Now I KNOW
why bnotnot!  He picked me up a little apast nine yesterday and we went
to a beach about 10 miles or so north osf Santa Cruz.  I don't tink
it has a name...I call it Suicide Point.  I don't believe that I climgbed
down that cliff and back up again!  Some day I'll take you there
and show it to you from the road (I ain't goin down there again!).
We are taklking about a HIGH cliff and VERY steep too.  I don't know
how many times I started to tell him to forget it, I wan'ted to go back.
But, I didn't want to look like a fool, so we kept going.  I have
war injuries to show, too.  NYes?

Two thiubngs:

  1) will you show me the war injuries?
  2) Thrown over (i.e. not reading my messages) for Rock Climbing!

Well...what can I say?  Not much, apparently.  Yes I will show you
my injuries.  Nothing serious.  He kept telling me not to scrape
my legs while I'm scrambling all over this cliff hanging on for
dear life. Literally.  I thought I would cry with relief when we finally
made it down there!  Needless to say, the beach was deserted.
Wonder why?  We did see a couple other people as we left.  The only
way to get there though, is to climb down those rocks.  So, we
spent the day there (stayed until 3:30 or so) and I proceeded to burn
my backside as there wasn't any shade onvce again.  We went over to another
part of beach to e"explore:" and very nearly got caught by the tide.
It was coming in really far and was pretty roucgh and we couldn't
get around the rocks back to our beach again.  *PANIC*  I think I had
heart failure about 6 times altogether yesterday.  We finally made
it, I don't know how.  Climbing back up was a little better thabn
climbing back downdown.  I don't know how many times I almost froze with fear
right where I was on the cliff.  If you slip, the only place to
go is on down the side of the rock and into the ocean.  All together
not my kind of beach.

We left (finally)Ev eann d with   yes?

Go ahead.  I'll ask later.

sure you don't want to sask now?

Yes.  I'll wait.

Okay.  Anyway, we finally left tthe beach and hea  asked me out to
dinner (I hadn't eaten since 8:00 that morning) aso we went back to
my apt. and I took a shower (yes, alone) and changed.  yes?

Thnank you.

Your quite welcome!  We went back to his place and he changed and
we went out to dinner at a Mexican restrautnt.  He went to a park
somewhere in Mountain View to watch the fireworkd that went on a t
Moffet but we got there so late that they were over in aobut 10 
miutes./inutes.  I was really popped.  So, he drove me back home (parked in
the carport because meep was out and there were no other spaces).

Meep came home Go on.
a
bout (beep me when you are done, so that I don't jump in every 
paragraph?)

sec.

Meep came home about 10 inutes later and asked him to move
his car so she could park, so he decided to just leave...we were\
so pooped.  So, that's the end of my storey.  Questions?

A bunch.  But I think I will only ask a couple of them.

Feel free to assk what you want, please.

Several need to see your eyes.  Even through all the fear, did you have
a nice time at the beach?  All I read was the fear and the burning...

Well, it was kind of eerie having these HUMONGOUS cliffs sourrrounding
you, knowing that if something happendeed, sno onw would know you
were there and there would be no way to get out if you pbroke your
legs or something.  Maybe I';m just too dramatic.  It was a strange place.
I like beacheds that emmit happiness and such.  This was kind
of empty.

I know.  I just called him but he said no.  Other than Mike Nason

I just told Susan Eisenberg that I would buy her membership for $250 (plus

It has the same priveledges as the Single Special membership that costs $1500
and $75/month.  Yes, it is a good deal.

You are really UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I' think I'm gonna have to

Hi.  I love you!

Hi.  ILY2!  They're trying to ,mamake me blush over here because of my dress...

Your dress is beautiful, but only because YOU are wearing it.  You look
wonderful and very touchable today.  It was all I could do not to run up and
hug the stuffing out of you.

What a sweetie.  You always know the right things to say.  You look very
nice today yourself!  VERY sexy!

When I figure out just what it is that you think is sexy, you can depend
on the fact that I will wear it whenever I have the correct clean sclothers.
I was tnt youto desire me as much as I desire you.

I do.   Believe me!  Did you really call me last night?  I can't decide
whether I rmember it or not.  I've been trying to figure it out all morning!

If iI did, what time di o you think it was?

1) Being so insistent about lunch alone with me
2) Being unalbeble to control my hands better

yes  you are forgiven.

Thank you, you cuddly-looking doll.  How did you know PRECISELY what
to say in your OnTyme of last night?  Am I that transparent?

at times you are.  VBBut then, I know you very well.

Is that good?

yes it is.

Since you know me so well, and know (almost all the time) exactly what to
say and do, does there exist the temptaion to tell me what I wantyou know theatI want to hear
(what you know that I want to hear)?

No.  I'll never tell you anything that it s not true.

Ok.  I accept that and thank you for it.  You are a special lady.

Am I very transparent?

Less often than I am, I think.  You are about the ONLY person that I
don't read like a book.  It is downright DIFFICULT (I wanted to say "hard")
to figure out what it is that you need at any one time.  Sometimes it
seems like what you want at any one time changes over the course of a
very few seconds.  That makes it nealrly impossible for me to keep up.

I guess you're right.  I do change my moods quite a bit, I must admit.
I talways thought that made me very hard to live with.  You sure you
know what you're getting into?

Part of the problem is tahat I'm not getting into it nearly often enough.

g(!)
Huh?



(!)

It doesn't make you hard to live with particularly.  Just very disconcerting
at times.  It feels like (on occasion) I just manage to figure out what
I should do and start to implement it, when you have already changed your
mind and what I do is not what you need.  Sometimes, I just miss.

Babe, ther e are times when NO ONE can give me what I need.  It's just
not possible to please me.  I guess I'm better off just left alone.
There are times when I try to tell you (in very obvscure ways, I must admit)
what I need and you try something thats close but not wquite right,
then it can get frustrating.  That doesn't often happen tho.

I don't accept that there is NO-ONE who can give you what you need.  I
will bust my butt (and othere things as well) until I *DO* manage to get
it right.  At least 90% of the time.  As for leaving you alone, you must
be kidding!  You are too cuddly, too warm, too much loved, too much needed
for me to just walk away.  Even if that is what is needed.  Send me away
for a while and I will STILL try to do what I can -- even from a distance.
Your happiness is more important to me than my own.

The times when I try tsomething that is not quite right can be very VERY
frustrating indeed.  Especially for you.  You send out the signals that
tell EXACLTLY what you need, and how to fill that need, and I manage to
not read them correctly (or, worse ytetet, read them correctly and still
not do what you need) and do something which (more often than not) fills
MyY need.  Not yours.

i know.  thanks.  yes, it is different.  i like.

Is it possible for you to describe how it is different?  Like:  is the 
physical feeling different or does it do something else to your head?

I guess a little of both.  Mostly physical.  Sometimes if I'm sore
and we do it from that angle it doesn't hurt.  Does it do
something to youYOUR head??

Yes.  And physically too, but less so than the affect on my head.

I thought it was one and the same..."physical"?

I don't userdatandnderstand what you just dasaid.

Look at your previous sentence.  I thought the two were both the same, that is, both
physical.  

If I am understanding correctly, to some extent that is true.  TMy mental state
VERY strongly affects the way that I feel things.  On the right track?

I would rather be experimenting, but talk is better than nothing...

okay...shoot!

I did that already once this morning.

cute...raeal cute...

I guess that a large part of the way that it affects me is due to the fact
that it has happened to me relatively arelyrarely.  Yet, no matter how many times
WE do it that way, it still affects me thae same.  Follow?

yes.  do you like it?  What's your favorite way?

To say that I like it is a gigantic understatement.  My favorite way, jhuh?
The easYy answer o(uand correct too)  yes?  You... "Your favorite
position..."

Ok.  As I was asaying, the easy answer is "in you".  My favorite position
changes with time.  Sometimes (probbably most often) it is with you on top
so that I can kiss your breasts.  Other times it is from behind.  Other times
it is with me on top and you opened as far as you can.  Want right now's
answer?

yes.

With you on top and kissing your breasts.  And I REALLY enjoyed it when
you asked for it from behind.  I like the mix of positions that you use.

You there?

sorry.  it was time to lather up again.  Your face?

   1)  What does that have to do with your developing/having developed them?

     2)  I said that I wanted to take them for YOU, not afor me or to remind
          ME of any "wonderful time".


Now,I  gdo ilvies tiet time tno  sink into that brick head of yours.....

Huh?

I said "Now, figive it time to sink into that brick head of yours."

Ok.  Sec.  Phone.

.......................................\..
.
.......It is. ....sink.ing in...

......oh <yawn> sorry...

I DO listen.  You just haven't counted on the deviousness of my mind,
especially when it is in this particular state.  To wit:
1) If I have them developed, you won't have the opportunity to "slip"
   out any picture s that you don't want me to see.
2) Even if they are for me, it is hoped that you will show them to me
   and give me the narrative that goes with them.
3) By paying for them and actually attending to their being developed,
   I feel a little less elft out.

(That was supposed to be "left" not "elft")

(OPPPersonally, I like "elft" better).

Well, #1 certainly shows a great amount of trust in me, doesn't it?/?

Beelieve it or not, trust doesn't enter into it.  I expected (not feared
or was anxious about) that you would take some that might be ones that
you would specifically want to keep.

Any luck with finding othreer people to go with you?

That I would specifically want to keep?  Or keep away from you.  Trust most certainly most    
certainly does enter into it.  You just done't want to dadmit it or face it.

NOT SO!  That you YwEoSu ld SsOp!ecifically want to keep.
 
 Not necessarily away from me.  But to remind you.



Well, ya know something?  Ther wprobably (infacet, definitely) will be
some I will want to keep.  I happen to LOVE Yosemite and think it is
one of the most beautiful places in the whole world.  If you can't 
understand that, well...I guess you don't understand me or my love for
nature.

Doesn't that suggest to you that what I was saying back there about your
wanting to keep some was right?  The problem (and it is entirely in MY
MIND) is not that you will want to keep them.  Not at all.

It is that I will keep them as a reminder of my fantastic time right?

It is htat that you might end up getting BOB onb in one of the picture that you
keep and I interpret tahat poorly.  Not that you are doing anything
wrong in that, even if you do.  I tiold you that the problem is mine.
I was hoping not to have to admit that that was what I was feeling
(to you at least), so I tried to slip it in there casually.  IT IS NOT
THE BIGGEST REASON THAT I WANT TO DEVELOP THEM>.  IT IS A SIDE ISSURE.

I know this is important to you, but if you step back and look at this conver-
sation, it's utterly ridiculous.  I haven't even lesft yet, let alone taken
even one picture, and here we are worried that I might keep some and might
even have Bob in some of them...  <ever taken yourself too
seriously; as if I didn't know>.  One more thing and this part of
the camera is sue is closed, I hope:  what is the biggest
reason you want to develop them?\

You are absolutely right: I am being utterly rediculous.  No contest.
I tried to tell you that I am feeling lonely, and I guess I just proved
it beyond any shadow of a doubt.  Huh?

The biggest reason ids that it will serve to give me a sense (albeit very
limited) of participating in your weekend.  Like I have sort of shared it
in a bizarre way.  Not that I am trying to put anyone else out of the
picture (nice ly put, huh?0), but I am trying to share with you sometihhing
hat is very important to you.

sec pls.

Waiting.......

Okay.  I can undersstand and appreciate that.  

Now, sec.ok tell me:  what kind of film does your camera take?
Is it easy to use?  Will you show me how to?  (Even take a picture
of me first, oand let me try taking one of you??pleeaawase?)

It uses 110 cartridges.  Probably the most common type of film available.
Bes to use Kodacolor II or equivalent.  It is trivial to use, and aeven
has a motor to wind the filelm for you.  It has a built-in flash and a built-in
telephoto lens.  No fucussing or anythingocussing or anytihhing.  Decide if you need the flash,
turn it on if you need it, point the thing and press the button.

  IIs  it aw oMiiunolta?

No.  Not a Minolta.  Better quality, I think.  I would be happy to show
you how to use it and let you practiecce a bit.  I'll bring it tomorrow
and we can play a bit over lunch.

Smashing!  How is the quality of the pictures?  What brand is it?

(Like my new word?)

Yes!  (just making a note to myself so that I don't forget it)  I don't
remember the brand-name, it is a rather off brand as I remember.  I have had
a similar Minolta and a similar Vivitar AND a similar Kodak, and this
beeats them all for ease of use and quality pictures.  You have some idea
what normal instamatic pictures look like , don't you?

Fuzzy and unclear; at eleast that's how MINE always turned out.

I have shot some 6 or 7 rolls (24 exposures each) through this thing, and
unless you get too close to the subject, the pictureas are very crisp and 
clearly focussed.

sec pls.

OK

Sorry. I didn't understnand the look the first time that you gave it.














Please go look in  at amnd sniff what is in your mailbox.  Beep when you return?[H[2JMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm

cafeteria...drink?

YES!! NOow?

yes..

Sorry. I didn't understand the look the first time that you gave it.

no problem...I;''ll tell you the latest sad news...

on your Mweay oveert? 

Meet you at the top of the stairs...Oko?n

 my way now.

[H[2JBy the way, my manners are showing:  thanks for the milkshake at lunch.
It was delicious and you didn't need to do it.  And I anm glad that you did.
Thank you.

You are most welcome.  What time  is it?

4:03   What time shall we leave for the Peppermill?

oh, I dunno.  How doesn 5:00 sound?

Like a winner.  And I should tell you sometihghing about or messages of earlier.

hang pls.  I need to make a few clasalls. Why don't you type and
I'll read in between calls and reply, okay?

Sounds good.  You tuenned to KYUU?

I htaynpesg
Ok.  I'll type.  Just wanted you to be able to hear "Maniac"...
I Earlier, I typesd Bingo whereas you typed "Bingo".  Even so, a rather
interesting happening...

yes?

I was referring to our typing the same keyword at the same time.
So, we are on for R-ball at lunch time tomorrow, but what do you suggest
that we do for food? You need to eat an hour or more before agme timegame time>?

Any ideas what my surprise will be tomorrow?

(Since you are probably going to be tired up much more than I will, why
don't you beep when you can break in?)

An awkward question for me.  It is about Bob.  Shall I ask, or let it
go for now?

sec.  let me read and catch up.  OrK-ball at lunch tomorrow - yes.
food after maybe?  we play for 45 min. or so.?  No ideas on
the surprise. sec phone I figured  (Thanks for taking the time to let me know
rather than guessing that the machine had crashed, or Violet had hiccupped).



Go ahead and sask your question, I am ready...

Have tyouyou told Beob that youare dating othreer people>?

not in so many words...

Please be more specific and answer the intent of the question, rahtherther than
just the words.

I wasn't trying to skip around the issue.  I was giving you an honest
answer.  No I haven't docome right out ansd siaaid I am dating other\
people simply become itbecause it hasn't come up.  He knows you call me at
odd hours some times , that I have slept with other men, etc. but that's
about all./

Sorry if it sounded like I was yelling.  Dropped a couple of minor
bombshells in that last one, huh?

Does he know that I call (or just that someone calls you at odd hours?

that a man calls at odd hours.

Thanks.  I'm not toatlly sure why I wanted to know, but I have my
suspicions.

When oyh.o u  suggested  yes?  go on pls.
When you suggested eating afterward, what specifically did you have in mind?

just to grab a sandwich and bring back here or get dsomething from cafeteria.

Sopuunds reasonable.  Will that leave you with enough energy to play well?

if we wait to eat?  We'll see.  I hope so.

(Sorry I am taking so long, but I am haveing some trouble keeping the subject
changed)..)  A ISfh all you still have something to say, please do so.  I want
all cards on the table so to speak.

You sure?

yes.  very.

Ok.  Watch out for the barely concealed jealousy in what follows:
Sounds like you had a nice time at the beach.

You want the truth?

I dunno, do I?

You have to say so.

OK.  I want the truth.

We;ll, since you asked:

   The truth iuss, ss,  I spent 99% of the time thinking about you.  I was really
scared after going down that cliff and felt awful at the thought
of having to climb back up.  sec.  The beach wasn't my kind
of beach.  It was desolate and "empty" in some way.  I think the super
high cliffs souurrounding us made me feel really uncomfortable.  I was
also nervous being with him, especially in this deserted beach.  He
was fun to talk with, though, (not as fun as you, though, not any-
where close), and was friendly.  I felt pretty much at ease
with him, but just couldn't stop thinking of you ALL DAY LONG.
Answer yur question?

I don't deserve you or the WONDERFUL ways that you take care of me.
Especially when I am being a snot.

Why do you bother woth me when I am being such a snot?

for the same reason you do.

(Laughing;):)  I DON't 'T put up with me when I am being a snot.  I ream me out
reall good!

[H[2JI think I just realized something about my behavior in the last couple
of days.  Does it seem to you thtaat I have been testing you lots?

sec

I guess.  I hjaven't really had dtime to stop and look.  Have you?

Looking at it from as far outside as I can, it sorta looks that way.
Why else would I have any doubts about your accepting my surprise of
last night?  Why would I treat you so poorly?  Why rag on you and then
accept your answeres and reassurances so easily?  Almost like it is a 
profound relief when you give better answers than the ones that I want/.
Makes a sort of sick twisted sense to me.

I guess that means I have tpassed the tests?

More.  You proved that you are better at answering the tests than the
"correct" answers given by the test creator.  You are wonderful.  And
I am glad that you passed them so well.  AND I am sorry to keep putting
you through them.

Sec. pls.  I have to run to the bathroom...

[H[O2kJ[[HH[[2J2J
[H[2J[H[2JBeep?Remember the last?  Shall I resend it?

please.

OI'm just glad I passed.

Me too.

Did you make it to the bathroom in time?  We got confused in both trying
to clear the screen...

yes.  ywes we did.  i have to write a letter really quickly to parks and

rec to reserve the b.ball diamond and send the check.  
Shall we log off and you can come over and get me?

My very thought.  ILY.
