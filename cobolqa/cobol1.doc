2.0     MAJOR CHANGES IN COBOL V6


     2.1        DATA BASE CAPABILITY


     2.1.1      NEW FEATURES

     PROCEDURE DIVISION DML VERBS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE
     COBOL  COMPILER.   THESE  VERBS  ALLOW THE USER TO INTERFACE
     WITH THE DECSYSTEM-10 DATA BASE FACILITIES (DBMS-10) WITHOUT
     REQUIRING  THE USE OF A PRE-PROCESSOR.  FOR MORE INFORMATION
     SEE THE DBMS PROGRAMMER'S PROCEDURES  MANUAL  AND  THE  DBMS
     DATA BASE ADMINISTRATOR'S PROCEDURES MANUAL.

     NEW FEATURES IN COBOL VERSION 6 FOR THIS PURPOSE ARE:


          SCHEMA SECTION

                  THE DATA DIVISION SECTION IN  A  COBOL  PROGRAM
                  WHERE  THE  DATA  BASE SUB-SCHEMA IS "INVOKED".
                  THE  SCHEMA  SECTION  MUST  FOLLOW  IMMEDIATELY
                  AFTER  THE  DATA DIVISION HEADER, AND THERE MAY
                  ONLY BE ONE SCHEMA SECTION IN A PROGRAM.


          INVOKE

                  THE DATA DIVISION VERB USED TO  ESTABLISH  DATA
                  BASE  CAPABILITY  WITHIN  A  COBOL PROGRAM.  IT
                  SERVES THE PURPOSE  OF  ALLOCATING  THE  SYSTEM
                  COMMUNICATIONS LOCATIONS (SCL) AND DEFINING THE
                  RECORDS SPECIFIED IN THE SUB-SCHEMA.


          ACCESS

                  SAME AS INVOKE EXCEPT IS  FOR  SHARING  A  DATA
                  BASE  WITH  A  PROGRAM-UNIT  WHICH  HAS ALREADY
                  INVOKED IT.   CONCEPTUALLY  PLACES  RECORDS  IN
                  LINKAGE  SECTION  RATHER  THAN  WORKING-STORAGE
                  SECTION.


          CLOSE

                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION VERB  USED  TO  RELINQUISH
                  CONTROL  OVER THE SPECIFIED AREAS AND MAKE THEM
                  AVAILABLE  TO  OTHER  RUN-UNITS  WHICH  MAY  BE
                  DELAYED WAITING FOR THEM.


          DELETE
COBOL V6A(332) DOCUMENTATION                               Page 3


                  A  PROCEDURE  DIVISION  VERB  WHICH  MAKES  THE
                  OBJECT    RECORD    UNAVAILABLE   FOR   FURTHER
                  PROCESSING.


          FIND

                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION VERB WHICH  ESTABLISHES  A
                  PARTICULAR  RECORD  OCCURRENCE AS THE "CURRENT"
                  ONE.


          GET

                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION VERB USED TO TRANSFER  THE
                  CONTENTS  OF  THE  SPECIFIED  DATA  ITEM OF THE
                  OBJECT RECORD OCCURRENCE INTO THE USER  WORKING
                  AREA.


          INSERT

                  A VERB WHICH INCORPORATES  A  SPECIFIED  RECORD
                  OCCURRENCE  INTO  A NAMED SET, ACCORDING TO THE
                  SET MEMBERSHIP RESTRICTIONS WHICH WERE  DEFINED
                  IN THE DATA DEFINITION FILE.


          MODIFY

                  THE VERB USED TO REPLACE THE VALUES OF ALL,  OR
                  OF  SPECIFIC  DATA  ITEMS  OF THE OBJECT RECORD
                  OCCURRENCE IN THE DATABASE,  WITH  VALUES  FROM
                  THE USER WORKING AREA.


          OPEN

                  THIS VERB INITIALIZES AN  AREA  FOR  PROCESSING
                  AND SPECIFIES ITS USAGE MODE.


          REMOVE

                  THIS VERB CANCELS THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE  OBJECT
                  RECORD IN THE SPECIFIED SETS.


          STORE

                  THIS PROCEDURE DIVISION VERB ACQUIRES SPACE AND
                  A  DATABASE-KEY  FOR A NEW RECORD OCCURRENCE IN
                  THE DATABASE.
COBOL V6A(332) DOCUMENTATION                               Page 4


          USE IF ERROR-STATUS...

                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION  CLAUSE  USED  TO  SPECIFY
                  PROCEDURES   TO   BE  EXECUTED  WHEN  SPECIFIED
                  ERROR-STATUS CONDITIONS OCCUR.



     2.1.2      CONVERSION FROM PRE-PROCESSOR FORMAT

     ALL  COBOL  SOURCE  PROGRAMS  CAN  BE  CONVERTED  FROM   THE
     PRE-PROCESSOR  FORMAT  TO  THE STANDARD FORMAT QUITE EASILY.
     THE FOLLOWING MODIFICATIONS ARE THE ONLY ONES NECESSARY:


          1 )  INSERT "SCHEMA SECTION" IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FILE
          SECTION,  IF  PRESENT, AND THE DATA DIVISION HEADING IF
          NOT.


          2 )  MOVE   THE    "INVOKE"    STATEMENT    FROM    THE
          WORKING-STORAGE SECTION TO THE SCHEMA SECTION.


     USERS SHOULD  BE  AWARE  THAT  ANY  ERRORS  IN  AN  "INVOKE"
     STATEMENT  IMPLY  THAT  ALL  DATA DEFINITIONS IN THE INVOKED
     SUB-SCHEMA WILL NOT BE CREATED BY THE COMPILER.   THEREFORE,
     ANY  SUCH  ERROR  WILL  MOST  LIKELY  PRODUCE NUMEROUS OTHER
     ERRORS LATER IN THE PROCEDURE DIVISION.



     2.1.3      RESTRICTIONS

     IN THE PROCEDURE DIVISION STATEMENT,  "OPEN  AREA  <AREA-1>,
     <AREA-2>,..."  ,  THERE  IS A MAXIMUM OF TEN (10) AREA-NAMES
     ALLOWED IN ONE STATEMENT.  IF MORE THAN TEN AREAS ARE TO  BE
     OPENED  AT ONCE, THEN MORE THAN ONE "OPEN" COMMAND WILL HAVE
     TO BE ISSUED.

     2.2        COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITY


     COBOL V6  INCLUDES  THE  FACILITIES  TO  ALLOW  PROGRAMS  TO
     ACCESS,  PROCESS,  AND  CREATE MESSAGES OR PORTIONS THEREOF.
     THESE MESSAGES ARE USED  IN  CONJUNCTION  WITH  THE  MESSAGE
     CONTROL SYSTEM (MCS-10) TO COMMUNICATE WITH LOCAL AND REMOTE
     COMMUNICATION DEVICES.

     THESE FACILITIES  INCLUDE  SEVERAL  NEW  PROCEDURE  DIVISION
     VERBS AND ONE NEW DATA DIVISION STRUCTURE:



          COMMUNICATION SECTION

                  THE COMMUNICATION SECTION IS USED IN  THE  DATA
                  DIVISION  AND  HAS  THE  FUNCTION  OF LOGICALLY
                  GROUPING TOGETHER  ALL  INFORMATION  CONCERNING
                  THE STRUCTURE OF THE MESSAGE QUEUES.


          COMMUNICATION DESCRIPTION (CD)

                  THE CD IS A DATA STRUCTURE WHICH SPECIFIES  THE
                  INTERFACE  AREA  BETWEEN  MCS-10  AND  A  COBOL
                  PROGRAM.    IT   MAY   APPEAR   ONLY   IN   THE
                  COMMUNICATION SECTION OF THE DATA DIVISION.


          ACCEPT COUNT

                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION VERB  WHICH  PERFORMS  THE
                  FUNCTION  OF STORING, IN A SPECIFIED DATA ITEM,
                  THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN A  PARTICULAR  MESSAGE
                  QUEUE.


          DISABLE

                  A VERB WHICH NOTIFIES MCS-10  TO  INHIBIT  DATA
                  TRANSFER  BETWEEN  THE SPECIFIED MESSAGE QUEUES
                  AND  A   PARTICULAR   SOURCE   OR   DESTINATION
                  TERMINAL.


          ENABLE

                  A VERB WHICH  NOTIFIES  MCS-10  TO  ALLOW  DATA
                  TRANSFER  BETWEEN  THE SPECIFIED MESSAGE QUEUES
                  AND  A   PARTICULAR   SOURCE   OR   DESTINATION
                  TERMINAL.


          IF MESSAGE ...
COBOL V6A(332) DOCUMENTATION                               Page 6


                  A PROCEDURE DIVISION STATEMENT WHICH TESTS  THE
                  STATUS  OF  THE SPECIFIED QUEUES.  IF THE QUEUE
                  IS NON-EMPTY, THEN THE STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE
                  "IF    MESSAGE"    STATEMENT    ARE   EXECUTED.
                  OTHERWISE, CONTROL PASSES TO THE  NEXT  PROGRAM
                  SENTENCE.


          RECEIVE

                  A VERB  WHICH  MAKES  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  COBOL
                  PROGRAM   A  MESSAGE,  MESSAGE  SEGMENT,  OR  A
                  PORTION OF A MESSAGE OR SEGMENT, AND  PERTINENT
                  INFORMATION  ABOUT  THAT  DATA  FROM  A MESSAGE
                  QUEUE.  THE "RECEIVE" STATEMENT ALSO ALLOWS FOR
                  A  SPECIFIC IMPERATIVE STATEMENT TO BE EXECUTED
                  WHEN NO DATA IS AVAILABLE.


          SEND

                  A  VERB  WHICH  CAUSES  A  MESSAGE,  A  MESSAGE
                  SEGMENT,  OR  A PORTION OF A MESSAGE OR SEGMENT
                  TO BE RELEASED TO ONE  OR  MORE  OUTPUT  QUEUES
                  MAINTAINED BY MCS-10.

     2.3        TEXT EDITING FACILITIES

     TWO OTHER VERBS, STRING AND UNSTRING,  HAVE  BEEN  ADDED  TO
     COBOL  V6.   THESE VERBS CONFORM TO THE ANSI-73 STANDARD AND
     PROVIDE FAIRLY  POWERFUL  STRING  MANIPULATION  CAPABILITIES
     WHICH  CAN  BE USED WITH OR WITHOUT MCS-10.  THESE VERBS ARE
     STANDARD IN ALL COBOL V6 RELEASE TAPES.



          STRING

                  THE STRING STATEMENT PROVIDES CONCATENATION  OF
                  THE PARTIAL OR COMPLETE CONTENTS OF TWO OR MORE
                  DATA  ITEMS  INTO  A  SINGLE  DATA  ITEM.   THE
                  CONTENTS  OF  EACH  SOURCE  DATA  ITEM  MAY  BE
                  DELIMITED EITHER BY A LITERAL, BY THE  SIZE  OF
                  THE  ITEM ITSELF, OR BY THE CONTENTS OF ANOTHER
                  DATA ITEM.  ALSO, THE STRING STATEMENT HAS  THE
                  FACILITY  FOR  PASSING  CONTROL  TO A SPECIFIED
                  IMPERATIVE STATEMENT ON THE CONDITION  OF  DATA
                  OVERFLOW.


          UNSTRING

                  THE UNSTRING STATEMENT CAUSES  CONTIGUOUS  DATA
                  IN  A  SOURCE  FIELD TO BE SEPARATED AND PLACED
                  INTO   MULTIPLE   DESTINATION   FIELDS.    THIS
                  STATEMENT  ALSO PROVIDES FACILITIES WHICH ALLOW
                  THE USER TO  ACCESS  THE  DELIMITING  CHARACTER
                  STRING  AND  TEXT  LENGTH  FOR EACH DESTINATION
                  DATA ITEM, THE COUNT OF DESTINATION ITEMS ACTED
                  UPON,  AND THE CHARACTER POSITION OF THE SOURCE
                  ITEM AT WHICH  THE  UNSTRING  OPERATION  IS  TO
                  BEGIN.
COBOL V6A(332) DOCUMENTATION                               Page 8


     2.4        MINOR ENHANCEMENTS


     2.4.1      THE ASCII  CHARACTER  LEFT  BRACKET  "["  IS  NOW
     ASSIGNED  THE  NUMERIC VALUE "+0".  ALSO, THE CHARACTERS "!"
     AND "]" HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS OVERPUNCH CHARACTERS WITH  THE
     VALUE "-0".

     2.4.2      PRELIMINARY OVERLAY FACILITY


     A PRELIMINARY LINK-10 OVERLAY FEATURE HAS BEEN  INCLUDED  IN
     COBOL  V6A.   FOR DOCUMENTATION SEE CHAPTER 5 OF THE LINK-10
     MANUAL IN SOFTWARE NOTEBOOK NUMBER 5.  THIS TYPE OF  OVERLAY
     IS SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS:

          1.  NO IO IS PERMITTED IN AN OVERLAY SUBROUTINE.

          2.  IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE BY LIBOL  TO  EXPAND  THE  IO
          BUFFER  AREA  INTO  THE  OVERLAY  AREA THE PROGRAM WILL
          TERMINATE WITH AN ERROR MESSAGE.  MOST BUFFER SPACE  IS
          ALLOCATED  AT RESET TIME.  ONLY SORT AND SOMETIMES ISAM
          FILES, WHEN ENOUGH WRITES ARE PERFORMED TO CREATE A NEW
          INDEX  LEVEL,  MAY REQUEST SPACE DYNAMICALLY.  THE USER
          MUST  ALLOCATE  SUFFICIENT  CORE  SPACE,  VIA  THE  THE
          LINK-10  /SPACE SWITCH, TO ACCOMMODATE THE PROGRAM'S IO
          BUFFERS AND ANY SORT IO BUFFERS AT LOAD TIME.

          3.  IF A CALL FOR AN OVERLAY  CAUSES  THE  END  OF  THE
          OVERLAY  AREA  TO EXTEND INTO THE SORT CORE BUFFER AREA
          THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE WITH AN ERROR MESSAGE.  NOTE
          -  THE  SORT CORE BUFFER AREA IS RELEASED AT THE END OF
          THE SORT.

     TO AVOID ANY CORE CONFLICTS THE USER MAY CHOOSE TO:

     1.  NOT WRITE INTO AN ISAM FILE AND

     2.  NOT CALL, WHILE A SORT  IS  IN  PROGRESS,  A  SUBROUTINE
     WHICH IS NOT IN THE ROOT SEGMENT.

     2.5        BUG FIXES

                    BUGS FIXES  NUMBERS  2.5.1  THRU  2.5.56  ARE
                    INCLUDED  IN  CURRENT  VERSION  6.  BUG FIXES
                    FROM 2.5.57 ON ARE IN VERSION 6A.

3.0     EXTERNAL CHANGES AND OPTIONS



     3.1        FEATURE TEST SWITCHES


     TWO NEW FEATURE TEST SWITCHES HAVE BEEN ADDED:   "DBMS"  AND
     "MCS".   IF  EITHER  OF THESE IS SET TO 1 IN COBASM.MAC, THE
     CORRESPONDING FACILITIES WILL BE ASSEMBLED INTO COBOL  V6  .
     HOWEVER, BOTH OF THESE FACILITIES REQUIRE THEIR OWN RUN-TIME
     SUPPORT MODULE WHICH IS SUPPLIED AS A SEPARATE PRODUCT.

     THE STRING AND UNSTRING VERBS ARE CONTROLLED BY  THE  SWITCH
     "STRING".  THIS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON;  OTHERWISE, THE RESULTS
     OF THE ASSEMBLY MAY BE UNPREDICTABLE.  THE DEFAULT VALUE FOR
     THIS FEATURE TEST SWITCH IS ALWAYS "ON".



     3.2        NEW MODULES


     THERE ARE FOUR NEW MODULES IN THE COBOL COMPILER FOR VERSION
     6.   TWO  OF  THESE  MODULES ARE CONCERNED WITH DBMS-10, ONE
     WITH STRING/UNSTRING, AND ONE WITH MCS-10.  THE NEW  MODULES
     ARE AS FOLLOWS:


          DBDML

               A MODULE USED DURING PHASE C OF THE  SYNTAX  SCAN.
               THIS  MODULE  READS THE SCHEMA DEFINITION FILE AND
               MODIFIES THE SOURCE SCAN SO THAT THE DBMS-10  DATA
               DEFINITIONS ARE CORRECTLY SET UP.  THE ACTUAL WORK
               IS DONE BY THE ROUTINES  DMLVOK,  DMLVIO,  DMLERR,
               DMLIO.
                 ALSO STRLIB.REL (AND  STRING.UNV)  ARE  USED  BY
               THIS  MODULE.  STRLIB IS ACCESSED EXCLUSIVELY AS A
               .REL  FILE  AND  CAN  BE  REBUILT  ONLY  BY  USING
               STRLIB.CTL.   IF STRLIB.REL MUST BE CHANGED DURING
               THE PROCESS OF REBUILDING COBOL, STRLIB.CTL SHOULD
               BE RUN BEFORE COBOL.CTL IS SUBMITTED.


          DBGETF

               A DBMS-10 ROUTINE WHICH INITIALIZES THE PROCESSING
               OF  THE VARIOUS TEMPORARY FILES WHICH WERE CREATED
               BY "DML".


          STRGEN

               THE PHASE E ROUTINE WHICH GENERATES THE  CODE  FOR

4.0     INTERNAL CHANGES



          4.1     COBOLK HAS BEEN CHANGED SO THAT THE DATA  TABLE
                  (DATAB)  AND  THE CONSTANT-VALUE TABLE (VALTAB)
                  ARE PRINTED IN ENGLISH INSTEAD OF BINARY.  THIS
                  MODIFICATION SHOULD MAKE READING THE DATA TABLE
                  AND INTERPRETING DUMPS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE.


          4.2     ALL SYNTAX TREES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR
                  RESPECTIVE   PHASES   INTO   INDIVIDUAL  SOURCE
                  MODULES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE OLD "COBOLC.MAC" HAS
                  BEEN    SEPARATED    INTO    "COBOLC.MAC"   AND
                  "CTREE.MAC".  EACH OF THESE SYNTAX TREES IS NOW
                  PLACED  INTO  "COBOLL.REL" SO THAT IT IS LOADED
                  WITH THE APPROPRIATE COMPILER PHASE.


          4.3     IN THE DEBUG VERSION OF THE COMPILER, THE TRACE
                  OF  THE  PHASE D SYNTAX TREE CAN BE SELECTIVELY
                  CONTROLLED BY THE "TRACE ON"  AND  "TRACE  OFF"
                  STATEMENTS.  IF THE "TP" SWITCH IS GIVEN AND NO
                  "TRACE OFF" APPEARS IN THE PROCEDURE  DIVISION,
                  THEN  THE ENTIRE PROCEDURE DIVISION SYNTAX SCAN
                  IS TRACED.


          4.4     FIVE NEW PARAMETER FILES (PURAB.MAC, PUREC.MAC,
                  PURED.MAC,   PUREE.MAC,  PURFG.MAC)  HAVE  BEEN
                  ADDED  TO  ELIMINATE  TERMINAL   INPUT   DURING
                  ASSEMBLY   OF  THE  PURE  AREAS.   THESE  FILES
                  CONTAIN ONLY ONE PARAMETER DEFINITION.


          4.5     ALL  COBOL  ASSEMBLY   PARAMETERS   HAVE   BEEN
                  COLLECTED  INTO  ONE  FILE CALLED "COBASM.MAC".
                  USERS SHOULD  INSERT  ALL  THEIR  FEATURE  TEST
                  SWITCH DEFINITIONS INTO THIS FILE.


          4.6     THE PROCESSING OF SCHEMA  FILES  IS  NO  LONGER
                  SEQUENTIAL.     DBMS    STYLE   PAGE   ORIENTED
                  PROCESSING IS NOW USED.
