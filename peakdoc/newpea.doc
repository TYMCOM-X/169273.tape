

	    New and Improved features in PEAK Version 1.1


NEW FEATURES:

New commands:

        ^X ! ([Recover Checkpoint File]) to recover an edit (for
             instance, after a system crash) to the point at which it has
             been checkpointed.

        New functions not bound to a key:

	  [Repeat Query Change]
	    Repeat the last query-change command, using the same search
	    and replacement strings.

	  [Increment Char]
	    Increment the ASCII value of the character after the point.

	  [Decrement Char]
	    Decrement the ASCII value of the character after the point.

	  [Indent Line Up]
	    Create a new line before the current one, indented to the
	    same indent level as the current one.

	  [Indent Column Down]
	    Create a new line after the current one, indented to the
	    current column position.  (Useful in comments.)

IMPROVEMENTS:

Improved commands:

	New prompts are provided when a kill operation will overflow
        the kill buffer, including the new feature of killing just
        what will fit in the kill buffer.

	A number of prompts have been modified to provide more feedback.

	Arguments now work with ^X > and ^X <.

	[Center Line] now deletes trailing whitespace before centering
        the line, and leaves the cursor at the end of the line.

	ESC ^J ([Right Justify Line]) now deletes trailing whitespace.

	ESC = ([Show Search String]) now displays both single- and
        multiple-search strings.

Improved features:

        PEAK now will accept long filenames and unusual usernames.

	Temporary "(Scratch)" buffers do not count towards the
	modified-buffer count anymore.

	Text-Mode insertion now obeys the prevailing level of indention.

Terminal support:

        Redisplay on Tym425 changed to minimize repainting the screen.

	Ti940 Terminal support for speeds <= 1200 baud added.

        A1200 terminal support removed.

BUGS:

        Numerous miscellaneous bugs fixed.
