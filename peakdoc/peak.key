        DELETE                  Delete character to left of point.

----------
* Setting a repeat count generally causes the next command to be repeated
  that many times.  However, it is used to pass numeric arguments into
  some commands.  For example ^U10X inserts 10 X's, but ^U5^X_TABWIDTH$
  sets the width of a <TAB> to 5 spaces.

Environment Variables.
----------------------

  The values of certain variables and flags effect various commands.
These variables, called "environment" variables, are available through
the ^X = (query) and ^X _ (assign) commands.  The "assign" command
assigns the value of the argument to the variable.

    Multiplier            4        Default for "Argument" command.
    OverWriteOnInsert     0        When nonzero, over write.
    RightMargin          72        Margin control in "text" mode.
    SwapPMRegion          0        If zero, location of point does not
                                    change after indent  and unindent region,
                                    insert file and "yank".
    TabWidth              8        Controls tab stops.
    UseTabs               1        Controls use of TAB in indent commands.
                                     Will change spaces to TABs where
                                     possible if nonzero.
                                   Inserts spaces for TAB when zero.
    WrapLongLines         1        When nonzero, long lines will wrap.
    VariableFill          0        When nonzero, argument to "fill
                                     paragraph" sets right margin,
                                     instead of setting repeat count.

Information Strings
-------------------

The following information strings are available; ^X I <I-Str> will 
insert the string in the file.

        Date                    Present date as dd-mmm-yy (29-Nov-82)
	Time                    Current time as hh:mm:ss (17:15:19)
	Username                Logged in username in uppercase (LOIS)
