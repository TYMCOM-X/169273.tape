	PRUNE.MOD
[uncensored] change proposals and interface comments about PRUNE.

NOTICE:	Don't change anyone elses comments, please.  In fact, don't
	change your own, someone else might just agree and not comment,
	so a retraction would probably more helpful.  It is fine to add
	comments wherever applicable in here, rather than sticking to
	the bottom.

SDD	Don't rewrite PRUNE.DAT if no changes were made.

SG	Provide means of moving file comments from one PRUNE.DAT to
	another along with a file (not necessarily automatic)

SG	^X is a bad choice ... it also happens to ZAP CIRCUIT when
	running with AUXIO.
SDD	Any suggestions readers?  [not ESC]

SG	Command syntax needs improvement. ... PREFIX should be POSTFIX?

SG	Method to edit a comment?
SDD	Wanted to, but what conventions?

SG	Should be able to specify a subset of comment field [eg F "FOO"]
SDD	[discussion] how about each file has a "tag" [6-char], which is
	not part of comment.  (I don't want comments to be file names)

SG	Sort of EXT, NAME seems backwards
