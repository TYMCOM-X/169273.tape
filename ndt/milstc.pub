Milestone Description:  
Multiple-width strings fully integrated into SAIL.  Compiler and runtime
support available.  Release of Field-test version of Multiple Width 
version of SAIL.

Completion Criterion:  
This is the final Multiple Width Strings milestones.  All code for the 
project is completed, and a compiler which purports to perform the task
is released (perhaps on FTSYS).  Language features are imbedded in the
compiler and runtimes, rather than as separate modules on SAILIB.
