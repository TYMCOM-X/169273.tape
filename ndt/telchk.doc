
TELCHK reads all then TELECOPY .COM and .OUT file pairs from your GFD'ed
directory and makes a summary of them.  When the files are read, they 
are either deleted or made into temporary files.  The normal behavior 
is to make them temporaries which will go away when you next GFD or log
off.  The results are written to a LOG file (which can be the terminal).
It is careful to make sure the names are of the appropriate form (three
decimal digits followed by "TEL" for the file name), in order to avoid
removing your files "PASTEL.COM" and "PASTEL.OUT".

Switches: /DELETE       delete the .COM and .OUT files as they are read
          /TEMPORIZE    convert them to temporary files
          /NOCHANGE     don't you dare touch those files!
          /APPEND       append the results to the log file
          /SUPERCEDE    always make a new log file
          /CONFIRM      (default) if the log file exists,
                                ask about supercede/append
If started in CCL mode, this behaves like TELCHK.LOG/APPEND, but will
just exit if it cannot do the append.

    For successful transfers, the output produces one line per file 
transferred.  If anything TELCHK did not expect occurs in the output 
file, it flags it with an arrow, (since it expects you want to know 
about it).  Some such things are license transfer failures, host not
available, and so on.  By the way, a completely blank line means to
put output to the terminal, and turn the .COM and .OUT files into 
temporary files.

A sample run: (Notice the arrows on the unexpected lines)
