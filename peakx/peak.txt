BASIC INFORMATION

    This is a brief guide to the screen editor PEAK.  For every PEAK
    command there is a short description followed by the PEAK function
    name enclosed in brackets.  The commands are grouped by topic.

Other Documentation

    Other available documentation include (sysnews)peak.key which
    contains a list of commands by key bindings and (sysnews)peak.cht
    which is a chart (132 characters wide) of bindable keys with the
    PEAK default function bindings.  Peak.cht can be printed out or
    copied to your directory and used to keep track of additional
    bindings.

Naming Conventions

    In this guide "^" means to hold the CONTROL key down while typing
    the next character, "ESC" means to type the ESCAPE key and then the
    next character.  Portions of commands in brackets are optional.

PEAK Tutorial

    The on-line tutorial, (sysnews)peak.tut, is designed for the new PEAK
    user.  To use the tutorial, type "peak (sysnews)peak.tut" (for monitors
    previous to "L", type "r peak" and then "^X ^R (sysnews)peak.tut".)

Use of PEAK

    PEAK is intended for Tymshare internal use only.

Accessing PEAK

    PEAK is accessible by the monitor command 'PEAK'.  The complete
    command is PEAK [filename] [/Pn] [/Ln] [/Cn] [/R] [/N] where /Pn,
    /Ln and /Cn specify the page, line and character number on which to
    start editing, /R will read in the file "Read Only" (no modification
    allowed),and /N will not delete nulls in the file.

    The monitor command 'PEAK' is not available in monitors previous to
    P034L.  To set up PEAK as a default editor on a system with an
    earlier monitor, see the instructions on page 17.
    
Terminal Type

    If you do not have tty class set, PEAK will ask for your terminal
    type.  If you are not sure what your terminal type is, typing "?"
    at the "Terminal type?"  prompt will give a list of supported
    terminals.  (To set your terminal type see page 17.)

PEAK COMMANDS

Moving Around - Basic Cursor Movement

    ^F              Move forward                                  [Forward]
    ^B              Move backward                                [Backward]
    ^A              Move to beginning of line           [Beginning of Line]
    ^E              Move to end of line                       [End of Line]
    ^N              Move to next line                                [Down]
    ^P              Move to previous line                              [Up]
    ESC F           Move forward over token                 [Forward Token]
    ESC B           Move backward over token               [Backward Token]

    You can think of a "token" as being a word or a number.  To have other
    characters included with the word or number, define them as tokens or
    numbers with the "Is Token" or "Is Number" command (see page 10).
    Your "peak.ini" file is a good place to define token characters.

    ESC {           Move to top of page                       [Top of Page]
    ESC }           Move to bottom of page                 [Bottom of Page]

Moving Around in the Window

    Unless you have split the screen into two windows (see page 5), 
    "window" is synonymous with "screen" in the following commands.

    ESC ,           Move to top of window                   [Top of Window]
    ESC .           Move to end of window                [Bottom of Window]
    ^V              Move to next window                    [Forward Window]
    ESC V           Move to previous window               [Backward Window]
    ^Z              Scroll window up                     [Scroll Window Up]
    ESC Z           Scroll window down                 [Scroll Window Down]
    ESC !           Move line to top of window      [Line to Top of Window]

Moving Around in the Buffer

    ESC <           Move to top of buffer                   [Top of Buffer]
    ESC >           Move to bottom of buffer             [Bottom of Buffer]

    PEAK does not edit the file itself; it reads the file into a buffer and
    all editing is done there.

Setting the Argument

    ^U [n]          Set argument to n (default 4)                [Argument]

    (See the detailed explanation on page 14)
PEAK Reference Guide               Version 2.0                       Page 3

   
Setting "Marks"

    ESC <space>     Set a "mark" in the buffer                   [Set Mark]

    Up to ten marks can be set.  All mark commands can be given an argument
    to specify which mark will be referenced by the command.  For example,
    "ESC <space>" sets mark 0, "^U 5 ESC <space>" sets mark 5.

    ESC G           Go to a mark                                [Goto Mark]
    ^X S            Exchange the point and mark                 [Swap Mark]

    "Point" is the present position of the cursor.

    ESC X Clear Mark ESC
                    Clear mark                                 [Clear Mark]
Deleting

    ^D              Delete character                               [Delete]
    ^H              Delete previous character             [Delete Backward]
    ESC D           Delete token                     [Delete Token Forward]
    ESC H           Delete previous token           [Delete Token Backward]
    ^K              Kill line                                   [Kill Line]
    ESC K           Kill to end of line                 [Kill Partial Line]

    ^K kills the line from point to end of line including the crlf at the
    end of the line, ESC K kills either the line from point to end of line,
    or the crlf.  Note:  ESC K will not kill a form feed, ^K will.  Giving
    ESC K a large argument will kill to the end of the page and stop there.

    ^W              Kill to a mark                            [Wipe Region]
    ^Y              Recover killed text                [Insert Kill Buffer]

    All text killed by successive kill commands will be in the kill buffer.
    After issuing any other command, or inserting any character, a
    subsequent kill operation will delete the previous contents of the kill
    buffer and replace it with the most recent kill.

    To append a subsequent kill to the kill buffer, give the following
    command before doing the kill:

    ESC X Set Append Kill ESC     Append next kill to kill buffer
                                                          [Set Append Kill]

    If the amount of text killed will overflow the size of the kill
    buffer PEAK will prompt you as to what action to take.  "A(bort)" will
    cancel the kill, "P(roceed)" will wipe out all of the text, and
    "S(ave)" will wipe out exactly the amount of text that will fit in the
    kill buffer.  Note you only have to type a single letter response and
    PEAK will fill in the rest of the word for you.

Inserting

    All normally printing characters insert themselves when typed.  This
    includes RETURN and TAB.  To insert any other character you must
    "quote" it by preceeding it with ^Q.
        
    ^Q              Insert the next character                       [Quote]

Searching/Replacing

    ESC S           Search                                         [Search]
    ESC R           Reverse search                         [Reverse Search]

    The complete command is "ESC S <string> ESC".

    ^S              Repeat last search                       [Search Again]
    ^R              Repeat last reverse search       [Reverse Search Again]

    ESC M           Multiple string search                [Multiple Search]

    "ESC M <string1> ESC <string2> ESC ... <stringn> ESC ESC" is the 
    complete command; n is any number up to 10.  You can repeat the search
    with "ESC M ESC".

    ESC =           Show search String                 [Show Search String]
    ESC )           Search for matching close parenthesis    [Match Parens]
    ESC (           Reverse search for matching open parenthesis 
                                                             [Match Parens]
    ESC X Copy to Search ESC
                    Copy region from point to mark into search string
                                                           [Copy to Search]

Substitution

    ESC C           Change                                         [Change]

    The complete command is "ESC C <string1> ESC <string2> ESC".

    ESC Q           Query change                             [Query Change]

    Responses to the query change command are: "Y","y", or <space> - yes,
    change this string;  "." - change this string and stop; "^G" - stop.
    Any other character continues searching without replacing the target 
    string.
    
    ESC X Repeat Query Change ESC
                    Repeat last query change          [Repeat Query Change]

    Note that an argument to a substitution command is a repeat count (see
    page 14); however, the default is to repeat execution of the command
    until the end of the file rather than a single execution.

    ESC I           Indent a line (add leading whitespace)    [Indent Line]
    ESC U           Unindent a line (remove leading whitespace) 
                                                            [Unindent Line]
    ESC X Indent Region ESC 
                    Indent region from point to mark 0      [Indent Region]
    ESC X Unindent Region ESC  
                    Unindent region from point to mark 0  [Unindent Region]

    Indentation width for these four commands is set by the environment
    variable IndentWidth; variable SwapPMRegion determines the
    location of the point after the region commands (see page 12).

    ESC X Force Left Margin ESC
                    Indent line to the column specified by the argument
                                                        [Force Left Margin]
    If no argument is given, the value of the left margin is used.

    ^J              Start new line at current indentation 
                                                    [Open Line with Indent]

    ^X ^U           Recover last checkpoint            [Recover Checkpoint]

    You can force a checkpoint by ^X ^S, and then edit, knowing you can 
    return to the state of the file at the checkpoint by ^X ^U.  The file
    will be automatically checkpointed if there have been no changes for 
    the number of seconds set as the checkpoint interval, or if you move
    to another file in the buffer chain.

Manipulating Windows

    ^X 2            Use 2 windows                            [Split Window]

Fill Commands

    ESC P           Fill paragraph                         [Fill Paragraph]
    ESC X Fill Line ESC
                    Fill Line                                   [Fill Line]
    ESC X Fill to End of Paragraph ESC
                    Fill from point to end of paragraph
                                                 [Fill to End of Paragraph]

    ESC P fills the paragraph using the current left and right margins.
    "Fill" will reformat the text of the paragraph so that the maximum
    number of words possible appears on each successive line.

    The indentation of the first line of the paragraph in relation to the
    second line of the paragraph will be preserved in filling.  This
    enables the use of crowns.

    The environment variable VariableFill will determine the location of
    the point upon completion of ESC P, and also the result of giving an
    argument to the command.  If the value of VariableFill is 0, an
    argument to ESC P will be a repeat count, and the point will be on the
    beginning of the line after the last paragraph filled after execution
    of the command.  This is the default.

    If VariableFill is non zero, an argumenl set the right margin and
    the point will be following the last character of the current paragraph
    after execution of the command.  This makes successive filling of the
    same paragraph with different right margins easy to accomplish.

    ESC X Fill to End of Paragraph ESC will fill from the point to the end
    of the current paragraph (ESC P fills from the beginning of the
    paragraph to the end of the paragraph).  The value of VariableFill
    determines the behavior of arguments and the location of the point upon
    completion in the same way as ESC P.

    ESC X Fill Line ESC will fill to the end of the current line.

Setting Margins

    ESC X Set Right Margin ESC
                   Set right margin at point or to value of argument
                                                         [Set Right Margin]
    ESC X Set Left Margin ESC
                   Set left margin at point or to value of argument
                                                          [Set Left Margin]

    Margins are used for "text" mode, fill, justify, and center commands.
    Margins may also be set by the environment variables RightMargin and
    LeftMargin (see page 12).

Macros and Key Bindings

    ^X D            Define a macro                           [Define Macro]
    ^X E            Define a macro by example     [Define Macro by Example]
    ^X X            Execute current macro                   [Execute Macro]
    ^X M            Bind macro to key                          [Bind Macro]

    Keyboard macros can be defined in two ways.  The command "^X D" allows
    you to define a macro before it is executed.  The first character you
    type will be the delimiter which will be used at the end to terminate
    the definition of the macro.  The command line at the bottom of the 
    screen will display your macro as you type it in, and you can edit it 
    with ^H if necessary.  To include a ^H in your macro you will have to 
    "quote" it with ^Q.

    The command "^X E" will define a macro to be all the commands you 
    execute until you type a ^G.

    To save the macro for later use it can either be bound to a key using 
    "^X M" or can be "named" to a name of your choice using the command
    "ESC X Name Macro ESC name ESC". 

    The present macro can be executed by "^X X".  A bound macro can be 
    executed by using the bound key, and a named macro is executed in the 
    same manner as an unbound function, using "ESC X name ESC".  Arguments
    work as expected.  Execution of the macro is aborted at the end of the 
    file.

    ESC X Unbind Key ESC key
                    Remove most recent macro binding to key   [Unbind Key]
    ESC X Unname Macro ESC name
                    Remove most recent macro binding to name
                                                            [Unname Macro]

    When a macro is bound to a key, the previous binding of the key is
    remembered.  If you then unbind the key using "ESC X Unbind Key ESC
    key" the old binding is restored.  Similarly named macros can be
    unnamed with "ESC X Unname Macro ESC name ESC".

    A bound macro can be displayed in the message line by "^X ?".

    ^X B            Bind function to key                    [Bind Function]
    ^X [            Push key binding onto stack              [Push Binding]

Defining Special Characters

    ESC X is special ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "special" character 
    ESC X not special ESC <char> ESC
                    <char> is no longer "special"

    These two commands define (or cancel definitions) for use with the
    following two special character search commands.

Special Character Searching

    ESC ;           Search for "special" character         [Special Search]
    ESC :           Reverse "special" search       [Reverse Special Search]

Defining Tokens

    The following definitions apply to ESC B, ESC F, ESC H and ESC D
    commands:

    ESC X is delim ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as a delimiter, which is the opposite
                    of a "token" for these commands.
    ESC X is number ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "number".                    
    ESC X is token ESC <char> ESC
                    Defines <char> as "token".                    
    ESC X not delim ESC <char> ESC
                    <char> no longer a delimter.
    ESC X not number ESC <char> ESC
                    <char> no longer a "number".
    ESC X not token ESC <char> ESC
                    <char> no longer a "token".

Executing Functions by Name

    ESC X           Execute a function by name           [Execute Function]

    The complete form is "ESC X <function name> ESC".  Only enough letters
    of the function name need to typed to make that function unique.  If
    you do not type enough to make it unique, the error message "is
    ambiguous" will appear on the message line, otherwise the function name
    will be completed when you type the final ESC.

    All functions in PEAK have a function name.  The function names have
    been given in brackets for all commands.  Some functions are not bound
    to keys, and must be accessed by name.  They are listed on the
    following page.

    Any of the unbound functions can be bound to a key using the "^X B"
    command.  If an unbound function is used frequently, it can be bound
    to a key in your "peak.ini" file (see page 15).

Auxiliary Circuits

    ESC X Creaux ESC
                    Build aux circuit and record into buffer       [Creaux]

    ESC X Creaux ESC will build an auxiliary circuit to the specified
    username:system.  It defaults to the current system and logged in
    username.  The login must be a legal TYMNET login, or the circuit will
    be zapped.  All output of the aux circuit session will be recorded in
    the current buffer.  Logging out will zap the circuit, and the output
    then may be edited.

    ESC X Set Creaux Esc Char ESC
                    Set aux circuit escape character  [Set Creaux Esc Char]

    Redefine the Creaux escape character.  The complete command is 
    ESC X Set Creaux Esc Char ESC <char>.  The PEAK default definition for
    the Creaux escape character is ^X.

    There are three special commands for use during an aux circuit session,
    all of which are preceeded by the Creaux escape character:

    <esc char> Q    Quit from aux circuit session, but retain circuit.

    <esc char> Z    Zap the aux circuit.

    <esc char> C    Change the Creaux escape character - the next character
                    received will be the new value.

    After quitting from an aux circuit session with ^X Q, a subsequent
    command to create an aux circuit with ESC X Creaux ESC will resume
    the previous aux circuit session.

    To send the character defined as the Creaux escape character through it
    is sent twice:

    <esc char> <esc char>  Send the escape character through.

FURTHER INFORMATION AND EXPLANATIONS

Setting the Argument

    Every command is passed a numeric argument which, unless set
    explicity, is zero.  The argument usually sets the repeat count for
    the command (the default of zero causes a single execution of the
    command).

    For some commands the argument will pass a value to the command.  The
    argument for commands dealing with marks is used to specify which of
    the ten marks to use.  The argument with the fill commnds will set
    the right margin if the value of the VariableFill environment
    variable is non zero (see page 8).  An argument to the ^X _
    command will set the value of the envrionment variable specified.

    To set the argument type ^U followed by a number.  The next command
    typed will be passed that number.  If no number is typed a default
    "multiplier" will be used.  The default value of the multiplier is 4.
    Hence the command string ^U10^F will send the argument 10 to ^F,
    which in turn will cause it to move forward over 10 characters.  The
    string ^U^F would send the default argument of 4.

    The current value of the argument will be displayed on the message
    line when the ^U command is given.  For example, the default
    number of 4 will be shown when ^U is typed.  If ^U is followed
    by the number 10, the message line will then display "Arg: 10".

    Arguments can be multiplied.  If an argument is passed to ^U it
    will multiply it against the next argument given.  The string
    ^U10^U3^N first sends an argument of 10 to ^U, which multiplies
    that against 3, and passes 30 to ^N, which will then move down
    30 lines.  Likewise, ^U^U^N will move down 16 lines.

    The multiplier may be changed to some number other than 4 by using
    the assign environment variable command "Un^X _ Multiplier ESC".

Peak.ini

    When PEAK starts up it looks for a file named "PEAK.INI" on your
    logged in directory (NOT the GFD'd directory) for special
    initialization commands.  A PEAK.INI should start by locking the file
    so that stray characters in PEAK.INI won't cause inadvertent
    modifications to the buffer.  PEAK.INI must end by unlocking the file
    if it has been locked, with NO carriage return following.

    A sample PEAK.INI, which sets the indentation width to 6, defines a
    macro to go to the top of the next page, and binds the macro to
    Meta-N and Meta-n, is:

        ^X-
        ^X| Lock file |

        ^X| Sample PEAK.INI |

        ^X| set the indentation width to 6 |
        ^U6^X_IndentWidth$

        ^X| define a macro to get to the top of the next page |
        ^Xd/$}^N/

        ^X| bind the macro to Meta-N and Meta-n |
        ^Xm$N
        ^Xm$n

        ^X| Unlock file|
        ^X+             

    NOTE:  There is NO carriage return at the end of the last line.

Backup Files

    PEAK will write a file with the extension "bak" for each file you
    edit.  When you write out your edited buffer with either ^X^W or
    ^X^F, PEAK renames the original file to <filename>.bak, after
    deleting the old <filename>.bak (if one exists), and then writes 
    out the current edit.

    Thus the .bak file normally will contain a copy of the file before 
    you began the current edit.  However, if you write out the file in
    the middle of your edit with a ^X^W, the .bak file will contain
    the file at the state of the previous write.

    Should you be editing more than one file with the same name (but 
    different extensions) read into different buffers, the .bak file
    will contain a backup for only one of the files.

Status and Message Lines

    The status line at the bottom of the editing window gives the following
    information:  Editor name  Version number (Terminal type  Major mode
    [+],  [Wrap]  [Over])  [<]  File name  [>]  - Cursor position in file -
    [*]  [$]  [Mail.]  with:
        Major mode  Text or Normal
        +           Executed peak.ini
        Wrap        Wrap flag set
        Over        Overwrite flag set
        <           Previous buffer(s) exist in buffer chain
        >           Subsequent buffer(s) exist in buffer chain
        *           Buffer modified flag
        $           File read only
        Mail.       XEXEC mail waiting

    Cursor position is given in percent of file before the cursor, or
    Top or Bottom.

    Below the status line, the message line gives prompts and information
    from PEAK.

Continuing PEAK after Attaching to Detached Job

    If you are dropped in the middle of an edit, have detach-on-disconnect
    set and it was not a host crash, you can continue your edit without
    losing anything when you are able to log in again.  Attach to your
    detached job, ESC (or ^C if you are in PDP10 mode), continue, and
    then ^L.  The ^L not only refreshes the screen, but also will reset 
    your terminal characteristics for the duration of the edit.

Recovery from Checkpoint

    If the system crashes in the middle of the edit, and there is a 
    checkpoint file, you can recover your edit to the point of the
    checkpoint.  (If you have just lost your line, and have a detached
    job, proceed as above to recover all your edit).

    Check your directory for the checkpoint file, which will be of the
    form 003PEA.001, where 003 is your old job number, and 001 is the
    buffer number.  It is wise at this point to check your present job
    number (by the command "who.")  and if you should have the same job
    number you MUST rename the checkpoint file to another name before
    attempting recovery.

    It is usually a good idea to rename the checkpoint file to something
    easier to remember.  Then invoke PEAK by either the command "peak" or
    "r peak" (for monitors K and earlier).  Immediately upon entering
    PEAK give the command "^X !".  PEAK will prompt for the checkpoint
    file name.  Your old edit will then be restored to the point at which
    it was checkpointed.

SETTING UP PEAK AS DEFAULT EDITOR:

    PEAK can be set up as the default editor on a system by:

      -ctest addpro editor=(sys)peak  

    You can now access PEAK with 

      -ed <filename>

    or

      -mod <filename>

    If you want to make this permanent give the following command after
    the first ctest command:

      -ctest makini

    This will create a file "rpg.ini" on your directory which will be read 
    to set up the editor when you give a command.

    Once PEAK is set up as the default editor, the file name is remembered
    for subsequent editing or compiling commands.

SETTING UP TERMINAL TYPE:

    So PEAK will not ask for your terminal type you can type

      -tty class <terminal type>

    where terminal type is one of those PEAK recognizes.  To get a list
    of supported terminal types, type a "?" at the Terminal type? prompt
    from PEAK.

SWITCHES:

    If PEAK is set up as a default editor, the file switches can be given
    by using "%" instead of "/".  For example

      -mod foo%p6

    would read in file "foo" and place you at page 6 of the file.

EDITOR:

    PLEASE NOTE:  If PEAK is set up as the default editor, commands that
    normally access the editor EDITOR will all go to PEAK.  In order to
    use EDITOR the user will have to enter

      -r editor

    and then use APPEND or READ to create or modify a file.  Since these
    commands do not bring the file identifier into EDITOR, the file must
    be then written out with the file name specified using WRITE, or EXIT.
