.synopsis
Concatenates text files quickly.
.syntax
FCAT outfile=infile1,infile2,...,infilen
FCAT outfile=infile1,infile2,...,infilen/VERBOSE
.description
Concatenates input files in a low overhead manner to produce output
file.  Output file is deleted if it previously existed.  A side
effect of the low overhead copy is embedded null characters (ASCII 0)
between input files to pad out the pages.  Optionally, /VERBOSE (or
/V) may be added to end of command to generate progress reports on
terminal.

If any input file name is preceded with an atsign ("@"), that file is
assumed to contain a list of files to include.  Names in the file may
be seperated by any combination of <blank>, <comma>, <tab> or <crlf>.
.caveats
Can't handle big input files (current limit is 475 pages).
Inserts nulls in middle of file.
