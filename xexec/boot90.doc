      1 -  INTRODUCTION



BOOT90 is a release of the bootstrap containing a subset of the version
9.0 bootstrap source code (BOOT90.SRC) conditionally assembled using the
assembly options in "BOOT90.OPT".  The major new features of BOOT90 are
support for downloading from HDLC lines connected to all four SIO
motherboards, including HDLC lines connected to SIO ports whose SIO port
numbers are discontinuous, and from SYNC lines connected to either SYNC
board.  BOOT90 retains the SYNC and HDLC line loading capabilities of
previous bootstrap releases and contains the TTY loader that was removed
from the MXP bootstrap (BOOT07) because of space considerations.  The
tape, 10MB disk, and MSC1400 disk loaders that were also removed from
the MXP bootstrap source code have been restored to BOOT90.SRC but were
conditionally assembled out of BOOT90 because of space considerations.  In
addition, the code to support the XPI board has been conditionally-assembled
out of BOOT90.  VERSION 7.0 OF THE ENGINE BOOTSTRAP WILL REMAIN THE ONLY
VERSION TO SUPPORT THE XPI BOARD.


      1.1  EXTERNAL BOOTSTRAP ENHANCEMENTS


      The following enhancements have been made to increase the usefulness of
      BOOT90:


           1.  BOOT90 supports downloading over HDLC lines connected to SIO
               ports on all four SIO motherboards (device addresses 80-83x).
               Previous versions of the bootstrap could only download over HDLC
               lines connected to SIO ports on the SIO motherboard at device
               address 80x.

           2.  BOOT90 supports downloading through any SIO port connected to an
               SIO motherboard, regardless of discontinuities in the numbering
               of SIO ports.  Previous versions of the bootstrap could not
               download through an SIO port unless all lower-numbered SIO ports
               were present.

           3.  BOOT90 supports downloading over SYNC lines connected to both
               SYNC boards.  Previous versions of the bootstrap could not
               download over SYNC lines connected to the second SYNC board.

           4.  BOOT90 contains the TTY loader that was removed from the MXP
               bootstrap (BOOT07) because of space constraints.

           5.  BOOT90 runs considerably faster than previous releases of the
               bootstrap, resulting in fewer lost records.


      1                         ENGINE BOOTSTRAP                     BOOT90.DOC
      INTRODUCTION                                                July 17, 1987



           6.  BOOT90 supports downloading over HDLC lines at all baud rates.
               Previous releases of the bootstrap could not download over HDLC
               lines at less than 4800-baud.

           7.  BOOT90 halts the target machine when a machine malfunction
               interrupt occurs.  Previous releases of the bootstrap disabled
               machine malfunction interrupts.

           8.  BOOT90 does not assume that SYNC input records will be separated
               by a minimum of one marking halfword (FFFFx).

           9.  The average number of initial records lost over HDLC lines has
               been reduced substantially.

           10. BOOT90 allows 3270 controllers to be connected as "SYNC lines"
               to SYNC ports during the downloading process.  Previous releases
               of the bootstrap required that 3270 controllers be disconnected
               or powered-off before downloading could begin.  Beginning with
               version 9.0 of the Engine bootstrap source code, the downloading
               line is not selected until a complete, correctly-checksummed
               record is received.  Previous releases of the bootstrap selected
               the downloading line when the first SYNC pattern (3232x) was
               received.  As 3270 controllers constantly transmit the IBM SYNC
               pattern (which is also 3232x), any powered-on 3270 controller
               was invariably selected as the downloading line.

           11. BOOT90 determines the frequency of ASYNC clock interrupts to
               ensure the timing of bootstrap routines is not affected by the
               position of the NT jumper on the multifunction card.

           12. Support for the XPI board has been eliminated from BOOT90 by
               conditionally-assembling the XPI board code out of BOOT90.


      1.2  BOOTSTRAP FUNCTIONALITY


      Although any Engine binary file that does not contain data to be loaded
      into the top 1000x bytes of RAM may be loaded into an Engine, BOOT90 is
      primarily used to download two types of programs:


      1.  Bound files (files with a .BND suffix), including ISIS images and
          stand-alone code (TYMSAT, Solo Switcher, etc.)

      2.  Diagnostics (Memory, CPU, MAC, SIO, etc.)

      2 -  DEVICE INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS



      BOOT90 interfaces with the following devices:


           1.  SYNC lines

           2.  HDLC lines

           3.  The RS-232 port on the multi-function board (TTY port)

           4.  The watchdog timer (and associated toggle switch) on the multi-
               function board

           5.  The Engine console

           6.  The memory chip ECC log


      Version 9.0 of the bootstrap source code, BOOT90.SRC, contains the code
      to support all current load devices.  Support of the following load
      devices, however, HAS BEEN CONDITIONALLY ASSEMBLED OUT of BOOT90 because
      of space considerations:


           1.  The ESELCH

           2.  Tape drives (using the ESELCH)

           3.  Small (10MB) disk drives (using the ESELCH)

           4.  Large (300MB) disk drives (using the MSC1400 controller)

           5.  The XPI board

      2.1  SYNC LINES


      SYNC lines are scanned looking for a down-line load header (3232x).  Once
      a down-line load header is received from a SYNC line, input data from the
      SYNC line is buffered by the enhanced SYNC microcode.  If a complete,
      correctly-checksummed record is received in the buffer, loading begins on
      that line and all other SYNC and HDLC lines are ignored.  The format of
      records is:

                     3232 tt 0aaaaa nn...nn vvvv dddd

      Where:

           3232    = SYNC pattern

           tt      = Record type:

                       00      Transfer command (jump to the address contained
                               in the record)
                       01-38   Load command (load the number of bytes specified
			       by the record type into RAM)
                       80      Dump command (dump 38x bytes from RAM)

           aaaaa   = Address to store data to, retrieve data from, or jump to

           nn...nn = 38x Data bytes (the data bytes are not meaningful in dump
                     or transfer records, only the number of bytes specified by
		     the record type are meaningful in load records)
                     For a load record:
                           00-7F        the data byte is stored into RAM
                           80 80-85     the data byte following the 80x is
                                        stored into RAM
                           81-83        unused
                           84 yy        yy bytes of 00x are stored into RAM
                           85 yy        yy bytes of FFx are stored into RAM
                           86-FF        the data byte is stored into RAM

           vvvv   = Vertical checksum of the record type, address field, and
                    the 38x data bytes (taken as halfwords).  See Appendix I-1.

           dddd   = Diagonal checksum of the record type, address field, 38x
                    data bytes, and the vertical checksum halfword (taken as
                    halfwords).  See Appendix I-2.


      NOTE:  Unlike previous releases of the bootstrap, BOOT90 does not assume
             that input records will be separated by a minimum of one marking
             halfword (FFFFx).

      2.2  HDLC LINES


      The LOADII/down-load record format for HDLC is the same as for SYNC.
      Data from one of the HDLC lines connected to an SIO port on one of the
      four SIO motherboards (device addresses 80-83x) is buffered and scanned
      quickly for a SYNC pattern (3232x).  If a SYNC pattern is received, data
      from the HDLC line is buffered for an extended period of time and checked
      continuously for a complete, correctly-checksummed record.  If a record
      is received from an HDLC line,  loading begins on that line;  all other
      SYNC and HDLC lines are ignored for the remainder of the load/dump.  If
      no further records appear on the selected line within sixty seconds,
      BOOT90 will timeout.  This causes BOOT90 to reset, reinitialize the
      Engine, and resume scanning all SYNC and HDLC lines for input.

      Resets are issued to device addresses 80-90x, inclusive, when BOOT90
      first starts, before executing a transfer command, after a timeout, and
      after an attempt to load into the bootstrap's RAM.


      2.3  THE WATCHDOG TIMER


      If the watchdog timer is not reset approximately every two seconds by
      writing to its device address, the watchdog timer will, when armed, cause
      BOOT90 to be reloaded from PROM into RAM.

      The bootstrap PROMs, located on the Engine's multi-function printed
      circuit board assembly, contain, in addition to the bootstrap program, a
      header used by the CPU microcode during the ROM-to-RAM copy.  This eight-
      byte header is NOT copied into RAM.

	------------------------------------------------------------------
	|	 Initial PSW		 |	    Initial PC		 |
	------------------------------------------------------------------
	| RAM Address To Store First HW  |  RAM Address To Store Last HW |
	------------------------------------------------------------------

      The first two halfwords of the header contain the PSW and program counter
      to use after loading BOOT90.  The program counter was fixed at 720x by
      release 6 of the bootstrap to allow Tymnet II to relocate the bootstrap
      from low RAM to high RAM upon receipt of a DLOAD command.  All future
      releases of the bootstrap should follow this standard.  The third
      halfword contains the RAM address at which the CPU is to begin placing
      the bootstrap.  The fourth halfword contains the RAM address at which the
      CPU will store the last halfword of the bootstrap.  This RAM address is
      FC6x for BOOT90.

      2.4  THE ENGINE CONSOLE


      The Engine console display is updated by BOOT90 so an operator may more
      easily monitor bootstrap status.  See Section 4.2.1 of this document for
      a description of these displays.

      3 -  GENERAL DESCRIPTION



      The function of the bootstrap is to transfer data from input devices to
      memory (load) and from memory to output devices (dump).  BOOT90 allows
      data to be dumped from any memory location in an Engine (the maximum
      amount of memory in a machine is one megabyte).  BOOT90 allows data to be
      loaded into any memory location below the relocated copy of BOOT90 at
      location yF000, where "y" is either 7 or F (BOOT90 uses the top 1000x
      bytes of memory).

      BOOT90 is initially copied from PROM into the low RAM addresses 700-FC7x,
      inclusive.  BOOT90 begins by determining the amount of memory in the
      Engine by attempting to decrement the contents of memory locations at the
      end of successively lower 64K blocks until a successful memory access is
      detected.

      Once it determines the amount of memory in the Engine, BOOT90 relocates
      itself into the top 1000x bytes of memory.  (NOTE:  The relocation
      routine itself is not copied to high RAM.)  BOOT90 then performs non-
      destructive writes to memory locations 0-FFFFFx, inclusive, regardless of
      the actual amount of memory present.  The non-destructive writes
      initialize and reset the memory chip error-correcting circuitry (ECC).
      BOOT90 clears the memory chip error logs, extinguishing the amber and red
      LEDs at the front of the multi-function board.

      BOOT90 resets SIO motherboard device addresses 80-90x, inclusive.

      BOOT90 then patches memory locations 48-6Bx with six RX3 jump
      instructions.  The jump instructions are used to access the six entry
      points that version 9.0 of the bootstrap source code (BOOT90) provides:

                 0048 - Low RAM restoraroutine
                 004E - MSC1400 disk loader
                 0054 - Magnetic tape loader
                 005A - SYNC/HDLC line loader
                 0060 - TTY port loader
                 0066 - 10MB disk loader


      Since three of the loaders have been conditionally-assembled out of
      BOOT90, the BOOT90 jump table has been reconfigured as follows:

                 0048 - Low RAM restoration routine
                 004E - SYNC/HDLC line loader
                 0054 - SYNC/HDLC line loader
                 005A - SYNC/HDLC line loader
                 0060 - TTY port loader
                 0066 - SYNC/HDLC line loader

      Having completed its initialization, BOOT90 executes the SYNC/HDLC line
      loader.

      Once BOOT90 has relocated itself to high RAM, all working data is stored
      in the top 1000x bytes of memory.  The low RAM area that BOOT90 was
      originally loaded into (700-FC7x) may be freely loaded into.  If an
      attempt is made to load data from a SYNC or HDLC line into the top 1000x
      bytes of memory, BOOT90 will be restarted.  Restarting BOOT90 resets
      device addresses 80-90x, inclusive, terminating the transmission of the
      current acknowledgement record (if it is still being transmitted).  As
      additional records that load into the bootstrap's RAM are received, the
      console will display "0 0000 0009", with the left-most digit changing but
      resetting to "0" constantly.

      NOTE:  Previous releases of the bootstrap did not acknowledge records
             that attempted to load into the high RAM bootstrap area.  To
             increase the speed of the bootstrap, BOOT90 acknowledges records
             before they are unpacked (and an attempt to load into the
             bootstrap's RAM is discovered).  Resetting the device addresses of
             all SIO motherboards and reinitializing all enhanced SYNC
             microcoded line descriptors is a reasonable way of destroying an
             acknowledgement record that is already being transmitted.

      4 -  GENERAL OPERATION


      As an operator you have several options you may exercise.  The options
      available to you include:


           1.  Position of the watchdog timer toggle switch located on the
               Engine's multi-function board

           2.  Selection of loader


      4.1  WATCHDOG TIMER TOGGLE SWITCH


      The watchdog timer toggle switch is located on the front edge of the
      multi-function board.  If you want BOOT90 to be loaded from PROM whenever
      BOOT90 stops resetting the watchdog timer, you should arm the watchdog
      timer by depressing the toggle switch until it clicks.


      4.2  SELECTION OF LOADER


      To load from the TTY port or load/dump from a SYNC or HDLC line, follow
      the instructions outlined below for the specific device you are using.


      4.2.1  ENGINE CONSOLE DISPLAYS

      BOOT90 reports its current status on the console display as follows:

            Display                     Current status
          ===========      =============================================
          y F000 BA5E      BOOT90 is initializing the memory chip ECC.  BOOT90
                           use high RAM locations yF000-yFFFF.

          0 0000 0009      BOOT90 is scanning the SYNC and HDLC lines for a
          :   :    :       complete, correctly-checksummed record.  The right-
          :   :    :       most two digits are the bootstrap revision level and
          F 0000 0009      version number (the left-most digit is changing, but
                           is not meaningful).  If the left-most digit is being
                           reset continuously to "0" before it reaches "F", an
                           attempt is being made to load into the RAM reserved
                           for the bootstrap.

          a aaaa 00dd      Data is loading from an ASYNC line connected to the
                           TTY port.  The last memory location to be loaded is
                           aaaaa, the last data byte received is dd.

                           motherboard).  The last complete, correctly-
                           checksummed record received had address field aaaaa.

          0 0070 5AFE      The low RAM restoration routine has been executed.
                           Pressing the RUN key on the console will start
                           execution at location 70x.


      4.3  SYNC AND HDLC LINE PROCEDURE


      The SYNC/HDLC line loader allows loading from or dumping to a SYNC line
      connected to either SYNC board or an HDLC line connected to an SIO port
      on any SIO motherboard.  Loading/dumping may take place at any baud rate
      between 1200-baud and 19200-baud, inclusive.  NOTE:  Previous releases of
      the bootstrap could not download over HDLC lines at less than 4800-baud.

      The SYNC/HDLC line loader can be executed in two different ways:

           1.  The SYNC/HDLC line loader jump table entry at location 5A may be
               used.  To verify that the jump table entry has not been
               destroyed, press the following keys on the console: PSW DTA SET
               5 A ADR RD.  The console display should read "0 005A 4300".  If
               the display is not correct, then reload BOOT90 from PROM (see
               method 2).

               If the console display is correct, then press the RUN key on the
               the console.  The display should change to "y F000 BA5E" for a
               few seconds, and then "0 0000 0009", with the left-most digit
               changing.  You may then use LOADII to load or dump via a SYNC
               line connected to a SYNC port or an HDLC line connected to an
               SIO port.

           2.  If the bootstrap cannot be restarted using the first method,
               BOOT90 must be reloaded from PROM.  This is done by depressing
               or lifting the watchdog timer toggle switch on the Engine's
               multi-function board.  BOOT90 will be copied into low RAM at
               location 700x and relocate itself to the top 1000x bytes of
               memory.  The console will display "y F000 BA5E" and then
               "0 0000 0009" with the left-most digit changing, as described
               above.  You may then use LOADII to load or dump via a SYNC line
               connected to a SYNC port or an HDLC line connected to an SIO
               port.


      If the SYNC/HDLC line loader does not receive a complete, correctly-
      checksummed record for sixty seconds, BOOT90 will timeout and restart.
      BOOT90 will then begin searching all SYNC and HDLC lines for a complete,
      correctly-checksummed record.

      4.4  TTY PORT PROCEDURE


      The TTY port loader allows loading from an ASYNC line connected to the
      TTY port on an Engine.  This procedure is more cumbersome than a load
      over a SYNC or HDLC line and is very slow, since the loading must be done
      at 1200-baud.

      Loading through the TTY port requires a terminal, a Y-cable
      P/N 160041-001 (ASC 192-1), and an ASYNC line (by hardwire or modem) to a
      functioning network node.  Follow the following steps to connect the
      Y-cable:

           1.  Connect the Y-cable to the terminal, to the ASYNC line from a
               network node, and to the TTY port on the front of the Engine's
               multi-function board.

           2.  Press the following keys on the Engine console:
               PSW DTA 6 0 ADR.

           3.  Set the terminal baudrate to 1200-baud and log into the host
               that contains the NIB FILE you want to download.

           4.  Using the terminal, type:
                                          R NAD<cr>
                                          %F(directory)filename.extension<cr>
                                          ;G<cr>

           5.  The NAD assembler will display the range of addresses contained
               in the NIB file on the terminal.  Take the highest address shown
               and type on the terminal:
                                          0,highest address;8

           6.  The NAD assembler will display a <cr><lf> on the terminal.
               Within two seconds of the line feed being displayed, press the
               RUN key on the Engine's console.

           7.  The terminal will display a random sequence of characters and
               the console will display a gradually decreasing value that
               represents the memory location into which data is being
               downloaded.  When the console display changes to "F FFFF 000A",
               the download has been successfully completed.

           8.  If the value displayed on the console remains the same for more
               than thirty seconds and is NOT "F FFFF 000A", repeat the TTY
               port procedure.

      CHECKSUMS FOR SYNC AND HDLC RECORDS                         July 17, 1987




      APPENDIX I.   CHECKSUMS FOR SYNC AND HDLC RECORDS


      Two halfword checksums are transmitted with each incoming SYNC or HDLC
      record.  The first is a 'vertical' checksum, the second is a 'diagonal'
      checksum.


      I-1  ALGORITHM FOR VERTICAL CHECKSUM



           1.  Load 0 into accumulator.

           2.  Get a halfword of data.

           3.  XOR data with accumulator.

           4.  Go to step 2.



      I-2  ALGORITHM FOR DIAGONAL CHECKSUM



           1.  Load 0 into accumulator.

           2.  Get a halfword of data.

           3.  Rotate 16-bit accumulator left one bit.  The high-order bit
               becomes the low-order bit.

           4.  XOR data with accumulator.

           5.  Go to step 2.


      NOTE:  The diagonal checksum includes the vertical checksum.
