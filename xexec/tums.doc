   DESCRIPTION

           TUMS-10 version 42 of 22-JAN-86 as described here is the Tymcom-X
           version of  the standard user  interface to the  Tymnet Universal
           Message System (TUMS).  It  allows the user to send,  receive and
           manipulate messages to other users on TUMS connected hosts.

           From TUMS  subcommand mode, normally  indicated by a  ">" prompt,
           the following commands are valid:

           Many of these  commands expect arguments  which specify a  set of
           messages  to be  acted upon  by the  command.  The  syntax  for a
           message set expression is:

           <ele> ::= one of following:
               n           message number "n"
               n:m         messages numbered "n" through "m"
               n:*         messages numbered "n" or greater
               n#m         "m" messages beginning with message number "n"
               #n          last "n" messages

           The user may  setup a TUMS.INI file  using the editor or  the SET
           and PROFILE commands.   The following variables may  be redefined
           to alter the behavoir of TUMS:

             ALIAS "name" "expanded name"
             ARCHIVE.FILE "filename"
             ARCHIVE.MOVED on~off
             AUTO.BCC "addresses"
             INCLUDE.SEP "seperator line"
             INIT "command1" "command2" ... "commandN"
             LIST.FORMAT "format control string"
             LIST.DEFAULT "default arguments"
             MACRO "name" "expanded command"
             MACRO ^character "expanded command"
             MACRO.ECHO on~off
             PROMPT "string"
             PROMPT.TEXT "text message"
             PSEUDONYMS "addresses"
             SEND.FROM "fullname <home address>"
             REPLY.ALIAS "from address" "reply address"

           The address may simply be a user name on the current system, or a
           mail name followed by "@" and a domain name for a user on another
           system.  An alias may also be used within the program wherever an
           address is expected.   Example addresses showing  currently valid
           domain names are:

             user@sysno            user on Tymcom-X host
                   (24,26,33,35,36,39,55,57,62,95,930 currently)
             user@EUNIX            NTD Vax/Unix system user
             user@TYMIX            NTD Vax/Unix system user
             account.userid@ONTYME inter-Ontyme system user
             userid@rscsnode.MCAUTO any McAuto PROFS user
             ident@OFFICE          any Augment user
             mailname@host.ARPA    most any ARPA-net user
             path!user@TYMIX       any Usenet user

           Whenever  inputting  the  text  of  the  message,  the  following
           subcommands  may  be  enetered  by  typing  a  tilde  (~)  at the
           beginning of a line, followed by the command:

             ~?            help - print this message
             ~b address    blind copy - add address to blind cc field (Bcc:)

           See  the TUMS  reference  manual for  a full  description  of the
           operation of the TUMS-X program.

           To make use of your personal Ontyme ID when sending and receiving
           Ontymes,  it  is  necessary  to  register  your  Ontyme  account.
           Otherwise,  the generic  account TUMS.GATEWAY  will be  used.  To
           register, send mail to POSTMASTER containing your  username, home
           system, ontyme account, ontyme ID, and ontyme key.
