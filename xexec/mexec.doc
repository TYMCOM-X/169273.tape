   (XEXEC)MEXEC                    Tymcom-X                     (XEXEC)MEXEC


   SYNOPSIS

           Mini-exec for special command mode commands.

   DESCRIPTION

           This  program  may  be  specified  as  the  special  command mode
           processor to  be run by  the monitor when  a command  is received
           which it would  otherwise not know  how to process.   MEXEC reads
           the command and looks in every directory specified in  the user's
           DO list to find a program with the same name as the  command.  If
           such a program is found, it is executed.

           This allows commonly used programs to be run as  commands without
           the  need to  specify the  "R" or  "GO" or  "RUN" command  or the
           program's  directory.  It  further allows  the program  to obtain
           arguments from the command line immediately following the command
           name.

           The "CTEST SETDO" command may  be used to change the DO  list for
           the  duration  of  the  session.   The  programs  (XEXEC)INIT and
           (XEXEC)MINIT setup (XEXEC)MEXEC as the special command processor.
