.Sec Schedule,SCHED:
The project is divided into %tasks% which are measured in units of
manpower called "%units%".
A unit represents 3 man-days of work,
or typically 1 week of elapsed time.
This definition is subject to change.

The following tasks are proposed at this time and are not necessarily
shown in the order of execution.
The approximate time involved is shown and is subject to change.

.Ss Fourth quarter,!4Q79:
The following is expected to be completed during 
fourth quarter 1979:
.myList
==background research [2 units]
.continue
Do research on grammar types,
compiler design tools, etc.

==survey of existing executive languages [2 units]
.continue
Research as many executive languages as possible and evaluate the
advantages each would present in the context of our system.
Also evaluate any languages which have features or grammars which
relate to the exec language being proposed.
Include comments on each in the journal.

==define expected requirements of language [1 unit]
.continue
Define (in general terms) the known requirements of the language
and provide specific examples illustrating possible methods of
implementation.

==define a proposed grammar that meets expected requirements [2 units]
.continue
Publish a proposed definition of the language(s) for evaluation by
other groups.
Obtain feedback.

==propose a set of primative functions [1 unit]
.continue
Outline the function and syntax of any primative functions that are
required.

==reevaluate the proposed language [3 units]
.continue
Call a meeting of all interested parties to discuss the original
proposal.
Based on the feedback from the meeting,
draft a final proposal with sufficient detail to begin implementation.

==outline the internal implementation of the interpreter [1 unit]
.continue
Provide a sketchy outline of the internal organization of the
interpreter.

.Ss First quarter 1980,!1Q80:
Expectations for the first quarter of 1980 
are to have a subset of the proposed
exec running and in use by internal users 
and perhaps certain special customers.
This version of the exec would:
.myList
--be able to entirely replace %COMCON%
--be able to replace some functions of %RPG%.
--support only one subordinate process
--process commands from files
--direct output to files
--provide simple error handling
--support simple deferred scheduling (a la %PERP%)
--not support %goto%'s or exits through multiple levels
--not support %compiled external functions%
--not support %Katakana%
--support only the "@" style macros
--perform %statistical analysis% and %performance analysis%
--support some %services for children%
