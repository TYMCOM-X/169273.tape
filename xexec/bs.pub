perform Binary Search on sorted text files
.syntax
BS key1 key2 ... keyn outfile=infile1,infile2,...,infilen/VERBOSE
.description
All lines beginning with the strings key1...keyn will be copied
to the terminal or output file.

Notes:

/VERBOSE will cause file names to be printed as they are searched.

Files must be sorted on the first N characters of each line, where
N is the length of the longest key.  Sort must be case independent.

Infiles may contain # and * as wild cards.

If keys are omited from command line, BS will prompt the terminal.

If outfile= is omited, output will go to the terminal.
.caveats
Does not work.
