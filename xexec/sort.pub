.synopsis
Sort records in a text file.
.syntax
SORT outfile = infile /options
.description
This program is a more friendly interface to the standard COBOL SORT in (SYS).
The program sorts lines which are seperated by CRLF and must not excede the
expected record length, but may be shorter.

With no options it will sort 80 column records in ascending order using the
whole record as the sort key.  Options which may be specified are:
.nofill

   /KEYPOS:integer
   /KEYLEN:integer
   /RECLEN:integer
   /NUMERIC
   /REVERSE
.caveats
If the actual record is shorter than the specified record length,
the records in the output file may be padded with up to five trailing
blanks to make the record an even multiple of five characters long.
These may be removed with TRIM.
