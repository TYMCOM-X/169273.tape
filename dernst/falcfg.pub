Hardware Configuration
Specification
DEC Falcon Based TYMSAT
.skip 2

.sec Introduction

This document describes the configuration specification for the
TYMSATs based on DEC FALCON micro-computers.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the architecture of the
FALCON and that the appropriate DEC hardware manuals are
available for reference.
.sec Components

The following is a list of components which can be integrated into
TYMSAT configurations.
.skip 1
.ss Processors

The processor board used is the M8063 (Revision D, circuit board
#501448d-xx) dual height board
described in the SBC-11/21 Single-Board Computer User's Guide
(EK-SBC01-UG-001).
.ss Bootstrap

The bootstrap for the TYMSAT is the MXV11-AC dual height board.
The bootstrap code resides in two 2716 proms on the board.
This code allows the down line loading of the TYMSAT from
TYMNET using LOADII or equivalent program.

The MXV11 is a dual height board which also has the memory on board,
and is described in the 1979-1980 edition of
"Microcomputer Processor Handbook".
.ss Memories

The MXV11-AC has 32K bytes of RAM on board and as
such requires no separate memory board.
.ss Asynchronous Interfaces

Three serial asynchronous port options can be used in a TYMSAT.
These are the DZV11, DLV11-J and the MXV11(bootstrap board).

An MXV11 serial line unit (SLU) interfaces one asynchronous
serial line I/O device to the LSI-11 bus (without modem control).
One MXV11 SLU must be configured as a console terminal (cty).

A DZV11 multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for 4 devices.
It is a quad height module, has full modem control and programable
baud rates.

A DLV11-J multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for 4 devices.
It is a double height module, does not have programable baud rates
and has no modem control.
.ss Synchronous Interfaces

Only one synchronous serial line interface is available for
the FALCON TYMSAT configuration, the DPV-11 (M8020).  This is a dual height
board described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories and Peripherals".
.if lines < 10 then skip to column 1;
.SS Backplanes

The usual box used for housing the TYMSAT is the BA11-VA or `tiny'
box (or equivalent). This box is described in the 1979-1980 edition of
"Microcomputer Interfaces Handbook".  The BA11-M box is also usable.

The BA11-VA box contains an LSI-11 Q-bus backplane and is capable
of housing up to 4 dual height boards.
.SS Watchdog Timer

The watchdog timer is a dual height board that monitors output
from a SLU and also provides halt and reset switches.
If a character is not received within a 10 second time cycle,
a reset signal is generated which reboots the TYMSAT.
The node software should be configured to generate a
character output once a second.

The watchdog timer does not interface with the Q-bus directly.
It requires only power from the backplane and must
reside after all active devices.
Interfaces exist on the board for three 10 pin berg connectors.
One provides the watchdog timer with access to the halt/enable
logic in the processor, another receives data from an asynch serial
port (either DLV11-J or MXV11), times out if 10 seconds elapse
without a character being received, and generates a reset signal
to reboot the processor.
The third connector is available to disable the watchdog function
by the carrier detect signal from a modem.
When a carrier is detected, the watchdog
timing function is temporarily disabled, thus allowing access to
an asynch serial port (the cty) for diagnostics.

Currently no document exists to reference for this device.
.sec Configurations

There are two possible configurations that can be supported by
the node software, depending on whether DLV11-J or DZV11 modules are
included. The components are as follows:
.list()
.item
BA11-N `large box'
.item
M7270 processor
.item
MXV11-AC bootstrap and memory
.item
1-2 DUV11 synchronous serial ports
.item
1-4 DZV11 asynchronous serial multiplexors (or DLV11-Js)
.item
0-1 Watchdog Timer
.endlist

The boards are inserted into the backplane as follows:-

	|            --EMPTY--           |  9.
	+--------------------------------+
.endhand

The boards must be contiguous from slot 1 on the bus (i.e. no `holes'
must exist in the bus) this includes the MXV11.
The DUV11(s) must be installed in the bus closest to the processor
because this is the most time critical device.
.skip 3
.if lines < 10 then skip to column 1;
.narrow 4,4;
The two asynchronous serial ports on the MXV11 are dedicated to
three functions. One as the cty, the other to drive the watchdog
timer and to optionally act as a high frequency interrupt source
for the TYMSAT software.  The cty cannot be used for this last purpose
as it is driven at 19.2K baud and will not then be
compatible with the diagnostic modem connection.

.sec Configuring the Boards

This section describes the way in which the component boards
must be configured to make them work in a TYMSAT.

It is assumed that the reader has access to the relevant
DEC reference handbook.
.SS Serial Interfaces

The following is a list of `standard' addresses and vectors
that can be assigned to serial interface boards in a TYMSAT
configuration.
