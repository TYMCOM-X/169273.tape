Stephane,
  The X.25 fix is in the works, however, it will be available only on
Skywaker and TSI.  A PIR is probably needed in order for Engine SIO
Motherboard and HDLC-Micro microcode to be updated.  The person in
charge of those two codes was going to do it without a PIR, but
he left the company without doing so.
