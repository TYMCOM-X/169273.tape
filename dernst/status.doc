Made packet level performance improvements.(DE)

Fixed BOFA VHB link level problems. (DE)

Attended ANSI X3S3.7 meeting.(DE)

Reviewed Consat PAD logic with Kenneth.(IW)

Investigated the node code crash caused by XCOM software.  The problem
is identified as the result of XCOM sending a gobbler to a dispatcher
port before the circuit is built for the port.(IW)

Investigated the MDSI echo control problem.(DE,IW)

Prepared betatest release V2.05.  The release files are in MIDBAK ready

UNIFIED PREFIX MODIFICATION PROJECT STATUS(FK)

NOTE:  the project milestones have been altered to reflect a changed
approach to the work effort.  Originally 6 separate major modifications
were required, now, 2 major code additions with 6 hooks to one or the
other addition.  The time to complete the work has not changed, only the
points when an assessment of the completion status can be made.

      OVERALL STATUS: on time to less than one week behind
              logic completed coding to begin next week


Completed the testing of CLDMAPPING feature and put the code into
F34.(SCY)

Added a new option, TRGPF into PKTOPT statement.  The X interface will
send a login string of the form "username:GdnicTtnic;<cr>" to request
the target profile support from the network supervisor.  See
(suechao)TRGPRF.DOC for details.  Several bugs in handling the RPOA
selection were encountered when testing the above feature.(SCY)

Work still in the process of combining all the 18 read parameters into
a single message in the XCOM dialect rather 18 separate messages.(KG)

Testing with several different hosts through different gateways to
analyze how well the echoing and deleting work.  Problems have taken
place when login to 39 host through gateway 923 from the 'please login'
mode.  Does not do the deleting in both data transfer and command mode.
Double echoing exits on the 1st char of command mode every time
switching from data transfer to command mode.  (KG)

Finished autobaud routines for ATC.(KS,DE)

Starting on powerup confidence test. (KS,DE)
