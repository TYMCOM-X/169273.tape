Subject:  Next X.75 Subcommittee Meeting
 
As John informed you, the next subcommittee meeting will be on Friday, June 14,
here in Navesink.  This is an all Bellcore location.  It is off exit 109 on the
Garden State Parkway.  If you are flying into Newark, I suggest you rent a car.
 Take the New Jersey Turnpike South (look for turnpike signs when you leave the
airport).  Get off the turnpike at the Garden State Parkway exit (10 or 11).
Take the Parkway south to exit 109 (Lincroft).  When you get through the toll
gate and to the street, take a left.  Drive the equivalent of about two blocks
until you get to the entrance of a three building complex on your right.  The
buildings are black.  This is the Bellcore complex (331 Newman Springs Rd.). 

If you park in the lefthand parking lot, there are visitor spaces near the
back.  You can call from downstairs if you need to be signed in, my extension
is 2312. 

I believe this will be an all day meeting, so let's plan to start promptly at
9.  Please try not to schedule early flights out.  The drive to the airport is
40 minutes.  Limos can be arranged, I suggest Hurley at 276-1671.  One-way is
about $40. 

I don't have a room yet so watch for more mail.

ISSUE 01

HOW ARE THE BOCS GOING TO SUPPORT IC PRE-SELECTION ?

DESCRIPTION GENERAL
-------------------

Interexchange Carrier  (IC)  pre-select is an optional feature avail-
able to data users at  subscription time and upon  line rearrangement
requests  (service orders). The feature enables a user the ability to
select a transit network carrier (IC)  to be used during virtual call
set-ups requiring an  authorized IC without specifying that IC in the
call request packet.  Should the user wish to complete the call using
the services  of  another  IC, the pre-selected  IC may be  overriden
through the users specification of the alternate IC in the RPOA field
during the call setup process.

DESCRIPTION CCITT
-----------------

RPOA SELECTION  is an  optional user  facility which may be either a-
greed for a period of time  or requested by the  DTE for a given vir-
tual call.

This user  facility, when requested, provides for the user specifica-
tion by the  calling  DTE  of a sequence of one or more  RPOA transit
network(s)  within the  originating country through which the call is
to be  routed when more than one  RPOA transit network exist at a se-
quence of one or more  gateways. In the case of  international calls,
this  capability includes the selection of an  international  RPOA in
the  originating country. Each  RPOA  transit network in the facility
field of a call request packet corresponds to a gateway.

If the DTE selects only one RPOA transit network, either the basic or
extended  format of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility may be used. If the
DTE selects more than one  RPOA  transit network, the extended format
of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility is used. The appearance of both for-
mats in a call request packet  will be treated as a facility code not
allowed.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . Since the feature is  user optional, an IC may not be selected
       by the user at  service  subscription  or  rearrangement time.
       Should this user attempt a call which requires the services of
       an authorized  IC  without  specifying one in the  RPOA  field
       during the  call setup  process, a  question arises as to what
       will happen to the call.

       One concern is  that in the absence of an  IC preselect and an
       entry in the  RPOA field, the call will be handed to a network
       defined  default  IC  for completion to the  destination  DTE,
       rather than  clearing the call request  and notifying the user
       of improper call setup procedures.

       Should  a default  IC  be used, the  user could be notified of
       that ICs identity in the call accept packet.

     . If some  ICs  are authorized to complete  intra-LATA  call re-
       quests, the  question arises as to whether each call initiated
       by users subscribing to an  intra-LATA  carrier will be routed
       to that  carrier  or will it be completed by the local origin-
       ating network.

       Considering that packet networks have been designed with prot-
       ective measures to prevent packets from being lost due to con-
       stant looping, each  network  which originates a call which is
       destined  for completion  in its own network following a hand-
       off to an authorized  intra-LATA carrier, must be investigated
       as to  ability to  override the  process. In addition, the ef-
       fects of  overriding this  process must be  considered against
       traffic remaining internal to the originating network.

       Further implications become apparent when intra-LATA calls are
       passed to  ICs who are not authorized to carry same. The resp-
       onsibility for blocking of such calls should be decided.

     . The ability to pass a  preselected IC by means of Common Chan-
       nel signaling was questioned as to viability for use with data
       calls. This form of  preselection reduces  BOC  administration
       of IC  preselection within the  packet network through the use
       of centralized databases.

     . Choice of carrier should remain the responsibility of the ori-
       ginating subscriber.


     ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS
     ------------------------

     . Develop  a means of  passing the data carrier of choice from a
       central  database into the  packet networks  to select the ap-
       propriate carrier.

     . If IC preselection is not supported in the BOC packet networks
       customer selection of  IC  carrier must be made  utilizing the
       RPOA field in the call setup packet on a per call basis.

CAPABILITY TO ALLOW END USERS TO PRE-SELECT MORE THAN 1 IC FOR SPEED,
USER CLASSES, ETC.

mats in a call request packet  will be treated as a facility code not
allowed.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . The same  concerns noted under  ISSUE 01  apply to ISSUE 02 as
       well.

     . Applying  multiple  preselects  requires increased  functional
       software capabilities  (program and translation)  to be incor-
       porated into  BOC  packet networks  which at  present does not
       exist. Translation  table sizes  would be  tremendously  large
       and require excessive administrative overhead.

     . Selection of  multiple  ICs  is capable on a per call basis by
       specification of  RPOA, pre-selection is a convenience feature
       that enables subscriber to input less digits using their IC of
       choice.

     . Network  must recognize  terminating  DTE  for each originated
       call and then associate an  ICs RPOA to that call. An increase
       in call set-up time would also be incurred.


     RESULTING CONSIDERATIONS
     ------------------------

     . Investigation  of  time and  feasibility to incorporate such a
       feature into the packet networks.

     . Introduce a  partial  interim solution in those networks capa-
       ble of  supporting a  centralized  LOGIN  database, whereby IC
       preselects are  assigned according to  login entered. May also
       require network program modifications.

     . Do not offer  any type of  pre-selection thereby requiring all
       call set ups to specify the  RPOA  of choice during call setup
       procedures.

     . Allow the use of a single  pre-selected IC as the primary car-
       rier of a users  calls, using  RPOA  override as the secondary
       means of selecting a transit carrier.





ISSUE 03

CAPABILITY TO DENY SPECIFIED RPOAS ON END USER REQUEST FROM BEING AC-
CESSED.

DESCRIPTION GENERAL
-------------------

Recognized Private Operating Agencies  (RPOAs)  are ICs which are id-
entified by  DNICs  in the  RPOA  fields. CCITT  documentation states
the association of RPOA being equivalent to the carriers DNIC.

Calls which  originate in one  network with a destination DTE located
in a network not locally connected to the originating network require
an  RPOA  identifier to indicate the intermediate carrier responsible
for providing the  communications link between the two separated net-
works.


DESCRIPTION CCITT
-----------------

RPOA SELECTION  is an  optional user  facility which may be either a-
greed for a period of time  or requested by the  DTE for a given vir-
tual call.

This user  facility, when requested, provides for the user specifica-
tion by the  calling  DTE  of a sequence of one or more  RPOA transit
network(s)  within the  originating country through which the call is
to be  routed when more than one  RPOA transit network exist at a se-
quence of one or more  gateways. In the case of  international calls,
this  capability includes the selection of an  international  RPOA in
the  originating country. Each  RPOA  transit network in the facility
field of a call request packet corresponds to a gatewa
If the DTE selects only one RPOA transit network, either the basic or
extended  format of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility may be used. If the
DTE selects more than one  RPOA  transit network, the extended format
of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility is used. The appearance of both for-
mats in a call request packet  will be treated as a facility code not
allowed.


APPLICATIONS
------------

. An originating  DTE  may wish all calls which are billed to them to
  avail the services of a particular  IC  in view of economics, reli-
  ability, etc.

. A terminating  DTE  which accepts  reverse charge calls may wish to
  take advantage of the  same  efficiencies (volume discounts, etc.).

     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . Where would blocking or denial take place.

       On an originating call which is billed to the  originator, the
       most  efficient  form of  prevention  would seem  to be at the
       originating  port where specific  RPOA(s)  requested by a user
       would not be  accepted as  valid  inputs. Denial  of this type
       would  require tables  associated to each  port requesting the
       service. Requires vendor development.

       Another means of administering  RPOA  denial on an  originator
       billed  port  would be to  carry lists of  DTEs  which are not
       allowed access to be associated with each denied RPOA gateway.
       Again, vendor development would be required. Performing denial
       at the  gateway  has a  shortcoming which  is not found in the
       first  scenario. If a user has requested multiple transit car-
       riers, blocking would  only  be performed on the first transit
       carrier so that participating IC RPOAs would also have to car-
       ry association lists on their gateways.


       In the case of an originating  DTE reverse charging to another
       DTE  which does not  wish to  accept charges unless a specific
       carrier has been used is  even more  complicated. If  all net-
       works are capable of  carrying  Transit Network Identification
       Codes (TNIC:1984 CCITT) across their networks, the terminating
       network would require an association  list of denied  RPOAs in
       the gateway  node. Every  call would require  processing as to
       whether  proper  RPOAs  were used  prior to  completing a call
       to the requested destination. The 1984 Recommendation does not
       allow the passing of TNIC(s) in X.25 packets, therfore an X.25
       destination  DTE  could not perform the  verification. In add-
       ition, asynchronous destination DTEs are incapable of  access-
       ing the TNIC information.

     . TNICs are transferrable according to 1984 CCITT Recommendation

WHAT USER  IDENTIFICATION  INFORMATION CAN BE  PASSED ON BETWEEN BOCs
AND ICs


DESCRIPTION
-----------

In order to perform billing  and trouble  sectionalization, it is im-
perative that sufficient information is transferred  between all net-
works involved in any data call. Issue 5 described accounting statis-
tics which, at a minimum, could be exchanged between networks.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . Identification of  users  may be different for users which are
       directly connected to  BOC  PPSNs  versus those that dial into
       the PPSN.

       Direct  connects should be  identifiable  by their originating
       port NTN as described under the numbering scheme for PPSN.

       Present  CCITT  Recommendations do not include the definitions
       for  fields  that could appropriately identify a dial-up user.

       Dial-up  connections,  depending upon  billing status (reverse
       or sent paid), may  pose significant problems as far as appro-
       priately  identifying a user. In the  case of  reverse charged
       calls, the  call request  packet will most likely  contain the
       NTN of the  port the same as  direct connects. The terminating
       service provider  could then  apply a  login type of verifica-
       tion to  uniquely identify the  call  requestor. On the  other
       hand,  sent paid calls would most likely contain either a port
       address or some type of network user  identification which may
       only be  usable by the originating  PPSN for billing purposes.
       Bilateral  agreements would be  necessary to relate these  BOC
       formatted identifications  into data which is usable by an IC.

     . Correlation of  BOC/user specific data such as NUI may be for-
       warded to neighboring networks either during 'session time' or
       post 'session time'.

       Actual session  time passing of  correlation information would
       require increased  network  resources in the form of databases
       and processing times.

       Post  'session time' information passing would require a down-
       stream processing of  information bilaterally  agreed upon be-
       tween carriers. Post session time processing may not be an ac-
       ceptable means of tranferring the information.


     ALTERNATE CONSIDERATIONS
     ------------------------

     . Requirements  for more information could be addressed by pass-
       ing the information in universally agreed upon utility fields.
       Development  work would be required in this area due to a need
       for field  definitions. This  definition  of  field  standards
       could be forwarded to ANSI for review.

WILL RPOA ADMINISTRATION BE HANDLED THE SAME AS WITH THE VOICE
NETWORK

DESCRIPTION GENERAL
-------------------

Recognized Private Operating Agencies  (RPOAs)  are ICs which are id-
entified by  DNICs  in the  RPOA  fields. CCITT  documentation states
the association of RPOA being equivalent to the carriers DNIC.

Calls which  originate in one  network with a destination DTE located
in a network not locally connected to the originating network require
an  RPOA  identifier to indicate the intermediate carrier responsible
for providing the  communications link between the two separated net-
works.


DESCRIPTION CCITT
-----------------

RPOA SELECTION  is an  optional user  facility which may be either a-
greed for a period of time  or requested by the  DTE for a given vir-
tual call.

This user  facility, when requested, provides for the user specifica-
tion by the  calling  DTE  of a sequence of one or more  RPOA transit
network(s)  within the  originating country through which the call is
to be  routed when more than one  RPOA transit network exist at a se-
quence of one or more  gateways. In the case of  international calls,
this  capability includes the selection of an  international  RPOA in
the  originating country. Each  RPOA  transit network in the facility
field of a call request packet corresponds to a gateway.

If the DTE selects only one RPOA transit network, either the basic or
extended  format of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility may be used. If the
DTE selects more than one  RPOA  transit network, the extended format
of the  RPOA SELECTION  facility is used. The appearance of both for-
mats in a call request packet  will be treated as a facility code not
allowed.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . The FCC is presently addressing DNICs and RPOAs in docket 83-
       1230. Until a final ruling is provided, administration of 
       RPOAs remains unsettled.

     . CCITT documentation equates an RPOA to be the DNIC which is
       registered to a carrier. Considering the problem with the al-
       location shortage of DNICs in the US, equating the DNIC to be
       the same as an RPOA extends the shortage to assignable tran-
       sit carriers (RPOAs).

       Technically, in an originating network, choice of an RPOA
       gateway is equivalent to selecting a trunk group in the voice
       world. Therefore nationwide agreements could be made as to as-
       sociation of a 4 digit numbering plan for RPOAs in the US
       which would be uniform throughout. While this may satisfy ex-
       it from the originating network, CCITT requires the transit
       network idntification to be inserted into the call request
       packet at the gateway. 

     . All ICs should be assigned DNICs and therefore have an RPOA
       (per CCITT Recommendation. Once all DNICs have been assigned,
       there would not be any provision for more (new) ICs to enter the
       data carrier market.

     . The possibility of ICs sharing RPOAs was tabled. Further in-
       vestigation would be required as to how this could be per-
       formed. This may be an appropriate item to present to ANSI.

HOW TO  IDENTIFY A  CARRIER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ASSIGNED A  DNIC TO BE
USED AS AN RPOA

DESCRIPTION GENERAL
-------------------

Considering the allocation shortage of DNICs to the US, it seems pos-
sible that  new  transit  carriers may come about in the future which
will not have a  DNIC assigned to them. The CCITT indicates that RPOA
is equivalent to DNIC  therefore the new carrier would not be capable
of carrying  inter-LATA traffic. DNIC  exhaust potential may be found
in more detail in the discussion of ISSUE 12.


DESCRIPTION CCITT
-----------------

A Data Network Identification Code  (DNIC) should be assigned to each
public  data network  or, possibly, where all  networks are contained
within  an  integrated  numbering  scheme, to each  specific service.

All data  network identification codes  (DNIC) should consist of four
digits. The first  three digits should  always identify a country and
could be  regarded as a Data Country Code  (DCC). The fourth, or net-
work digit, should identify a specific data network or service in the
country.

Each  country should be  assigned at  least one  3-digit data country
code  (DCC). The  data country  code  (DCC)  in conjunction  with the
fourth  digit can identify up to  10 public data networks. The format
for data network identification codes  (DNIC)  should be as indicated
in Figure 1/X.121.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . See issue 7 (especially FCC considerations).

     . Should  the new carrier  not require  international status and
       not be used  in multiple transit network connections, the pos-
       sibility  exists, at  least  technically for  routing calls to
       a carrier without an  RPOA (DNIC). Issue 7 addresses this mat-
       ter in more detail. An  additional concern imposed on this new
       carrier would be that it could not support any terminating DTE
       accessable from other networks.

     . The CCITT Recommendations should be followed.

SINGLE  VERSUS  MULTIPLE  DNICs  AND  EASE OF  NETWORK IDENTIFICATION


DESCRIPTION CCITT
-----------------

A Data Network  Identification Code (DNIC) should be assigned to each
public  data network  or, possibly, where  all networks are contained
within  an  integrated  numbering  scheme, to each  specific service.
All  data network identification codes  (DNIC) should consist of four
digits. The first  three digits  should always identify a country and
could be regarded as a Data Country Code  (DCC). The  fourth, or net-
work digit, should identify a specific data network or service in the
country.

Each  country  should be  assigned at  least one 3-digit data country
code  (DCC). The  data country code  (DCC)  in  conjunction with  the
fourth  digit can  identify up to 10 public data networks. The format
for data network identification codes  (DNIC)  should be as indicated
in Figure 1/X.121.


DESCRIPTION GENERAL
-------------------

Any assignment of  DNICs less than one per public network will result
in routing  identification implications. Various illustrative schemes
have been  introduced which include the  sharing of a single national
DNIC or the sharing of geographically assigned DNICs.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . Compliance with the  MFJ has resulted in the formation of 163+
       distinct  local exchanges  (LATAs) in which OTCs provide local
       exchange services. All  communications originating and termin-
       ating within these  LATA  boundaries, if not  enhanced, may be
       serviced  by the  OTCs.  Communications  crossing  these  LATA
       boundaries require the services of intermediate carriers (ICs)

       A  limited number  of  DNICs  have been assigned to the United
       States for identification of terminating  Public Data Networks
       by the CCITT. Presently, 70 DNICs are available for assignment
       and the  possibility  exists that an additional  allocation of
       130 could be obtained from the CCITT.

       Considering that 38 DNICs are presently assigned in the US and
       the potential exists  for a minimal requirement of 163 more to
       uniquely identify the  BOC  networks alone,  the allocation of
       200 US DNICs by the CCITT would not be sufficient for this un-
       iqueness. 

       FCC docket  83-1230  is presently  considering  this situation
       and reviewing  comments filed on its behalf. Final  resolution
       cannot be made prior to the FCC decision.

     . Additional digit  interpretation by ICs is required should any
       thing less than one  DNIC  per network be  assigned. Single or
       multiple requires additional translation. 

     . Sharing of  DNICs  appears as though multiple networks are one
       common  network. As  such, it becomes possible to implement an
       abbreviated call  setup  procedure  among all of the  networks
       sharing  the  DNIC. While  this is an added convenience to the
       user, it may be  viewed as a disparity or advantage applied to
       those sharing the DNIC.

     . A single  nationwide shared  DNIC  scenario  merely identifies
       that  further digit  interpretation  must take  place and does
       not  provide for  any  type of  routing  decision making. Geo-
       graphic  DNIC  assignments could  possibly  allow  ICs to per-
       form  initial  routing  ( North, East, South, West )  in  main
       regional  nodes  followed  by  NTN  routing  in  local  nodes.

     . Should  troubles  occur  (eg; congestion, link failure, etc.),
       use of a  single  DNIC  is  insufficient for identification of
       the  offending  party. Multiple  DNICs  may provide for better
       trouble  sectionalization,  possibly  to  corporate  identity.

     . Pursuance of further DNIC allocations from CCITT.

ARE SIX  DIGITS OF  DNPA DCO  NEEDED TO IDENTIFY TERMINATING BOC LATA

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Foreseeing  the unliklihood  of obtaining a unique DNIC for each net-
work  to be deployed, it becomes  evident that an  alternate means of
identifying  terminating networks will be required. Sharing of a DNIC
among  multiple networks  requires  translation of a  portion  of the
Network Terminal Number  (NTN)  as well as a numbering scheme to pro-
vide ICs with a unique means of delivering data to a terminating DTE.

See discussion of ISSUE 12.


     RESULTING CONCERNS
     ------------------

     . An illustrative  plan has been produced in which the numbering
       scheme  would  parallel or nearly  parallel that of the  North
       American  Numbering  Plan. In  many cases, the  first 3 digits
       would  be  sufficient for  identification of  the  terminating
       network. Should  multiple  LATAs exist which are identified by
       a common  DNPA, translation  of the  next 3 digits (DCO) would
       be required.

     . Another  means of  identifying  terminating  networks has been
       suggested  whereby LATA identifiers could be used (3-4 digits)
       thereby  decreasing the number of  digits requiring processing
       by the IC. While  this may seem to be a simple  solution, fur-
       ther investigation of  state jurisdictional  requirements need
       be pursued.


     RESULTING CONSIDERATIONS
     ------------------------

     . Any numbering  plan based on shared DNICs requires the follow-
       ing considerations :

          - Uniqueness of identifying terminating DTEs
          - Effects on ISDN Numbering Plans
          - Agreements between allocation schemes of all participants
          - Ease of implementation
          - Minimization of delay during call set up
          - Allowance for continued network growth capabilities
          - Distribution of administrative responsibilities

     . Outcome of FCC Docket 83-1230.
