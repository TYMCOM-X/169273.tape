0. Introduction

  For some users and applications, security restrictions other
  than the existing Closed User Group (CUG) mechanism are
  necessary.  The CUG mechanism is somewhat unweldly because it
  requires a central administration of the CUGs, and many CUGS are
  required if there is not a great deal of overlap of user communities.
  The mechanism described here is designed to be under the control
  of the DTE owner through the Network Console.  It is based on
  lists of restricted or allowed DTE address.



1. Called DTE address restriction
				
   CLDRES(address) :
    
  Default: no address restrictions exist
  Range: address = 1 - 14 digits of address


    This macro can be used to generate a restriction table for
    testing a called address received from the link for access to the 
    network.  It is intended to be used at an X.25 interface of a
    DTE to which multiple terminals are attached which have no
    builtin restrictions that would prevent misuse.

    If the CLDRES macro is used, it only applies within the
    current link option group (L.O.G.).

    If this macro is specified one or more times in a link option
    group, the called address in a call request packet will be compared
    with a list of addresses consisting of the parameters of the
    CLDRES macro calls specified for this L.O.G.
    This comparison will be made between each address in the above 
    mentioned list in its entirety and the same number of digits 
    of the called address in the call packet.  If a match is found, 
    the call will be cleared with "access barred" as the reason.
    A don't care condition in a certain position of an address is
    indicated by the non-BCD character "F".

    This address checking will be performed after prefix handling
    if there is any.


    Example:

      HOSTLINK(500,0)
	CLDRES(2342)

2. Called DTE address permission
				
   CLDPER(address) :
    
  Default: no address permissions exist if CLDRES is specified
		otherwise all addresses are permitted
  Range: address = 1 - 14 digits of address


    This macro can be used to generate a permission table for
    testing a called address received from the link for access to the 
    network.  It is intended to be used at an X.25 interface of a
    DTE to which multiple terminals are attached which have no
    builtin restrictions that would prevent misuse.

    If the CLDRES macro is used, it only applies within the
    current link option group (L.O.G.).

    If this macro is specified one or more times in a link option
    group, the called address in a call request packet will be compared
    with a list of addresses consisting of the parameters of the
    CLDRES macro calls specified for this L.O.G.
    This comparison will be made between each address in the above 
    mentioned list in its entirety and the same number of digits 
    of the called address in the call packet.  If a match is found, 
    the call will be allowed to go through unmodified.
    If the end of the list is reached and there has been no match, then
    the call will be cleared with "access barred" as the reason.
    A don't care condition in a certain position of an address is
    indicated by the non-BCD character "F".

    This address checking will be performed after prefix handling
    if there is any.


    Example:

      HOSTLINK(500,0)
	CLDPER(2342)

3. Calling DTE address restriction
				
   CLIRES(address) :
    
  Default: no address restrictions exist
  Range: address = 1 - 14 digits of address


    This macro can be used to generate a restriction table for
    testing a calling address being sent to the link for access to
    the DTE.  It is intended to be used at an X.25 interface of a
    DTE to which multiple terminals are attached which have no
    builtin restrictions that would prevent misuse.

    If the CLIRES macro is used, it only applies within the
    current link option group (L.O.G.).

    If this macro is specified one or more times in a link option
    group, the calling address in a call request packet will be compared
    with a list of addresses consisting of the parameters of the
    CLIRES macro calls specified for this L.O.G.
    This comparison will be made between each address in the above 
    mentioned list in its entirety and the same number of digits 
    of the calling address in the call packet.  If a match is found, 
    the call will be cleared with "access barred" as the reason.
    Otherwise, the call will be allowed to go through unmodified.
    A don't care condition in a certain position of an address is
    indicated by the non-BCD character "F".

    This address checking will be performed after prefix handling
    if there is any.


    Example:

      HOSTLINK(500,0)
	CLIRES(2342)

4. Calling DTE address permission
				
   CLIPER(address) :
    
  Default: no address permissions exist if the CLIRES macro is used
		otherwise all addresses are permitted
  Range: address = 1 - 14 digits of address


    This macro can be used to generate a permission table for
    testing a calling address being sent to the link for access to the 
    DTE.  It is intended to be used at an X.25 interface of a
    DTE to which multiple terminals are attached which have no
    builtin restrictions that would prevent misuse.

    If the CLIPER macro is used, it only applies within the
    current link option group (L.O.G.).

    If this macro is specified one or more times in a link option
    group, the calling address in a call request packet will be compared
    with a list of addresses consisting of the parameters of the
    CLIPER macro calls specified for this L.O.G.
    This comparison will be made between each address in the above 
    mentioned list in its entirety and the same number of digits 
    of the calling address in the call packet.  If a match is found, 
    the call will be put through unmodified.  Otherwise, the
    call will be cleared with "access barred" as the reason.
    A don't care condition in a certain position of an address is
    indicated by the non-BCD character "F".

    This address checking will be performed after prefix handling
    if there is any.


    Example:

      HOSTLINK(500,0)
	CLIPER(2342)
