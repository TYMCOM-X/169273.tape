1.0 Introduction
.lm 2
  This document describes the hardware
configuration specification for the
TYMBASes based on LSI-11 computers.
  It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the architecture of the
LSI-11 and that the appropriate DEC hardware manuals are at hand
and available for reference.
.lm 0
.st Components
.pg
2.0 Components
.lm 2
  The following is a list of components which can be integrated into
TYMBAS configurations.
.s 1
2.1 Processors
.lm 4
 Three processor boards can be used in a TYMBAS configuration, 
two are revisions of the KD11 module and the third is the KDF11
module.
These are the M7264 quad height board
with on board memory, the M7270 dual height board, and the
M8186 dual height board. All three are discribed
in the 1979 edition of "Microcomputer Processor Handbook"
by Digital Equipment Corporation.
.lm 2
.s 1
2.2 Bootstraps
.lm 4
 The bootstrap board used in a TYMBASe configuration is the BDV11-AA.
 The BDV11 board is described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories
and Peripherals".
  The bootstrap has a prom which resides on the
board.  This bootstrap allows the down line loading of the TYMBAS from
TYMNET using LOADII or equivalent program, or from a connected host.
Hosts currently supported are:-
.s 1
.list
.le ;DEC-2020 Tymcom-X
.le ;Pdp-11 Rsx-11m
.le ;Pdp-11 Rsts
.le ;F3 Tenex
.le ;F4 Tenex
.els
 The BDV11 is a quad height board.
.lm 2
.s 1
2.3 Memory
.lm 4
 The TYMBASe is provided with a 64K byte
dual height MSV11-D or MSV11-E 18 bit MOS memory board.
 The MSV11 memory is described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories
and Peripherals".
.lm 2
.s 1
2.4 Asynchronous Interfaces
.lm 4
 Two serial asynchronous port options can be used in a TYMBAS.
These are the DLV11-J and the DZV11.
 The DLV11-J is a dual height module with 4 separate
serial line units (SLU).
A DLV11 SLU interfaces one asynchronous serial line
I/O device (either 20ma or EIA) to the LSI-11 bus (without modem control).
One DLV11 port must be configured as a console terminal (cty).
 A DZV11 multiplexes asynchronous serial line I/O for 4 devices.
It is a quad height module and has full modem control.
.lm 2
.s 1
2.5 Synchronous Interfaces
.lm 4
 Two synchronous serial line interfaces are available for
the TYMBAS configuration, the DPV-11 and the DUV-11.  The DPV-11
is a dual height board and the DUV-11 is a quad height
board described in the 1978-1979 edition of "Memories and Peripherals".
.lm 2
.s 1
2.6 Backplanes
.lm 4
  Two boxes can be used for the TYMBAS configuration,
the BA11-N or large 9 slot, and the PDP-11/03 or small 4 slot
box (BA11-M) with an optional expansion box (BA11-ME).
These boxes are described in the 
1979-1980 edition of "Microcomputer Interfaces Handbook".
 For the 9 slot box, the slots serviced
by the Q-bus, are the leftmost two (as viewed from the rear of the
box).  The rightmost two slots do not interface to the bus.
  All slots in the 4 slot box (and the expansion box), are serviced
by the Q-bus.
.st Configurations
.pg
.lm 0
3.0 Configurations
.lm 2
 There are two possible configurations that can be supported by
the TYMBAS software. These are detailed below.
.s 1
3.1 Large Box
.lm 4
 The modules in the large box are inserted as follows:-
.list
.le ;KD11 or KDF11 processor
.le ;MSV11 memory board
.le ;0-2 DPV (or DUV11) synchronous serial interfaces
.le ;1-5 DLV11-J asynchronous serial interfaces
.le ;0-4 DZV11 asynchronous multiplexors
.le ;1-2 DRV11 parallel interfaces 
.le ;BDV11 bootstrap board (with prom)

.f
 The DPV11(s) (or DUV11(s)) must be installed in the bus 
closest to the processor
because it is the most time critical device.
The DRV11(s) must be installed last in the bus (but before the BDV11)
in order for the node to perform well.
The BDV11 acts as bus terminator, so it must always
be inserted in the last slot after the other boards.
(i.e. there must not
exist any `holes' between interrupting devices in the bus; the BDV11 is
not an interrupting device).
.pg
.lm 2
3.2 Small box
.lm 4
 The insertion of boards in the small box (with expander) is as follows:-
.list
.le ;KD11 or KDF11 processor
.le ;MSV11 memory module
.le ;1-2 DPV11 (or DUV11) synchronous serial interfaces
.le ;1-5 DLV11-J 4 SLU module

	+------------------------------+
.f
 All boards must be contiguous from slot 1.
The DPV11(s) must be installed in the slot(s) closest to the processor
because it is the most time critical device.
The DRV11(s) must be installed last in the bus (but before the BDV11)
in order for the node to perform well.
If no bus expander is
provided, then the BDV11 must be inserted into slot 4, and the DPV11
in slot 2 (right side).

4.0 Configuring the Boards
.lm 2
 This section describes the way in which the component boards
must be configured to make them work in a TYMBAS.
 It is assumed that the reader has nearby a copy of the relevant
DEC reference handbook.
.s 1
4.1 Processor board
.lm 4
 The processor must be configured to jump to loactaion 173000 upon
power-up.  This is done by the insertion of jumper W5 and the
removal of jumper W6. On the LSI-11/23 the jumpers W4 and W7 must
be removed and the jumper W8 must be installed.

4.2 External Interfaces

 The following is a list of `standard' addresses and vectors
that can be assigned to various interface boards in a TYMBAS
configuration.
