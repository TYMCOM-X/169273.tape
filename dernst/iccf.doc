SUBJECT:  Packet switching ICCF follow-up meeting

Mike,

    A meeting was held on April 2, 1985 in Denver as the result of the 
March 12, 1985 packet switching ICCF in Piscataway, NJ.  The purpose of the
meeting was to discuss and expand on questions that arose in the ICCF.
The meeting was attended by Bellcore, BOC and interexchange carriers.

The attendees were:

        Katherine Keith   Bellcore
        Augie Trinchese   NYNEX
        Roger Guenther    ATT-C
        Dan Morgan        ATT-C
        Jim Burns         ATT-C
        Vic Serspinski    ATT-C
        Bernie Pfeiffer   NYNEX
        George Abe        CSC
        John Hanle        Bell Atlantic
        Ron Berry         Northwestern Bell
        Bob Anzlovar      Michigan Bell
        Bill Jerome       BellSouth
        Jerry Johnson     MCI

The meeting was chaired by Jerry Johnson (formerly of Lockheed Dialog).

The questions discussed were:

1. Support of Interexchange carrier pre-select.

           This is for the most part a BOC question, but in the discussion
        several interesting points were raised.
        
    a.  Most of the BOCs seem to believe the state of the art for async
        dial-up is not to have IC-preselect.  Since we can provide that
        feature in our equipment, we may have a good selling point there.

    b.  Rules concerning IC-preselect may be augmented by state regulatory
        agencies and we may have to plan for that.  We have no problems
        with the current plan, but we may in some LATAs.

    c.  InterLATA calls entirely within a state could cause us problems
        if we have to file tariffs and go through the regulatory process
        in a lot of states.  We may want to look into restricting
        ourselves to interstate traffic only.

    d.  Do we want to push the BOC to give us intraLATA calls if a RPOA
        selection of Tymnet is (accidently?) made?



2.  Should BOCs allow users to make more that one IC-preselect?

           The IC selected would be based on speed or other quality of
        service issues.  The BOCs felt that this was too much overhead
        for them.  Again, we can offer this service in our equipment.
        Two interesting ideas arose during the discussion. One was
        the association of IC-preselect with a CUG, and the other
        was the ability of the end DTE of a reverse charged call
        to screen calls against a list of "good" ICs.  We may want
        to consider these feature for our X.25 and X.28 interfaces.


3.  Should the BOCs be able to deny access to an RPOA for a customer?

           The primary use of this feature would allow companies
        which have negotiated volume discounts with an IC to keep
        calls to other ICs from going through.  This was perceived
        in the discussion to be both a business as well as a technical 
        decision.  The other use of the feature would be for ICs
        that require a prior agreement (and credit check) with the user
        to carry his data traffic.

4.  Should provision be made for the identification of the clearing
        network?

          I pointed out that a utility exists in 1984 X.75 to carry
        this information, but no corresponding facility exists in
        X.25.  The information could be made available to the end
        networks and the distribution of the information to the user
        would by manual operation.  The Bellcore rep pointed out that
        the clearing network utility was not mentioned in the generic
        requirements, but she would look into incorporating it.
        I then pointed out that there was a small implementation timing
        issue because not all X.75 interfaces will be able to handle it.
        Unilaterally generating it may cause problems at gateways, and
        we had taken the approach of changing the code to transparently
        pass the utility but not generate it.  The incorporation of the
        clearing network facility into X.25 was brought up.  I felt
        there might be resistance internationally to this, but that
        it could easily make it into a US standard.  I did volunteer to
        make a contribution to ANSI for forwarding to CCITT proposing
        this addition to X.25.

4b. Will there be "certification" of X.75 gateways?

          This is the ultimate can of worms.  Questions that spring from
        this one are:  Who certifies whom?,  Who provides the tests?,
        What is "passing"?,  If certification comes after the first
        interfaces come up, will the new guys complain that the first
        ones got off easy?,  Will a BOC (or network) be able to use
        the criteria for passing to discriminate?.  The last question
        and the thought of lawsuits by the discriminated parties makes
        a strong case for uniform tests.  However, the BOCs seemed
        to think that bilateral agreements as to what is necessary
        in a conformance test was the way they wanted to go.  Also,
        the Bellcore rep didn't seem thrilled about having to come up
        with the tests.


5.  What call statistics should be exchanged?

           There is a separate group studying this issue.

6.  What user information can be passed between BOCs and ICs?

           The most important item is the NUI, and X.75 does
        not have provision for a NUI utility.  To me, the obvious
        way to do it is put it after a national marker.  In order
        to continue this process if there were two concatenated
        ICs and the both required a NUI, the a convention about
        passing information after a second national marker to the
        next network would have to be standardized.  Recognition
        of the need to standardize any such approach was recognized.

7.  Should the administration of RPOAs be the same as voice?

           For a while we weren't sure what this question meant,
        but came to the conclusion that it was: Will the area code
        scheme be retained?  Their answer is yes.  I think in the long
        run the BOCs will be burnt pretty badly by this decision.
        Somehow in this discussion the notion of symbolic names
        for the ICs in X.28 PAD calls came up.  It seems like
        a nice value added feature that would be easy to implement
        in our CONSAT PAD, and it is in agreement the the CCITT
        recommendation to do so.  This would be a nice competitive
        feature since the BOCs didn't show any interest in the
        idea.

8.  What happens if IC selection is made and there is no IC-preselect
        for the user?

           I am still a little confused about the legal status of 
        this one, but my impression is that the BOC can't make any
        routing decisions including round-robin selection of the gateway.
        The result is the call will be cleared, but there is no
        CCITT defined diagnostic that is anywhere close in meaning
        to this error.  The consensus was that a "national" diagnostic
        was needed to convey this information to the user.

9.  Can a carrier that has not been assigned a DNIC be selected
        through some mechanism to handle traffic?

           No!

10.  What are the operational issues (fault isolation, diagnostics,
        responsibilities) involved?  Define "operational".

           There wasn't much of a consensus reached.  Most agreeded
        that is was a bilateral agreement between the BOC and the IC.
        The idea of echo ports for diagnostics came up and everyone
        seemed to think that was a basic requirement for test calls.
        It doesn't seem like "operational" can ever be defined
        because of the context sensitivity of software errors can
        make a switch not be operational momentarily.

11.   Can the compatibility of X.3 parameters be maximized
        across multiple networks.

          This is entirely a BOC equipment problem.

12.  Are multiple DNICs needed for the addressing of the BOC networks.

           The BOCs all have applied for DNICs, but none have come through.
        USTA seems to have had theirs assigned.  Although everyone agreeded
        that they could use the USTA one, it seems like the they will
        still all try to get their own.  For us the DNIC is redundant
        information, and we may just end up with 8 redundant DNICs.
        They BOC networks will need DNICs when they realize that their
        address scheme is wasteful, and they have run out of numbers.
        At that point I think the area code scheme will be abandoned.

13.  Are the 3 digits of the DCO (central office) code necessary for
        routing?

           This was a question I had raised in Piscataway at the first
        meeting.  Routing based on the DCO is necessary when a area code is
        split  across two LATAs or when an independent shares the area code.
        The reason for the question is that if the DNIC doesn't provide
        any routing information, then the 3 digits of area code could
        easily be made to fit into our routing scheme.  Our current
        routing implementation easily handles four digits.  Routing on
        six digits may turn out to be very time consuming to implement.
        My suggestion had been to assign similar codes to the area codes
        split across LATAs.   I couldn't develop any interest in this at
        all from the BOCs.  All I got back where stories about how
        their voice customers had problems where area codes were split,
        and the recognition value of knowing where you were calling
        from the area code.  They did not  seem to mind that some of
        the BOCs want to have data area codes formed by adding 8 to the
        middle digit of the area code, making them all 8 or 9.  This
        is a rather unsettling development since we will have to do
        additional development to reach these split LATAs before
        they come online.  


The meeting concluded at 2:30 and I spent the rest of the afternoon 
enjoying the view from the new Denver Tymnet offices.
