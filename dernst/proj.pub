     Use of an X.25 VC for a TYMNET II link	2Q84	4 M/M
.fill
	This is the ability for a node under ISIS to establish a Virtual
Circuit through an X.25 slot in the same ISIS system, to use as an internodal
link.  This allows an independent network to use a public network for its
internodal connections.
