                        TYMNET II MESSAGE FORMAT



      All supervisory messages  begin with 16  bits of node  number (the
addressed node if a downstream message, the sending node if  an upstream
message).  The second  1/2 word of the  message consists of  the message
type (first byte), and supplementary information (2nd  byte).  Following
the 2nd 1/2 word of the message there may be addtional data  bytes.  The
entire length of the message is sometimes implicit in the  message type,
but in several  cases it is  determined by the  type as well  as message
data.

      Note that the destination node number in the SUP to  node commands
is escaped (e.g. 8000  is ored into the  number).  This is true  for all
commands except the takeover command, sent by Supervisor's using  V41 or
greater of the SUP  code.  The bit is  ignored by all except  newer T-II
node code, and it's  absence serves as a flag  that the SUP wants  a new
style takeover response (type 19).

      In the notation below, the header line for each  message indicates
the 1 byte type, the name of the message, and the length of the message.
The length may  be a formula which  depends on data within  the message.
Following the  header are  lines for each  1/2 word  of data  along with
explanations.  When the bytes of a halfword have different meanings they
will be separated  by a comma.  Required  data fields are  surrounded by
square brackets "[" and  "]", whereas optional or contingent  fields are
surrounded by angular brackets "<" and ">".

        [08, Supern+80] -(Supern is Sup's number)

        Note - Supervisor's using V41 or greater of SUP code
        flag their willingness to take the "new" takeover
        response by omitting the 8000 escape bit in the destination
        node number.

                If the flags indicate the circuit represented
        by this needle starts with a T-I neighbor, then there
        follows two 1/2 words which define the T-I interface:
        <TYMNET I node #>
        <Channel #>

        List of node #'s in the circuit:
          [node #               note - node numbers are
            :                   not escaped with 8000.

                          followed by channel #:

                                        - bit 2000 is 1/2 duplex flag
                                        - remaining bits reserved

        [Requesting Host + 8000]        - 8080 if unknown
        <Control Characters, User name
        termination & pad character>    - this field only present
                for user circuit terminating in T-II.  Not present
                for command or rebuild circuits, or for circuit
                fragments continued into T-I.  The field
                consists of optional initial control characters
                which are always mark parity:  'BF' for transparent
                gateway & 'C1' for Oper status (not available
                if transparent gateway).  The use of parity
                to provide additional control characters is a
                future option.  The username follows these
                characters - without parity.  The username is
                terminated by either a 'BB' for semi-colon, or a
                '8D' for a carriage return.  A null, '80', will
                be inserted, if necessary, to make the entire
                message even.

                        options as follows, where 'X'='tpsq':

                        't' - is Host Type presence designator,
                              where t=0 if type field present.
                        'p' = 1-t is used to prevent escaping.
                        's' - is the status change bit.  If 0,

                              status change, and the status field
                              'S' should be processed.
                        'q' - is the HIQ bit.  0 is no IIX capability
                              declared, 1 is IIX capability.

	The first two bits of 'S' designate originate/terminate status:
			'O' - 0/1 = not origonate/originate only
			'T' - 0/1 = not terminate/terminate only

	The last 2 bits of 'S':
                                00 - answered
                                10 - shut or up
                                01 - down,
