Tymshare TYMCOM-X manual for TIO                               PAGE   2
Introduction


       TIO allows the examination  and  modification  of  the  user's
  "TERMINAL  CHARACTERISTICS",  or,  those parameters associated with
  the user which describe the configuration of the  user's  terminal.
  These  parameters  are  set  upon initial connection to TYMNET (the
  identification character typed by the user).

       If the user makes an error during entry of a TIO command,  the
  error  may be corrected by typing Control-A, Control-W or Control-Q
  (1).  Control-A deletes the preceding character and prints  a  back
  slash  (\)  followed  by  the character deleted.  The user may type
  Control-A repeatedly to delete several preceding  characters;  each
  repeated  use  prints the character deleted.  Control-W deletes the
  preceding word typed; that  is,  Control-W  deletes  all  preceding
  characters  up  to,  but  not  including,  the  first  blank  space
  encountered.  Control-W prints a back slash  (\)  followed  by  the
  characters  deleted  and a final back slash.  Control-Q deletes the
  line currently being typed, prints an up arrow (^), and returns the
  carriage.

       The TIO command level prompt is an integer followed by a colon
  (:).   After  each  TIO  command is completed, the prompt number is
  incremented by 1.  Thus, successive TIO commands may appear as:

          1: command
          2: command
          3: command

  The prompt number does  not  increment  by  1,  however,  when  the
  immediately preceding command is a user-assistance command (2).

       All TIO commands and options may be abbreviated to the minimum
  length  required  to  avoid ambiguity (3).  When the user enters an
  incomplete command, TIO prompts for the information still necessary
  to  complete  the  command.   The  entry of a TIO command is always
  followed by a carriage return.






(1) Consult the Tymshare EDITOR Reference Manual for illustrations of
the use of editing characters.

(2) A user-assistance command is any command that  gives  information
only and does not perform any specific task (ie, LIST and its options
is a user-assistance command).

(3) The acceptable abbreviation for HELP is a question mark (?).

Commands and Descriptions


       All TIO commands and options are described below.


                                   ?

       The ? command may be typed at any point in a  command  string.
  It  will  cause  a brief list of options that are valid in place of
  the ? command to be typed on the users terminal.  For example,

          1: DELAY ?

          ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
                  LF
                  CR

  This indicates that "LF" AND "CR" are the two valid options for the
  "DELAY" command (DELAY LF or DELAY CR).


                                   A

       The A  command  allows  the  user  to  set  the  TYMNET  delay
  parameter "A" to a certain value.  The format of the command is

          A <value>

          <value> may be any integer of: 
          1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128

  This will set the rate at which unit delays  are  accumulated  when
  characters are output to the user's terminal from the computer.


                                   B

       The B  command  allows  the  user  to  set  the  TYMNET  delay
  parameter "B" to a certain value.  The format of the command is

          B <value>

          <value> may be any integer of:
          0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

  This will set the minimum unit delay that will be used.

Commands and Descriptions


                                   C

       The C  command  allows  the  user  to  set  the  TYMNET  delay
  parameter "C" to a certain value.  The format of the command is

          C <value>

          <value> may be any integer of:
          0,1,2,3,4,5,7,10,14,19,26,36,50,69,95,131


                             CAPABILITIES

       The CAPABILITIES command gives the user a description  of  TIO
  capabilities.  It has no options.


                                CHARGES

       The CHARGES command details additional costs incurred  by  the
  user by the running of TIO.  TIO carries no premium charges.


                                 CRLF

       The CRLF command allows the user to specify whether or not his
  terminal  automatically  returns  when  line  overwrap occurs.  The
  format of the command is

          CRLF <option>

          <option> may be any one of the following:
                  ON      cr-lf output by computer on line overwrap
                  OFF     cr-lf never output on line overwrap

  See the "WIDTH" command also.


                                 DELAY

       The DELAY command allows  the  user  to  specify  whether  the
  carriage  delay  occurs  after  a  line  feed  is output or after a
  carriage return is output.  The format of the command is

          DELAY <option>

          <option> may be any one of the following:
                  lf      delay will occur after a line feed output
                  cr      delay will occur after a carriage return

Commands and Descriptions


   output
                                EXPLAIN

       The EXPLAIN command allows the user to interrogate  TIO.   The
  format of the command is

          EXPLAIN <command-name>

          <command-name> may be any valid TIO command

  Detailed instructions will be  output  for  any  command  given  to
  EXPLAIN.  For example,

          1: EXPLAIN DELAY

          THIS COMMAND DETERMINES WHETHER THE CARRIAGE DELAY (IF ANY)
   OCCURS
          AFTER A LINE FEED IS OUTPUT OR AFTER A CARRIAGE RETURN IS
   OUTPUT.
          FORMAT OF THE COMMAND IS:

          DELAY LF        DELAY WILL OCCUR AFTER A LINE FEED OUTPUT
          DELAY CR        DELAY WILL OCCUR AFTER A CARRIAGE RETURN
   OUTPUT


                                  FDX

       The FDX command will put the computer into  FULL-DUPLEX  mode.
  Characters  will  be  echoed  by the computer as they are accepted.
  This is the normal mode of operation.


                                 FFILL

       The FFILL command allows the user  to  set  the  filler  count
  which  is used when form feeds are output to the user's terminal as
  a control-l or a control-k.  This depends on  the  setting  of  the
  'FORM'  command.  If form feed expansion is not done, control-l and
  control-k are output directly to the user's terminal.  When one  of
  these   characters  is  output,  the  computer  will  wait  "FFILL"
  characters before outputting another characters.  This is  to  wait
  for  the  user's  terminal  to  mechanically  perform the form feed
  function.  The format of the command is

          FFILL <value>

          <value> may be any integer of:
          0,1,2,3













Tymshare TYMCOM-X manual for TIO                               PAGE   6
Commands and Descriptions


  The larger the value of FFILL, the longer the pause will be after a
  form feed is output.


                                FILLER

       The FILLER command allows the users to assign the  same  value
  to  FFILL  and TABFILL with one command.  The format of the command
  is

          FILLER <value>

          <value> may be any integer of:
          0,1,2,3

  See "FFILL" and "TABFILL" for details.


                              FULLDUPLEX

       The FULLDUPLEX command will put the computer into  FULL-DUPLEX
  mode.   Characters  will  be  echoed  by  the  computer as they are
  accepted.  This is the normal mode of operation.


                              HALFDUPLEX

       The HALFDUPLEX command will put the computer into  HALF-DUPLEX
  mode.   Characters  will  not  be  echoed  by the computer with the
  exception of a line-feed after every user typed carriage return.


                                  HDX

       The HDX command will put the computer into  HALF-DUPLEX  mode.
  Characters will not be echoed by the computer with the exception of
  a line-feed after every user typed carriage return.


                                 HELP

       The HELP command may be  typed  at  any  point  in  a  command
  string.  It will cause a detailed list of options that are valid in
  place of the HELP command to be typed on the user's terminal.   For
  example,

          1: DELAY HELP

Commands and Descriptions


          SHOULD BE:
          DELAY <OPTION>

          <OPTION> MAY BE ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
          LF      DELAY (IF ANY) WILL OCCUR AFTER A LF
          CR      DELAY (IF ANY) WILL OCCUR AFTER A CR

  This indicates that "LF" and "CR" are the two valid options for the
  "DELAY" command (DELAY LF or DELAY CR).


                                  ID

       The ID command  allows  the  user  to  set  input  and  output
  parameters either by login id characters or baud rates.  The format
  of the command is

          id <id1>,[<id2>]

          <id1> and <id2> may be any one of the following:
          a,b,c,d,e,f,g,j,110,150,300,400,600,1200

          where: alphabetic characters are login id characters
                 numeric values are baud rates

  If <id2> is not given, <id1>  is  used  to  set  input  and  output
  parameters;  otherwise,  <id1>  is used to set input parameters and
  <id2> is used to set output parameters.  For example,

          1: id 300,i

          says: input rate is 300 baud, and output rate is that
                which goes along with the "i" login id character.
