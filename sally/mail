Re plural of virus and English and Latin dictionaries...

There was a ***long*** discussion of this on a conference disk where I
work (IBM).  The conference concerns the English language, as well as others.
The final word on the subject was that 'virus' does *not* have a Latin
plural.  The only acceptable plural of 'virus' is 'viruses'.

Brad,
  Below is a *warranty card* from McDonnell Douglas that a friend gave to
  me.  It should be printed out on two pages, so I put '(form feed)' in where
  a CTRL-L should go.  Enjoy! :-)
