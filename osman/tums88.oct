Subject: re: QIKSAV 

Just a note... it will have to be done the right way, that is, writing
to (SYS)SPAGES.SYS as a file doesn't work as long as we have the no-delete
bit set in the RIB, ... so, to write into SPAGES, I have to figure out the
geometry of the disks, and verify in the RIB of SPAGES that they match
on each unit, then use super-mapping to write into SPAGES.  Sigh..
 a little more work than just writing into a file in update mode....

Subject: re: SPAGES.SYS writing 

Joe,
  There is "sort of" a way to get the page information for SPAGES.SYS
without without too much trouble...

  VDSKPT AC,    ; where ac/ memory page

  First, we lookup SPAGES.SYS to get the size.
  Then we do a DSKCHR on the STR to get the # pages in STR and each UNIT.
  The number of units is deduceable from the DSKCHR info.
  The size of SPAGES div #-UNITS = 2 times pages per cylinder and gives
      the offset into SPAGES per unit.
  This offset div 2 = Max pages we want to write per unit, thereby only
      using 1 cylinder of the 2 on each unit that SPAGES uses.
  Then we do CHANIO .chMFP each of the pages we wish to scribble in
      for safety's sake (and we do want to compare info later).
  Now that it's mapped, we use VDSKPT to get the retrieval pointer on disk
      for each page "before" we overwrite it.
  To overwrite it, we take the retrieval pointer, calculate the appropriate
      structure page that matches the <UNIT>B16+<PAGE> and super-map that
      page read/write and then scribble in it and unmap both pages.

**This is still much less work than deciphering rib data structures in a
  user program, and depending on things that ONLY the monitor and DSKCLN
  ought to know in the first place!

Craig,
  What this means is that writing SPAGES is simple and straight-forward and
the extra steps taken here will provide greater reliability that QIKSAV will
NOT damage anything on the disk.  If SPAGES doesn't exist, it will report it
as such and maybe write a disk file, but won't just go scribbling on various
unknown cylinders, corrupting the file system in an effor to save it.

Subject: TITO statistics 

Note: TXS confidential

I have the map from disk and write to tape portion of TITO working, tested
and benchmarked against the standard (SYS)TITO.  I had directories made using
(SYS)TITO of all tapes written with both versions of TITO.

On system 33, with a minimal load (not a controlled single user environment)
Saving (SYS)*.* took 20 minutes with TITO
                took  8 minutes with TITO-P

On system 32, with the static sys-jobs (again not completely controlled)
Saving ALL (for 1 tape) took 52 minutes with TITO
                        took 18 minutes with TITO-P
                        took 17 minutes with TITO-P (minor change to loop)

All times are approximate... within one-minute.

TITO-P is approximately 3 times faster than TITO.

******************************************************************************
 
Within the next 30 days, several OnTyme accounts in NSC and Diversified will be
restructured.  This is being done to reduce the number of accounts and to
provide account names that are more intuitive.
 
Please pay close attention to any memos sent out to you regarding these changes.
You will receive more specific information, including a diagram of the affected
accounts, by the end of next week.
 
Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: SYSDAT, SYSSHO 

A newer version of SYSDAT and SYSSHO have been propagated to (CARL) on
all KL-10s in TYMNET.  Didn't do B39 or the 2020's except :17.

SYSDAT corrects a bug which overwrote the high-order 5 bits of the 12-bit
apr serial number with ones in the data.

SYSSHO now displays a new field after the memory usage "m%%" which is the
percentage of user memory required to meet the need of memory usage.  It
contains a slight hack, assuming the size of the running monitor is the size
to deduct from the amount of physical memory available for each sample, to
determine user available memory.



Note:  This change is in response to monitoring D56 when they get to adding
more memory.  For Sept.. the approx. highest usage was 350%, with the normal
usage above 150%, only a few periods that fell below 100%.

The version running everywhere was dated Aug-79.  It used <JRST .-1> to
keep polling for incoming characters.  There was a version in SSPAMSYM
dated Aug-82, but it had 3 problems.
1. It was loaded with a version of PAM.MAC that had the debugswitch set.
   This made it incompatible with the existing PAM.LOW, and caused I/O
   to unassigned channel due to mismatch.
2. The ACs weren't defined consistently.
3. The routine to do waiting did not have 2 <SOS (P)> instructions to
   retry the AUXCAL that read in characters.

The new version is running everywhere - it hibernates while waiting for input.

                     HOW DO I FIGURE OUT THE NEW IDS?
                     ********************************


              To figure out a new ID, merely change the OLD 
                   account name to the NEW account name




         For example, Dick Kovach's ID is FIN.R/KOVACH.  His new ID,
         starting 9-26, will be NSC.R/KOVACH.  

                     OLD ONTYME ID === > FIN.R/KOVACH
                     NEW ONTYME ID === > NSC.R/KOVACH



         Another example is Dick Gunther's ID.  His new ID, starting 10-3
         will be NSCMS.D/GUNTHER.

Osman,
  After you left on Thursday, I talked to Joe and here is what we decided
to do with who was on-call.

Scheduled: 9/12- 9/18 Joe     Actual:  9/12- 9/14 Joe   M -W  3
           9/19- 9/25 Carl    Actual:  9/15- 9/21 Carl  Th-W  7
           9/26-10/02 Osman   Actual:  9/22-10/02 Joe   Th-W  7 Th-Sn 4
          10/03-10/09 Joe     Actual: 10/03-10/09 Osman M -Sn 7
          10/10-10/16 Carl    --back on schedule--      M -Sn 7

Since I am going to be off Th-Sn with visiting relatives, I shifted my week
back 4 days, with Joe taking the first 3 and last 4 days of his scheduled
week a week apart.

Then, since we're both going to be out-of-town for 3 1/2 days, Joe will swap
with your scheduled week.  This gives Joe a week and 1/2 at once, but keeps
the swap uncomplicated and gets us back on schedule.

This also allows me to be available to go to St. Louis for a couple of days
in the first week of October.

So, I am on call!

/Carl

     Use the MDC OnTyme User Directory to locate OnTyme IDs!
 
 
The MDC OnTyme User Directory consolidates account directories
each OnTyme Account Supervisor maintains.  To simplify look up,
you no longer have to know the user's account!
 
 
   To look up an employee's OnTyme ID, when accessing OnTyme 
   (Choose Manual Access if you are using ISGMail), merely type
 
                  :EXEC *** DIRECTORY [RETURN]
 
   Wait for the prompts and you are then asked to identify 
   the person.  Whenever you use the Directory, you have 
   three times to request OnTyme IDs.  After this, you are
   logged out of the Directory and back into OnTyme.  If 
   you are unable to locate a person's ID, let them know.
   It is possible the Supervisor* needs to add the person to
   his or her directory.
 
 
We think you will find the MDC OnTyme User Directory a valuable 
tool, especially useful during the OnTyme restructuring transition 
taking place during the next few weeks.

Subject: DIVERSIFIED RESTRUCTURE 

                       OnTyme Account Restructuring


    This is to advise you that the ISGFM account will be phased out.
    There are some new Diversified accounts available, beginning Monday,
    9-26.  They are as follows :

         RSC        Remote Services Center
                    [Includes Mr. Calvert]

         MPD        Manufacturing, Permac & Distribution

         ISE        Information Systems Engineering


The restructure only affects the account name.  For instance, Bill McKay's
OnTyme ID is currently ISGFM.B/MCKAY.  Starting Monday, his new ID will be
RSC.B/MCKAY.  In the same way, Kathy Waddell's OnTyme ID is currently
IPC.K/WADDELL.  Her new ID will be ISE.K/WADDELL.


    In addition, the entire account, MDCSS, will be renamed to the new
    account, MDCIS.  On Monday, you must send your OnTyme's using the new
    account.


    For instance, Paul Scholten's current ID is MDCSS.P/SCHOLTEN.  His new
    ID will be MDCIS.P/SCHOLTEN.


        ** WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE DURING THIS TRANSITION **

24-Sep-88 20:15/Joe
Contact:  TRW Opertaions, Tina Ngo, (714)786-3145(home?) (714)385-5522
Problem:  TRW had a head crash on DSKB0 and DSKB1 at 5:14pm Friday the 23rd.
          After aligning new heads and formatting new packs, "the FE was
          unable to IPL the system".  This call was a warning from Tina
          that she might need assistance in rebuilding the system.
          I.e. this is not yet a hotline call, but may turn into one.

---------------
My personal procedure is to put something into (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG before
working on the call, whenever possible.  This is so that if anyone is
curious as to what is going on can find the information on the first page
of (M33)HOTLIN.LOG on system F33.  After the call is closed, I take the
message verbatim, extract it into HOTLIN.TMP, and then use TUMS to send
it to MONITOR.

Subject: QIKSAV testing 

A version of QIKSAV is now available for testing.

IT writes the following information into the first "n" pages of
(SYS)SPAGES.SYS:

  A directory
  HOME Page
  HOME.SYS RIB
  SAT.SYS  RIB
  [1,1]UFD RIB
  [1,4]UFD RIB

The directory is in sixbit and is self explanatory for the
informed user/repair-person.

At present, if unit 0 is clobbered, so is the data, since it
is ONLY written once.  However, this is a major improvement
over not being written at all!!! :-)

Subject: VUE installation 

As part of my trip to St. Louis, I took a couple of tapes with me.
(Actually one tape, but copies of 5 tapes on it with MTCOPY)...

Anyway, tonight I installed a copy of VUE (Yes! VUE not FINE!)

There's also a copy of FINE as it existed at University of Arizona in 1980
on SYS:FINE.EXE but the key bindings are somewhat different than PEAK or VUE.


I had a copy of the preliminary version of VUE as originally installed as
FINE on the TYMCOM-X systems on the tape.  I changed a few of the key bindings
to reflect the bindings of the current VUE, and put it on SYS as VUE.EXE.

To run it:

    .R VUE;filename                   where filename is the file to edit


The only complications are with ^S through TYMNET.  ^S^S^Q works in-place of
any single ^S as needed.  I also added ^XS as a binding = ^X^S just for ease.
Help is ^X?  and mind you this is an OLD OLD version of VUE.  Many features
do not work (eg. $X function doesn't work)

Joe:  I have SED and other things on the tape if you want to install them.
      I onl;y put up VUE so I can work 3-5x faster on things than I can using
      TECO or SOS.

X17 SPECIAL BACKUP
System X17 (RM03) down due to garbage in page 0 (KS-boot pointer) and
garbage in RIB to DSKCLN.SAV.  Booted from tape, came up in CONSOLE mode
to run (SYS)DSKCLN.107 in CHECK mode.  "DELETE (SYS)DSKCLN.SAV/BAD" and
"RENAME (SYS)DSKCLN.107,(SYS)DSKCLN.SAV".  After full DSKCLN, was able
to restore most of the files in (SYS)RECOV.SYS, but left (CARL)FSLAVE.SAV
and (CARL)MT.SAV alone.  DSKCLN did not detect all files damaged by MUP
because the new file that overlapped the old file got deleted before DSKCLN
had a chance to run (001RPG.TMP in particular).

Two incremental saves have been done: (NOBACKUP)INC11.DIR on 19-Oct-88 and
(NOBACKUP)INC12.DIR on 21-Oct-88.

  I put some of the things from my tape on PUSH:[1,2,*] including 2 versions
of SED (POssibly the same version? I didn't look) in [1,2,sed] and [1,2,sed,nih]
fo you to look over.

  PUSH:[1,2,SYS] has the system files from GALLAUDET, with many of the .EXE

Subject: OHTFUL = Spurious usermode parity error. 

If the PC was in usermode at the time a parity error was detected and the
memory scan routine can't find the word with the parity error, all of the
user's core is marked as bad.  Due to the unfortunate way that "bad" is
reported as having a disk I/O error, all these pages get stored in the OHT
(Output Hash Table).  If the user's core image had more that 63 pages, we
die with OHTFUL.  To check for this condition in the crash, look at:
  PARPC = PC from CH1 at time of parity error.  10000 in LH if user mode
  SAVERA = nonzero if parity error
  SAVSB0+1 = SBUS diag.

CRA013, CRA014, and CRA015 on X32 match this description.

Subject: X32 Mail host 

Hi gang,

  Two problems have come to mind in regards to using system X32 as a
mail host (other than the obvious: what to do when it's being used as the
spare hardware for some other system)...

  1)  mail names will be limited to 12 characters
      R/Williamson  works fine = 12 chars
      C/Longfeathers  is a couple of characters long = 14 chars

  2)  TUMS currently relies on "user/filename" for archive files, lists,
      exec files and other special things.  Thus, C/BALTRUNAS looks for
      (C)BALTRU.TUM

      We could hack TUMS to get around this, but it may not be worthwhile
      since it would break the features it relies upon.
      This means we'd have to look at a different way to specify names and
      that means re-training people.

When I bring the spare units that are marked SPARE on-line, should they be
in READ/WRITE or READ mode.

Thanks Rick

What makes this program interesting?  Do you know what it does?
char*p="char*p=%c%s%c;main(){printf(p,34,p,34);}";main(){printf(p,34,p,34);}

Subject: The null job is not running on D34. 

SY says that D34 is 100% used.  it lies.  
Many user jobs in the RN queue are not getting any run time, not even the
null job.  PAM has 11 hours of idle time; meaning it has not executed any UUOs
during that time even though it is in a RN state.  Since it is not racking
up TRUs, it is not getting any CPU time.  And when CHKPNT gets stuck, all
user programs eventually grind to a halt in the AC state, waiting on the
ACT: device.  Last night I attached to CHKPNT but it did not output its
"CHKPNT shutting down" message because it was stuck in this funny RN state.

Subject: WAIT1.PAT in X32-P035/D08-1 

I installed WAIT1.PAT in NEWMON on X32 - it runs with no problem.
The patch needs to be applied to D34 if they did not find any hardware
problems.  /Joe
