   BPA16 SAYS IT GOES OFFLINE AND BACK ONLINE AGAIN. THIS HAPPENS
   AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
   NEVER ANY THUNGS. THE SYSTEM CAME UP WITH 2 FILES THAT LOST

Joe;

I have no knowledge of what you todl FSC to do or not to do.  I
do not know what operator you talked too.  What operator did you talk
too?

I was called and asked if I wanted to do anything on the system.  I told them
No.  I said if FSC had return the sytem to them to bring it up.

One would think they would do what was asked of them.

DSKCLN reported errors of units 6, 21, 1, 5, 12, 4, 7, 3, 2, 14, 10
