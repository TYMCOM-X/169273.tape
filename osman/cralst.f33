  The crash of F33 seems to have been an EBUS induced crash because it
thought that it got a bad key from the PDP.  Can't tell much more than
that now.

The AR.ARX reported in CRA001 is a side effect of a memory parity error.
The other AR.ARX crashes are very consistent.

  1) The KL gets a page fault with code 37, ARX failure while in EXEC mode.
  2) The virtual memory address reported matches the previous instruction.
  3) The PC of the page fault is 122163, at TIMADJ+46 in CLOCK1.
  4) The instruction at the PC is an ADD instruction, opcode 270.
  5) The instruction in the ARX (stored in AC 1 of block 7) has opcode 250.
  6) The ARX got bad parity when the stored instruction changed from 270 to 250.

One explanation would be that the bad parity was deteced when the ARX fetched
the instruction from cache.  If this is true, then the portion of cache which
holds words for locations xxx163 is suspect.  In particular, bit 4 of word 3
in group 034, in all 4 quadrants.

CRA006 is just like all the other AR.ARX crashes mentioned in the message from
JMS on 14-Jun-88 at 17:36.  Bad parity detected in the ARX when opcode 270
lost a bit and became opcode 250.  The previous instruction was MUL T1,-1(P).
I believe that the MUL instruction uses the ARX; maybe that's significant.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, System 33, (415)498-2588
Problem:  System when down with RIBBRP on (EBUS)[3,317016].UFD and Mike wanted
          to know how serious it was.  System 54 was scheduled to be down
          for the conversion to pages at 20:00 and System 33 was supposed to
          be up all weekend.  He was worried about bad RIB in UFD.
Action:   Had them bring the system up MANUAL so I could check the UFD.
          No RIB errors were found.  Considerring that I had 5 jobs GFD'd
          to EBUS when it went down, it might have been a bad RIB pointer
          in a DDB, meaning everything on disk was good.  Told them to force
          a FAST DSKCLN so that it would finish before D54 was scheduled down.
