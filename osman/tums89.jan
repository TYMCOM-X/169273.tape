--------------------------------------------------------------------------
     System 29 will be leaving timesharing permanently on Friday,
Dec. 16, 1988 at 1700 PST.

     Users who are valid exclusively on F-29 will be moved to Fremont's
F-74 by RPM on 12-16.  All other users will be responsible for moving
their OWN files to another PDP-10 system they are valid on.

     It has not yet been determined when AT&T users will be moving to 
system 74.  The appropriate people will be contacted when it has been
decided.

     Tapes assigned to F-29 will be transferred to F-74 unless users
request an alternate system.  Please type file (TAPEDIR:74)TAPES.29
for a list of usernames/tapes currently assigned to system 29.

     If you have any questions I can be reached at (415)498-2557 or
via Ontyme at IPC.L/MORRIS.


Thank you,
Landa/RPM

Joe,
  I did a PPN comparison of F29 against F74 and all PPNs on F29 appear
on F74.  If you haven't done this already (I guess I ought to read my
mail before I send this), I suggest that we have operations make a gan-3
tape with tito... STORE ALL GAN 3 ... and then restore it all to F74.

The complications are: (MAIL) and (JMS)

I will have them store all gan 3 from F29 and then restore all using
mold old new  to keep the new things on 74, and have them send us the
tty output so we can have a record of those things which didn't copy
in case we have a version discrepancy due to work on both machines.

However, I will await a sign {pronounced sigh} from you before sending
the request... or you may send the request.  What say you?

Subject: F22 Crashes, CRA002 & CRA003 

Rick,
  Both crashes were at NULARQ which indicates that the scheduler was in
the process of re-queueing a job and found thet the job number was 0.
The crashes both indicate that J and JOB the two places the monitor keeps
the job number were zero.  THis cannot normally happen and it is a good
indication that the hardware is suspect.  Sometimes when memory is flakey
the hardware gets a zero when in fact memory contains a different value.
In my opinion this is what happenned.

  Joe or Osman may have something to add... if not, the best thing is for
FSC to continue to check out the hardware, memory and data path to see
if they can cause a hard failure.

Does anyone know of a UNIX utility that will read tapes made with the
the TOPS-20 DUMPER utility. A new faculty member here has several tapes 
written with both the DUMPER utility and the TOPS-10 BACKUP utility. He 
now wishes to read them onto a UNIX machine. Having never been a TOPS-20
installation, we have never had to deal with such a conversion before. Most
of the tapes are many years old, so having them rewritten in a more 
compatible format is not an option.

Alternately, a utility to read such tapes onto a CDC Cyber (running NOS) or 
IBM VM System would do. A a last resort, finding a TOPS-20 site, with Internet 
access, willing to read the tape for us would do.

Subject: Available memory for slots in X32's base. 

Memory requirements of the PDP-10 bases.

The current set of BND files use 809k of core.  Only 215k bytes are unused.

Node code requires a minimum of 235k, anything above that amount is used for
buffers (needed by the REBUILD option).  All the TYM files have S0CORE
to 350k.  (B39 had problems with rebuilding circuits with less than 300set

The EBUS code in slot 1 needs only 10k, but an additional 256k is allocated
if the option EBDUMP is selected.  This memory is for dumping the 68K's
memory into the Engine to analyze crash dumps.  Nobody uses this option.

Slot 2 had 100k allocated, but needs only 10k for storing the 68K code.

I juggled the memory configurations around, and came up with the following:

Slot  Low  High Core  Use
FF  00000 177FF  93k  Kernel (DDT host 1294)
 0  17800 55FFF 250k  Node Code (XRAY host 1294)
 1  56000 587FF  10k  EBUS, host 32
 2  58800 5C7FF  16k  68000 code for EBUS
 3  5C800 617FF  20k  Slot for Joe, host 24
 4  61800 667FF  20k  Slot for Carl, host 28
 5  66800 6B7FF  20k  Slot for Osman, host 57
 6  6B800 F07FF 532k  Big slot, host 930 (512k of buffer)
    F0800 FFFFF       unused

Subject: ref: EBUS 

I got a call on Friday from someone in TYMNET (I forget her name at the
moment, anyway) trying to determine exactly WHO is responsible for the
maintenance of EBUS and/or IPI, because there is some need to have the
source code moved/archived/translated to SUN.

I also recall Joe mentioning that porting EBUS to SUN s a waste, since
it is only necessary as long as the PDP-10's are around anyway...

Anyway, I wanted to mention this to everyone since, this is YET ANOTHER
area that we can make a precedence for field service company.

/Carl

PS. If I didn't make it clear, I was told that she was told that no one in
    NTD is responsible for EBUS and may already think that we are the
    people that maintain it.  (However, THAT may not be official, YET!)

Joe:  Comment?  Did she also call you?  I gave her your number in bldg. F.

The Validations Department is in the process of updating our current infor-

We appreciate your cooperation, and we hope you understand that this is a
necessary step to improve the security of our Network. Basically, it will 
provide accountability, and will give us immediate access to the person that
owns the status name.

This security enhancement is particularly significant in light of the recent
unfortunate publicity about Tymnet Security practices. Call me (X7316) if
you'd like a copy of the article.



We are requesting that anyone who currently has a status name, run our exec
** license.req. This exec will prompt you for the information that we need
in order to update our files. It will be available on or before 12-12-88.

People who have not provided the required information by January 13,1989,
will be barred from setting license after that date.

Node 6760, the base for our 2020 host X14, has been upgraded from an LSI-11/03
to an 11/23.  I didn't even have to change SV6760.BND - it loaded the old code
with no problems.  The node has 2 lines running at 9600 baud, the line to
neighbor node 5561 is active with no errors.

The line to neighbor node 5416 is suspended because that node has no XLINKs
and is not configured to talk to node 6760.  We cannot really exersize this
configuration unless TYMNET changes the TYM file for node 5416 and adds an
additional TIILNK for 6760.

In-reply-to: your message of Tue, 17 Jan 89 15:43:24 PST

The MAPAL1 stopcode in CRA001.SAV is a result of the Monitor getting confused
as to which pages were available.  It is a software problem that was cleared
up by running DSKCLN.  Please let us know if it occurs again.

Subject: Analysis of TRW's MAPAL1 crash. 

LOGINN was running and did an INBUF uuo which caused the low-seg to be
expanded to handle the input buffers.  The kernel did a VCREAT uuo, asking
for 2 writeable pages starting at user virtual page 2.  One page was
allocated and a second one contiguous to the first was requested.  The
MAPAL1 occured when PCBIO was asked to read a bogus SAT page for SWAMP.

Something went wrong in GETPAG while allocating the first page.  It returned
200004,,467125 which is an error; the highest page on an RP06 is 227161 octal.
The bogus disk address was found in ac M and in the UPT and UPT+UPTLMA.
When GETPAG was called the second time, is took the bogus disk address,
calculated the address where the STT would be if the disk had that many
pages, and read random garbage as an STT entry.  It read this garbage as
if it were a retreival pointer and passed it on to PCBIO.  The MAPAL1 crash
is a result of RBREAL not being set on this garbage pointer.

There was no bounds checking in the GETSTT routine in SWAMP.  I put in a
check against UNIPAG.  This will fix this particular MAPAL1 scenario but
until the problem in GETPAG is found, bad data can still get put into the
UPT.  That will cause a PAGPOR (page out of range) stopcode when the page
is faulted in.

I have not checked the logic in GETPAG to find out why it could return a
bogus value.  It may have been that the very last SAT page of the last
unit was in-core and completely full (and the routine fell off the end
of DSKB).			/Joe

Subject: TAUX reports strangely in middle of sup swap. 

At 00:05 I tried to TAUX to XRAY:8671 to look at X32's base from F33.
It kept saying "access barred".  I tried from X14, which said "no such host".
I tried from D25, and got a long delay.  Trying to build a new circuit from
the mux produced "ISIS unable to complete request".  That's when I realized
it was 3 very different symptoms of the same problem.  The SUP took over
F33's base at 00:06:29 PST and D25's base at 02:06:32 CST, at which time
the TAUX on D25 finally got through.

Moral of the story: If the network is acting crazy, try again in 30 seconds.

To all of you...

  I asked at the desk, and they do have copies of the notes/slides used
for the class.  I do not (yet) know what they want (cost) for additional
copies.

  However, if we assune, MDFSCO is purchasing them.. (or they are free? which
I sincerely doubt)... Who wants a copy, (how many do we want?)

  I will check with Craig at lunchtime (Wednesday) and get the copies
before the class is over... presumably, I will be able to quote the price
at that time.

/Carl
PS  Let Craig know if you want a copy... /Carl

Subject: SETOP :: OPPS 

Vida & Cynthia,
  As per our discussion on Friday, OPPS has now been modified to allow
users to change their OPER passwords and update the NEW setop data files.
OPPS is now ONLY on system D34.

  A possibly new feature is that a manager need not run SETOP just to
change a user's OPER password, whereas previously you were only allowed
to change your own password with OPPS.  It now validates the user by
requesting an opername and password, then allows the user to change any
opername that is on that user's particular branch.
