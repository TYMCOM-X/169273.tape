Subject: "I took the liberty of editing"... 

I took the liberty of editing your MAIL.FWD on 930.  I added the
"!" in front of the name so you don't have to worry about forwarding
loops between 930 and 35.  For example, !JMS@C35 is the same as
JMS@C35 except that with the "!" it will suppress any further forwarding.
This ony works if the destination is a Tymcom-X.  -Bill

Subject: P035/C Monitor Release .. 


	This is an announcement of official release of "Monitor Version
P035/C".  Included with this mail is a brief document describing the
significant changes and improvements made to the monitor.

	(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all PDP-10 systems now have the P035/C
monitor.  This monitor is already tested.  All of Fremont D.C.
PDP-10's have been running with this monitor since July.

	Any questions or comments please call (408)922-6224 and ask for
Carl Baltrunas, Dennis Coffey, Joe Smith or Osman Guven.  Thank you.
Significant changes to the TYMCOM-X Operating System.           10-Aug-87

   Part 1:  Features in P035/C that are new since P035/B.
   Part 2:  Changes from P034/P to P035/A to P035/B.

              Changes from P035/B to P035/C

Bug fixes:

 o  Fixed one cause of FILAMO crashes on a heavily loaded system.

 o  Fixed IME crash caused by inactivity timer (SET AUTOLOGOUT command).

 o  Fixed most cases of "serious restart error while writing to HOM pages".

 o  Fixed KAF crash from tape read errors caused by ONTYME accounting data.

 o  JBTUID is now cleared on logout so XEXEC can keep track of its jobs.


Support for new disk hardware:

 o  64 disks can be defined as 8 strings on 4 logical controllers.
    The current maximum supported configurations are 32 disks with 128 jobs,
    48 disks with 80 jobs, or 64 disks with 32 jobs.

 o  4 strings of disks can be connected to a single Storage Control Unit
    (Memorex 3674 or 3676).

 o  Double capacity disks (Memorex 3652) are supported and appear as two
    logical 3650 units.

New features for Operators:

 o  More information is reported about amount of memory on-line.

 o  The unit-IDs and DSKB logical unit numbers of all on-line disks are
    reported when the system comes up.

 o  The SET KSYS command has been added to tell XEXEC when to stop
    scheduling SUBMIT jobs.  (This function will be added to TAKEIT soon).


Performance improvement:

 o  RIBs to new files are always created on the unit with the most space.
    This distributes files more evenly which speeds up DSKCLN.


System reliability:

 o  AR/ARX parity error trapping is now supported.  It can be enabled from
    KLDCP by using the command "PE 36".

 o  BAT (Bad-page Allocation Table) now works.  Any disk page with a read or
    write error gets logged in the BAT page.  If it is not already marked
    there, the INFO stopcode BADPAG is output to the CTY.  To get a list of
    bad pages, use "TYPE BAT" when in FILE dialog, or use "RUN (MPL)TYPBAT"
    after the system has come up.

 o  The system can continue running after a single SAT failure, but stops on
    the second SAT failure (in case the disk system has failed).  The two new
    stopcodes are REDSAT (which means a hard read error occured while trying
    to read in a SAT), and SAT2ND (which means a 2nd SAT was detected bad).
    The old stopcode BADSAT means the count of bits in the SAT is incorrect,
    and WRTSAT means a hard write error occured while trying to write a SAT.

 o  More information is output whenever unrecognizable SA10 interrupts occur.
    Stopcode SAXINY is printed when an unknown disk controller interrupts.


More information stored in crash dumps for analysis:

 o  Locations ERASTA, SBDST1, and SBDST2 now always set up with S-bus diags
    for all types of crashes.

 o  Disk operations and status bits are stored in a circular buffer for
    tracking down problems with SA10/IBM disk system.

 o  All output to the CTY is stored in a circular buffer and can be read
    from a crash dump.  The operator's commands to ONCE are included also.


[End of P035/C changes - P035/B changes are included here for reference]
Significant changes to TYMCOM-X between P034/P and P035/B      3-Aug-87

Bug fixes:

  1)  Fixed ILLINS crashes when account supervisor logs out another job.

  2)  Fixed host initiated base crash when we sent it bad data.

  3)  Fixed ancient bug where one page per unit would not be correctly
      restored after an ASP rebuild.

  4)  Fixed the bug that caused the REFRESH option to create a file with
      a bad RIB.  This problem triggered a bug in DSKCLN and caused the
      rash of FILAUS crashes on 3650 disks.  NOTE: This monitor requires
      DSKCLN version 36J(103) or later.


Performance improvements:

  1)  The scheduler is now more responsive to interactive users.

New features for General Users:

  1)  TYMNET parameter "D" and KATAKANA mode now properly recognized.
      The old method of "SET TTY TYPE 1" still works for Japanese customers.

  2)  The SET TTY TYPE and TERMINAL TYPE commands also accept a six character
      name, such as VT100, TYM444, etc.

  3)  The SUBMIT command was added - it replaces PERP and DEFER.

  4)  The TYMVALIDATE command was added to let customers validate new users.

  5)  Error message such as "Device not avaliable" now output the correct
      device name (instead of TTY name).

  6)  The Control-T display (enabled by TTY RTCOMP in PDP mode) now outputs
      the name of the program being run and last known PC (Program Counter).

  7)  In addition to the job number, the PJOB command now prints the user
      name and GFD name.  This is a quick way for a user to verify which
      directory and which system the user is connected to.

  8)  The VERSION command outputs the name of the current program and decodes
      the version number.

  9)  The HELP command has been changed to output help on a particular program
      or a list of available topics.  For instance, "HELP DIFFER" gives help
      on the DIFFER command, "HELP *" lists the names of all help files and
      the names of all monitor commands.


New messages printed on the CTY:

  1)  Whenever the system date or time is changed, it is done so gradually and
      a message "Date/time is now ..." is output when the adjustment is done.

  2)  The time of day is reset whenever a new TYMNET supervisor takes over.
      If the change is more than 60 minutes, the system is automatically SHUT.

  3)  Most messages to the CTY are stamped with the Data Center's time zone.

  4)  The BIGBEN message comes out every four hours and prints the system
      name and the number of pages free on DSKB.  If DSKB gets below 1000
      pages, the message comes out every 10 minutes.

  5)  INFO stopcodes, EVENT stopcodes, and many other CTY messages are also
      sent to the OPR terminal.

  6)  EVENT stopcode NOBASE is output if the base stops talking to the PDP10.


New features for Operators:

  1)  The monitor verifies that it is running on the correct hardware by
      checking the CPU serial number.

  2)  The BOOTS command has been added to ONCE and to FILES so that the
      operator can quickly recover from having loaded the wrong monitor.

  3)  A "146 restart" has been defined.  If depositing 1 in location 30 or
      restarting the CPU at location 147 does not get to BOOTS, "ST 146"
      can be used as a last ditch attempt to get BOOTS loaded so a crash
      dump can be taken without wiping out memory the way "P BOTLOD$" does.

  4)  New command, "SET BIGBEN 120" causes the BIGBEN message to come out
      every 120 minutes (instead of every 240 minutes).

  5)  Anyone with license set can temporarily turn off all license using
      the DISABLE command.  The ENABLE command restores previous license.

  6)  A new license bit has been defined - QM for Queue Manager.  It is used
      only by XEXEC/EXECX/SUBMIT for job processing.


Changes to enhance reliability:

  1)  INFO stopcodes work - system stays running after outputting information.

  2)  System attempts to keep running after the base crashes.

  3)  Files with RIB errors are reported to the CTY.  Hard read errors on RIB
      pages are reported with stopcode RIBHRE, software detected failures are
      reported with RIBERR.

  4)  Cases where the system was stuck in a loop used to be reported as "System
      hung, no output on CTY".  They now show up as stopcode KAF which outputs
      the PC where the system was looping.


Changes important to Systems Programmers:

  1)  SPAGES.SYS is created when the structure is refreshed.

  2)  GETTAB item 12,,5 has date/time the system came up.

  3)  GETTAB tables +31 and +32 have GFD name corresponding to PPN in +2

  4)  Items 127,131,136,154,163 added to CONFIG table 11.

  5)  Add FINASS uuo to assign frame related interrupts.  This allows
      different software interrupt channels to be assigned to each child frame
      for logout-in-child, exit-in-child, interrupt-from-child.

  6)  EDDT takes pointer to commands in AC 0 when started at CCL entry.

  7)  The DSKCHR uuo indicates type of formatting (blocks versus pages).

  8)  The login string for CREAUX is stored in the LDB so that outgoing
      AUX circuits can be traced.

  9)  The DATUUO has been modified to handle additional formats, including
      DEC's one word date/time format.

 10)  LOGIN and CREFRM uuos take additional arguments - LDBLOG and project code.

 11)  New bit in CREFRM tells LOGINN to validate username and password.

 12)  SETUUO function 14 sets the KSYS timer.


Changes to aid Crash Dump Analysis:

  1)  NONAME stopcodes were given names after they occur.

  2)  The current job's context pages are copied to pages 3-5 before dump.

  3)  The DEBUG command added to ONCE to enable debugging routines.

  4)  Special memory locations in low core belonging to the SA10 and to the
      base are copied (snapshot) before creating a crash dump.

  5)  The CPU error bits are decoded in english on APRFAT stopcodes.

  6)  Stopcode type "PATCH" defined for counting times thru patched code.

  7)  CRASH.SAV is created for 8192 pages to be able to save all of core.

  8)  The contents of IRPPDP, ORP620, KEY620, etc are output on base crashes.

SUBJ: 

Why is SSW #4 being set on the TYMCOM-10's?


This switch is not set unless directed by Software Support, FSC, or
Coordinator.




Why are some of the system being brought by Monitor tape?


Hosts are not brought up by tape unless:

     a.  There is a HEAD Crash.  (This necessiates a rebuild)

     b.  The monitor is suspected to be clobbered on the disk, or,

     c.  Boots will not load from disk.

Anytime you bring a host up by tape YOU MU8T include WHY it was done
in your mail.  If there is a problem regarding items b. or c.,
Software Support has to be notified immediately.

No system is to be brought up on the BACKUP monitor without first
clearing it with Software Support or Coordinator.

If a system crashes and does not go to boots, notify software 
support by mail or telephone call.

If a system keeps printing out 'Boots loaded' and does not go to
boots, notify software support.

In other words, anything out of the ordinary, should be brought to the
attention of Software Support of the Tymcom-10 Coordinator.

Thanks for your cooperation.

	Any system running with the P035/C monitor if enabled will
report the AR/ARX parity error.  This would give FSCO personnel more
precise information where in the hardware the error happened.

	AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled by KLDCP.  While
in KLDCP type "PE 36<cr>" to enable it and "PE 16<cr>" to disable it.
Once the AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled on the KL10 you must
bring the system up with P035/C monitor or later.

        Whenever a system crashes, goes down for preventive maintenance,

Subject: MUX 2096 is very slow today. 

As of 9/15, MUX hosts 2096 and 1274 have moved from Engines in Orchard Parkway
to Microengines in South Bay Center.  If you have nodes 2366 or 2367 in your
SWITCH.INI, they should be changed to 3170 and 3345 respectively.  I noticed
the change because host 2096 was having problems.  It was "2*OV" and "****"
meaning the link to its only neighbor was overloaded both directions and
had a high line error rate.  1274 was better.   /Joe

Subject: [1, 4].UFD damaged on F26. 

The first UFD data page for (SYS:26) was on BPA3 page 10010.  That was one
of the pages that PAKCOP could not read, and had pointers to LOGINN and RPG.
DSKCLN aborted with "Error in RIB - wrong hash code" and "Critical file
damaged".  Page 0 was indeed garbage, and the 2nd page for that hash code
was 10.  After zeroing the offending paged and putting 10 in the link at 777,
the UFD was readable.  Having REFLAG, I restored all of SYS until TITO asked
to overwrite a file.  Typing control-C at that point caused TITO to report
that 102 files were processed, exactly one page worth.  F26 is running a
full DSKCLN at this moment.  /Joe

Subject: 98% dialup connection 

I sent mail on X14 describing the events, but you won't see them until you
get to the office.  I returned to the office around 7:30 and generated new
code at Nicholson, reloaded 2346, went to SBC to install the new boards,
went back to Nicholson to get a 2nd DUV11 for 2770, back to SBC to install
it, back to Nicholson to load 2770, back to SBC to check the DZV11 and the
node itself, re-pinned 4 male connectors as cross-overs at the DZV11 panel
and connected the modem with a straight male connector.

The modem line works... however, the code is generated with the DZV11 lines
as Hard-Wired and I need to change the configuration to Dial-Up and reload
2770.  I will try to do that on my way to the office tomorrow (today).  I
will check to see who is on before I yank out the plug on 2770, besides I
will need someone to push the HALT/ENABLE and INIT buttons to put it into
it's bootstrap to load.  (I don't remember how to do it remotely).

I am logged in on the modem, and even though I hung up, the modem will not
because the line isn't a dial-up... this should be fixed when I reload it.
Possibly if I logged out first, the modem would drop the circuit... but that
isn't the case.  I just hung up.

Guys,

    The connection to Tymnet on floor 3 of this building is O.K.!  I've talked
with Dick Kovachs about connecting to Tymnet through his engine.  No problem
-- except that Dick reminded me that we will have to run cable from his
printer room to his phone closet, and from our phone closet to our lab.  He
was concerned about the appearance of the cables.  We might be able to run
them up the (inside of the) walls and through the ceiling, since both ends of
the cable are in rooms with real walls, and I've looked at the ceiling:  it's
typical suspended ceiling.  We could pull cable just like Carl and I did at
Nicholson Way.

    We could be in Tymnet just as soon as the cable is pulled and connected,
and the code is cut!

Subject: FINDIT %10 

A new version of FINDIT.SAV has been installed on SPL and XEXEC on system
F32 and system D35.  The new version %10 of FINDIT uses the argpar package
and has two (2) switches: /CHECKSUM and /QUIET.  The default values are
/CHECKSUM (list checksums in formatted output) and /NOQUIET (allow output
to appear on the terminal when an output file is selected).

Oh yes, this means the output can be sent to a file and /QUIET says to send
it ONLY to the file, not to both the file and the terminal.

/NOCHECKSUM will cause six (6) blanks to be printed instead of the checksum
in the output, and of course, no checksumming of the files will be done.


To Joe:  Since you have RF on the file, I will let you transmit the new
         version to all systems... sufice that it is on 32 and 35 for now.

ARGPAR means that FINDIT can be run at command level.. however, I have made
sure that it acts just like it used to if you say FINDIT or R (SPL)FINDIT.

New FINDIT %10 to be distributed soon...  Now includes ARGPAR.

The only visible change to anyone using FINDIT the old way is that the
line "End of SAIL execution." is no longer printed in any case, and some
programs such as RDIST may look for such a line to terminate processing.
The prompt has NOT been changed, so programs waiting for a second prompt
should not be affected.

                            AR/ARX Parity Error
                            -------------------


        Any system running with the P035/C monitor if enabled will
report the AR/ARX parity error.  This would give FSCO personnel more
precise information where in the hardware the error happened.

        AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled by KLDCP.  While
in KLDCP type "PE 36<cr>" to enable it and "PE 16<cr>" to disable it.
Once the AR/ARX parity error checking is enabled on the KL10 you must
bring the system up with P035/C monitor or later.

        Whenever a system crashes, goes down for preventive maintenance,
or after an ASP Dump, this command will be set by Operators.

        The best time to do it is before you bring the system up
and you are removing Sense Switch #4 if it has been set.

Subject: XEXEC, EXECX and SUBMIT 

There is a new version of each ofthese programs on directory (SUBMIT) on
all systems (as per the result of TELECOPY).  The only change is to the
sources to require (EXECX)XEXFIL.REQ instead of (CARL)VMFILE.REQ to insure
that nothing happens to these products while VMFILE is undergoing major
surgery.

THis versionis also on SYS on system 32.

          I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE APPOINTMENT OF THOM  KELLEY  TO  THE

          POSITION OF MANAGER,  NETWORK RESOURCES,  REPLACING JACK SNAVELY.

          THIS APPOINTMENT IS EFFECTIVE MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28TH, 1987.


          WITH THOM'S APPOINTMENT,  SEVERAL CHANGES WILL BE TAKING PLACE IN

          THE  NETWORK  RESOURCES  GROUP.    FIRST,  THE LOGISTICS PLANNING

          FUNCTION, UNDER FRANK TROGLIONE,  WILL BE MERGED INTO THE NETWORK

          RESOURCES  GROUP AND WILL CONTINUE TO REPORT TO THOM.   THE ORDER

          PROCESSING GROUP, UNDER KATHERINE GOODWIN,  THE PROJECT IMPLEMEN-

          TATION GROUP,  UNDER BERYL AGUA, AND THE RESOURCE CENTER UNDER JO

          HANNAH, WILL ALSO REPORT TO THOM.   THIS COMBINATION OF FUNCTIONS

          WILL BETTER ENABLE US TO ADDRESS THE MATERIAL SUPPORT CONCERNS AS
                                                                Page  2


          THEY RELATE TO ORDER PROCESSING.   PEGGY MACDONALD,  SECRETARY TO

          JACK SNAVELY, WILL ALSO REPORT TO THOM.


          THIS  NEW  NETWORK RESOURCES GROUP WILL THEN REPORT INTACT TO DR.

          A.  S.  (RAJA) RAJARAMAN,  DIRECTOR OF NETWORK  PLANNING.    THIS

          CHANGE  IS  BEING  MADE  TO  CONSOLIDATE  REPORTING FUNCTIONS AND

          PROVIDE  A  MORE  COHESIVE  APPROACH  TO  NETWORK  PLANNING   AND

          IMPLEMENTATION.


          I  TRUST  THAT I CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT FOR BOTH THOM AND RAJA

          AS THEY ASSUME THEIR NEW ASSIGNMENTS.

I saw and talked with Gary Pretty late this afternoon.  I asked him about
completing the sync line for the connection of 2770 to engine 5566.  He is
busy getting async and voice access to those who are moving this weekend, so
he cannot afford the man-hours needed to immediately finish the sync line for
us.

Gary said that our line should be finished early next week.

Subject: Nicholson voice line is 432-1564. 

As of Monday morning, the following phone lines are connected:
  (408)432-1564 = voice line (Pacific Bell beige telephone)
  (408)432-1735 = TXS modem (with Pacific Bell yellow telephone)
  (408)432-0935 = MIS modem (with Radio Shack brown telephone).
The ringer on the Radio Shack phone cannot be heard above the noise of all
the fans, which is why a real telephone is connected to 432-1564.

At this point they called us.  The RIB for [1,4].UFD was marked bad, the
self pointer was corrupted.  Carl and I fixed the RIB pointer using (MPL)FILDDT.
Tried to bring up system in MANUAL mode, but still "?LOGINN not found".
I went to Solar Way, came up REFLAGged to run TSTSUP.  Turned off the bit
which is set when the monitor finds a bad RIB, and (SYS).UFD was then OK.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



To find out what is causing the SLOT OUT OF PORTS ON ND 10350, please
perform the following on F26 each time it happpens:

     Try logging into the system on another terminal.

     If you get SLOTS OUT OF PORTS, do a SYSTAT on home OPER TTY.
     Save this output.

     Log into XRAY on a different terminal and take a snapshot
    of the node (Node 10350).  Save this output.

     Call NETWORK Control and have them RETAKE THE NODE.  Take
     an XRAY snapshot of Node 10350 again.  (Save this output).

     Send all output mentioned above to me.

     Thanks Rick

Joe,
  For the record... reading P035.MEM... it isn't clear what was added in
the monitor for /C01 when what is written says: "Re-instate everything from
P035/A14 and P035/B04 that had been taken out."

  To make it easier, could we get a condensed (or the full version if that
is less work to copy the old text) version of the actual items what were
put back into /C01 so starting at the P035/D heading says what features were
actually added/deleted/etc.  What was taken out is a significant amount of
work and one sentence does not do it justice.

The link between 2770 and 5566 is now working.  From our micronet lines,
we can go to Nicholson or to TYMNET.  From TYMNET, we can get to host 17.
The network supervisor still does not like host 14, so I moved the RP06
to host 17.  Node 2770 crashed, I was able to reload it from ND2770.BND
using LOADII on system 32.  We can build circuits into and out of the
micronet now.  Hurray!!!			/Joe

Subject: (OSP)33035C.SAV rebuilt to handle 4 logical strings. 

I changed CONF33.MAC in M33 and OSP to have "XP DISKS,^D<4*8>" so it could
use all four logical strings (2 physical strings) for 3652 disks.  Note
that 2*8 defines BPA0-7 and BPC0-7 while 4*8 defines BPA0-17 and BPC0-17 when
DSKTYP='3652B'.

There are 4 generic 4-string monitors in SYS on all systems.  They are:
KL3652.SAV, KI3652.SAV, KL3675.SAV, KI3675.SAV.  Carl had Rick use KL3652
(which is stored in (M33:32)KLXC01.SAV) to do the add pack on F33.

I called Fremont to see if the test KL was down for a particular reason.
They said the CTY on F33 started smoking, so they borrowed the LA36 from X32.
I suppose they don't have any other current-loop LA36's available.  /Joe

Subject: F26 survived a base reload! 

F26's base was having problems (many jobs running LOGINN in TI state) and
it was reloaded.  Host 26 was not available thru net because the EBUS base
was waiting for the PDP10 to tell it what host number to use.  From KLDCP
I was able to deposit a host-to-base message in the ORING specifying the
host number and 127 ports.  When ORPPDP was poked, host 26 became visible.
OPER could log in, but others couldn't because the base thought the PDP10
was SHUT but F26 thought it had answered.  Setting SCHED 400000 and SCHED 0
cleared up that misconception.  I will add the code to send the right
messages to SCNSER; it may be worth adding a DDT patch to all P035/C when
it's ready.  /Joe

When it is noticed that this system is reporting "UNABLE TO BUILD
CIRCUITS TO F26", take a SYSTAT of the system on the OPER TTY.
(Save this output)

See if you can log into F26 on another terminal.  If not, log into
XRAY and take a snapshot of the KERNEL HOST 8671.  The password for
this USERNAME has been given to the Dayshift Supervisor.  If it
has not been passed on to you, please see me.

While in XRAY, enter the following commands:

    ND

    CL 30

    NS

    ^Z  (To get out of XRAY)

                                                                Page  2

During the hours of 2000 to 0800, call NETWORK Control to RETAKE the 
Node.  If this doesn't work, recycle the system.

During the hours of 0805 to 1955, call Software Support.

After the system is up, repeat the procedures mentioned above about
logging into XRAY.

Take another SYSTAT of the system.

Send all HARDCOPY to me.

Software Support says we do not need to run the procedures on F26
anymore when it runs out of ports.

They seem to have a handle on the problem and are working to get it
solved.

Subject: Fitting F74 on 3650s 

System 74 has 1,488,920 pages in use + 462,783 free.
Of the 29 disks, only 21.6 are in use, the rest is free space.
Using 3650 disks in blocks, 1488920/103785 = 14.3, too much for 14 disks.
Using 3650 disks in pages,  1488920/116550 = 12.8 with 142780 pages free.
All of 74's current files would fit on two strings of 3650 disks in pages,
but when 2 disks are kept as spares, this means only 10% free space.
If any growth is expected on F74 then it needs 3 strings of 3650 disks.

Joe,
  I called Osman on Saturday and he was still trying to juggle his schedule
to be available on Monday.  His daughter is not expected to be released from
the hospital until Tuesday sometime (if all goes well).

  I told him that we discussed doig the HARDWARE portion of the class without
him and if he couldn't make it, we would do it.  He was relieved, because it
would have been very difficult for him to make it to Fremont before Wednesday.
On Wednesday, he'll try to be there and cover anything we didn't cover in as
much detail as the class is interested.

  I will stop by the office today to pick up the KL handbook set and the three
volume KL handouts from Rhett's class, just so we will have them available.  I
will also bring the processor reference manual (unless you happen to already
have a copy at home, then you can bring it.  Let me know, so I can leave it at
the office.)

Joe,
  Thre is a more descriptive message on System D35 concerning the schedule.
Joe & I will be doing the Hardware section on Monday, in place of Osman.
Joe & I will do most of the Software section on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Dennis will do the XEXEC user section (probably on Wednesday).
Osman expects to be in Wednesday to cover any Hardware we missed on Monday
in more depth, and to cover some of the Software section.
Anything not covered Monday-Wednesday may spill over to Thursday, maybe not.
Rick will cover operational procedures the remainder of the week.

Guys,

  Concerning teaching this week, Wednesday sounds ideal for me.  I'm going to
be at the Cal. Berkeley Extension seminar on UNIX System Administration on
Monday.  The Cal. Extension seminar will be all day, in Mountain View.  I'll
be checking TUMS, Aspen & Judy for messages.  It will be difficult to provide
user support Monday, but I'll do what I can about getting and answering
messages.

Subject: Formatting X32's disks. 

I found 2 bugs in PAKCOP(PAKCP5).   
If the 1st string controller is off-line (BPA0-BPA7), then PAKCOP assumes
the entire 3674 controller is off-line (BPA0-17 & BPB0-17).  PAKCP5 didnot
want to look at the string of 3650 disks on BPA10-17 as a result of
the string of 3675 disk on BPA0-7 being switched off.

2nd problem: Although I tried to make PAKCOP do everything SA10NW does,
something is missing.  Those paacks have not been formatted using PAKCOP,
because PAKCOP dies on CYL 559 with "Equip Check".    They were formatted with
SA10NW with FMTM=0, wich does cylinders 0-554 only.  When I tried FMTM=1,
SA10NW aborted because cylinders 555-559 were not set up.  I am now using
FMTM=-1 to re-write HA and R0 - this takes 2 secons per cylinder, 19 minutes
per pack.  After SA10NW finished, thhen I reformat thhem in pages.
I plan do do all but BPA16 - I'll leave that one as a test case for the
next version of PAKCOP.			/Joe

Subject: Leased line troubles. 

Yesterday afternoon I went to Nicholson Way, to look at possible modem
problems.  Our Paradyne modem was powered down.  I turned the power back on
for it.  The indicator LEDs were lit for the 3 left-most indicators and the 1
right-most indicator.  The 4th from the left, which Joe tells me is carrier
detect, was not lit.

I returned to D-2.  The modem in the lab was indicating the same state.  I
tried to load 2770 from the public network, but it wouldn't take a load (it
"timed out", according to LOADII), which should indicate that it was already
loaded fine.

While at Nicholson Way, I neglected to look at the connection between the
Paradyne modem and the leased line.  If it was disconnected when the line was
being worked on Monday (which is highly possible, since they were there and
had powered the modem down) that could be a cause for the communication
failure.

Or (paranoid fantasy):  Tymnet is messing with us, because we have a
non-Tymnet line going into "their" "super site".  (Remember the fortune
cookie:  "Just because you're crazy doesn't mean they're not out to get you.")

Subject: Nicholson Modem working now. 

The 9600 baud modem is in the rack by the F3's, but the leased line interface
is on the other side of the ramp, by the 2020's.  The modular plug at the
interface end was unplugged.  It was not obvious because the it was hidden
by the blue panel.  It has been moved to the back of that rack to be more
accessable - the link came up as soon as it was plugged in.

Host 17 was down to allow Osman to build another KLAD pack on the RP06,
host 14 was brought up but is not visible to the Supervisor due to 2770's
config file.  Until that's fixed, the only way to get to the 2020 that is
host 14 is by dialing (408)432-1735.  It is up now, on the 1-pack RM03.

Subject: X32 on three 3650s in blocks. 

So that we can all have something to work with, I have formatted 3650's using
SA10NW (BPA10,BPA11,BPA12) and restored X32's files on them.  This way we can
get to our files and I can load PAKCP5 from disk to test it on the other 5
disks.  PAKCOP (all versions) is getting EQUIP CHECK - SYNC OUT ERROR on this
particular string of HDAs.  I plan to add code to type out the 3650 specific
portions of the sense bytes when this occurs.  /Joe

Subject: Where the files went 

Before move:  All TXS files were spread out on 3 systems: X930, X62, X95.

Liberty St:  All of X930 and X62 files were combined onto one system.
  This system was called X118 and consisted of 3 RP06 packs.  It had
  everything that X930+X62 had, except for the directories Carl saved
  on the "ripoff" tape and directories (such as KS2020) which were
  kept on the 2 RM03 X95 system instead.

During move:  Everything was moved to X32 in Solar Way.  X32 used 4 3675
  packs, and had X118's RP06 save restored to it.  To make sure nothing got
  lost, the saves for X930, X62, and X95 were also restored.  Some of the
  ripped off directories came back as a result of this.

After move:  A one-pack RP06 system was build on X17 from the 1-tape save
  and Carl's 4-tape save and the microNET sources from B39.  A one-pack
  RM03 system was built on X14 from the 1-tape save only.

23-Oct-87:  A third RM03 was added to X95's 2-pack set and mounted on X14.
  All the files that Carl had on the 1-pack RP06 system are being restored
  to it.  X14 will have KS2020 and microNET related files.
  The 3-pack RP06 set has been formatted and is being restored to the way
  it was when it was in Liberty St.

Future:  Directories which exist on X17 and X14 need to be sorted out.
  Between the two of them, they have enough space to handle everything
  that is currently on X32.  A 1600bpi save of X32 can then be restored
  to the two 2020s.

         They were running P035/C.

Work:    Tried reloading P035/C, no luck.  Tried P035/B07 from OLDMON, no luck.
         Tried reloading F26's base, no luck.

         Created special TELECO.SAV with DDT and breakpoint at location TRAP.
         Failure was caused by recieving a null character.  Modified BIO.MAC
         to output in hex all characters read from block I/O input buffer.
         Ran on X32 to get good data, compared with run on F26.  Found
         null characters in input buffer - all non-null characters were good.
         Log is (TSUCOOP:26)TEL0.LOG

Rick,
 
Here is my feelings on the TYMCOM-10 training class:
 
A) I feel that the information was well grouped. The instructors did not teach
   as if the students were all programmers, like in most cases.
   The presentation for the most part was well structured, the only obvious
   problem I felt was the fact that the people who were training did not get
   to prepare for the class, due to the personal problems of Osman & Joe.
   For example: The first day Osman was to teach and he had to attend to
   personal business which left Carl & Joe fairly unprepared to teach that day.
 
B) I feel that as far as time constraints that the training should have been
   on a more rigid schedule. Breaks on the hour for 10 minutes, lunches 1 hour,
   class starting and ending as scheduled.
   One week was fine for the duration.
 
C) I refreshed on a lot of items that I had forgotten, unfortunately I missed
   more than I wanted to, but I will be attending the next session.
 
D) All in all I feel that it was a valuable training session.

Yesterday, I rerouted power at Nicholson Lane.  I reloaded node 2346 last,
and expected the date and time to come in from the Supervisor as soon as it
started to node 2770.  Instead, the following happened:

27-Oct-87 15:05 2020 host 14 died with ?PAR ERR 373 001, node 6760 OK

It looks like the "DP parity error" (373) was caused by bad data from the
KMC as a result of 2346 sending garbage to the two bases.  Very strange.

      a. How do you feel the seminar was presented?
COMMENT: Due to circumstances the order of the classes had to be changed,
         this did have an effect on the big picture goal of the class since
         it meant others had to be called upon before they were ready. The
         class was also prepared for those who had some experience, yet the
         participants were mainly made of inexperienced persons. These two
         things lessened the effect of the class, however, I thaught the
         classes were very informative.
 
      b. Do you feel the seminar should have been longer?
COMMENT: The seminar really couldn't have been any longer because of
         scheduling problems. I do think that we need to go into detail
         in some areas, in another seminar. A sequel of sorts.
 
      c. What did you get out of the seminar?
COMMENT: I picked up bits and pieces of information from all areas covered.
         I now feel more comfortable with the file structure, and monitor
         concepts inparticular.
 
      d. Include as other comments you feel are pertinent.
COMMENT: Next time we should match the information and class objective with
         the expected participants of the class. I was very satisfied with
         what Lynn and myself took from the class, but the new people will
         probably need to reattend the class once they've worked with the
         PDP10's for a while. Rick I commend you on your part in making
         these classes happen.

   Subj: DECsystem10 P035/C monitor with E-BUS uprev.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     As of today  10-30-1987 all of the Dallas  DECsystem10's are running
   with the  P035/C monitor and the  uprev E-BUS Tymnet board.  With this
   combination we have  seen a drop in NOBASE type  stopcode crashes that
   took the DEC system and the engine  down. With this added value to our
   system, we should see a much needed improvment of CPU reliability.
 
     The CTTY will report the following messages:
 
      %%EVENT stopcode NOBASE at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      No response from base. Please reload it. PDP-10 is still up.
 
     After the  base is reloaded  or reinit the  DEC system and  the base
   will resync and you will receive the following message twice:
 
      %% EVENT stopcode BASEOK at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      Code in base is version 2.00 - debug flag is OFF
 
     I wish we had this 5+ years ago.  In any case, this is much like how
   the TYMCOM-370 base/operating system works. If the DEC user has LOGOUT
   on DISCONN, no problem, the user is  logged off the system, but if the
   user has DETACH  on DISCONN this will  put him in a  detach state.  If
   and only IF  the user is smart  they will reattach to  the detach job.
   If the user does not, we will start getting a bunch of control C jobs.
   We can do several things to correct these massive control C's,
 
      1) Change all users to DETACH ON DISCCON with a 15 MINUTE TIMEOUT
      2) Re-educate the user on how and why to reattach.
      3) Keep everything the same and run the FREE program.
 
     I have talked with OSMAN and as of Monday we are going to submit the
   FREE to run  all the time in detach  and kill all the  control C jobs.
   This is just for short term until whom  ever can come up with a better
   solution.
 
     As we all know, this should not be  coded as a crash nor recorded in
   the MUR  database, but FSC  should be  notified for the  simple reason
   that  the base  may have  a  problem and  may  need to  correct it  on
   schedule time.
 
    Any futher questions or comments, please either call me or send me an
   ONTYME.
 
                                 Thank you,
                                Tom Marconi

This means that I have to make SETLIC with 0 in the frame half disable
license, or make SETE and the SETE program both work with a zero argument
and no password.  {Sigh}

Subject: SETLIC hack 

It shouldn't affect any programs... it doesn't seem to affect OPER, but
if the frame license portion of a SETLIC UUO call is 0, then JBTSLC RH is
set to 0.  Otherwise, any non-zero RH is used to accumulate the value in
JBTSLC for the user.

SETE 0,n$password
does exactly what is expected... it sets the field to 0, via the SETE UUO.
SETE 0
uses the SETLIC UUO and for now, it also sets the frame license to 0.

Subject: SETE 0, SETE -1 

When we go into the monitor to work on the SETE -1 call, I think it would
be a good idea to allow SETE 0 to work without a password, for any slot.
Then, I can remove the SETLIC 0 *kludge*.

We should discuss this...  SETLIC 0 is an exception to the normal SETLIC
functionality, but it's there because the SETE program does a SETLIC when
you say SETE 0.

Subject: Known problem: Job in ^C but no prompt. 

If you ever get job 1 immediately after loading the system, you should log
out and back in again.  Especially if you have to supply the date and time.
If you wait until after EXECX starts, there does not seem to be a problem.

Problem: After running a program (such as GFD or OPER), the program finishes,
but the user does not get a prompt.  Typing Control-T says the job is in ^C
state, but the user has to type a Contro-C to get the monitor prompt.  The
situation lasts until the job logs out.  Cause unknown, but never seen after
2nd network login.		/Joe

System F22 is up on monitor P035/C03.  With this monitor we now have
the capability to attach to a job if a BASE crash takes the DEC
system or the engine down.  If either one occurs, you will see
a STOPCODE message on the CTTY.

Before reloading the base or re-initing the DEC system, enter "PJOB"
on the OPR TTY.  You will need to know what job to attach to when
logging back in after reloading the base or reiniting the DEC system.

After the base is reloaded, or reiniting the DEC system, the DEC
system and base will resync and you will receive the following message
twice:

%% EVENT stopcode BASEOK at dd-mmm-yyy hh:mm:ss
Code in base is version 2.00 - debug flag is OFF

Wait for about 90 seconds and then log in attaching to your job.
You may also have to type in "CONT" for your job to continue from where

   Subj: DECsystem10 P035/C monitor with E-BUS uprev.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     As of today  10-30-1987 all of the Dallas  DECsystem10's are running
   with the  P035/C monitor and the  uprev E-BUS Tymnet board.  With this
   combination we have  seen a drop in NOBASE type  stopcode crashes that
   took the DEC system and the engine  down. With this added value to our
   system, we should see a much needed improvment of CPU reliability.
 
     The CTTY will report the following messages:
 
      %%EVENT stopcode NOBASE at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      No response from base. Please reload it. PDP-10 is still up.
 
     After the  base is reloaded  or reinit the  DEC system and  the base
   will resync and you will receive the following message twice:
 
      %% EVENT stopcode BASEOK at dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss
      Code in base is version 2.00 - debug flag is OFF
 
     I wish we had this 5+ years ago.  In any case, this is much like how
   the TYMCOM-370 base/operating system works. If the DEC user has LOGOUT
   on DISCONN, no problem, the user is  logged off the system, but if the
   user has DETACH  on DISCONN this will  put him in a  detach state.  If
   and only IF  the user is smart  they will reattach to  the detach job.
   If the user does not, we will start getting a bunch of control C jobs.
   We can do several things to correct these massive control C's,
 
      1) Change all users to DETACH ON DISCCON with a 15 MINUTE TIMEOUT
      2) Re-educate the user on how and why to reattach.
      3) Keep everything the same and run the FREE program.
 
     I have talked with OSMAN and as of Monday we are going to submit the
   FREE to run  all the time in detach  and kill all the  control C jobs.
   This is just for short term until whom  ever can come up with a better
   solution.
 
     As we all know, this should not be  coded as a crash nor recorded in
   the MUR  database, but FSC  should be  notified for the  simple reason
   that  the base  may have  a  problem and  may  need to  correct it  on
   schedule time.
 
    Any futher questions or comments, please either call me or send me an
   ONTYME.
 
                                 Thank you,

Subject: Resync with base. 

In reference to ONTYME from Tom Marconi on Friday 10/30/87 12:05:33.
Subj: DECsystem10 P035/C monitor with E-BUS uprev.

It is now possible to reload the EBUS base and not have to recycle the
PDP-10 host.  This capability is a result of recent hardware and software
changes; an ECO to fix the DMA problem and a patch to SYSTEM.SAV.

The current monitor (P035/C) can handle the case where the base is reset
by being reloaded.  However, that monitor does not always recover gracefully
when the base is reset from its front panel.  The PDP-10 has to be running
the P035/C03 (or later) monitor to be able to resync with the base in
this case.

anyone to set a limit between 1 and the system default limit.  However, to
set the limit to 0 or to a value greater than the system default, you MUST

A minor typo was found in /C05 which caused LDBLOG to report the wrong node
number on PTYs (such as SUBMIT jobs).  (M33)C05.PAT has been applied to all
copies of ##XC05.SAV and to NEWMON.SAV on all Fremont systems.  74XC05.SAV
had to be rebuilt with 127 jobs instead of 128 to handle 4 strings of 3675

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Robert C. Grandey

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guys:

	There have been a few problems around here, that I must stay home
Monday morning to try to get fixed.  I will not be arriving until I have
gotten the minimum fixed, or at least started.  Item on my list:

	1.)  Repair the U-joint on my car which broke Saturday, so it can move
under its own power and thereby get me to work.  (Car is currently in my
driveway.  I am unable to find a replacement U-joint.  The car must be out of
the driveway Monday morning, to make room for the 40 cubic yard "dumpster"
which will be placed to receive the old roofing shake and other construction
material/debris which is scattered throughout the house and yard.)

	2.)  Hire someone to dig up my front lawn, to find and fix the place
in the main sewer line from the house which is broken and since Saturday will
not allow anything to flow.  (I miss clean clothes, a shower and a toilet.)

	3.)  Be here to meet the roofers Monday morning.

	4.)  Finish wiring the kitchen and installing the range hood vent
through the ceiling and roof, so the kitchen ceiling drywall can be finished
and the new roof can be installed with the vent included.

	Items 1, 2 & 3 will be taken care of Monday morning.  Item 4 is a
project for tonight.

	-D.-

Subject: Progress in "slot out of ports". 

(SYS:26)CRA003 is a dump from F26 getting an IME stopcode after the base
was INITted.  The dump showed many terminals with the same set of messages
to be output.  They were (in order) "set echo mode", "read terminal
characteristics", "set terminal characteristics", "send a zapper",
"send defered echo", and "send orange ball".

Based on that, I created RCVZAP.PAT which clears out any other output
bits when a zapper is received from TYMNET.  This was applied to the
monitor on F26 and F33.

This afternoon, F26 ran out of ports again.  This time, (MPL)TTYTAB reported
only 1 port marked "zapped" and "gone".  All the other ports that the
dispatcher reported as "in cleanup" appeared to be correctly zapped from 
the host side.  However, when I set the bit which says to send a zapper,
nothing happened.  This evening I noticed that one of the lines in question,
TTY2:, was marked as being a PTY.  This caused zappers going out on TTY2
to be received by TTY3 instead of the base.  I have no idea how the PTY
bit got set, but I have added code to check and correct it to SCNSER.

I have created 26XC06.SAV and 33XC06.SAV with the SCNSER changes.
In addition, I created (MPL)HANGEM.SAV which will hang all ports that
are not logged in.  After running it on F26, all dispatcher ports that
had been in cleanup were freed.

P035/C06 has been copied to NEWMON on F26 and F33 and should be run
the next time they get slot out of ports.  /Joe

Subject: Micronet-TXSNET nodes 

We are now testing a neww configuration!
  Node 2770 is now an 11/03-SE box with a DUV, DLV and DRV to servve
as the interface to TYMNET at MDC-SJ.
  Node FRED is now a NETCON box with 2770's old configuration with
the exceptioon that it doesn't talk to TYMNET, instead it talks to 2770.

This shouuld allieviate the probles we see with both jitter and lost
circuits between TXSNET and TYMNET.  TELECOPY should work better...
Any problems please let me know.

SORRY TO START YOUR DAY OFF SO GLORIOUSLY BUT WE'VE BEEN HAVING 
THE SAME PRBLEMS WITH D54 AS BEFORE YOU PUT IN THE NEW MONITOR.

CHECK IT.  ALSO, WHEN RUNNING SYSTAT THIS MORNING, THERE ARE
SUPPOSEDLY 22 USERS LOGGED ON BUT NETCON CAN'T LOGGIN (GOT A CALL
FROM THEM JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO INQUIRING ABOUT THE SYSTEM).
 
IS THRE IS THERE ANYTHING YOU KNOW OF THAT WE CAN DO AT OUR END TO RECTIRY
THE SITUATION?
 
OTHER THAN THAT, SURE HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.

Subject: Found bug causing loop in SCNSER. 

The two crashes on F26 indicated that SCNSER was looping when it tried to
report a black-ball to a PTY.  When too many characters were in the input
buffer, a bit was set to tell the PTY of the buffer overflow.  The routine
that delivered this message had a coding error, which meant the bit was
never cleared.  SCNSER would see this next time it ran - causing a loop.

This might be caused by a job running the COM program and forcing more than
1104 characters into the job's own input buffer.  The P035/C07 monitor will
output a stopcode whenever this occurs again.  /Joe

Subject: "slot out of ports" caused by AFD. 

F26 has two crash dumps taken when no commands could be typed on any
terminal.  Both were during a "slot out of ports" condition, and in both
cases, someone was executing a PCOM job that was running AFD.  The system
hung by a command like "RUN AFDCOM;AFDPUT.TMP" because the input file
had more than 1024 characters.

We have been trying to warn everybody for over 3 years that programs like
(UTIL)COM and AFDCOM should not attempt to force the input of more than
one line of 72 characters.  Anything over 72 characters cannot be guarenteed
to work.  Any procedure that needs more input must be converted to use the
":COM filname" feature of PCOM and SUBMIT if it is to be relied upon.

Daily procedures that use the COM program (such as running accounting for
BILLING10) should be converted to PCOM style control files before the next
monitor release.  Documentation is in (*6NEWS)PCOM.DOC.

Subject: Comment on "Zapped! Gone!" ports. 

The spare KI was running X32-P035/C05-1 which means it was loaded from tape.
When I ran TTYTAB during the day, it said two ports were "Zapped! Gone!".
Figuring that they would go away when X32-P035/C08 was loaded from NEWMON,
I ran TAKEIT to do so.  Bad move, because after TAKEIT has issued the HANG
uuo to make the system go to BOOTS, the once-a-second code in the monitor
waited forever for those two ports to go away.  I had to get an operator
to deposit 1 in 30.  This has happened once before, but should never be
seen again with /C08.   /Joe

Subject: Bug in SETE UUO 

I found a bug in the SETE UUO code introduced in /C07.  It is really a
typo and can be fixed with a 1-word patch.
   SETE+10/ XCTFU <SKIPGE 2(M)>
               should be
   SETE+10/ XCTFU <SKIPGE 2(T2)>

In /C07 & /C08 this actually reads:
   SETE+10/ XCT 1,UUOLIT+111    which contains/  SKIPGE 2(M)

I patched it on system 32 while testing the new version of SETE.
(both in the running monitor and on disk).

See MONDOC.

Joe, Osman... do we want to patch /C08 or rebuild everything as /C09 or
wait a few days to see if we want to change anything else before we do
anything?

Any version of SETE will die (user mode error-page fault in user space)
without the patch.  The BUG used the hash constant as the address in user
space instead of the block address, so different page faults occur based
on the passwords given by the user.

See you in the morning.

There is a new SETE program on SYS.  I didn't bother to make it try SETE
and then SETLIC if SETE fails.  It simply checks for zero license and
expects the new monitor.  We can wait until the new monitor is running
everywhere before transmitting it.

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 3 Dec 87 3:47:07 PST

The message "Bits 18,19,20 disabled cannot swap" should be interpreted as
"disk full or quota exceeded".  User UKMKTG on F26 has a quota of 5000 pages
and is currently using 5030 pages.  The easy way of checking this is to
GFD to that directory and "R QUOLST".
UKMKTG will not be able to created any new files until either
a) some old files are deleted, or
b) the logged in quota is increased and the user logs out and back in again.

Subject: "All-files problem on F29. TITO"... 

All-files problem on F29.
TITO aborted the all-files save of F29 with "EXCEEDED PROG LIMIT" on tape 13
while saving (USEVAL).  TITO has a limit of 43777 tape positions (18431 files)
per tape and directory (USEVAL) has 18075 files.

Tape 14 was "STORE ALL STARTING WITH (USEVAL)".  That tape as 18075 files from
all of USEVAL, 278 files from UTIL, 61 files from VALDEV, 4 files from VALIDATE,
3 files from VALTELCO, and 10 files from VBURKE, for a total of 18431 files.
It appears that someone tried to APPEND to that tape instead of going on
to tape 15.  Operations called the hotline because of that confusion.

Whenever TITO reaches its limit of 43777 tape positions, you should not skip
the current user, and you should not restart with the current user.  The
proper procedure is to get a directory of the tape, find the name of the last
file on the tape, and go to a new tape, starting with that particular file.

The easy way to look at the end of a file (such as FTA2.DIR) is with the
command "RUN (XEXEC)TAIL;FTA2.DIR".  In this case, it showed the last file as
43777 14 Y6YSF8.ME0   VBURKE        11:42 13-FEB-86  00:00 04-DEC-87    2 TUCLIK
therefore the command "STORE ALL STARTING WITH (VBURKE)Y6YSF8.ME0" should have
been used on tape 15.

Subject: XEXEC Monitor solution! 

Joe,
  I've come up with a solution to the problem XEXEC has with the universal
identifier JBTUID which currently restarts at 1 each time the system is
reloaded.  If instead of using a monotonically increasing number, we set
the UID to the universal-date-time, we will be guaranteed of unique UIDs
that will never be reused.  Thus, if a job number and UID match at any time
we know we have the right job.

  Of course, we know the UDT is accurate to 1/3 second, so what do we do
about jobs that would have the same UDT?  Simple... since we keep the last
UID, we now keep the last UDT used for a UID and if the current UDT matches,
we increment it by 1  (1/3 second isn't going to hurt anything).  It's a
small possibility that the UID could get ahead of the UDT but it wouldn't
stay ahead for very long.

  And last, but not least, we can redirect .GTJLT (130) to point to JBTUID
and be able to obtain the login time for a job.

  The change should be in FRMSER in FRMASN where the UDT is incremented and
set for each frame

*** I would like this change to be made in /C09 ***

(or however you want to specify /D-A with a ddt patch)

The current definition has 9 bits for patch level.  The macro in COMTXT
is set up to handle a numeric patch, or an alpha patch level, but not
both.  Since this number is determined at compile time, it really should
include only source patch indications; PATMAP is for numeric DDT patches.
What are Osman's and Craig's opinions on this?   /Joe

Subject: How to have PDP-10 mail forwarded to ONTYME. 

To have all PDP10 mail (including crash mail) forwarded to ONTYME, create
a file in your directory called MAIL.FWD and insert your ONTYME name, an
"at" sign, the ONTYME server name, and the suffix ".ONTYME".  For example,
if (DANIELSR)MAIL.FWD had the one line:
        OPERA.SUP@EMSTXS.ONTYME
then all PDP10 mail (including SEND, SENDMAIL, and TUMS) would be forwarded
to OPERA.SUP on the EMSTXS engine.  Note that name and address is required,
no password needed for forwarding mail.

Your MAIL.FWD file has to exist on all systems your username is valid on.
The easiest way to duplicate it to all systems in the Fremont Data Center
is by "RUN (SPL)CPY;MAIL.FWD/CENTER:F".  That will run TELECOPY in your
behalf.  After it is finished, you can "RUN (SPL)TELCHK" and hit Return
twice to type and delete 0nnTEL.COM and 0nnTEL.OUT files.

Subject: Previous message. 

Please show memo about MAIL.FWD to anyone currently getting crash mail.
Tell Sharon that I won't need here ONTYME password after all, but she will
have to clear out her existing crash mail - MAIL.FWD only affects new mail,
not already received mail.

By the way: It is very easy to have PDP10 mail forwarded to ONTYME; getting
ONTYME mail forwarded to the PDP10s is possible, but a little more difficult.
Also, it is an all-or-nothing deal - when all ONTYME messages are forwarded,
they can't be read using ONTYME anymore.    /Joe

Subject: P035/C10 

There were 2 changes to P034/C09 yesterday.
1) Output correct information on CPU stopcodes, instead of getting a
   2n stopcode in the middle of the first stopcode.
2) Fix problem where TYPBAT and other programs couldn't find DSKB1 but
   found DSKB10 twice.
The second change was not implemented correctly.  It has been fixed and
P035/C10 has been copied to NEWMON on all systems in Fremont.
Please resume loading from NEWMON.    /Joe

Guys,

  I'm a little late with this---I probably should have doen this last week.
Who will be the SPOOL maintainer?  I will get with him to give him the easiest
intro to what I've been doing to maintain SPOOL (and how I've been doing
it).  The monthly stuff can wait until near the end of the month, and this
week's stuff required no manual intervention, so I've finished it.

Till later,

SUBJECT>   New Software for PSPPDP


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Attention ALL Operators!!!!!!!!!!!

Software Support has modified the PSPPDP software on F33 to have the
BEEPER sound off when a system is down.  At this time it is only on this
host.

The way it works is after the PSP has completed listing out it will BEEP
for about 10-15 seconds and will stop running.  The BEEP will repeat
every 60 seconds until something is done.

When you hear this BEEPER, you must check to see what system is down.
If it is a system that you know is not scheduled down, you have to
check that system.  If it is a system that you know is scheduled
down, then press the RETURN key twice to start the PSP running again.

Once you are aware of a system down, and something is being done, press
the RETURN key as mentioned above.

                                                                Page  2

The BEEPER will sound off until the System has returned to TIMESHARING.

THANKS

Subject: GAN-5 and other usernames 

Jan,
  There are a reasonable number of usernames that currently exist on the
PDP-10s that no one ever logs into.  Is there really any reason for those
usernames to exist in TYMNET?  Is there any reason why a set of usernames
or directories cannot exist only on the PDP-10s?

  The only stipulation being that those usernames cannot be assigned to
users that want to use the PDP-10s.  A user could have the name (DEC) and
be valid to talk to the DECNET gateways 411 and 412, but not be valid on
the PDP-10s.  On the PDP-10s we could have username (DEC) with a designated
PPN that isn't billed against (since it would be an IPC internal name).

  Maybe we should get together to talk about this... since if you and Ed
and Nancy and I can agree on what I'm proposing, it would solve the problem
with duplicate UUNs and reduce the cost incurred by IPC and by us in TYMNET.
(Why should we have billable username sin TYMNET if no one ever logs in?)

6760 (X14 base) is connected to ND5416 and ND5561 also.
Node 2346 has been renamed to NICK (terminals & modems at Nicholson).
Node 10115 has been renamed to FOON (dual base for the Foonlys).
Node FRED (terminal & modems at MDC) is basically unchanged.
Node 2770 now tells the Supervisor that it has hosts 62 (alias for X14),

Osman;

I sent the following ONTYME to everyone who may have the
opportunity to do PACKCOPIES on the TYMCOM-10's.

What I did not tell them is that I RENAMED all PACKCOPY software
on each system to prevent them from using the incorrect software.

They can ONLY load the correct software.  All software that is
not used has been renamed:

PAKCPX.V25 or PAKCP5.V25 or PAKCOP.V25.

Thought I should let you know what I did.

Happy Holidays;

Rick

On 11 December, the wrong PACKCOPY program was loaded to do a
PACKCOPY on System 30, which could have resulted in REBUILDING
the system.

On 6 December, I passed out a NEW list with the System Numbers,
and what PACKCOPY software to use on these Systems.  A copy
went to all Operators and all Supervisors.  A copy was also
posted in the System Quality Control Office.

Please use CAUTION and make sure that the correct PACKCOPY
is loaded before doing a PACKCOPY.

Subject: X17 out of room again! 

I tried logging into X17 today and found it "job capacity exceeded"
went to Nicholson and found, "disk full, take corrective action" and
cty was out of paper...

I reloaded and found 2 files in (M33:17), XFER.WED was 8281 and XFER.FRI
was 4582 pages long...

It appears we are having some kind of "open-line" problem with aux-circuits
where lots of nulls are "sent"/"received" and they are filling system 17 so
it is running out of space...  there is approx 20,000 pages free on the
system at the moment... (of course, there was this much free on XMAS day
also, but the problem occurred again!)

Subject: Hotline Call 

Bonnie called me at 10 minutes to 8, and I responded late (at 9:20pm when
I returned home) that the Japanese customers were complaining about SPOOL
and BIONIK and a fortran program TOKTYP that were causing them problems.

This same problem occurred last week, DEC 22, when the SA-10 problem caused
them to put 74 on the spare KL. I presume they swapped the SA-10 and brought
things up on 74's base... 'cause the japanese customers reported the problems
fixed shortly after that.

I checked out BIONIK and BIONIC, Bonnie and I checked out TELECOPY and all
block-io programs appeared to be having problems.  BIONIC received every 4th
byte transmitted (? really ?) and TELECOPY failed miserably.

I found out they were using node 2100 for the base (?the bad one?) and had
Bonnie call FSC to have the base swapped out for Node 6722's hardware.  It
took until 2:00 for them to get the base loaded after the swap out.

The system answered by 2:40 and I logged in and tested BIONIC.  Cindy from
operations checked out TELECOPY and it worked ok.  I asked her to put a note
on the base 2100, that BLOCK-IO doesn't work on this base.  (I thought the
bad base was retired?)

System 74 is up on the spare KL (that is why it was using node 2100) because
the SA-10 is still down... need to check with FSC to find out when X32 will
be back with it's own SA-10.
