INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 20 Sep 85



To:       All ISG Employees

Subject:  ISG EDUCATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT



Employees are encouraged to increase their capabilities and 
value to ISG by participating in approved educational programs, 
whereby the costs of the educational program are refunded to the 
employee to the extent specified in this policy.

This program is applicable to all full time regular employees of 
ISG employing companies as designated by the ISG Management 
Committee.

Career development programs eligible for reimbursement fall into 
two (2) categories as follows:

1.  Adult Education Program

    The Adult Education Program provides assistance to employees 
    participating in non-credit courses designed to develop 
    potential capabilities.  The Adult Education Program 
    consists of the following:

    - High school equivalency preparation
    - High school diploma
    - Remedial education
    - Job related vocational courses

2.  College Study Program

    A program which falls into one of the following categories:

          Job related: An educational program which when taken, 
          is expected to improve the employee's performance in 
          his/her current position and/or increase the 
          employee's capabilities for promotion into a higher 
          position within ISG organizations.

          Certificate/Degree related:  An undergraduate or post 
          graduate curriculum at an accredited college or 
          university which is related to the employee's 
          profession or other business related professions which 
          the employee intends to pursue within ISG 
          organizations.



Eligibility

    To be eligible for reimbursement of educational costs, an 
    employee must be a full-time regular employee at the time of 
    enrollment and at the time the course is successfully 
    completed.  In addition, the employee must be in an active 
    pay status at the time of course completion and must not be 
    on a leave of absence.  Those who retire, are laid-off, or 
    enter active United States military service after 
    enrollment, but prior to course completion, may be eligible 
    for reimbursement, provided all other requirements have been 
    met.

    The course or program must be conducted by an approved 
    and/or accredited educational institution.

    Courses, programs and subjects undertaken must receive 
    approval by employee's supervisor and acknowledgments by 
    their local Human Resources organization prior to the start 
    of the course.

    An employee who is eligible for tuition assistance through 
    veterans' benefits, federal aid, scholarship or other such 
    programs after reporting such eligibility, may be eligible 
    for that portion not covered as specified in this policy.

Enrollment

    Employees will be limited to enrollment in not more than two 
    (2) courses plus one (1) lab per semester.

    ISG reserves the right to exclude from inclusion in this 
    plan any educational institution.

Reimbursement

    Upon satisfactory completion of each college study course (a 
    minimum grade of "C" or equivalent, provided "C" meets the 
    school requirements for degree objective), 80% of tuition, 
    enrollment fees, textbooks, required instructional material, 
    laboratory, and other recurring fees will be reimbursed.  
    Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not 
    reimbursable.  Grades are based upon an A, B, C, D, and F 
    scale.  In Adult education programs which are graded "A" 
    thru "F", the "C" grade rule applies for eligibility for 
    reimbursement.  Other evidences of satisfactory completion, 
    such as diplomas, certificates or letters from the 
    institution are acceptable when no grades are given.

    Maximum employee reimbursement per calendar year is $3,000 
    and presentation of evidence of course/program completion, 
    grades and receipts are required.



Reimbursement  (Continued)

    The Educational Reimbursement Plan is not a contract.  It 
    may be terminated or modified at any time without prior 
    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

Subject:  MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION NATIONAL CAR RENTAL 
          CORPORATE-WIDE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

To:       McDonnell Douglas Corporation Plant Lists A-H; Post 
          Bulletin Boards



1.  McDonnell Douglas Corporation has again signed an exclusive 
    supplier agreement with National Car Rental system, Inc. 
    beginning 01 October 1985 through 30 September 1986.  This 
    agreement replaces the previous National contract which 
    expires on 30 September 1985.  National Car Rental is to be 
    used by all reservation functions and by any individual MDC 
    traveler on company business with or without advance 
    reservations.  All car rentals should be made through 
    National, even for the few locations which have no National 
    services (since National will reimburse the rate 
    differences).  MCAIR Travel Services in St. Louis has been 
    assigned responsibility by MDC Corporate Office to 
    administer this agreement for all MDC locations.

2.  With the new agreement, unlimited mileage daily rates for 
    compact size vehicles ("B" size) returned to the same rental 
    location range for $26.00/day in St. Louis, Los Angeles, 
    Phoenix and Long Beach to $27.00/day throughout the 
    remainder of the United States.  Domestic weekly rates are 
    five times the daily rate and monthly rates are three times 
    the weekly rate.  The agreement also provides for Canadian 
    and international discounts.  One-way rentals are charged a 
    reduced time and mileage rate.  National should be notified 
    of the one-way rental at the time of reservation booking to 
    prevent a drop charge.

3.  The same Corporate rates have again been extended to MDC 
    employees for personal travel.  To obtain the Corporate rate 
    for personal rentals, employees should identify themselves 
    as MDC employees when they call National Car Rental at 
    1-800-328-4567 for their reservation.  The Human Resources 
    Office and Recreation Department have National Car 
    Identification cards which should be used with the 
    employees' MDC badges to obtain the MDC rate for personal 
    travel.

4.  All Corporate and personal domestic rentals include full 
    insurance coverage [Collision Damage Waiver, (CDW)].  
    International rates do not include insurance and must be 
    obtained at the time of rental.  On personal rentals, for 
    insurance coverage beyond the free CDW, any necessary 
    personal credit reference and driver's license requirements 
    remain the responsibility of the employee.



5.  If National Car Rental fails to provide a vehicle that has 
    been confirmed within 45 minutes after the traveler arrives 
    at their counter, a written notice along with a copy of the 
    car rental agreement should be sent to MCAIR Travel 
    Services, Dept. 028, Bldg. 275, in St. Louis.  The delay 
    will result in a $25.00 credit rental certificate.  If 
    National fails to comply with the preceding within one (1) 
    hour of the employees' arrival at the rental counter, 
    National will be responsible for a $100.00 penalty.  All 
    penalty certificates are payable to MDC, and will be used to 
    reduce the applicable component's monthly car rental cost.

6.  Where possible, the MDC Huntington Beach, Long Beach or 
    St. Louis Travel Departments should be utilized for making 
    business trip car rental reservations.  MDC receives a 
    commission on any car reservations made through these 
    departments which will help to hold down the Corporation's 
    ever-increasing travel expenditures.

7.  Please route this AB to all personnel in your organization 
    to notify travelers or reservation functions prior to 
    01 October 1985.  Any questions on this agreement should be 
    referred to Travel Services at 314/234-6666 in St. Louis; 
    714/896-2872 in Huntington Beach and 213/593-7565 in Long 
    Beach.

Subject:  Five Keys to Self Renewal; Special Assignment - 
          J. H. MacDonald



1.  Over the past four years, we have introduced the Five Keys 
    to Self Renewal; Strategic Management, Participative 
    Management, Human Resource Management, Productivity 
    Improvement and Ethical Decision Making.  Each of these 
    initiatives are interrelated and are necessary at MDC to 
    improve our competitive business position and ensure our 
    long-term survival.  It's our assessment that we are well 
    into what might be called the "awareness-informational- 
    experimental" phase of these Five Keys.  The big task ahead 
    of us is to guarantee that the Keys become fully implemented 
    and integrated into each of our jobs.  The Keys can't be 
    something we do in addition to our daily jobs but instead 
    must be literally built into the way we each carry out our 
    work.

2.  Because of the importance we place on this, we have asked 
    Jim MacDonald, Corporate Vice President - Human Resources, 
    to spend 90% of his time and effort over the next year on 
    ensuring that the Five Keys become fully implemented and 
    integrated into every function throughout the Corporation as 
    announced separately in Administrative Bulletin 85-74.

3.  The two of us will also be giving this Five Keys activity a 
    great deal of personal management direction.

    notice.

    Currently, educational refunds to ISG personnel are not 
    subject to income tax withholding or reporting to the 
    Internal Revenue Service.

Educational Leave of Absence

    Leaves of absence for educational purposes are prepared and 
    approved the same as all other leaves of absence, with the 
    exception that approval of the cognizant Department Head and 
    Human Resources is also required.

    Reimbursement of expenses while on a leave of absence is not 
    authorized, except for those pursuing a Doctorate Degree, in 
    which case reimbursement is limited to a maximum of twelve 
    (12) months during required residency.

Reduced Work Week For Educational Purposes

    The reduced work week is authorized for graduate degree 
    programs only and requires the approval of the cognizant 
    Department Head and Human Resources.  The reduced work week 
    permits salaried employees to work not less than twenty (20) 
    hours nor more than forty (40) hours per week.  This plan 
    stipulates that salaried employees be paid based on actual 
    hours worked.  Those benefits available immediately prior to 
    the beginning of the reduced work week will be retained.  
    The work schedule is established not normally to exceed 
    eight (8) hours per day.

Approval of Educational Program

    Employees applying for educational reimbursement will 
    complete an "ISG Educational Reimbursement Application" at 
    least two (2) weeks prior to the first class meeting.  The 
    application must be approved by the employee's supervisor 
    and acknowledged by their local Human Resources organization 
    to assure consistency related to guidelines.

    Human Resources will review the application and notify the 
    supervisor of approval of disapproval.  The supervisor will 
    then notify the employee.  If the application is not 
    approved, the employee will be informed of the reason.



Obtaining Reimbursement

    Upon completion of the course(s) and no later than ten (10) 
    weeks from the last scheduled meeting of the course, the 
    employee must submit to Human Resources:

          An official grade report or other evidence 
          establishing satisfactory completion of the course(s) 
          as specified under the "Reimbursement" section.

          Official receipts showing actual costs paid for 
          tuition, required textbooks, and other eligible course 
          fees paid to the educational institution.

    Human Resources will complete the authorization section 
    showing approved costs reimbursable on the "ISG Educational 
    Reimbursement Application".  The authorization is then 
    forwarded to Accounts Payable for payment to the employee.

    When a course is not completed but it can be clearly shown 
    that non-completion was due to Company action, other than 
    discharge for cause, the refund may be granted provided that 
    all other conditions are met.

SUBJECT: REDUCTION IN FORCE   
     
PLEASE SEE THAT THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM VERN HART, PRES-FIELD  
OPERATIONS, IS POSTED AND/OR DISTRIBUTED:    
     
     
DEAR FIELD SERVICE COMPANY EMPLOYEE:    
     
WHEN YOU WORK FOR A COMPANY, PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DISTURBING 
THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IS A REDUCTION IN FORCE.  THE LOSS OF A JOB, OR
THE THREAT OF IT, IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER TO EVERYONE.
     
MANY OF YOU HAVE MADE USE OF "OPEN LINE" TO EXPRESS YOUR CONCERNS AND 
TO ASK QUESTIONS.  I WISH TO THANK ALL THOSE WHO HAVE DONE SO AND TO  
EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR SHARING YOUR FEELINGS.  EACH QUESTION OR  
CONCERN WILL BE ANSWERED INDIVIDUALLY AND, IN ADDITION, THE RESPONSES 
WILL BE SUMMARIZED IN COMPANY PUBLICATIONS FOR THE INFORMATION OF ALL.
     
SINCE THIS INFORMATION WILL BE PUBLISHED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, I WILL   
NOT, IN THIS LETTER, ADDRESS ALL OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE RECEIVED
EITHER THROUGH "OPEN LINE" OR IN PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS.  MY PURPOSE  
HERE IS TO SKETCH OUT FOR YOU THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH RESULTED IN THE 
NEED FOR A REDUCTION IN FORCE AND THEN TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON WHERE WE ARE    
GOING AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE DOING TO GET THERE.
     
THE PRESENT BUSINESS SLUMP IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CERTAINLY NOT  
NEWS TO ANYONE.  IT BEGAN TO DEVLOP LATE LAST YEAR AND HAD GROWN TO   
SERIOUS PROPORTIONS BY THE SECOND QUARTER.  ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS
HAVE EXPERIENCED ITS EFFECTS, INCLUDING IBM, DEC, ATT-IS, HEWLETT
PACKARD, DATA GENERAL, AND WANG.  ALL HAVE HAD TO ADJUST THEIR 1985 PLANS  
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.  MANY HAVE TAKEN COST REDUCTION ACTIONS RANGING
FROM REDUCED WORK WEEKS AND PERIODIC SHUT DOWNS TO REDUCED WAGES,
REDUCTIONS IN FORCE, AND PLANT CLOSINGS.
     
A KEY PART OF THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ISG STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO DIVERSIFY
ITS OPERATIONS BY ESTABLISHING ELEVEN BUSINESS UNITS WHICH, BY WORKING
TOGETHER, WILL ADDESS A MULTIPLICITY OF MARKETS.  IN A NORMAL YEAR, THE    
EXPECTATION IS THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF UNITS MIGHT HAVE A RELATIVELY   
WEAK PERFORMANCE BUT THAT THIS WOULD BE OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCES OF   
THE OTHERS.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE OVERALL RESULTS FOR ISG IN THE SECOND  
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WERE EXAMINED IN JULY, THE REVERSE SITUATION WAS 
FOUND.  WHEREAS A FEW UNITS WERE DOING WELL, THE MAJORITY WERE FALLING
SHORT OF PLAN AND THE OUTLOOK WAS NOT GOOD.  
     
AS A RESULT, EACH BUSINESS UNIT, INCLUDING THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY, 
WAS GIVEN A PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TARGET AND ASKED TO DEVELOP PLANS 
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  
     
EVEN THOUGH THE FIELD SERVICE COMPANY WAS ON PLAN THROUGH THE END OF  
JUNE, IT WAS APPARENT THAT OUR PLANNED REVENUE GOALS FOR THE LAST HALF
OF THE YEAR, WOULD FALL WELL SHORT OF PLAN.  WE CLEARLY COULD NOT AFFORD   
TO SPEND ON THE CURRENT RATE, AND THEREFORE, THE ELIMINATION OR  
SIGNIFICANT CURTAILMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS WHICH WERE NOT    
ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, BECOME NECESSARY.  WE ALSO FOUND
THAT NORMAL BELT TIGHTENING WOULD NOT PRODUCE THE REQUIRED RESULTS TO 
MEET OUR NEW GOALS AND THEREFORE, A REDUCTION IN FORCE BECAME NECESSARY.   
     
IT IS MY VIEW THAT THE ACTIONS TAKEN, THOUGH PAINFUL, WERE A NECESSARY
CORRECTION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WILL KEEP US ON COURSE TOWARDS 
OUR LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE OF BECOMING THE SUPPLIER OF CHOICE TO THE OTHER    
ISG BUSINESS UNITS. 
     
MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE REDUCTION IN FORCE, HAVE, QUITE   
NATURALLY, EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO WERE AND FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE   
WITH THE COMPANY.  LET ME SAY THAT I KNOW OF NO ONE IN MANAGEMENT WHO 
WILL CONTEMPLATE A REDUCTION IN FORCE WITH ANYTHING BUT THE GREATEST  
RELUCTANCE.  I KNOW I SPEAK FOR THE ENTIRE SENIOR STAFF AS WELL AS MYSELF  
WHEN I SAY THAT.  AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL TODAY, THE FORCE REDUCTION WE 
HAVE JUST MADE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO THE PRESENT NEED.  THAT IS NOT TO
SAY THAT CONTINUED ACTIONS WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE SALES AND 
CONTROL COSTS.  QUITE THE CONTRARY IS TRUE.  TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGETS, THE   
COMING MONTHS WILL REQUIRE EXTRA EFFORTS AND ELIMINATION OF ALL  
UNNECESSARY COSTS.  I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL MAKE THOSE EFFORTS AND
THAT OUR COST CONTROLS WILL BE EFFECTIVE.    
     
WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED AT THIS TIME IN DETAILED PLANNING FOR 1986.  MOST 
INDUSTRY OPINION SUPPORTS A VIEW OF A CONTINUATION OF SLOW COMPUTER   
SALES THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF 1986.   THEREFORE, WE ARE    
DEVELOPING PLANS WHICH TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND WILL CAREFULLY CONTROL   
OUR GROWTH TO MITIGATE AGAINST ANY FURTHER NEED FOR A FORCE REDUCTION.
     
FOR THE LONGER TERM, I BELIEVE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE    
OF THE UPTURN WHEN IT HAPPENS.  BY THE END OF THE DECADE, OUR TARGET IS    
TO AT LEAST DOUBLE OUR REVENUES THROUGH EXPANDED SALES TO OTHER ISG   
BUSINESS UNITS AND TO ADDITIONAL OEM CUSTOMERS.   
     
IN EARLY 1986, ALMOST ALL OF MANAGEMENT WILL BE ENGAGED-ONE WAY OR ANOTHER-
WITH HELPING TO DEVELOP A LONG-RANGE BUSINESS STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE OUR 
GOAL OF PROFITABLE GROWTH.  ESSENTIAL TO THAT STRATEGY IS THE INVOLVEMENT  
OF EVERYONE IN THE QUEST FOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS THROUGH QUALITY IMPROVEMENT.    
IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE ONLY COMPANIES WHO CAN PROVIDE LONG-TERM   
EMPLOYMENT ARE THOSE WHO CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY PROFITABLE.  IN OUR HIGHLY    
COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY, THE SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES WILL BE THOSE WHO FOCUS ON  
QUALITY, WHO DELIVER PRODUCTS WHICH CONFORM EXACTLY TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS,   
ARE COMPETITIVELY PRICED, ARE DELIVERED AS COMMITTED AND ARE PROFESSIONALLY
SERVICED. 
     
WITH YOUR HELP, I BELIEVE WE WILL MAKE OUR COMPANY A GREAT SUCCESS.

RE:    MICOMS.85265


THE LATEST VERSION OF MICOMS, MICOMS.85265 WAS RELEASED SEPTEMBER 22, 1985.
I WAS SO INVOLVED IN PREPARATION FOR THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY THAT DOCUMENTATION
ON THIS VERSION WAS NOT SENT TO THE FIELD.  I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS DELAY IN
SENDING OUT DOCUMENTATION.

THE MOST NOTICEABLE CHANGE IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE MANAGEMENT SCREEN AND THE FE
SCREEN WITH A SINGLE USER SCREEN.  THIS WILL BE MORE EASILY DOCUMENTED,
MAINTAINED AND TAUGHT.

THIS USER SCREEN HAS THE FOLLOWING CHANGES:

1.	THE DATA BASE MAINTENANCE SCREEN IS NOW ITEM 4 RATHER THAN ITEM 7.

2.	THE INQUIRIES WHICH WERE INCLUDED ON THE FE SCREEN ARE NOW A SEPARATE SCREEN-
   ITEM 6.

3.	THE PICKING, SHIPPING AND RECEIVING ARE NUMBERED IN CONSECUTIVE ORDER 11, 12 AND 
  13 RATHER THAN 13, 14, 12.

4.	THE ABILITY TO UPDATE CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, MODEL DATA AND MODEL PART DATA HAS BEEN
  REMOVED BUT INQUIRIES FOR ALL THIS INFORMATION IS CONTAINED ON INQUIRIES SCREENS.

5.	THE MASTER PART DETAIL SCREEN HAS BEEN GIVEN UPDATE ABILITIES FOR THE PHYSICAL
  INVENTORY.  THIS UPDATE ABILITY WILL BE REMOVED AFTER THE PHYSICAL INVENTORY
  IS DONE.


THE INPUTTING OF MODEL AND MODEL SERIAL NUMBERS IS NO LONGER REQUIRED 
INFORMATION FOR MARS.

IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME.

    MCDONNELL DOUGLAS       ADMINISTRATIVE     NO:  ISG-85-149
INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 02 Oct 85



To:       ISG Lists A - D

Subject:  ADMINISTRATIVE BULLETINS (AB's)



1.  The following guidelines are established regarding the use 
    of AB's within ISG:

          Administrative Bulletins (AB's) will be used 
          throughout ISG as the means of announcing organization 
          changes, promotions, new or revised policies requiring 
          immediate implementation and other administrative 
          matters of substantial importance.  Two types of AB's 
          will be used:

          -   ISG AB's - Issued by ISG HQ/Group Staff

          -   ISG Company AB's -  Issued by ISG Business 
                                  Units/Organizations reporting 
                                  directly to the Group 
                                  Executive Officer or the Group 
                                  Operating Officer.

          All AB's should be drafted on the appropriate AB form, 
          signed by a Director or higher level and ready for 
          issuance (excluding AB number and date) and forwarded 
          to the issuing organization.  All ISG AB's involving 
          policy will require ISG-HQ signature.  All company 
          AB's involving policy will require signature of 
          Company Head.  AB's which identify newly assigned or 
          revised reporting relationships should include the 
          signature of the principal to whom these personnel 
          will report.

          The issuing organization will assure that all position 
          titles used in the AB are correct and will verify with 
          Human Resources that all announcements of promotions 
          or other title changes have been approved prior to 
          release of the AB.

          AB distribution should be customized whenever feasible 
          to include the specific Management Levels and 
          combination of ISG and other MDC organizations that 
          are impacted by the information being communicated.  
          Examples:  (1) For organization change in a Company 
          Fiscal area, Dist.--Company Levels A-E; (2) For change 
          in Cafeteria hours ISG Campus, Dist.--ISG and 
          MDAIS-St. Louis, Levels A-H; (3) For new Director 
          appointment ISG Group, Dist.--All ISG levels A-D.



          An ISG AB is required:

          -   when an ISG company announcement includes 
              concurrence signature(s) of ISG HQ or ISG Group 
              Staff principals,

          -   for all announcements of a policy nature which 
              materially impact any ISG company other than the 
              issuing organization,

          -   for all announcements of Vice President or higher 
              level promotion (distribution to include MDC 
              levels A through D).


          ISG AB's

          Responsibility for issuance is assigned to ISG Policy 
          Management.

          These AB's will be issued on ISG AB stationery. The AB 
          number will consist of a prefix - "ISG" followed by 
          the year (2 digits) and a single consecutive number, 
          i.e. - ISG-85-XXX.  (All numbers to be assigned by ISG 
          Policy Management.)


          ISG Company AB's

          Responsibility for issuance is assigned to each 
          applicable ISG Company head, reporting directly to the 
          Group Executive Officer or the Group Operating 
          Officer, or their appointed representative.  Each 
          company shall inform ISG Policy Management of the 
          individual assigned this responsibility.  It is 
          recommended that this be the same individual 
          responsible for handling policy coordination for each 
          ISG Company.

          These AB's will be issued on ISG Company AB 
          stationery.  The AB number will consist of the 
          specific company appreviation as a prefix followed by 
          the year (2 digits) and a single consecutive number, 
          i.e. - For "Health Systems", HS-85-XX.  Each ISG 
          Company shall include ISG Policy Management in the 
          distribution of their AB's.



2.  Please assure that communication of AB type information 
    within your area of concern is accomplished by an AB and is 
    prepared in accordance with the requirements as stated 
    above.  All ISG AB's should be forwarded to ISG Policy 
    Management-St. Louis, Dept. L089, Bldg. 301 for issuance and 
    a copy of each ISG company AB should be sent to them for 
    information.  Please call Ext. 36113 if you have any 
    questions on this subject.

You can now transfer files from a PDP-X to the FSC OnTyme account.
For this to work, modify or create the file ACCESS.ONT under your 
PDP-X username as follows:

	USERNAME;EMSFSC
	ACCOUNT.FSC
	ONTYME NAME X/XXXXX  (where X=your username)

That should do it.  If you have any problems with this, call me.

Also, a big THANK YOU to the folks who brought this problem
to my attention.

Jerry Bowman and John Hartog will be here from Irvine on Tuesday

To:       ISG Lists A - E

Subject:  FORMATION OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ELECTRONIC MESSAGING 
          SYSTEMS COMPANY



I am pleased to announce the formation of the McDonnell Douglas 
Electronic Messaging Systems Company.  MDEMS combines two 
existing businesses, FTCC and OnTyme, to aggressively pursue a 
larger share of the Electronic Messaging Market.  Combined 
revenue of FTCC and OnTyme in 1985 is $30 Million and the 
planned 1986 revenue goal for MDEMS is $40 Million.  This new 
unit will be a product organization and will rely on other ISG 
business units for the distribution of its products.

One key element of the 1986 MDEMS sales plan is to encourage all 
ISG business units to sell these messaging products.  At the 
present time, the bulk of the messaging revenue originates from 
the Diversified Systems Company and FTC Communications.  These 
organizations will continue to aggressively sell these products, 
but MDEMS will begin working with the other business units to 
adapt the products to their markets.

During the remainder of 1985, the MDEMS organization structure, 
business plan and 1986 financial operating plan will be 
developed to enable us to implement our messaging business 
strategy.

MDEMS will be managed by Terry Donaher, Vice President of 
Network Applications for the business and Network Systems 
Company and will report to Warren Prince, President of McDonnell 
Douglas Business and Network Systems Company.

   THIS MEMO IS TO LET THE FIELD KNOW OF SOME PROBLEMS WE HAVE   
BEEN HEARING ABOUT ON THE PSM BACKPLANE. THE BACKPLANE PINS ARE  
VERY EASILY BENT IF THE CARDS ARE NOT PUT IN PROPERLY. YOU HAVE  
TO INSERT THE CARD SLOWLY UNTIL YOU FEEL THE PINS SEAT IN THE    
CONNECTOR, THEN, PUSH IT IN THE REST OF THE WAY UNTIL SEATED
COMPLETELY. IF YOU DO NOT DO IT THIS WAY YOU ARE LIKELY TO BEND  
THE PINS AND THE CARD WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. IF YOU DO BEND 
SOME PINS, TURN THE POWER OFF TO THE PSM CARD CAGE AND TRY TO    
STRAIGHTEN OUT THE PINS. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO THIS, OR, THERE 
ARE TOO MANY PINS BENT, YOU CAN NOW ORDER JUST THE BACKPLANE INSTEAD  
OF THE WHOLE CARD CAGE. THE PART NUMBER IS 430190-001. IF YOU HAVE    
ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL NTS.

     As most all of you should know by now, we are being put
   through another inventory. This may or may not be a problem
   to you unless you run out of forms. Should anyone have not
   pulled unformatted copies from sys.54 and reformatted them
   to some readable state, or if you've had just about enough
   of your Great Expectations being ruined by your employment
   at the Counting House, even if you feel that life is pre-  
   sently sending you through Fields of positively charged 
   Copper, and you're a proton, I have a series of files designed  
   to take care of such an emergency.

     All it takes is a phone call to (408) 446-6149 8:30-5:30 <---P.S.T.
   Monday-Friday, or an ontyme to fsc.d/bilar. If given 0.5 day
   warning, I will have your copies sent out via ontyme or
   interoffice (with proper address) by the next morning. If
   anyone hasn't started yet, this stuff might be of some help, no?

     The files include instruction summary, all 3 forms, and all 
   3 sets of instructions. They are set up on 1 page each,
   where possible.

     Let me know If i can be of some help.

The problem was that CLRJBT cleared JBTPPN, but not JBTNM1 and JBTNM2.
This caused the monitor to return 0 as the PPN for MAIL, BAIGENT, etc when
it read the tables corresponding to jobs no longer logged in.  It has been
fixed in /P03.

Subject:  San Jose/Santa Clara, California Hotel Accommodations



1.  Information Systems Group has obtained special accommodation 
    rates with the Marriott Hotel, Santa Clara and the Embassy 
    Suites, Santa Clara for MDC employees.

2.  The Marriott Hotel is located at Highway 101 and Great 
    American Parkway (telephone (408) 988-1500); special MDC 
    rate for a hotel sleeping room is seventy-nine dollars 
    ($79.00) per night, single or double, Monday-Sunday.  The 
    rate is net/non-commissionable and applicable tax is not 
    included.  Reservations should be made by the MDC Authorized 
    Agency or individual directly with the Hotel Reservation 
    Department.  Reference to the special MDC rate should be 
    made when making reservations.  Billing procedures (paid for 
    individually upon check-out or billed to MDC) will be 
    established at the time the reservation is being made.  This 
    special rate is not a guaranteed space agreement and 
    therefore accommodations are subject to availability.

3.  The Embassy Suites location is 2885 Lakeside Drive (Highway 
    101 and Bowers) (telephone (408) 496-6400) special MDC rate 
    is eighty dollars ($80.00) single, ninety dollars ($90.00) 
    double, Monday thru Thursday per night, and sixty-nine 
    dollars ($69.00) up to four (4) people Friday thru Sunday 
    per night.  The rate is net/non-commissionable and 
    applicable tax is not included.  These rates include the 
    standard amenities of a two (2) room suite, complimentary 
    made-to-order breakfast every morning, complimentary 
    refreshments each evening, complimentary limousine service 
    to and from San Jose, California airport and a 'no tipping' 
    policy.  Reservations should be made by the MDC Authorized 
    Agency or individual directly with the Embassy Suites 
    Reservation Department.  Reference to the MDC special rate 
    should be made when making reservations.  Billing procedures 
    will be established at the time the reservation is being 
    made.  These special rates are not guaranteed space 
    agreements and therefore accommodations are based on 
    availability.



4.  These special rates are effective through 31 December 1985 
    at which time volume will be assessed and we may be in a 
    position to make the commitment necessary to get lower rates 
    in 1986.  These agreements provide excellent accommodations 
    in two (2) of the finer hotels in the San Jose airport 
    vicinity.  However, if you find any kind of problem with the 
    service you receive while staying at the hotels, a call to 
    Mike Tipton, McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company, 
    (408) 435-7606, Purchasing Department, will be all that is 
    required for us to follow-up with hotel administration.

5.  All MDC personnel are encouraged to take full advantage of 
    these offers while in the San Jose/Santa Clara area.

I am pleased to announce that Kevin P. McKeon has joined the 
MDISI organization as Director Business Management Planning 
effective 7 October 1985 reporting to me.

Kevin's twelve years of successful sales, marketing and 
management experience began in 1973 with the Burroughs 
Corporation where he advanced from Sales Representative to Sales 
Manager and Sales Instructor.  He joined Tymshare in 1978 to 
establish the new office in Minneapolis and later he became 
Branch Manager in St. Louis.

In 1982, Kevin was selected as the Manager of Electronic Data 
Interchange and was responsible for the basic development of EDI 
as a business opportunity for Tymshare.  His most recent 
position was that of Tactical Marketing Manager for the EDI 
product in the McDonnell Douglas Electronic Data Interchange 
Systems Company.

Kevin's responsibilities in this position will focus primarily 
on strategic planning and marketing issues for the MDISI 
business unit.  In this role he will be instrumental in the 
maturation of MDISI into a marketing driven organization.

Please join me in welcoming Kevin to MDISI and in assisting him 
in the fulfillment of his new responsibilities.

Subject:  RESIGNATION OF GARY E. LIEBL



I sincerely regret to announce the resignation of Gary E. Liebl, 
currently the Group Operating Officer of the Information Systems 
Group, effective Thursday, October 17, 1985.

Gary has accepted an appointment as President, Chief Operating 
Officer and member of the Board of Cipher Data Products, Inc., 
of San Diego, California, a leading supplier of magnetic tape 
peripherals and controllers.

During the time we worked together as ISG executive board 
members and, since June, as the team leading the ISG, I have 
developed great respect for his capabilities and for him as a 
person.  He will be greatly missed, and I am sure we all wish 
him much success in the future.

Prior to his present ISG position, Gary was President of 
McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company and President of 
Microdata Corporation.  Gary was also appointed a Corporate Vice 
President of MDC in July 1983.

Gary's departure makes necessary some alterations in the senior 
management structure of ISG; those changes will be announced in 
a few days.

Subject: FCR.E+3/4 

I followed the code a little further...
  it goes as follows... the user is doing SIMIO output and ends up at
  SIMBOU:  no problems, @SIMBO1+15 does a PUSHJ P,DDO(T1) which does
  a JRST OUTBLT.    P1,T4 are put on the stack, SIMIOA returns with a
  page in  %UPT+UPTSIM(W), SIMIOB sets up the POS in J and %UPT+UPTPOS(W),
  NEDMAP (bit 20) is set so we see PUSHJ P,SIMIOM @OUBLT0+15.  [No idea
  about whether SIMRMV is called, but I doubt it else we couldn't get a
  #3 error from map-file-page.]  SIMIOM puts P1,P2 on the stack, NEDRMV
  is not set, cause we made it past the STOPCD.  IO was set in S, so we
  jump off to SIMIM1 for output.  GOTPHP is set, so we hurry down to
  SIMIM2 where we call SIMCRE to do the right stuff with the output file.
  That probably succeeds (since we know we got a MAPERR not a FCRERR) and
  we try to map the page @SIMIM3+2.  That fails with #3 %FLVEX (FALVEX)
  and we go into the literal that clobbers the page number and JSPs to
  MAPERR which clobbers the page number again and sets the UUO value to 1
  and scurries off to SIMIMF which pops P2,P1 back into place, sets up S
  from DEVIOS(F) and returns to  OUBLT0+15  which goes to SIMIOS which
  pops T4,P1 back from the stack.  T1 = UUO,,ERR  == 1,,3  is pushed on
  the stack for the UUO-range check.  Then at MAP.E/FCR.E it's popped
  back off the stack, mangled and checked...  we then hit our STOPCD at
  FCR.E+3 (old FCR.E+4).

Looking at the stack, it's clear that 1001,,3 is returned from the CHANIO
UUO (EPT+1,,PG)[suspicious no?]  and that we have some other clues to
verify this.
  %UPT+UPTIOC[ usecount  which is found in %UPT+UPTSIM(W)[ usecount,,501001
  and %UPT+UPTPOS(W)[ 11  which was also in DEVPOS(F).  We can now check
  the old FCR.E+4 crashes for lh[ UPTSIM(W) ]==UPTIOC to find out what page
  and status bits {GOTPHP,NEDRMV,NEDMAP,GOTHOL} are set.  In this case, the
  501001 says GOTPHP,NEDMAP,page 1001.  %UPT+UPTPBM[ 600000,,177777  which
  says ppp 1000 & 1001 are marked in use.

It's possible that more checks for NEDRMV are needed, or a non-faulting
test is needed to see if the page IS there even though NEDMAP is set?
I looked at SIMRMV and it looks like it makes sure that the page is gone
one way or the other... so we need to make sure that the page is NOT in
the indicated slot for that channel.  GOTPHP and USETO may play a part in
this too.  Need to insure that USETO will clear GOTPHP if the pos is less
than DEVPOS(F)/UPTPOS(W).   sigh.

Hope you can follow this commentary through the crash and dig up any new
leads on what to look at.  I've already spent too much time looking at it
instead of doing other things.  /Carl

SUBJECT>   HEALTH PLAN INFORMATION


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Over the past few weeks, many of you have had questions about 
your new health benefits.  The most frequently asked questions 
are answered here to help everyone understand these new plans.  
Other questions may be referred to your Human Resources 
Department:
 
     Southern California             (714) 250-1000
                                      Ext. 2184 or 2239

GENERAL AMERICAN PLAN
 
 
WHEN ARE MY ISG BENEFITS EFFECTIVE?
 
If you were an ISG employee prior to 9/30/85, your benefits 
become effective 9/30/85.  If you were disabled or on a leave of 
absence on that date, your coverage will be delayed until you 
return to work.
 
 
I HAVE A DEPENDENT WHO WAS HOSPITALIZED ON 9/30/85.  IS MY 
DEPENDENT COVERED UNDER THE OLD PLAN OR THE NEW PLAN?
 
                                                                Page  2

If a dependent was confined in a hospital or convalescent nursing 
home prior to 9/30/85, he/she will be covered under the old plan 
until discharged.  The day after discharge, the dependent will be 
covered under the new plan.
 
 
DO I HAVE TO SATISFY AN ADDITIONAL 1985 ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLE WITH 
GENERAL AMERICAN BEFORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE?
 
Deductible expenses incurred between 1/1/85 and 9/29/85 under 
your previous health plan apply toward General American's 1985 
deductible.  If the deductible on your previous plan was less 
than General American's, you will need to satisfy the difference.  
This information was sent by the previous carrier to General 
American on 9/30/85.
 
NOTE:  Under the General American Plan, deductible expenses 
incurred during October, November or December apply toward the 
following year's deductible.
 
 
WHAT DO I DO WITH BILLS INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85 THAT HAVE NOT 
BEEN SUBMITTED?
 
All claims must be submitted to your previous carrier as soon as 
possible.  Send claims to:
 
     Former Tymshare/Tymnet employees:
 
          New Systems Inc.
          P.O. Box 11290
          San Francisco, CA.  94101
 
     Former Microdata employees:
 
          Northwestern National Life Insurance Company
          Regional Claims Center
          730 Fairmont Avenue - Suite 202
          Glendale, CA  91203
 
 
HOW WILL GENERAL AMERICAN KNOW ABOUT DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES I 
SUBMITTED AFTER 9/30/85 FOR EXPENSES INCURRED PRIOR TO 9/30/85?
 
Keep your copy of the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) form which 
accompanies all claim payments.  Attach this form to claims you 
submit to General American so that you are credited with the 
proper deductible amount.
 
 
WHEN WILL I RECEIVE MY PCS CARD?
 
Your PCS card(s) will be mailed by the end of October.  Until you 
receive your card, you must pay for the drug.  Keep the receipt 
which itemizes patient's name, doctor's name, prescription 
number, date, quantity dispensed and amount charged.  You will be 
reimbursed the charge for the drug, less the appropriate 
deductible ($1.50 or $3.00) by attaching the receipt to the PCS 
                                                                Page  3

claim form.  Claim forms are available from the Human Resources 
office.  This form requires information found only on your PCS 
card, so wait until you receive your card before submitting the 
form for reimbursement.  This procedure applies for drugs 
purchased for dependent children over age 19 or from non-
participating pharmacies.
 
 
HOW DO I FILL A PRESCRIPTION THROUGH THE MAIL ORDER OPTION?
 
You will receive a mail order form for the America's Pharmacy 
with your PCS card.  You may order by mail the amount prescribed 
by your doctor, up to a 6 month supply, by paying only one 
deductible.
 
 
WHO DOES MY DOCTOR/HOSPITAL CALL FOR VERIFICATION OF MY 
INSURANCE?
 
Call the MDC Group Insurance Office in St. Louis at
(314) 232-9181.
 
 
WHAT IF MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDS HOSPITALIZATION?

or General American will not pay the hospital bill.  Ask the 
doctor to call Monday through Friday:
 
     St. Louis Area          1-314-367-8401
     Minnesota               1-800-642-4456
     Other Areas             1-800-328-9903
 
 
WHAT ABOUT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS?
 
Your doctor must call for certification within one working day 
after admission to the hospital.
 
 
WHEN MUST I OBTAIN A SECOND SURGICAL OPINION?
 
Unless you obtain a second opinion for some non-emergency 
surgical procedures, General American will pay half the amount it 
would normally pay for the surgeon's fees.  These procedures are 
listed on page 13 of Your Group Insurance summary plan 
description.
 
 
WHAT IF A NEED EMERGENCY SURGERY?
 
Second opinions are not required in emergency situations.
 
 
ARE THERE ANY SPECIAL CLAIM PROCEDURES?
 
Yes.  When you get a second opinion, get a special sticker for 
your claim form from the Group Insurance Office or your Human 
                                                                Page  4

Resources Office.  The doctor giving the second opinion must 
complete and sign the sticker for the second opinion to be paid 
at 100%.  Separate bills for tests related to the second opinion, 
require a similar sticker for reimbursement.
 
 
WILL I RECEIVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PRE-ADMISSION 
CERTIFICATION AND THE SECOND SURGICAL OPINION FEATURES?
 
A mailing was sent to all ISG employees which included brochures 
on Second Surgical Opinions, Pre-Admission Certification and 
General American Plan information card(s).  If you did not 
receive this information, please contact Human Resources.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED, RESPONSE TIME ON ONTYME HAS GOTTEN SLOWER
AND SOMETIMES YOU RECEIVE A MESSAGE SAYING - SUBHOST OUT OF PORTS -

BOTH OF THESE HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF USERS ON OUR
ACCOUNT.  

DO NOT STAY LOGGED IN FOR ANY LONGER THAN NECESSARY.  WHEN YOU FINISH,
USE ONE OF THE LOGOFF COMMANDS (:Q, :EX, :LOG).  IF YOU JUST TURN OFF
YOUR TERMINAL, YOU'RE STILL CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM UNTIL YOU ARE TIMED
OUT.  THAT KEEPS SOMEONE ELSE FROM LOGGING ON.

THE USERS ON THE WEST COAST CAN DO EVERYONE A SPECIAL FAVOR.  STAGGER YOUR
LOG-IN TIMES.  IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE MANY WHO LIKE TO PICKUP YOUR MESSAGES
AND GO FOR A CUP OF COFFEE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,  TRY PICKING UP
YOUR MESSAGES LATER ON IN THE DAY.  TRY AND AVOID PEAK TIMES.

IF YOU DO RECEIVE A SUBHOST OUT OF PORTS MESSAGE, WAIT AT LEAST 15 MINUTES
BEFORE TRYING AGAIN.

ANOTHER TRICK MIGHT BE TO USE THE :SIG COMMAND WHEN YOU ARE DONE.  IF THERE
ARE TWO OR THREE OF YOU WHO ALL WANT TO CHECK YOUR MESSAGES, HAVE ONE PERSON
LOG IN.  WHEN THAT PERSON IS DONE, :SIG WILL SIGN THEM OUT BUT LEAVE
THE LINE CONNECTED INTO THE ACCOUNT.  THEN THE NEXT PERSON LOGS IN WITHOUT
HAVING TO REMAKE A CONNECTION THROUGH THE NETWORK.

IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR DEALING WITH OUR ONTYME PROBLEMS,
                                                                Page  2

SEND THEM TO ME (FSC.SUP) AND IF THEY'RE GOOD I'LL PASS THEM ALONG.


LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO KEEP OUR LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN AND CLEAR.

Subject: INSSIM+2 crashes on D25. 

All 15 of the INSSIM+2 crashes on D25 were the same.  The symptoms were:
JOB pointed to a frame that was running LOGOUT.
%UPT+UPTPDL/ CAME 400323	;1 past the EVICT uuo in LOGOUT
	710/ 4000,,USRMPE+2 or 4000,,USRXIT+22 ;left over garbage
	711/ 4000,,UUOPN1+5	;UUOPNT+8 has PUSHJ P,UUODSP

	713/ 32001		;Result of CONI MTR,T1 on a KL
  P/    714/ UUOKNT+12		;UUOKNT+11 has PUSHJ P,UUODSP

Diagnosis: The EVICT uuo in PICON has the following:
	PUSH   P,T1		;Save the target job number
	PUSHJ  P,FARCHK		;Fast access rights check for HALT access
	  POPJ P,		;Not allowed

If the check for access rights fails for any resaon, the POPJ jumps to an
illegal instruction in low core.

Cure:	Change EVICT+5 from POPJ P, to JRST TPOPJ.  This fix is in 
	(M33)EVICT.PAT and will be distributed to all systems.

Note: Carl found that the bug was introduced in the P034/B monitor.
	It only occurs when someone with account supervisor privileges
	tries to kill another frame with the same GAN, and the attempt fails.
	The attempt is supposed to work, and does if the killer has license.

    of MDC property .

4.  Your observance of these new security procedures will be appreciated.

A LITTLE MORE.

DO 'NOT' COUNT INSTALLED NETWORK MACHINES OR PRIVATE NETS.
DO 'NOT' WORRY ABOUT APPLYING ASSET TAGS.

JUST SUPPLY THE ENGINE TYPE, THE LOCATION (ADDRESS), AND THE MOST
IMPORTANT ITEM THE SERIAL #.

THIS COUNT 'MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED BY WEDNESDAY OCT.30,1985. ALL THE MACHINES

My "extra" beeper battery doesn't seem to want to charge at all.  I've
had it charging in the spare slot on my charger and when I went to use
it on Friday, it was dead as a doornail!  I've tried charging it a little
inside the beeper while turned on, and again it doesn't seem to work.  I
haven't tried it with the beeper OFF, because I wanted to make sure Osman
or Joe was available while I had the beeper OFF.

I may want to try another charger or another battery... anyway, if I don't
answer the page this weekend, it's because my batteries are on the blink,
so feel free to call me if you need help.. /Carl

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

ISG-85-162

    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.

Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

Osman,
  Craig was by and we talked about the msg from Donahue... it did bring
up an interesting co-incidence.  I looked at the crashes and BOTH of the
crashes had APRSTS[ NoMem MemBusParity, ERASTS[ 602000,,APRINT+2  which
is really APRINT+2 plus 3 from bits 0-1 == APRFAT+2 which is by a weird
co-incidence RDERA ERASTS!  Both crashes had TTYZNE as the stopcd, and
were caused by a message type 15 (leave deferred echo mode) while there
were characters left to be echoed  LDBECC(U) ... Hmmmm.  Both crashes are
at DIEREH!  Both crashes have a completely different idea of how they got
to DIEREH... one was at TTYBMT (bad message type? how did it get here?)
if it was processing a stopcd?  and the other was in the null job!

Both had a CH1 in progress from the same location DIE1A+13... Hmmmm.

Joe?  any ideas?
Osman, please talkto craig BEFORE you answer Donahue.

OSMAN,AS USUAL I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE CRASHES ON THE PDP-10'S.
I HAVE NOTICED THAT TWO SYSTEMS,BOTH KL10'S, ARE GETTING THE SAME
CRASH RUNNING THE SAME VERSION OF THE MONITOR.THE SYSTEMS ARE C26
AND F30,BOTH ARE RUNNING THE P034/P-1 SOFTWARE AND BOTH ARE CRASHING
WITH APR DETECTED NXM'S WITH NO DMA NXM DETECTED DURING A CACHE
SWEEP.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE SOME STRANGE SOFTWARE BUG OR THAT
WE ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING THAT THE VERSION OF U-CODE WE ARE USING
CAN'T HANDLE.I CAN'T REALLY SEE TWO KL10'S BROKE THE SAME WAY RUNNING
THE SAME SOFTWARE.THE CRASH ON C26 IS CRA013 AND F30 IS CRA007.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP      BULLETIN        DATE: 29 Oct 85



To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

    $ 25,000                 $ .23             $ .34
    $ 50,000                 $ .45             $ .68
    $ 75,000                 $ .68             $1.02
    $100,000                 $ .90             $1.36
    $125,000                 $1.13             $1.70
    $150,000                 $1.35             $2.04
    $175,000                 $1.58             $2.38
    $200,000                 $1.80             $2.72
    $225,000                 $2.03             $3.06
    $250,000                 $2.25             $3.40



ISG-85-163
Page 2


If you elect family coverage, consult your Group Insurance 
Summary Plan Description for the definition of an eligible 
child.  The benefit payable depends on your family makeup:

     SPOUSE ONLY       SPOUSE & CHILDREN       CHILDREN ONLY

         60%             Spouse - 50%               20%
                          Child - 10%

Enrollment cards can be obtained from your local Human Resources 
Office serving your area.  Completed cards must be dated during 
the month of November 1985, and forwarded to your Human Resource 
Office no later than November 29, 1985.

To:       ISG Lists A-E; MDC Plant Lists A-C

Subject:  CHANGES IN ISG ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE



When ISG's top management structure was formed in June of this 
year, it was built around the complementary capabilities 
Gary Liebl and I brought to our respective positions.  Now, 
Gary's departure has compelled us to re-evaluate that structure 
and decide whether to continue with out Group Executive/Group 
Operating Officer arrangement or switch to a simpler arrangement 
that consolidates all reporting under one Group executive.

As is clear from the attached preliminary organizational chart*, 
we have chosen the latter.  The purpose of this A.B. is to 
announce a number of organizational changes related to this 
revised organizational structure, all of which are effective 
immediately.

First, in order to have a manageable number of people reporting 
directly to me, I have made the following changes in reporting 
relationships:

    .  John Clancy now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company, John will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
       Systems Company, under Otis Brinkley, President, and 
       McDonnell Douglas Communications Industry Systems 
       Company, under Buck Yoder, Executive Vice President and 
       General Manager.

    .  Vern Smith now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Computer Systems Company, Vern will oversee the 
       activities of McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, 
       under Vern Hart, President.  Since one of the Field 
       Service Company's primary tasks is to maintain Computer 
       Systems hardware in the marketplace, this grouping will 
       facilitate an even closer working relationship in this 
       activity.

ISG-85-162
Page 2


    .  Rich Calvert now reports directly to me.  In addition to 
       his ongoing duties as President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Diversified Information Systems Company, Rich will 
       oversee the activities of McDonnell Douglas Information 
       Processing Company, under Ted Bellan, President.  While 
       the Information Processing Company serves many ISG 
       business units, Diversified is its largest customer.  As 
       with Computer Systems and Field Service, this grouping 
       will be beneficial to both parties.

    .  McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company, under 
       Leo Mirowitz, President, reported to me before Gary 
       became Group Operating Officer.  Now this company will 
       again report directly to me.  I am also pleased to 
       announce that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems 
       International Company, under Jerry Causley, President, 
       will now for the first time report directly to me.

It is important to note that, while some business units are 
being grouped for reporting purposes under a few ISG senior 
executives, there is no intent to change individual business 
unit missions or consolidate operations and financial 
reporting.  The companies being grouped together are still key 
elements of the ISG strategy and will continue to function 
independently.  I will continue to take a personal interest in 
these business units, but I must rely on John, Vern and Rich to 
oversee the direct management of these organizations.

Along with the above business unit realignments, I am making the 
following changes in the structure of ISG's Group-level staff 
organizations:

    .  Charlie Dignan, Staff Vice President-Corporate Accounts, 
       now reports to Jim Donovan, Vice President of Marketing 
       and Planning-ISG.

    .  Stan Bjurstrom, Chief Counsel-ISG (East), and 
       Hank Kohlmann, Chief Counsel-ISG (West), now report to 
       Mark Kuhlmann, Staff Vice President and Associate General 
       Counsel-ISG.

    .  Bernie Hathaway, Staff Vice President-Productivity, now 
       reports directly to me.

    .  Dennis Carvalho, Director of Human Resources-ISG 
       (St. Louis), now reports to Mike Becker, Staff Vice 
       President of Human Resources-ISG.


ISG-85-162

Some further organizational changes are being made in response 
to our need to limit the number of strategic thrusts we can 
realistically pursue at one time.  These changes are summarized 
below:

    .  For the time being, we have decided to eliminate 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company's 
       growth strategy and to focus on the activities of 
       McDonnell Douglas Payment Systems Company.  As a result, 
       McDonnell Douglas Financial Transaction Systems Company, 
       as it was organized earlier this year, has been 
       dissolved.  Alden Heintz, President, McDonnell Douglas 
       Payment Systems Company, now reports directly to me in my 
       capacity as Group Executive Officer-ISG.

    .  In a related move, the Check Card and Credit Reporting 
       Development organizations, headed by John Mazzola and 
       David Jung and formerly part of McDonnell Douglas 
       Financial Transaction Systems, now report to 
       Otis Brinkley.  We believe in the need to continue work 
       on our Distribution Systems strategy, even though we have 
       limited 1986 funds available for this activity.  Because 
       we believe that both of these former Financial 
       Transaction Systems thrusts have synergy with our plans 
       for the wholesale/retail distribution industry, we want 
       them to be evaluated for integration into our 
       Distribution Systems strategy.

    .  The Computer Systems Marketing and Sales organization, 
       under Mike Coleman, has by all measurements had an 
       extremely difficult year in 1985.  In an effort to 
       strengthen this organization, it has been move out of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company, 
       and will now report to Otis Brinkley.  Considering that 
       about a third of our Computer Systems sales have 
       historically been into the retail distribution 
       marketplace and that Computer Systems products are 
       planned as the foundation of our Distribution Systems 
       strategy, this new alignment should allow ISG to take 
       better advantage of our domestic Computer Systems sales 
       force.  The fact that Distribution Systems, Computer 
       Systems Marketing and Sales and the Computer Systems 
       Company all are located in Irvine, California, will 
       facilitate a close working relationship among the three.

    .  As a result of the preceding change, the name of 
       McDonnell Douglas Business and Network Systems Company is 
       now McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company.  Warren 
       Prince will continue as President of this company, and 
       will report directly to me.

In the coming weeks, more details will be provided by the 
business units and staff organizations affected by these 
changes.  In the meantime, the attached preliminary 
organizational chart should help clarify our new top management 
alignment.

To:       ISG Employees Eligible for Benefits

Subject:  ISG OPTIONAL SPECIAL ACCIDENT INSURANCE PLAN



During the month of November 1985 eligible employees who are not 
now members may elect to enroll in the Optional Special Accident 
Insurance Program.  Current members may elect to make other 
changes, such as redesignation in the amount of insurance or 
inclusion of their family.

If an ISG employee is married to another ISG employee, and both 
are eligible for the Optional Special Accident Insurance, they 
may each elect coverage as employees but they may not insure 
each other as spouses.  If these employees have eligible 
children, either employee may elect family coverage in order to 
cover the children but only one parent may cover the children.

If your spouse is a salaried employee of MDC but is not an ISG 
employee, and you are both eligible for an MDC-sponsored Special 
Accident Insurance plan, the rule again applies that you may 
each enroll as employees but you may not insure each other as 
spouses.

The schedule of benefits and weekly cost is as follows:

    Level of                Weekly Cost of Coverage For:
    Coverage                You Only        Your Family

Subject:  ONTYME SYSTEMS APPOINTMENT



I am pleased to announce the appointment of Richard C. Gunther 
to the position of General Manager, Ontyme Systems, in the newly 
formed McDonnell Douglas Electronic Messaging Systems Company 
(MDEMS, a part of Network Systems Company).  Dick will report to 
Terry Donaher, Vice President, MDEMS.

Dick brings over 25 years of experience in the computing and 
communications industries to MDEMS.  Over the past four years, 
he has made many contributions to the strategic plans of Tymnet 
and the McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group, most 
recently by chairing the ISG Communications Opportunities Task 
Force and by spearheading the effort to create MDEMS.  He was 
instrumental in the acquisition of FTC Communications, the other 
principal component of MDEMS.

During the balance of 1985, Dick will focus on developing a 1986 
operating plan for Ontyme Systems, and organizing the business 
unit to start the new year with increased momentum.

The recent announcement of the formation of MDEMS stressed that 
a key to ISG's success will be how well MDEMS works with all the 
other business units to distribute its products and services.  
Dick is making this his top priority.  Please join me in 
welcoming him to MDEMS and give him your full support in his 
efforts to achieve our mutual objectives.

Subject: Problem with SCNSER running during STOPCD output. 

I was looking at (M33)SIMKL.MAC, and happened to come across a comment that
explains how we could be getting a stopcode in SCNSER while processing a
JOB or INFO stopcode.  I verified it in the Processor Reference Manual, on
page 3-8:  Bit 24 Request interrupts on levels selected by 1s in bits 29-35,
and force the processor to recognize them even on lefels that are off.

This means that the WRPI REQCLK at KEYSET+6 in PICON causes the channel 7
interrupt to be recognized, and a full SCNSER cycle and a full schedular
cycle is initiated.  This is most likely the cause of the recursion in
the stopcode handler.

I added a SKIPN .CPCPC in front of the WRPI REQCLK for the P034/P05 monitor.
That change needs to be put in all the P monitors when I get back.

Subject: Removal of usernames from systems 25, 33 and 70 

I just received a forwarded copy of your memo regarding the removal of
usernames from these 3 systems and I am *VERY* concerned that you would
even think of this kind of wholesale username annihilation.

I realize it is your responsibility to manage the system resources for
TYMNET, but this kind of action shows a marked lack of understanding of
the systems involved.  TYMCOM-X systems require a fairly substantial
list of GAN 1 and GAN 3 usernames for the smooth operation of both the
operating system itself and related utilities.  System accounting and
billing require some usernames in GANs 4 and 6.  Software distribution
requires usernames in GANs 1 and 11447.

I believe that there must be a better mechanism for consolidating the
system resources of TYMNET and removing unnecessary users from your new
or dedicated TYMCOM-X systems.

Please give me a call (afternoons) at 415-794-2515  or ext 116-2515 so
that we may talk about this matter.

In order to alleviate the load on our account and attempt to cut
back on 'junk mail', some new administrative procedures are going
into effect.
 
As of Monday, November 11th, any requests for additions and
deletions to the FSC account will be handled by the people listed
below:
 
     Sales                              FSC.L/EVERINGHAM
     Marketing and Planning             FSC.SUP

     Finance and Administration         FSC.SUP
     Field Operations - East            FSC.S/HARRIS
     Field Operations - Central         FSC.D/BRANNON
     Field Operations - West            FSC.N/RICHARDSON
     Field Operations - Headquarters    FSC.B/SANDQUIST
     Material and Logistics             FSC.SUP
 
These people will also be responsible for message distribution in
their area.  We are in the process of standardizing the file
names used for mailing lists, to make them easier to use.  Any
OnTyme problems should be referred to the appropriate person, who
will then, if necessary, escalate it.

Good news!  The FSC account is being moved to a new OnTyme host.
This should give us better response time and easier accessibility.
 
The move will take place the weekend of November 15th.  There are
a few things that each of you need to know:
 
     1.   Only the usernames and the files will be moved.
          The IN, IN OLD, OUT, and OUT OLD messages will
          be left behind.
 
     2.   If you have any messages you want to save, put
          them in a file.*  (see * below)
 
     3.   ALL MESSAGES MUST BE SENT AND/OR READ by 12:00
          noon, PST on Friday November 15th.
 
     4.   You have until 4:00 pm, PST on November 15th 
          to save any messages.
 
     5.   The FSC account will be UNAVAILABLE from 5:00 pm,
          PST, November 15th until 3:00 pm, PST, November
          16th.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ACCESS THE ACCOUNT DURING
          THIS TIME.
 
     6.   A new letter will appear in front of messages on
          the new host.  Instead of a J, you will see a P.
                                                                Page  2

 
All internal accounts have been notified of this move.  They have
been asked to hold all their messages for FSC until the move is
completed.  Thanks for your help and understanding.
 
 
* - Here are two procedures for saving your messages as files:
 
     1.  There is an EXEC available between the hours of
         3:00 pm and 6:00 am PST, called ** FSC.FILEMSGS.
         Decide which messages you want to save and write
         down the complete message numbers.  Type in 
         :EXEC ** FSC.FILEMSGS and answer the prompts.
 
     2.  Determine which messages you want to save and
         write down the full message numbers.  For each
         message to be saved, issue the following commands:
          :ERASE
          :GET message#
          :FILE * filename

Around 11pm - got a call from Karen, the first attempt to copy the pack

Got on the system, ran full DSKCLN in check-out mode.  Only two files in
(TAPELIB) marked as bad, still had 24000 lost pages.

12:40am - Called data center, told them to deposit 1 in 30 and bring the
system up with a real FULL DSKCLN.  (Could not run TAKEIT because of network

I had difficulty getting to system 74.  The Fremont TYMSAT was not talking to
the supervisor, in that when I typed "JMS:930" or "JMS:74" it just sat there,
and did not ask for password.  I had to go thru Oakland to get the manual
DSKCLN started.  Once it was going, I typed two Control-C's, CCONTINUE, and
DETACH so I could hang up and try the Fremont node 3220 again.  It still
would not let me in as JMS from that node.  But username BUBB worked.
I typed C to get back to TYMNET, and was able to login JMS:74 and attach
to the DSKCLN job OK.

DSKCLN pointed out problems in [1,30773], user TAPELIB.  I GFD'd there,
went to do a DIR/EVERYTHING, and got no response on my terminal.  Tried hanging
up and redialing, had to go thru BUBB again, but got nothing after the
<beep>shut<beep> message.  At this point I called the Data Center and told
them to recycle system 74 with a full DSKCLN.

I had to login thru Oakland again, the Fremont node 3220 is not even talking
to BUBB now.

Symptom:  System dies in ONCE complaining about unit 15 off-line due to hardware
          errors, logical unit 5 missing from DSKB.  Operations called for
          software support in case problem was the same as "inconsistent pack

Problem:  Advised them that problem sounded like hardware, and to try to the
          disk on a different drive.  Hardware called in.

Solution: Drive had a bad plug.  System answered at 18:49.

Subject: RPORTN on system 95, micronode 6760. 

The off-by-one discrepency between the PDP-10 and its base also affects the
2020.  I noticed that the micronode was assigning port numbers starting at
17 when logging into 95, so I build a monitor with RPORTN=^D16.  That is,
one that would only accept port numbers 0-17 (octal, or 0-15 decimal) from
6760.  The monitor got two INFO stopcodes TTYBZP when it came up.  In each,
the message type was 43 (date/time from supervisor) and the port number was
20 (octal).  The system came up fine, and allowed me to login on TTY17 (octal).

The monitor 95XP07.SAV is currently built with RPORTN=^D17 so that it can
handle 16 real ports (00 to 17 octal) and one fake port TTY20 for date/time.

The micronodes on the Paris machines appear to assing port numbers starting
with 37 octal and working down, and never use ports 40 to 77.  Reducing RPORTN
for those 2020s would add to available free core.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


It has been brought to my attention that some of you may not be aware
of the fact that our OnTyme account was switched to a new host last
weekend.  (Have you noticed the improved response time?)

Because of the move, any incoming messages that you did not read by
4:00 pm, November 15th have been left behind.  If you are concerned
about not receiving an important message, there is a solution.

I can go in and get a hardcopy of your messages and mail them to you.
Just send me your name and a mailing address and I'll send them out.
If you need them any faster, please call me at (408) 446-6940.

The last day that I can do this is November 27th, so get your request
in by then.

Subject: TRW's access to host 31. 

O.,

I've spoken with Karen Linus.  she tells me that TRW can log into host
26, through their gateway, with no problem.  This way they are able to
do their backups onto our host with no added difficulty.  Although they
cannot get to host 31, they are satisified -- for now.

Karen mentioned your telling her that you were going to look at AUXMOX
on 31.  I believe her mention of this was more due to her curiosity than
the existence of any problems.

Subject:     Property Removal System


On 25 October 1985 an OnTyme message was sent to all managers in
reference to the new property removal system.  It was requested
that all managers contact the Security Department for further
information.

This message is being sent to reissue the above request to all
managers so that the new property removal system can be properly
implemented.

Those managers who have already contacted the Security Department
in reference to the new property removal system should disregard
this message.

The Security Department can be reached at X7075 Monday thru Friday
8AM till 5PM.

1.  MDC  Standards,  Reference  (a),  provide a list of preferred
    hardware  and  software standards for office automation.  For
    ISG  use,  Reference (b), we are continuing with only the IBM
    Personal  Computer  (PC) and IBM Personal Computer XT (PC/XT)
    devices   for   automated  office  systems.    Enclosure  (1)
    provides   the  current  standard  configurations  for  these
    systems.

2.  Configurations  in Enclosure (1) have been updated to reflect
    new  software versions for Multimate (Advantage Version 3.6),
    Lotus  1-2-3  (Version  2),  and  DOS  (Version  3.1).    All
    existing  PC  and  PC/XT users will receive software upgrades
    for  these products in December 1985.  Update procedures will
    be announced by separate Administrative Bulletin.

3.  Lotus  Version 2 will not require use of the system diskette,
    provides    accelerated    calculations    using   the   math
    coprocessor,  and  provides  file  password capability. Lotus
    1-2-3  Aids  in  Enclosure  (1)  have  been  removed from the
    Preferred  Options  due  to these features now being provided
    by Lotus.

          APPOINTMENTS



As  a result of the formation of the new Northern CA Metropolitan
Services  Organization,  I  am  pleased to announce the following
assignments.    This  organization  will  provide  facilities and
other  general  services  support  to ISG's Northern CA corporate
properties.    A  more  detailed  statement  of  charter is being
direct  mailed  to  affected  business  unit  presidents or their
designees.

    Bob  Beach  is appointed Manager - Plant Engineering Services
    with  responsibility  for interior design, space planning and
    allocation,   engineering   and  construction  services,  and
    regulatory  compliance.  Many of you will know Bob, as he has
    served  Tymshare and its predecessor companies for many years
    in  a  variety  of  capacities,  most  recently as Facilities
    Manager, Northern California properties.

    Leo  German  is  promoted  to  Manager - Maintenance Services
    with  responsibility  for  service  contract  administration,
    preventative  and  on-call maintenance, and landlord liaison.
    Leo  has  been with Tymnet almost two years, most recently as
    Staff   Facilities   Engineer,  Network  Facilities.    While
    relatively  new  to ISG, Leo has over 20 years' experience in
    facilities maintenance and operations.

    Chuck  Herman  is  appointed  Manager - General Services with
    responsibility  for  mail  services, reprographics, and voice
    communications.    Distribution  services, as well, are under
    study  for  possible  centralization  under  this department.
    Chuck  has  been  with  Tymnet  for  less than a year, in the
    capacity  of  Manager,  Non-Network Facilities.  While new to
    ISG,  Chuck has over 15 years' experience in general services
    and facilities operations.

    Wanda  Smith  is  continuing  in  her assignment as Manager -
    Administration.   However, as we have recently integrated our
    Network  Facilities  Department  with  the  new  Metropolitan
    Services   Organization,  Wanda's  responsibilities  will  be
    expanded  to include full support to the MSO.  Wanda has been
    with   Tymnet   almost   two  years,  following  considerable
    experience    in   other   Facilities,   Real   Estate,   and
    Administrative organizations.

    Mark  Lauver,  Director  of Facilities, MDNSC, will be Acting
    Manager  -  Metropolitan Services until further notice.  This
    organization,  as  well as the Network Facilities Department,
    will continue to report to Mark.

Please  join  me  in  congratulating  these  folks  on  their new
assignments  and  responsibilities.  They, and I, will appreciate
your support and cooperation as we tackle these new challenges.

To:       ALL ISG MANAGEMENT (LEVELS A-H)

Subject:  PLACEMENT,  ADVANCEMENT, COUNSELING AND TRAINING (PACT)
          PROGRAM


Entrance  into  the PACT Program's displaced workers and training
functions   was  suspended  in  August  1985  because  of  budget
constraints.    After  careful  consideration, we have decided to
discontinue  PACT  as  of  December  31,  1985.   The decision to
discontinue  PACT  was difficult and is based solely on financial
considerations.

The   Program   was   successful   in  redeploying  and  training
employees.    A  total of 299 ISG employees participated in PACT.
Eighty  three percent of this total or 248 employees were trained
and  placed  in new productive positions within ISG and other MDC
components.   The majority of the remainder had job offers within
MDC prior to leaving.

The  Internal  Placement  function will continue as part of Human
Resources  at  both  the  Business Unit and Regional levels.  All
transfers  within  or  between  ISG  Business  Units, group staff
organizations  and  MDC  organizations  external  to  ISG will be
administered  by  the  Human  Resources  function  supporting the
affected  organizations.    Transfers  for Business Units that do
not  currently  have Human Resources functions will be handled by
the  Regional  staffs.    Questions  concerning  support  at  the
regional  levels should be directed to Dennis Carvalho, St. Louis
Region, or Wylie Taylor, Western Region.

Our  appreciation  for  a  job  well  done  and  best  wishes for
continued  success  in  your  new  positions  to  the PACT team -
Jerry  Sexauer,  Mel  Bradford,  Regina  Higgins,  Larry Jenkins,
Melinda Kendall, Shelly Landau, Bill Miller and John Scheitlin.

To:       ISG Management Levels A-E

Subject:  Addition   to   Policy   5-MDC  section-ISG  Management
          Handbook



1.  Policy  5  in  the MDC section of the ISG Management Handbook
    discusses    the    HQ-authorized    manuals    which    have
    corporate-wide  applicability.    The appendix to this Policy
    contains a listing of those manuals.

2.  The   Corporate  Information  Resource  Management  Standards
    should be added to this appendix.

3.  The  purpose  of this manual is to disseminate Corporate-wide
    standards  for Information Resource Management principles and
    practices,   standards   for  systems  analysis  and  design,
    software,    equipment,    telecommunications,    information
    processing, systems integrity, and data administration.

4.  The  person responsible for development and revision of these
    standards  is  the  Director-Information  Resource Management
    Hardware/Software   Technology,   with  minimum  coordination
    required with the component IRM function heads.

5.  Distribution,  publication, and control of this manual is the
    responsibility  of  the  Manager-MDC  Procedures.    Approval
    resides  with  the  Staff Vice President-Information Resource
    Management.

6.  Other areas of the handbook remain unchanged.

7.  In  January  1986,  ISG Policy Management will distribute the
    quarterly  update  of the Management Handbook.  At that time,
    a  new  page  will  be  provided  to  update  the text in the
    Appendix  to  Policy  5 and include the Corporate Information
    Resource  Management Standards as a Corporate Manual.  In the
    interim,  please  make  a note of this change in your copy of
    the handbook.

I have *NOT* moved it over from 930 as of this moment.  I was in the
process of moving the file just now and the host became un-available
through the net.  (Probably, base crashed?)  If either of you wish to
move the file, feel free... just send mail.  The file is:

System 24 now has the OPER password file from system 930.  Anyone who

names that need to be present on OUR development system should let me
 BEFORE they add the names.

Also, OSMAN & JOE, please put any names we "allow" on our system other
than those for BLDG-C Operations under TXS.WATCH    -Thanks

APPARENTLY ALL THE MACHINES WERE NOT COUNTED DURING THE INVENTORY IN  
OCTOBER, THE COUNT IS APPROXIMATELY 1100 MACHINES SHORT.    
     
SO THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE WILL TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY. ATTACHED TO    
THIS ONTYME IS A LIST OF ALL THE NODES #'S THAT WERE 'NOT' COUNTED    
DURING THE INVENTORY. PER THIS LIST THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WILL    
BE SUPPLIED;   
                NODE#           SERIAL#         MACHINE TYPE
                ---------------------------------------------   
     
THIS INFORMATION WILL BE SUPPLIED FOR MANNED SITES BY WEDNESDAY NOV.  
27TH, 'ALL' OTHER SITES ARE DUE BY DEC. 3RD. THESE DATES ARE 'FIRM'   
NO EXTENSIONS OR EXCEPTIONS WILL BE MADE. THE INFORMATION WILL BE
GIVEN DIRECTLY TO CORP. FINANCE AND THERE ARE TWO (2) METHODS TO 
GET THE INFO TO THEM.    
     
1.  ONTYME PEGGY BOLLINGER (FIN.P/BOLLINGER) 
2. CALL DIRECTLY WITH INFO TO,  PEGGY BOLLINGER (408)446-7760

THERE IS A SECOND METHOD OF LOCATING THE MISSING EQUIPMENT (SIC).
THERE IS A REPORT ON SYSTEM 54 UNDER MY DIRECTORY (WASOWSKI)ENG.RPT,  
THIS REPORT IS A SORT BY MACHINE SERIAL # OF ALL THE MISSING NODES.   
ON THIS REPORT THERE IS A SITE NUMBER COLUM, THIS IS THE SAME SITE    
USED ON THE OES SALES ORDERS FOR NEW INSTALLS. ALSO YOU WILL NOTICE   
A DATE SHIPPED COLUM, THIS SHOWS THE DATE THE EQUIPMENT WAS SHIPPED   
FROM MANUFACTURING. THERE ARE SOME REMARKABLE MACHINES LISTED THERE   
223 OF THEM WERE SHIPPED IN 1985 AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM, THEN THERE   
192 THAT WERE SHIPPED IN 1984 THAT WE CAN'T FIND. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO  
BELIEVE THAT MACHINES THAT WERE SHIPPED FROM 1 TO 22 MONTHS CAN'T
BE ACCOUNTED FOR.   
     
ANY AND ALL MACHINES ARE TO LOOKED AT TO FIND THESE SERIAL #'S. ALL   
NETWORK MACHINES, LAB MACHINES (YES, EVEN THOSE ONES THAT YOU HAVE    
MADE YOUR SELF OR ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO HAVE), PENDING INSTALLS, DE-
INSTALLS, AND ALL SPARE MICROS. ALL MICROS ARE TO BE COUNTED GOOD,    
BAD, SPARES, WHATEVER....
     
THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING THESE MACHINES CANNOT BE RELAYED IN THE SPACE    
AVAILABLE. THIS EQUIPMENT IS WORTH SEVERAL MILLONS OF DOLLARS AND
MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR !!!!!!  
     
CURT MILLER IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS SITUATION AND IS  IN TOTAL AGREEMENT

Patch #4 is for NO INTERRUPT ENABLE during JOB, INFO, and DEBUG stopcodes.
It disables the CONO PI instruction that re-enabled channel 1 interrupts for
these stopcodes.

Subject: X930 down with disk problem. 

When I tried to LOGIN to 930 today, the monitor said "?LOGINN NOT FOUND".
Found all units with ready light on, but APA2 had "hardware indications on
drive".  System 930 is down, needs disk maintenance.

System 24 (the eh0erimental 3350 machine) is sending garbled characters.
Sometimes ">" comes out as ".", "v" as "f!", and sometimes the columns output
by DIR don't line up because spaces are getting lost.  At this point, I can't
tell if C24 is flakey, or if it's base is acting up.

Just thought you'd want to know.

Subject: Where did the old files in M33 come from? 

There are 4000 pages in files in (M33) that were created before 1-Jan-85.
Where did they come from?  They are using up all the free space on 930.
I thought we renamed those files to (OSARC).

Subject: P09 works in pages on C24. 

The good news is that I formatted, refreshed, and restored (SYS) to a one-pack
system on C24, using 3675 formatted in pages.  The bad news is that BOOTS does
not know how to read it.  I had to have the "blocks" pack on-line to get BOOTS
and the monitor (SYS)3675.SAV from it.  This test monitor then decides that the
"blocks" pack is improperly formatted, ignores it as being off-line, and only
looks at the "pages" pack.  Right now, the "pages" pack on BPA0 has only SYS:
from C34 and a few .SAV files in M33.

The next step is to jumper the 3650 for native mode, run (SYS)PAKCP5 from the
"blocks" pack to format the 3650, and use (SYS)3650.SAV to refresh it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Node naming convention is being changed to include a number for the ap-
propriate region. The break down is as follows:

                WNFE = 1
                CNFE = 2
                ENFE = 3

The district is also being changed in some cases to fit more closely with the 
city. The breakdown is as follows:

** WNFE **

Old District       New District          
   Letter             Letter             District (City)

     S                  E                Santa Clara - East Bay

     P                  P                Philidelphia
     W                  W                Washington










The break down will be as follows, the first six (6) characters will still be 
for the Company name or city if Tymnet, the underscore will change to the number 
that corresponds with the appropriate region, the second to the last character 
will be the district letter from above, and the last letter will correspond with 
the software type of the engine. The breakdown of software type is as follows:

          A = Async Tymsat or Consat
          B = Base
          I = Isis (regardless of engine i.e mini-engine, micro-                 
              engine, etc.)
          S = Switcher
          U = ATC


The node name should look like the following:

         DALLAS2DI   this would be a Tymnet node in Dallas (DALLAS),
                     which is CNFE (2), the district is Dallas (D),                                            
                     and the engine is running ISIS software (I).

To Craig and Dennis: Recap of Friday's testing.

  We tried using PAKCP5 (a modified version of PAKCOP) to format the 3650s
in native mode in pages.  This failed when it got to cylinder 542.  It did
however format the 5 alternate cylinders (559-555) and some of the regular
cylinders (554-543) before dying with "NO RECORD FOUND" for record 0 on
cylinder 542.  The REFRESH command, which usually clears problems like this
by resetting the assignment of alternate cylinders, could not reset RECORD 0
HEAD 0 CYLINDER 0.

  Osman brought up the SA10 diagnostics, formatted the 3650 in native mode
blocks.  I disabled the test in ONCE that checks for the special TYMSHARE
format on the disk, and we are now up running on the 3650 in native blocks.

To Osman and Carl: Why PAKCOP failed.

  When the 3650's were formatted in compatibility moded, the 815 logical
cylinders used physical cylinders 0-542 and half of 543.  The RECORD 0 (R)
and HOME ADDRESS (HA) information on these cylinders was correct for 3675
compatibility mode, but wrong for 3650 native mode.  PAKCP5 had no problem
formatting cylinders 559-544 since they still had the correct HA/R0 info
from the factory.  The question we had about the SET FILE MASK byte was a
red herring, octal 300 gives the most privileges, setting other bits disables
certain SEEK commands.

  The problem is that the commands PAKCOP uses to refresh HA and R0 on the
3675 and 3650 in compatibility mode get COMMAND REJECT when attempted on a
pack in native mode.  The 3674 manual states that the WRITE HOME ADDRESS
has an additional requirement for 3650 native mode - it must be proceeded by
a successful SEARCH HOME ADDRESS command.  That is:

	SEARCH HOME ADDRESS
	TIC back if search failed
	WRITE HOME ADDRESS
	WRITE RECORD 0

  The SA10 diagnostics did this when it formatted the 3650 in native blocks.
Now that valid HA and R0 info is on the disk, all we have to do is run the
existing PAKCP5 to format it in native pages.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

THE SOFTWARE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE DELAYED THE CONVERSION ARE BEING RE-
SOLVED AT A RAPID PACE.  WE EXPECT RESOLUTION OF THE REMAINING PROBLEMS
BY THIS WEEKEND.  IN ORDER TO MAKE THE CONVERSION AS ORDERLY AND 
QUICK AS POSSIBLE, WE ARE SCHEDULING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SUPER-
VISOR FOR 3:00 A.M. SUNDAY MORNING, 12/15.  THIS WILL ALLOW ONE WEEK
FOR CONVERSION, WHICH SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE FEW REMAINING NODES.

CURRENT STATUS OF SOFTWARE PROBLEMS ARE:

940 NET - THE AUX CIRCUIT PROBLEM WHICH IMPACTED VALIDATIONS ON MONDAY
          HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND TESTING IS CONTINUING.

E-BUSS - NEW CODE IS BEING LOADED NOW WHICH FIXES THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

         1.  INPUT PROCESSING BEING STOPPED

         2.  LOGINS FROM X.25

         3.  LOGIN FROM HSA

         THE PROBLEM OF LOST OUTPUT DATA IS A BUG IN AN OLD VERSION OF 
         THE MONITOR ON SOME OF THE ADP 10'S.  THE FIX IS TO LOAD THE 
         LATEST VERSION OF THE MONITOR.

HSA KATAKANA - NEW VERSION WHICH FIXES ALL KNOWN PROBLEMS.

GATEWAY - NEW VERSION RELEASED WHICH FIXES:

          1. LOADii PROBLEM

          2. CRASH FROM 6C63

I HOPE I HAVE ADDRESSED ALL OF THE KNOWN PROBLEMS.  IF THERE ARE ANY NEW
CONCERNS, PLEASE RESPOND IMMEDIATELY.  ITIME IS SHORT, AND CONVERSION 
BECOMES MORE CRITICAL WITH EACH PASSING DAY.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  We are currently involved in the process  of installing a Tymnet II base
  on  S90 (the  PDP10  installed here  in St.  Cloud).   Jack Snavely  has
  informed  us of  the  fact  that one  of  the  problems that  have  been
  detected, an  intermittent loss  of characters,  has been  solved on  US
  PDP10's by installing a recent release of the operating system.
 
  As this is one of the reasons why we have reverted to the Tymnet I base,
  and because of the  fact that we would like to test  the new software as
  much as possible, we would like to have the  new monitor release for S90
  very soon.
 
  It may, however, also be necessary  to update other system software. S90
  is currently still  running on a /K  monitor, and a lot  of software may
  have changed since. I  am not aware of what changes  may be necessary to
  move to a  /P monitor, (CUSPS, operator  procedures, user documentation,
  APL-related, etc).
 
  Could you give me the information I  will need to plan this upgrade cor-
  rectly ?  Tentatively, given  the current Tymnet  I elimination  date of
  Dec. 15th,  Tuesday night, Dec. 12th.   our time, seems  appropriate for
  the monitor  upgrade. (this  means the  day of  Dec. 12th.,  your time).
  Could you please confirm this schedule as soon as possible ?
 
  I can be contacted via ontyme on  ct.dpm, or mail to CTMKTG7:930, if you
  need more information or assistance.
 
  Best regards, Peter Stratman.

=================================================================
 
 
EFFECTIVE  JANUARY  1,  1986,  DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS  COMPANY  WILL 
OFFICIALLY BE OUT OF THE EQUIPMENT LEASING BUSINESS.  IN THE PAST 
OUR DIVISION HAS HANDLED THE LEASING OF TERMINALS,  PRINTERS  AND 
MODEMS    TO   "TYMSHARE"   CUSTOMERS.     THIS   INCLUDED;   THE 
ADMINISTRATION, BILLING OF NEW LEASES, RENEWALS AND CANCELLATIONS 
AND PURCHASE CONVERSIONS.  
 
 
AS OF JANUARY 1, ALL OF THE ASSETS WILL TRANSFER OUT OF DSC FIXED 
ASSETS INTO THE COST CENTER OF THE BUSINESS  UNIT   RECEIVING THE 
MONTHLY  REVENUE  FROM THE CUSTOMER LEASING THE  EQUIPMENT.   THE 
BUSINESS UNIT NOW WILL BECOME RESPONSIBLE FOR THE  ASSETS.   THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY  INVOLVES  TAKING BACK THE EQUIPMENT,  SHOULD  THE 
CUSTOMER CANCEL.  DSC WILL NO LONGER:
 
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE PICK UP
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING
 
                 o  ARRANGE FOR THE BILLING TO BE DISCONTINUED
 
                 o  RECEIVE THE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR WAREHOUSE
 
 
ANY EQUIPMENT THAT CANCELLED PRIOR TO DECEMBER 1, WILL BE  PICKED 
UP AND RETURNED  TO  OUR  WAREHOUSE.   ANY  CANCELLATION  LETTERS 
RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER 2, WILL BE SENT TO THE CUSTOMERS'BUSINESS 
UNIT.
 
 
THERE IS HELP AVAILABLE FOR THE BUSINESS UNITS THAT LACK  STORAGE 
AREA.   IF  YOU  DO  NOT WANT OR NEED  YOUR  CUSTOMER'S  RETURNED 
EQUIPMENT YOU MAY CONTACT BOBBIE HINES AT  714/952-6555.   BOBBIE 
IS MANAGER OF  THE EQUIPMENT DISPOSITION AND SALES DEPARTMENT FOR 
ISG. SHE CAN HELP YOU DISPOSE OF YOUR ASSET AT FAIR MARKET VALUE.
 
 
NORTHERN  AIR  FREIGHT  HAS  HANDLED THE  PICK  UP  OF  CANCELLED 
EQUIPMENT FOR  SEVERAL YEARS.  THEY WILL GO TO THE CUSTOMER SITE; 
PACK  AND BOX THE EQUIPMENT AND SHIP TO YOUR DESIGNATED LOCATION.
THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON (800/426-5962) WILL 
HANDLE  ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS.

 
CURRENTLY,  MOST OF THE EQUIPMENT OUT ON LEASE HAS BEEN THERE FOR 
MORE  THAN  2 YEARS AND IS FULLY DEPRECIATED OR  HAS A  VERY  LOW 
BOOK  VALUE.   IT IS OUR SUGGESTION THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO GET  YOUR 
CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE THIS LEASED EQUIPMENT AT A LOW  COST.   THIS 
PURCHASE  WOULD  RESULT  IN  REVENUE FOR  YOUR  OFFICE  AND  YOUR 
CUSTOMER  COULD  SIGN  UP FOR A MAINTENANCE  AGREEMENT  WITH  THE 
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FIELD SERVICE COMPANY.  THIS WOULD PREVENT YOUR 
OFFICE FROM EVER HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE RETURN.
 
 
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS NEW POLICY YOU CAN  CALL 
YOUR COMPANY CONTROLLER OR ONTYME DAN SAENZ DSD.D/SAENZ.

The monitor 24XP10 should be able to determine what kind of disk it is
running on, and reacts nicer to DEPOSIT 1 IN 30.  It hasn't been tested yet.

Subject: Re: 24XP10 
In-reply-to: your message of Fri, 13 Dec 85 0:24:16 PST

All the information about a disk is stored in the Unit Data Block.  Each
disk has its own UDB.  The information is set up for each disk, one unit at
a time at ONCE-only time.  Therefore you can have an RP06 and an RM03 on line
at the same time on a 2020, and can build a two-pack DSKB from them (but it
is not a good idea to have different types of disks in one structure).

BPXKON has always allowed a mixture of 100 Mb and 200 Mb disks on the same
string.  The capacity test would determine whether the disk had 404 or 808
cylinders, and the Monitor would happily use whatever was out there.

I had to remove the test for 3330-I (100 Mb) to fit 3650 definitions into a
two-bit field.  24XP10 is designed to recognize the following types of disk:
0 = 3350 in blocks (we won't be using this format other than for testing)
1 = 3330 in blocks (this is what all our systems currently use)
2 = 3350 in pages  (this is the approved format for 3650 disks)
3 = 3330 in pages  (to get 11% more our of existing disks)

This means, however, if both 3650 spindles are on-line, and they both say
they are DSKB0, then the Monitor will complain because it will see both,
even if one is formatted in native pages and the other is not.

RE:  DATATROL PROCEDURES 
     
     
EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1986 THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES FOR DATATROL (T-20)
TERMINALS WILL BE IN EFFECT.  
     
1.      ALL DEFECTIVE DATATROLS ARE TO BE SHIPPED TO:    
     
                        MDFSC  
                        40547 ALBRAE STREET

2.      INVENTORY CONTROL
     
        ALL DATATORL INVENTORY TRACKING WILL BE DONE ON THE MENTRY 
        PARTS SYSTEM.  PLEASE TRANSFER ALL DEFECTIVES TO SITE/ACCT 
        NUMBER 1202 (FREMONT DEFECTIVE ACCOUNT).    
     
        THE MENTRY PARTS SYSTEM WILL CONVERT TO CIMS IN MARCH OF '86,   
        AT THAT TIME PROCEDURAL CHANGES WILL BE MADE.    
     
3.      DATATROL ORDERING
     
        ROUTINE ORDERING OF DATATROLS WILL REMAIN THE SAME, VIA THE
        PARTS ORDERING SYSTEM.  
     
        P-1 ORDERS CAN BE ACCESSED EITHER THROUGH KING OF PRUSSIA OR    
        FREMONT.  THE MAIN CONTACT FOR ANY DATATROL QUESTIONS OR   
        PROBLEMS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO SCOTT AYARS @ 415/659-8600 
        OR FSC.S/AYARS.    
     
4.      ADDRESS CARDS AND POWER TRANSFORMERS.
     
        WHEN RETURNING DEFECTIVE DATATROLS FOR REPAIR "DO NOT" SEND
        IN THE ADDRESS CARDS OR POWER TRANSFORMERS UNLESS THEY ARE 
        KNOWN BAD.  REPLACEMENT DATATROLS ARE SENT WITHOUT THESE   
        ITEMS UNLESS ASKED FOR. 
     
        THE ADDRESS CARDS CAN VERY EASILY BE RESOLDERED TO CUT NEW 
        ADDRESSES AND SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED FOR THAT REASON.  SINCE    
        THERE ARE NO COMPONENTS ON THE PC IT'S HARD TO HAVE A 
        DEFECTIVE ADDRESS CARD.

Subject:  Organization Changes in MDC Aerospace Group


1.  Effective  1  January  1986,  there  will  be several changes
    within  the  MDC Aerospace Group.  These changes are a result
    of  the continuous evaluation of organizational relationships
    to  ensure  that  operational effectiveness, productivity and
    service  delivery are maximized.  During the past two months,
    attention  has been focused on the reporting relationships of
    MDAIS, MDMC and MDRL within the Aerospace Group.

2.  Ernie  H.  Ridenhour is appointed Vice President, Information
    Resource  Management  (IRM)  and will report to R. L. Johnson
    and  R.  C.  Little;  MDAIS  will  report  to  Ernie.    This
    reorganization   recognizes   the   important  economies  and
    efficiencies  of  combining  information  resource  planning,
    management  and  service delivery into a single organization.
    As  a  result,  IRM and MDAIS' total support of all Component
    "customers" should be strengthened.

3.  Since  January  1984,  MDMC has been building a customer base
    outside  MDC  as well as developing its capabilities as a MDC
    technology  resource  center.    To  facilitate achieving its
    internal  and  external business objectives, MDMC will report
    directly to R. C. Little.

4.  MDRL  will  report  to  Kenneth  A.  Francis, Vice President,
    Aerospace  Engineering  and  Operations.   MDRL will continue
    its  role  as  a  basic  research  resource for the Aerospace
    Group Engineering organizations.

5.  In   recognition   of  their  responsibilities  as  heads  of
    significant  resource  units, the following title changes are
    effective 1 January 1986:

          W. B. (Brad) Rigdon       General Manager, MDAIS
          Anatole Browde            General Manager, MDMC
          Donald P. Ames            General Manager, MDRL

6.  We  believe these organizational changes will further improve
    the capabilities of the MDC Aerospace Group.

   SUBJECT:   STORAGE POLICY ON PUBLIC NET CODE HOSTS
 
   ==============================================================
 
 
   As part of the system cleanup for hosts 25,  33,  54 and 70, and 
   to  maintain acceptable levels of storage for future needs,  the 
   following policy is now in effect:
 
   AT  ANY ONE TIME,  CODE FILES SHOULD ONLY EXIST IN ONE OF  THREE 
   DIRECTORIES:
 
              A)  YOUR PERSONAL DIRECTORY 
              B)  YOUR REGION'S CENTRAL DIRECTORY
              C)  THE MASTER DIRECTORY (TYMNET OR TYM4000)
 
   There is no reason to maintain duplicate files now that you  are 
   working on the master systems (25 and 54).
 
   Once you have genned code in your personel directory, you should 
   RENAME (NOT COPY) it into your region's central directory.   The 
   HQ  Code  Gen group,  upon receiving your backup  request,  will 
   RENAME  the  file(s) into the appropriate master  directory  and 
   telecopy it to the appropriate backup host.
 
   All  files currently in your personal directories for code  that 
   has  already been backed up must be deleted from all four  hosts 
   immediately.
 
   Until this is done,  we continue to operate with critically  low 
   storage on most hosts, particularly 33.
 
   Your immediate attention to this matter is required.
 
   Thank you.

                             MEMORANDUM
 
 
  DATE:        DECEMBER 23, 1985

  COPIES:      ED BARENS & DALLAS OPERATIONS PERSONNEL

  FROM:        EILEEN RIORDAN
           
  SUBJECT:     SYSTEMS 25 & 54 DOWNTIME LAST WEEKEND
 
  ================================================================
 
 
  Several  complaints were registered this weekend about systems 25 
  and 54 being scheduled down for maintenance simultaneously.   I'd 
  like to set the record straight:
 
  They were not SCHEDULED down and will not be,  per Ed Barens, the 
  Dallas Data Center Manager.
 
  System 25 has been suffering from a DASD problem since  yesterday 
  which required a system rebuild.   Considering the size of system 
  25, this can take as much as a day to complete.
 
  System  54  suffered a base-initiated (EBUSS) crash at  the  same 
  time  25 was down.   Operations worked as quickly as possible  to 
  get 54 restored.
 
  Field Engineers also reported that they had no backup to 54 since 
  the TYM4000 files were not available on system 33.
 
  I  fail to see why this should have come as a surprise since this 
  was the song I was singing the loudest all last week:
 
        Since directories were not sufficiently cleaned up
        by field personnel, we were unable to load the tapes
        containing TYM4000 files.
 
  Until that was completed (late last Friday), it was fruitless for 
  the  HQ  CODEGEN group to try backing up the files created on  54 
  all  last week from 54 to 33.   Once they  received  confirmation 
  that  the  original  files were in place on  33,  they  issued  a 
  request  to cut a tape of all their work on 54 last  week,  which 
  was flown to Cupertino and loaded on Sunday (yesterday).  Both 54 
  and 33 are now in sync.
 
  I  wish  to express my thanks to the operators and management  in 
  Dallas  for their efforts to restore 25 and 54 this  weekend  and 
  for handling the calls from field personnel.:load off

Carl,
     
I tried your new BIONIC on host 34 and 24.   
     
Trials via Async    
----------------    
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (FTSYS)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
     
        I tried 10 times in one session and get   
     
          6 trials : Ok  
          4 trials : NOT Ok with  BLOCK INPUT ERROR.   
                                  0 RECORDS INPUT.
     
     
Trials via HSA 
-------------- 
     
        Tried by (FTSYS)BIONIC on C34 and by (SYS)BIONIC on C24. 
     
        In both code, the situation seems to return to the last  
        Saturday's which I mentioned in my OnTyme (A88226). 
        Any command for the BIONIC on (FTSYS:34) or (SYS:24)
        can't be accepted, and the BIONIC replys "Unrecognized command ...."    
        for any input at "*" prompt.    
     
     
Carl, I beleave you had already tested it well, especially via Async. 
So I can't understand why such a problem appeared......
     
        By our location, by some routing of network, or by just a program  
        error ..... etc ???   
     
One question: in the BIONIC, does the same command scan routin analize
a command via Async and via HSA-Bisync,  or two routins, one for Async
and another for Bisync, are ready for the code ?  
Because I wonder why the BIONIC can recognize a command via Async and can't
do it via Bisync.   
     
     
In Japan, our office is closed during the next week by NEw Year holidays.  
However, I will ready to test it when you send another version of it. So   
please send an OnTyme to KTL.TOKYO and make a copy to KTL.OGURA, which I   
will check by appropriate timing at home.    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Makoto,

  I cannot be sure how your Bisync equipment works, but it is possible
that when a line of data is transmitted, it is padded to a standard size
such as 80.

  I simulated this action with BIONIC version %1(2) by adding blanks to
the end of my command line.  I also received "Unrecognized command,...".

  There is now a new version, %1(3), which contains code to remove both
leading and trailing blanks from the command line.  Please test this new
version when you have time.  It is in all the proper places on systems
34 (FTSYS)(UPLKT), 55 (FTSYS), 57 (FTSYS)(OHTA) and 24 (SYS).

  *** Have a happy New Year Holiday ***

Subject: XEXEC Progress 

Amidst all the clamour of BIONIC the past few weeks, little has been
done actively on XEXEC.  I do however have some good news to report.
The wheels kept turning, working on the various solutions to each of
the most pressing problems.

XEXEC now properly handles :ESCAPE, including "." or "-" in column 1
without clearing the frame (as in PCOM).  The problem with LOGOUT is
fixed.  (In fact, it takes a few seconds after completion before the
circuit zap is received... rather nice, I think).  Asynchronous data
flow to and from the PTY ports, and their associated command and log
files appears to work as smoothly as possible.

The remaining work that must be done, (other than general cleanup of
some of the older code), is in the scheduling routines and fitting a
sense of time-zones into Helge's date and time code.

Oh yes, and fitting Helge's modified code into XEXEC to reschedule a
job for the next runtime.

When this is done, I will have an alpha-test product for release.

Yes, I know I'm (we're) supposed to be on vacation.  Somebody forgot to
tell that to the calendar.  January 1, is fast approaching.  I plan to keep

Carl,
     
This morning, I tried your new BIONIC.  
     
Via Async 
--------- 
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 11 times in one session and got ...    
     
        6 trials : Ok (1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th trial)  
        5 trials : Not Ok with BLOCK INPUT ERROR. 
                               0 RECORDS INPUT.   
     
        And I found the sequence of OK/NOT-OK is the same as yesterday's.  
        However I don't know the sequence has some meaning or not ....
     
Via HSA   
--------  
     
        Tried in following manner on C34.    
     
        R (UPLKT)BIONIC  
        RUN    
        file-name   
     
        I tried 10 times and  
     
        5 trials : Ok    
        5 trials : Not Ok    After EOT sending from terminal,    
                             the host replys nothing.  
     
        - "Ambigious command ......" message 
     
          When terminal send R (UPLKT)BIONIC with some trailing blanks,    
          BIONIC replys above message as follows. 
     
     
          Terminal sends 
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs><Etx>  
     
          Response from node(host), echo and others    
     
          <Stx>R (UPLKT)BIONIC<--- 56 blanks ----><irs> *        <irs>Ambi 
          gious command, please re-enter.<irs>*<irs><etx>   
     
     
          I also know that, in the New BIONIC, blank(s) input at "*" prompt
          causes the message. 
     
          This is not a problem for my current operation, but how can I    
          understand it ???   
     
     
        - In evry NOT-OK case, I can close the BIONIC by additional   
          operation as follows.    
     
          Term     Last data record ... <irs><etx>       <eot>   
          Node                                     <ack>        ..... 
     
                ....... No response from node .......  
     
          After 10 min.  
     
          Term    <enq>      <stx><-- 80bytes record --><irs>      <eot>   
          node          <ack>                                <ack>    
     
          So I send one more dummy text after actual data, BIONIC closed.  
     
          I don't know about the ball-logic, but I guess, in somewhere,    
          the first EOT is eaten by someone and BIONIC does not know  
          about it. 
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Subject: system 39 username purge 

Someone in NTD sent validations a request to delete a list of users not
in NTD.  The list was in progress when Bill Soley noticed that (SPL) had
disappeared and he went to validations and stopped the purge...  I went
to check on 39 and found username (CARL) gone, and called validations to
see what happenned.

In all, 12 GAN 3 usernames were purged.  Bill and I made a list and gave
it to Jan Krivanek to have the accounts restored.  So, if you notice that
things on 39 are missing, ** Don't Panic ***,  they are being restored.

Of concern were: (BRING), (CARL), (DENCOFF), (FLETCHERC), (HELGEM), (JMS),
(SPL) and (TSUCOOP).  There were others, but of no consequence.

Jan assured me that she would put in the batch rquests to have operations
restore the file that were deleted.

Makoto,

    I have fixed the problem of blank records causing an error message
when entering commands to BIONIC.  I believe that I have also solved the
problem behind the "BLOCK INPUT ERROR." message.  Apparently some things
do NOT work as they are documented to work.

    I have put my newest trial version, %1(6) [version 1, edit 6] in the
(FTSYS) directory on systems 34, 55 and 57, in the (SYS) directory on 24,
in the (UPLKT) directory on 34 and in the (OHTA) directory on 57.

    Please run your tests on this version on systems 24 and your production
systems.  If the tests are successful, then I will release this version to
the (SYS) directory as soon as possible.  If the tests fail, then I would
like you to run your tests on another internal system which has a different
type of TYMNET-II base.

    Thank you very much for your attention and co-operation.

    ****  Happy New Year Holidays ****

Carl,
     
Today, I tried your new BIONIC in UPLKT:34 through HSA, and found interesting   
matter.   
     
- I made trials under following 2 methods.   
     
        Method-1 : Send data , which you can see (OGURA:34)TEST.128, 128 char   
                   * 100 recs, with blank compression (by Igs).  
                   This file contains 2 all-blank records which are   
                   compressed as   
     
                        <Igs><7F><Igs><7F><Igs><42><Irs>    
     
                   per a record.     (Total 128 blanks/rec) 
     
                   In past 2 weeks, I tried under this method.   
     
        Method-2 : Send the same file with truncating traling blanks. 
                   Under this method, the all-blank record is sent as single    
     
                        <Irs> 
     
- And as far as I know, Phil's OnTyme (I95298) is not reflected for KTL's  
 HSA yet. 
     
     
At the trial   
     
In method-1     5 trials 
-----------    
     
        2 trials : Ok    
        3 trials : fail with the same situation which I mentioned in my OnTyme  
                    A90038, 28-Dec-85. (No reply from node after data sending)  
     
In method-2     10 trials
-----------    
     
        Every trial is OK !!     However the all-blank records are ignored.
     
So, from the observation, I thought IGS cause some problem, and I tried    
another data which did not contain blank compression. You can see the file 
(OGURA:34)TEST2.128, 128 char * 100 recs.    
However it was not OK. BIONIC did not reply after data sending. So IGS may not  
be a cause of the problem.    
     
Then I guess a single IRS has some meaning at Terminal-BSC-HSA-Base-BIONIC ???!!
And please remember my OnTyme (A88428,23-dec-85), in which I reported the  
same experience under katakana mode of your BIONIC.    
     
However, I'm not sure, in this kind of problem, what number of trials is enough 
for the test. Even in the method-2, I don't know 11th trial may fail or not.    
     
     
And I also tried (UPLKT:34)BIONIC via async 10 times, and found every trial
was OK. I didnot experience which I got in past trials via async.
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


AS OF THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1986, THE MICOMS INVENTORY SYSTEM WAS
REPLACED BY THE CIMS INVENTORY SYSTEM.

ALL SITES HAVE BEEN SENT NEW CIMS FIELD OFFICE PROCEDURE MANUALS. 
PLEASE FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THESE MANUALS AND REFER TO THEM IF
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING NEW PROCEDURES.  IF YOUR SITE HAS NOT
RECEIVED A MANUAL, PLEASE CONTACT KATHE FRONCKOWIAK AT:

          MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FSC
          MATERIAL SUPPORT
          40547 ALBRAE STREET
          FREMONT, CA  94538
          415-659-8600  X-3024

CHANGES IN PROCEDURE ARE RELATIVELY FEW, HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT
ALL PERSONNEL FOLLOW A FEW GUIDELINES TO INSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION.

1.  NEW "TRANSFER/RETURNED GOODS SHIPPERS" FORMS ARE BEING SENT TO ALL
    FIELD SITES.  WHEN RETURNING PARTS FOR REPAIR, OR TRANSFERRING PARTS
    BETWEEN SITES, THIS FORM WILL BE USED.  ANY TIME PARTS ARE TRANSFERRED
    BETWEEN SITES, THE FIELD TRANSFER FORM MUST - REPEAT, MUST - BE
    RETURNED TO MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR DATA ENTRY.  MANDATORY FIELDS
    REQUIRING INFORMATION ARE:

    A.  SHIPPER NUMBER (FROM LOG BOOK)
    B.  DATE
                                                                Page  2

    C.  FROM LOCATION
    D.  TO LOCATION
    E.  CORRECT PART NUMBER

    IF THIS INFORMATION IS OMITTED, IT WILL BE RETURNED TO YOUR SITE FOR
    COMPLETION.  PLEASE BEGIN USING THESE FORMS AS SOON AS THEY ARE
    RECEIVED.  THIS FORM WILL REPLACE THE SHIPPING AUTHORIZATION FORM.

2.  ALL PART INQUIRIES WILL BE DONE BY LOGGING INTO THE "DISPATCH INVENTORY
    SEARCH (FSV-1)".  ANY P-1 REPLENISHMENT ORDERS PLACED THROUGH MATERIAL
    SUPPORT WILL REQUIRE AN OPEN INCIDENT NUMBER FROM DISPATCH BEFORE YOUR
    ORDER WILL BE PROCESSED.

3.  ALL DATA ENTRY INCLUDING FIELD TRANSFERS BETWEEN SITES WILL BE DONE
    THROUGH THE MATERIAL SUPPORT DATA ENTRY DEPARTMENT, SO IT IS IMPERATIVE
    THAT ALL PERSONNEL ACCURATELY AND COMPLETELY FILL OUT ALL DOCUMENTS AND
    FORWARD THEM TO MATERIAL SUPPORT PROMPTLY FOR PROCESSING.  CONSULT YOUR
    MANUALS FOR APPROPRIATE FORMS TO USE.

4.  INVENTORY MAINTENANCE AT FIELD SITES WILL BE TRACKED THROUGH THE
    INDEX CARD SYSTEM.  THESE CARDS NOW ARE BEING PRE-PRINTED WITH PART
    NUMBERS AND WILL BE SHIPPED TO THE FIELD WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

5.  ALL SITES WILL BE RECEIVING COMPUTER PRINTOUTS WITH PARTS LISTED IN
    NUMERICAL ORDER.  PLEASE RETAIN THESE PRINTOUTS FOR USE IN SETTING
    UP YOUR INDEX CARD INVENTORY SYSTEM.  THEY CAN ALSO BE USED FOR
    LOCATING INVENTORY AT YOUR SITE.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT ANSWERED IN YOUR MANUALS, PLEASE
CHECK WITH YOUR AREA MANAGER OR THROUGH MATERIAL SUPPORT.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND COOPERATION DURING THIS TRANSITION.

The EUE stopcode was caused by FILIO trying to start I/O to unit 340.
Since only 20 disk unit blocks are defined, it picked up garbage as a

DEDUCTIONS AS CREDIT UNION, VAN POOL, MANAGEMENT CLUB, HEALTHCLUB,
EMPLOYEE AUXILIARY SERVICES, OLD TYMSHARE INSRANCE, WAGE ATTACHMENTS,
BONDS, AND OVERPAYMENTS.

IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THIS OMMISSION, A DOUBLE DEDUCTION WILL BE MADE ON YOUR
CHECK FOR WEEK ENDING 1/5/86 SCHEDULED TO BE RECEIVED ON THURSDAY, 1/9/86.
IN SOME CASES, THE SECOND DEDUCTION MAY BE DIVIDED OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
BASED ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE DEDUCTIONS.

WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED.

Subject: BIONIC %1(6) Release 

Greg,
  After the last set of messages and my own testing, I feel that the
current version, %1(6) of BIONIC solves all of the known problems on
the PDP-10 side of the DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST-BIONIC connection.

It does not address the one request from Kamoto Ogura that all messages
be in UPPER CASE.  That will be fixed in release %1(7) which I will put
into (FTSYS) after we are sure that all the HSA concerns are fixed and
their new code is running in all the HSAs.

I believe that anyone using BIONIC from (SYS) is still using the oldest
version which I DO NOT expect to work properly.  We need to agree on
whether the new version can be placed in (SYS) before I have it released.

I want to avoid the problems and complaints that occurred with the first
test version %1(1) that was put on (SYS) by customer request.  So, let
me know and I will put version %1(7) out for final testing before its
release.

Carl,
     
This evening, I got your letter, A95887.  Regarding the Ontyme,  
please remember my OnTyme A93053 which was sent at 05-Jan and I reported no-    
close problem at %1(6) in that Ontyme.  
     
To make sure, just before I tried (UPLKT)BIONIC, it is still %1(6) !!, at our   
RWS and got the same problem which meant that BIONIC did not close the
specified file after sending completion, at the first trial.
     
So we still have a problem at BIONIC operation, however I don't know the   
problem is in BIONIC or it hide behind DEV-BISYNC-HSA-BASE-HOST connection.
     
Anyway what I can just know is BIONIC worked without problem at the last   
summer, and now BIONIC still does not work normally, and    
our boat is sinking day by day.    
     
However I think release of %1(6) may not cause worse situation than the    
current one.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Joe,
  we need to get together and make a list of feature tests and what the
bit designations are for things that exist now, and things that we plan
on implementing.  Once we settle on the proper settings, we can start
putting together programs which will run on the old and new versions of
the monitor without having to do strange things to see if things exist!

/Carl

PS: The table is already in the monitor... we just need to define all
    the bits.

Symptom:  PJ not running, in ^C state.

Problem:  PJ running LOGINN in ^C state.  Apparently it never ran the
          init program and went to an EXIT someplace?  When I logged-in
          I experienced tha same problem.  I typed ^C^C and then took
          a look at PJ.

Solution: I built a circuit to PJ:34 and was asked to attach, which I
          did.  I then logged out PJ and built another circuit.  The
          second time it ran PAM and detached like it was supposed to
          do.  Problem solved.  Cause of problem still unknowm.  I did
          check for HRE HWE BDA set on LOGINN.SHR but everything seems
          to be ok.

Symptom:  Page i/o error on OPER.SAV and SYSTAT.SHR

Problem:  System experienced some disk errors on BPA6 earlier and the
          files (SYS)OPER.SAV, (SYS)SYSTAT.LOW, (MAGNUM)MAGNRN.SHR and
          (RCONX)I6SAFV.MR0 were marked with HRE and (SYS)011286.DAT
          was marked with BDA.

Solution: I set my SETE password and copied OPER.SAV on top of itself
          which cleared HRE (file wasn't really bad).  Same worked for
          (MAGNUM) and (RCONX) files.  I copied (SYS)SYSTAT.LOW from
          system 35 to 55.  Everything seems to be ok now.

Note:  (RCONX) is customer for Donna Kurimay, who also called OPS to
       complain.  Hopefully fixing MAGNRN and their .MR0 file also
       solved their problem. /Carl

Maintenance replaced a couple of cards in BPA6, so a bad drive was the
original cause of the HRE and BDA errors seen this morning. Since it
was known "bad" the first try was to see if the data was actually good,
which apparently worked in 3/4 cases.  /Carl

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective immediately, operations has been informed that they must
no longer honor any requests to have all files from a user's directory
restored from tape, without prior approval from this office.

The purpose of this is to maintain greater control over storage
utilization, especially on critical systems.

The primary reason users ask to have all files restored, is because
they have forgotten the name of the one or two files they really
want back.  But once all files are restored, and the files in
question located, rarely does the person delete all the others.

By having such request approved by this office, we avoid suprise drains
on storage, and ensure that there is an immediate directory cleanup once
the file(s) in question have been located.


When requesting a restoration of all files, please submit your
batch request as normal, and follow it up immediately with an OnTyme
utilizing the specially designed form (:EXEC *** FORMS.ALLFILES).  
Immediately upon receipt, I will either message operations to proceed, 
(and notify you via OnTyme of such), or contact you by phone for further
clarification.

I hope you can understand the reason for this measure - it is
meant to help ensure that resources are always available for you
when needed - and that unnecessary online files never prevent this.

Talked to Carson about one of the returning F3's and he said we could
have the use of one.  It will still be his in reserve in case of dire
necessity so we might have to give it up until such time as he has
no more need.  Odds are, however, that we would have the use of it
and Carson would never take it back.  Taylor will wheel it into
our "new" computer room.

It might be a good idea to keep a 1-pack system on this 2nd F3 to use
as our "test-bed" system from scratch.  Later, after we've accomplished
this feat, the single drive can be "added" using ADDPACK in ONCDSK to
bring the system upto it's full complement of disks.

Subject   : Trials for BIONIC through revised base program on C34
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
     
At the noon of last saturday (18-Jan) in JST, I was informed by the president   
Asama, he is staying in Cupertino, that some base program of C34 was revised.   
     
Then I tried BIONIC as follows.    
     
Trial-1   
-------   
     
        18-Jan 13:30  --  14:40   (JST) 
     
        1.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC          .... OK  
        1.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.3  10 trials for (UPLKT:34)BIONIC        .... OK  
        1.4  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC          .... OK  
     
        I thought a base program of C57 was not revised yet. So I checked  
        the difference between revised-base and not-revised-base.
        However both had the same conclusion.
        And I didn't know (FTSYS:34)BIONIC was the same one as (UPLKT:34)BIONIC,
        which is %1(6). So I checked the UPLKT's. 
     
trial-2   
--------  
     
        18-Jan  17:05  --  17:20    (JST)    
     
        2.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC        ..... ok   
        2.2  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC        ..... ok   
     
     
Trial-3   
--------  
     
        20-Jan  9:20  --  10:30      (JST)   
     
        3.1  5 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC
                3 trials ( from the 1st to the 3rd ) was not OK. 
                In every trial, BIONIC closed normally but some data was lost.  
                2 trials were OK.  
        3.2  5 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC         ..... OK 
        3.3  5 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC           ..... OK 
     
Trial-4   
-------   
     
        20-Jan  18:30  --  22:00  (JST) 
     
        4.1  10 trials for (SYS:34)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed but some 
                data was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
        4.2  10 trials for (FTSYS:34)BIONIC          .....OK
        4.3  10 trials for (SYS:57)BIONIC    
                1 trial (the 3rd trial) was not OK. BIONIC closed, but some data
                was lost.
                9 trials were OK.  
     
     
From the observation of the trials, every BONIC(SYS:34,FTSYS:34,UPLKT:34, and   
SYS:57) seems to be closed normally and I think the current situation is a bit  
better than the last week's, however it is not enough to say the problem   
is fixed. 
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

It appears that I've been given a forced rest period with the FLU coming
down to visit me this past week-end.  I've spent most of the past 2 days
in bed.  I will at least try to login and check my mail just in case any
emergencies crop up, but I don't expect to be doing much work for the
next couple of days.

Carl, could you verify that the commands in (KL10:930)APT10.HLP are listed in
the small blue KL notebook?  APT10.SAI was written by Bill Soley 8 years ago
when he first came to TYMSHARE.  It is supposed to allow us to copy a new
BOTLOD onto the KLDCP DECtapes.

If you enrolled in the optional life insurance, you will notice on

for four (4) weeks.  Thereafter, your deduction will be calculated
on a weekly basis.

Well,
  I seem to be getting back on my feet.  I feel better today than I have

If I stay home tomorrow, I will probably be working.  If so, i will send

Hope to see you all then.

I've looked at the code, found something fishy, but since it's some
of my more cryptic (un-commented) code, I'm not sure if it'd break
worse than it is now.  I have a couple of ideas, but I'm too woosy
to pursue them at the moment.  I'll send mail when it's fixed.  the
problem is in the part that changes the schedule using the data in
ONCALL.SCH, (sigh)!

Subject: ONCALL working again 

I moved some code and that seemed to fix the problem (assuming that it
didn't cause some other more obscure problem).  Anyway, it defaults the
list from ONCALL.RES in the proper order, and when ONCALL.SCH exists it
builds the table in the order Joe,Osman,Carl.  So, at the moment, I've
copied the .SCH file as .SCN so we get Joe,Carl,Osman which is the order
that we're using for the moment.

It may work to actually schedule in the .SCH file the correct order and
let it take it from there....

============================================================
 
An Ontyme interface is now available on the M7000.
If you are located at 2351 MCGAW, instructions for it's use
will follow. If you are located elsewhere and have access to
an M7000, I will be glad to send the software if you send
the request to me, along with a blank tape.
 
This interface allows printing of Ontyme messages and Ontyme
workspace.  Printing can take place on any of the Production
System printers, of which there are three.  "LPTR", "LAB",
and "GE".
 
Messages and workspace may also be captured in a disk file.
 
Disk files may be transfered to Ontyme workspace.  This
allows the user to use the M7000's superior editor or the
TEXTPRO wordprocessor to create and edit messages before
transferring to Ontyme.
 
This interface is menu driven and rather easy to use.

Subject: 24XP14 works. 

Tracy's diagnostics wrote over part of SYS, I had to refresh the pack
(but only restores SYS, no others UFDs).  The /P14 monitor correctly
identifies what type of disk it is talking to, I currently have it
set to ignore the blocks pack.  I used the old BOOTS to load the new BOOTS,
the new one comes up, but can't read any disk.  

Either there is something with the paper-tape punch on 57, or PTPSER is
sending extra nulls.  I could not get the old BOTLOD program to punch
out an exact duplicate of the current papertape bootstrap.
Therefore I cannot create a new BOTLOD tape for testing.
I will try the PTP on 22 and 70 next.

I found another reason why DSKCLN needs to be run by the monitor 
instead of by INITIA - if (OPER)[1,21].UFD is bad, INITIA dies
and does not run DSKCLN, therefore the UFD does not get fixed.
Its even wors when the STRUUO causes a stopcode - you can't even GFD
to OPER.  I had to delete  the UFD by hand.


DSKCLN then ran, and said that (SYS)CRA003.SAV had lost data.
The monitor does not handle lost data well, when COPYCRASH tried to
LOOKUP CRA003.SAV, FILIO hung.  All PI's disabled, PI 3
currently in progress, IO bus request on PI 1, program request on PI 7.

I will probably go straight to CUP-C tomorrow (Thursday).

Subject: 3650 status 

I have a hacked version of BOOTS (named BOOTX) that reads from pages
packs only.  It works, but currently it is read from the blocks pack,
then it reads the monitor from the pages pack.  

The paper-tape punch on C70 works, I have some more debugginf go do
on BOTLOD.

Talked to Fred Wright at Systems Concepts, he says that the 3350's
cannot be completely reformatted by outputing a predetermined string
of bytes like the 3330's.  To rewrite the HA (home Address), you have to
read the existing HA, read the sense bytes from that read, merge the
sense byte data with the new HA data, then rewrite the HA.

He also mentioned that the location CRECL has the numbers of words per
record.  Setting it to 1000 will format the pack in paged.  
Unfortunately that causes a length error unless a cople of locations are
kludged up.  I haven't tried the kludge yet.

I formatted all but 3 disks, and will try creating a 10-pack system.

Subject: New F3 status 

The line from node 3143 has been cut & strung... Dennis Ernst is going
to build us code as node 2770 (same as 2770 connected to 6657!) with
host number 118.  When TYMNET gets around to giving us a new node and
host and line from one of the engines, we will consider reconfiguring
everything.  (Dennis Coffey estimates 3 weeks on that, I'd say a month).

The 2770 code should have been finished friday afternoon.  Just before
I left for the evening, I plugged in the cable to the DxP-11 card in
the NETCON box and realized we needed a cross-over of some sort...  On
Monday (today) we can find the right cross-over, build a monitor, try
to load 2770 and if everything works, build a 2 or 3 pack system.

Due to concern over the E-BUS crashes Dallas (Marconi) called and wants
us to quickly look at the dumps and then have the files removed to get
some disk space back.

   *** PLEASE, DO NOT DELETE THEM WITHOUT TALKING TO ME /CARL ***

Also, Marconi asked me to cut /P monitors for all the Dallas machines
due to pressure from Bill Fisher (spelling?).  I told him that we would
build them, put in the appropriate patches and dispatch them to the
systems sometime beginning Monday (today).  I vote that all STOPCDs on
the dallas machines cause a reload after the message is typed.  Once we
find a solution to the DIEREH/CRASH/147 crashes we can release a new
version of the monitor.

I expect to be in by noon... if anyone needs me earlier, feel free to
call me and wake me.

No, we don't really have the time to look at any of these thoroughly,

In particular, block-io request negotiations and block output requests
to the base seem to be crashing the base....

Subject: Node 2770 up! 

I finally got node 2770 up and running.  I swapped hardware around with
Dennis' blessing and he re-cut code for it with the swapped hardware. I
put the DUV-11 board from node 555 in place of the MDB DUV-11 look-alike
and replaced the M9400 (REV11-A) bootstrap with the M8012 BDV11 board
from the 2-cabinet micronode.  I found another DUV cable and used that
while trying to find out why it wasn't loading.

Turns out it's supposed to be plugged into slot 3 (0,1,2,3 : 4th) from the
left (and not from the right) on node 3143.

We need to do the following:

    1)  Make a new monitor for system X118 with ^D33 ports.
    2)  Make a TITO save tape.
    3)  Make sure the disks are formatted (I think they are).
    4)  Define a 2 or 3 pack structure.  I vote for 3.
    5)  Refresh & rebuild it from 930's all-files tape, selected directories.

Joe,
  Any reason P15 shouldn't work?  If not, it's ready to go.
If so, then we should simply build a /P from sources in (OSP).
Either a monitor tape, or just copy it across with TITO, then
we can bring the other system up on the network.

When loading, there were lots and lots of "lost" packets according
to the LOADII program.  I donno if that means we have a flakey line
or not.  We'll find out later.

COMMOD.MAC has already been changed to reflect these new entries.
     I re-used some of the SWAP pointers, HOMK4S > HOMSPS, HOMSWP > HOMFEF
     and UNISWP > UNIFEP.

REFSTR, UUOCON and KSFEFS still need to be modified.
KSBLOD has already been modified to use BOOT pages 3,4,5 as all other
processors already do.

The plan is to make a duplicate 930 file structure, then to delete all

are on 930 (leaving them on 118).  There of course, will be some small
duplication, but that chan be pared down as time goes by.

Subject: PDP-10 SCNSER BUG 

It's "official", that one of the major causes of the base crashing at
the moment is caused by a timing problem in SCNSER.  What happens is
this:

  o  The user sends a BLOCK-IO OUTPUT request at PDP-10 UUO level.
  o  The circuit gets zapped out in the network.
  o  The base tells us via the input ring that the port is zapped.
  o  The monitor clears out the LDB for the port and flags that a
     zapper needs to be echoed.
  o  The monitor now goes to process the BLOCK-IO OUTPUT at SCNSER
     interrupt level, picks up the BLOCK-IO output buffer address
     (which incidently has been zeroed by the circuit zap code)
     and proceeds to build an output message using 16 bits of the
     port LDB address as the character count and 6 as the buffer
     address.
  o  The base tries to process this message and gets itself crashed
     by ISIS after messing up the rings with an incredibly large
     message.
  o  In the process of going down, the base "sometimes" takes the 10
     down; other times the 10 is crashed by DEP 1 in 30.

This is NOT a new bug.  It has been happenning for quite a while.  The
Varian base used to attempt to process this and generally went on it's
merry way after outputting only a single byte (most probably a null).
This bug has caused crashes in every version of our monitor running with
the new bases.

The fix is for the PDP-10 to NOT put the bad message type into the ORING
by making additional checks at interrupt level to determine whether the
port has been zapped since the BLOCK-IO OUTPUT request was issued, but
prior to the actual data transfer.

Subject: BIO-ZAP patch 

I've made patch #9, BIOZAP.PAT and installed it on systems C26 & D25
both in SYSTEM.SAV and the running monitor.  The patch addresses two
areas:
  1) STOPCD if T3/ LDBBIO(U) = 0 and a zapper was not seen
                                 if seen, then act if no room for data
     simulates STOPCD(DEBUG,BIOZAP)

  2) GETBIO routine ought to check if the port it's allocating a buffer
     on is really there (not zapped).

If C26 & D25 seem to run "clean" then I will propagate the patch to all
the other systems and fit the fix into the sources.

Subject: BPXKON is stupid. 

It's so dumb that it treats "RECORD NO FOUND" as if it were a bad spot on the
disk, and blithely assumes that the record will reappear if it waits long
enough.

The problem that kept ASP restore from working is the same one that caused
"I/O error to page 124" when I tried to "SAVE (SYS)NEWMON" on C24.

If FILIO tries to output more than 21 contiguous core pages to contiguous
disk pages, BPXKON has to split the request up into 3 or more requests of
7 pages each (7 pages per track).  The routine that does this made a bad
assumption.  Since the size of the command list area is big enough to handle
one cylinder on a 3330 in blocks (1 cyl = 380 blocks), then it thought it
could use the amount of space remaining in the command list to calculate the
end-of-cylinder boundry.  But 380 pages is 1.8 cylinders on a 3650 (and 4.0
cylinders on a 3330 in pages).  It correctly built the command list to transfer
pages 1-7 of track 0, 1-7 of track 1, 1-7 of track 2, but then added 8-10 of
track 2.  The disk complained that record 8 does not exist, but stupid BPXKON
treated it like a bad spot on the disk.

A three-line patch to BPXKON solved this problem.

An ASP dump stores the first 317 cylinders on one tape and 238 on the 2nd (total
of 555 cylinders).  An ASP restore takes 26 minutes, including the time it takes
to rewind the tape and mount the second one.

/JMS

P.S. The old copy routine in PAKCP5 ("OLDC" and "DOIT") works, takes somewhere
between 25 and 30 minutes to copy one 3650 pack (I wasn't watching when it
finished).

Subject: ADDPAK vs REFRESH 

Joe,
  The code in ADD UNIT tests a lot of things and all go to CANTAD which
prints out the message CAN NOT ADD UNIT TO STRUCTURE.  However, I suspect
that it took the error return from PAKREF.  This is because there is an
AOBJN pointer that says to read the RIB for each of the per-pack files
which were (2) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and now are (3) SAT.SYS, HOME.SYS and
SPAGES.SYS.  In PAKREF, at PREF2 + it says to error return if the rib is
blank... and in the OLD structures SWAP.SYS has been obliterated.  You
need to REFRESH first to setup the rib for SPAGES.SYS and then an ADDPAK
should work fine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW 5.9 VERSION OPERATING SOFTWARE FOR
THE MARS+ HONEYWELL 6/23 SYSTEM , A NUMBER OF TROUBLES HAVE APPEARED.
SYSTEMS HAVE 4-2 AND LARGER CONFIGURATIONS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING
VARIOUS CRT TROUBLES.

EXAMPLES:  ERRONEOUS RESPONSES
           UNSOLICITED RESPONSES
           FROZEN CURSORS

IF YOU ARE SERVICING A SYSTEM THAT HAS REPORTED THESE PROBLEMS OR
ONES THAT ARE SIMILAR , BE SURE TO ASK THEM WHEN THE TROUBLES STARTED
AND WHEN THEY MADE THE SWITCH TO THE 5.9 SOFTWARE. IF AGENCY STILL HAS
IT'S OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE YOU CAN USE IT TO REINIT SYSTEM AND CHECK
WHETHER CRT TROUBLES ARE STILL OCCURING. IF THEY STOP , THEN YOU HAVE
TWO OPTIONS. YOU CAN ADVISE AGENCY THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE
USING THE OLD OPERATING SOFTWARE. OR YOU CAN RESET THE BAUD RATE FOR
THE LAST CRT <LAST ADDRESS IN SYSTEM> FOR 4800 BAUD INSTEAD OF NORMAL
OPERATING BAUD RATE OF 9600 BAUD. THEN YOU CAN BRING SYSTEM BACK UP
ON NEW 5.9 SOFTWARE AND CRT PROBLEMS SHOULD DISAPPEAR. BUT IT IS
                                                                Page  2

VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU FIRST EXPLAIN THESE OPTIONS WITH THE AGENCY
AND ALLOW THEM TO MAKE DECISION. IF AGENCY DECIDES TO HAVE ONE CRT
RESET TO 4800 BAUD , MAKE CHANGE TO CRT THAT HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT
OF TRAFFIC.

THIS IS ONLY A QUICK-FIX SOLUTION TILL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CORRECTS
PROBLEMS WITH SYSTEM <DATA CENTER'S 6/53'S> OPERATING SOFTWARE.

DATA LEAVES AGENCY'S 6/23 AND GOES TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 COMPUTER
VIA TYMNET. DATA IS THEN TRANSLATED BY 6/53 TO THE AIRLINES'
COMPUTER'S LANGUAGE AND SENT TO AIRLINES FOR ANSWER. ANSWER <DATA>
IS THEN RETURNED TO DATA CENTER'S 6/53 TO BE TRANSLATED BACK TO
OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. AFTER TRANSLATION DATA IS SENT TO THE
AGENCY'S 6/23 AND APPEARS ON ONE OF IT'S CRT'S DISPLAY.

THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN DATA CENTER'S 6/53 IS TRANSLATING DATA < ANSWER>
FROM AIRLINES COMPUTER TO OUR OPERATING LANGUAGE. IN SOME CASES
WE LOSE THE "END OF MEESAGE TAG". THIS WILL CREATE A MULTITUDE
OF PROBELMS FOR THE 6/23 WHICH IS SLAVED TO THE 6/53.



************************************************************************


ADDED NOTE:

IF YOU HAVE AGENCY'S THAT ARE REPORTING THAT THEIR CRTS ARE 
GENERATING TICKET COMMANDS ON THEIR OWN , BE SURE TO ASK THEM
WHETHER THEY WERE BUILDING A RECORD WHEN TICKET COMMAND WAS
GENERATED. THIS IS BECAUSE WHILE THEY ARE BUILDING A RECORD THEY
USE THE "0/SEGMENT" KEY. IF THEY ACCIDENTLY HIT THE "0/SEGMENT"
KEY AND THE "F7" KEY TOGETHER < THE "F7 KEY IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE
"0/SEGMENT" KEY" > THE SYSTEM WILL SEE THIS AS A TICKET COMMAND.
WE CALL THIS THE "FAT FINGER SYNDROME". TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING
AGAIN YOU CAN ASK THE AGENT TO BE MORE CAREFUL OR REMOVE THE 
"F7" KEY'S TOP. YOU CAN ALSO REMOVE THE KEY AND BREAK OFF IT'S
PINS AND THEN PLACE IT BACK INTO KEYBOARD. THIS WAY YOU CAN LEAVE
THE KEY'S TOP ON.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO EVERYONES ATTENTION TWO ITEMS OF INTEREST
IN WORKING ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 SYSTEM. THEY ARE:


1. NOW THAT WE HAVE NEW OPERATING SOFTWARE THERE IS A TROUBLE SYMPTOM
   CHANGE. WITH THE OLD SOFTWARE WHEN THE TRANSMIT KEY EXPERIENCED
   ELECTRICAL BOUNCES YOU WOULD SEE THE CURSOR DROP SEVERAL LINES
   INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL ONE LINE DROP. WITH THE NEW 5.0 - 5.9
   SOFTWARE THE CURSOR WILL ONLY DROP ONE LINE. INSTEAD THE SYSTEM WILL SEE
   EACH TRANSMIT AS A SEPERATE COMMAND. YOU WILL SEE YOUR REPLY
   TO YOUR REQUEST PLUS YOU WILL SEE SEVERAL ERROR MESSAGES SUCH AS
   "INVALID FORMAT" APPEARING ON FOLLOWING LINES. YOU MAY JUST HAVE
   A COLD SOLDER JOINT BUT IT IS ADVISABLE TO REPLACE THE KEY. WHEN-
   EVER YOU OPEN THE KEYBOARD IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE YOUR SOLDERING
   IRON AND GO OVER ALL OF THE KEYS SOLDER JOINTS. IF YOU FIND A COLD 
   SOLDER JOINT IT WILL COLLAPSE WHEN SOLDERING IRON IS PLACED
   ON IT. THIS EXTRA STEP MAY SAVE YOU TROUBLE IN THE FUTURE AND TAKES
   ONLY A FEW EXTRA MINUTES.

2. WHEN PERFORMING PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON THE HONEYWELL 6/23 IT IS
                                                                Page  2

   VERY IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE CONTROLLER BOARD'S CONTACTS. THIS CAN BE
   DONE WITH A PENCIL ERACER. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CLEAN THE POWER
   SUPPLIES AND TAKE APART THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY TO CLEAN IT.
   THERE ARE TWO VENTS IN THE BACK OF THE CARD CAGE WHERE AIR IS DRAWN
   THROUGH BY THE BUS POWER SUPPLY FANS TO COOL THE CONTROLLER
   BOARDS. THESE VENTS NEED TO BE CLEANED ALSO.

ADDED NOTE: WHEN YOU HAVE A HONEYWELL <PRU1001> PRINTER THAT IS SHUTTING
            ITSELF <KICKING IT'S OWN CIRCUIT BREAKER> OFF YOU SHOULD
            FIRST CHECK THE BRIDGE DIODE CR01. THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE
            THE CAUSE OF PROBLEM IN ABOUT 98% OF OUR PRINTER PROBLEMS
            DESCRIBED ABOVE.

1. VIP7200 CRT'S RASTER IS TOO BRITE BUT THE DISPLAY IS ADJUSTABLE;


       CHECK THE 7800 UFD CAP ON THE VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOAD.


2. VIP7200 IS MISSING IT'S VIDEO <DISPLAY> , OR IT'S HORIZONTAL SYNC;


      CHECK THE LOCATION B14 <SN74LSI161AN> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


3. VIP7200'S CURSOR WON'T MOVE WILL WILL TYPE CHARACTORS;


      CHECK THE LOCATION M06 OR M07 <SN74LS08N> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


4. VIP7200'S RASTER OKAY BUT DISPLAY <BRITENESS> CAN'T BE ADJSTED;
                                                                Page  2



      CHECK THE CAP C431 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD.


5. VIP7200 HAS A VERY ERACTIC DISPLAY , SCREEN JUMPS AROUND;


      THERE IS RIPPLE ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD-REPLACE.


6. VIP7200'S TOP LINE OF DISPLAY IS CURVED OR BENT;


      CHECK R29 ON VIP7200'S VIDEO BOARD FOR OPEN OR LOSS OF RESISTANCE.


7. VIP7200 DISPLAYS ONLY EVERY OTHER LINE;


      CHECK LOCATION E05 <SN74LS193> ON VIP7200'S LOGIC BOARD.


8. VIP7200 DISPLAYS RANDOM CHARACTORS;


      CHECK FOR 15V ON 5V PIN ON VIP7200'S POWER SUPPLY BOARD. IF
      IT IS PRESENT THEN Q03 IS OPEN BETWEEN B-C. REPLACE.
      ALSO CHECK VIP7200'S KCM BOARD CONTACTS AND CLEAN THEM. THE
      DIRTY CONTACTS CAN CAUSE ABOVE PROBLEM AND ALSO FROZEN CURSORS.



ADDED NOTE: YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CLEAN THE CONTACTS ON THE KCM BOARDS
            EVEN IF YOU ARE WORKING ON A DIFFERENT PROBLEM.
            IF YOU CHECK +5 VOLTS ON THE DISK DRIVE POWER SUPPLY
            AND IT SHOWS +2.5 OR LESS VOLTAGE THEN CHECK THE
            REGULATOR LM323K.

Subject: 118's New Configuration, per Tymnet. 

  We have our answer from Tymnet, re. the F-3's network configuration:

      The F-3's new host number:		   62
      The LSI-11 micro-Tym-Base's node number:	10115
      The LSI-11's Kernel-host number:		 7964
      The neighbor node:			 3143

  Note:  the physical port on 3143, to which node 10115 (the micro-Tym-Base)
      is attached doesn't matter:  in Tymnet II the engine's software
      dynamically associates the physical port number on which it finds the
      neighbor with the logical port number to which the nieghbor is assigned
      in its .TYM file.  The only time it matters is placing the clock jumpers
      on the proper sync board pins.

  We can install everything, even before Tymnet Operations cuts the changed
      code for 3143, as long as we maintain 2770 until we have all the code
      for the LSI-11 and the F-3 with the new numbers.

                                                                   /Dennis

This headache/earache combination seems to be getting worse.  I have an
appointment at Kaiser tonight at 7:00 to see what is causing the problem.
If it doesn't get any better, there is a good chance that I will be at
home tomorrow.  (Possibly working?)

I will keep you all posted on developments.  I hope that all will be
cleared up and I'll be in as usual tomorrow.

Subject: Update on my condition 

The pain in the side of my head isn't getting much worse, but it also
isn't getting any better.  Lying down seems to decrease the frequency
and the intensity somewhat, but I don't know how much.  The doctor did
NOT find anything conclusive and told me to wait a day or two and come
back if the pain didn't go away.
  I have a dental appt this afternoon to determine if the pain is from
a cavity in one of my lower teeth... I don't think it will be, but we
will see.
  I will be working from home in the meantime... send mail or if it is
urgent feel free to call me.

  Ken, receive my apologies for answering so late to your December memo.
 
  1.  Oper names  for host 930 to  access INFO database: copying  930 INFO
      database to system 90  will not work. System 90 is  due to be defin-
      itively taken out of the network way before the end of 1986
 
      System 74 (accounting host) might be a better choice
 
      We need essentially EVERYTHING that exists in the INFO database
 
      Removing RF from 930  does not seem practical: as far  as I can tell
      this is used both to access INFO database and to access monitor code
      when weing for a replacement
 
  2.  Accessing on host 74 the Validation database: we will be using user-
      name CTOPSMGR and oper names JAY or STRATMAN (the latter to be vali-
      dated)
 
      Files accessed are: USERDB.DMS, CUSTDB.DMS, ADDRDB.DMS
 
  3.  Current status  of the  project: we  are running  January accounting
      cycle with your and our data in  parallel. We will let you know when
      we do not need your data any more
 
      We can  give you a royalty  report containing connect,  tru (without
      pru), pru (as a separate amount) for prime, nonprime and batch time.
 
      Please provide  a list  of royalty codes  as viewed  by MIS  and the
      relationship between each royalty code and the corresponding code in
      the TYMCOM/370  raw accounting. After reviewing the TYMCOM-370 moni-
      tor notes,  it seems that the  corresponding TYMCOM-370 code  can be
      one of the following raw accounting fields:
 
          Accounting record type 5, field  "PREMPGNM" for the royalty code
          and field "PREMPRU" for the pru amount
 
          Accounting record type 9, field "TRNSPGNM" and field "TRNSCHGS"
 
      Please indicate what kind of record layout you need for your royalty
      data
 
  I hope this answers your questions.
 
    Regards,
    Eric
 
  PS: special note  for Patrice de Beranger: the royalty  report will have
  to be  taken from your  data and sent  to Ken  BeDell. Since we  (YM and
  myself) provide you with detailed data you  are the only one in position
  to provide this report, since you do the totaling

Ken,

      Eric referred to two items to which I can (should?) provide answers:

1.)  PERP replacement:  the project is our number two priority, and should be
completed within about one month (my rough estimate--I'm not directly
involved in it at this time).  We are confident that this is poenty of time
prior to the date expiration of the 940s.

2.)  OPER license access on 930:  Eric's point about the plans to take system
90 out of the network well before the end of the year is news to me, and is a
very valid point.  Their need to access monitor code on 930 will be taken
under advisement.  No answer to this problem immediately, but soon.


      Regards,
      Dennis

          ALL ISG EMPLOYEES


          CHANGE IN TAX LAWS - TUITION REIMBURSEMENTS





    McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Group (ISG) employees 
attending a college, university or other reimbursable program 
under the ISG Tuition Reimbursement benefit should be aware of a 
change in the tax law concerning tuition reimbursements.

    Code Section 127 was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 
1978 and excluded tuition reimbursements from gross income.  This 
section of the Code expired on December 31, 1985 and unless a new 
Code amendment is passed or the present one extended, tuition 
reimbursements will be included in gross income and subject to tax 
withholdings beginning January 1, 1986.  As a result, tuition 
reimbursements paid to employees after January 1, 1986 will 
reflect the withholding of the appropriate amount as required by 
the law.

    There is an indication that Congress may act in early 1986 to 
reinstate the provisions of section 127.  If that occurs, ISG will 
make appropriate refunds to the affected employees.

l.  Incidents  involving terrorist actions have increased in number
    and   severity   in  the  past  months.    In  order  to  avoid
    unnecessary  danger  to  employees,  Corporate American Express
    Cards are being reissued with the company's name omitted.

2.  The  new  Corporate  American  Express  Card will have the same
    account  number  as  the  card the employee is currently using.
    Therefore,  when  the new card is received, the card containing
    the company's name should be destroyed.

3.  The  new  Corporate American Express Card is still considered a
    corporate  card  and  all  rules and regulations governing such
    card is still in effect.

4.  The  reissuing  of all cards should be completed by 1 April 86.
    If  you  have  not  received your new card by that date, please
    contact Glenda Goodman in St. Louis at (314) 234-6898.

The Safety of our employees is of the utmost concern to all of 
us.  We must continue to support aggressive programs aimed at 
achieving the protection of our work environment and the safety of 
everyone.

ISG Management Directive 210 Safety, states:

o   Management will provide a safe and healthy working environment 
    for employees and be responsible for compliance with Federal, 
    state, and local laws regarding employee safety.

o   All organizations will comply with the procedures established 
    by ISG Human Resources regarding industrial accidents and 
    illness to include management awareness, provisions for 
    medical assistance, forms preparation, reporting requirements, 
    etc.

We must all take the actions necessary to ensure the safety of our 
employees and prevent occupational related injury and illness.

If you are aware of any area in your organization where safety 
concerns exist, please contact your local Human Resources 
representative.  Should you need additional assistance, contact 
Corinne S. Karp of the ISG Group Human Resources in St. Louis.

Subject: BAD SYSUFD PATCH 

Correction:  The patch to turn off the weird SYS:.UFD = (UFD).UFD does
what we expected... however, we didn't expect that some old accounting
programs actually used that "feature"/"bug" and thus, we cannot patch
it at the moment.

   I went around to most of the Dallas machines with the new /P-8 monitors
and in an effort to just "get it done before I forgot again" I put the
instructiuon  "CAME T1,MFDPPN" back where it was patched out of both the
running /P-8 monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on
  27, 31, 37, 56 and 65.   Just fixed (SYS)NEWMON on 25, 72 and 79.

DID NOT FIX systems 23 and 54 since they were unavailable for some reason
at this time.  Someone (OSMAN,JOE) please check them and un-do the SYSUFD
patch:

  FILUUO$:   CHKPP1+2/ JFCL 0   <== replace with CAME T1,MFDPPN

I did NOT update P-8 to P-8 because I was in a hurry and don't feel all
that well at the moment... I was just trying to do it while it was on my
mind.

I was planning on getting in around 9am... but one of our cars looks it
may have a blown head-gasket (i hope that's all) so I have to car-pool
with Cherie... Tomorrow she has to go to SF before going into work, so
when she gets back from SF she'll pick me up and I'll probably get there
sometime after 1pm (not really sure... she has to be in SF at 11;30).

I'm expecting to try going through the REFSTR code with DDT to see where
it's dying, then I'll decide if it's easy enough to try to fix and re-test
it again...and again...

  See you then.

1. BODLOD worked as far as puching the tape but, when I tried
   to boot the "BOOTX" looked like either paper tape wasn't puched
   right or paper tape reader was not reading it right, although
   at the end it sat "LOAD PAPER TAPE". I will try puching it one
   more time before I give up.
2. C26/3650 Project, still trying to find out if everthing works
   the the way it should. Also checking the disks to make sure that 
   thay are usable in terms of bad spot. Ran diagnostics all weekend
   with SA10NW in "VERIFY MODE". I probably need an other day or two
   to compleate the checking. See you soon.

Craig,
  To use TOPS-10, just BOOT system 95 from the DSKA and DSKB packs (DSKA
has to be in the drive with the 0 plug).  To log in, type "I" on the TYM444,
INITIA will log in a [1,2] job there.

Subject: REFSTR 

I believe it is finished.  The problem was that after running off the end
of the unit list, I didn't reset U to point at anything (let alone the first
unit) and PCBIO got upset.  I put in code to reset it, and it worked fine.
I built a 4-pack system, then disolved it, then built a 2 pack system.  I am
restoring the all-files tape to it to prove to myself that it will do all
that it's supposed to... then I will do an ADD-PACK to verify that that will
also work correctly.  I don't expect any problems.

The 2-pack system died in the middle of the all-files rebuild.  I'm not
syre why, it got an IME stopcd and I lost the crash by trying to dump it
to the "good" packs instead of the "2-pack" packs.

Anyway, It seems one of the UFD's is bad but that's all I know at the
moment. I just crashed it... will tell all more tomorrow.  /Carl

Subject: Hours... 

I will probably NOT be in early today....  I've finished a REFSTR that
works as best as the packs will let it.  (It created SPAGES.SYS just fine,
but I think DSKCLN didn't like 2 pages in the file and marked them as
holes in the rib, [I donno what it did to the pages in the SATs]).  I built
a 3-pack system, dumped a bunchof files to it from 930, and thinned the
files down a little.

There's a "working" skeleton system on 24 now... not everything works...
for example, TELECOPY works pulling, but not pushing?  May be a base bug,
but don't depend on it!  SPOOL is not expected to work, etc...

I didn't write a boots, and am not worried about it at present.... we need
to do that Osman,...  

Most of the MONITOR utility programs and such are out there...

  (SYS) has some compilers, etc, PEAK, VUE, TECO, ...RPG, PIP, DIRIT, etc.
 (FTSYS) has TECO 124a, and a few updated things, eg MACRO %53B
  (OSU) has some tools, some things that were in (WRS)
  (MPL) has more tools
 (CARL) and (JMS) have various copies of other things & DEC programs.
 (PJ) has a jOBS.DAT FILE but there is no (TYMNET) files.

Good night....

OSMAN will make an all-files of this system then overwrite it by making
the biggest 3650 system he can without wiping out our 2 1-pack systems.

Subject: (TYMNET)NODES.MAP updated for 14-bit node numbers. 

NODES.MAP is now 96 pages long - it has a 3-word entry for all 16834 possible
14-bit node numbers.  All nodes that do not have an explicit name now have
a 9-character implicit name.  The implicit name consists of a space, a hyphen,
the 5-digit node number (from 00000 to 37777), another hyphen, and another
space.  The program (TYMNET)DEFNOD does not list implicit names so that
it is easier to see the defined node names.

Now that the fully expanded NODES.MAP has been telecopied to all systems,
SYSTAT won't get into a loop anymore.  SYSTAT currently does not even attempt
to look for the name of any mode above 7777, which is OK since the base passes
only 12 bits to SCNSER (for LDBLOG).

Try running SYSTAT (with license set) on a "real" system to see the new names.

F58 will be going down for pPM tomorrow night.  I will request FSC to

Please let me know as early as possible tomorrow.

1. Well, today(3/6) I finally go to "Jury Duty"

2. 3650 Project for C26 is "GO" for this weekend.
   I build a 12-pack system over the weekend but,
   2 hrs after finished rebuilding the system lost
   one of the disk therefore lost the 12-pack system.

3. I am on the process of building an other 10-pack
   system, to check out disk, monitor and all the other
   utilities, pakcop, asp, tito etc..

4. I have not acounter any problems so far with disk,
   like disk errors or any utilities not doing what 
   they suppose too.

5. I will continue to rebuild and checking. I will
   do asp dump after restoring the all-files.

6  For this weekend I will assist ops for the move
   and be available for help.

In-reply-to: your message of Thu, 6 Mar 86 9:07:05 PST

I think it is because F38 has two 3672 control units and four 3673 string
controllers.  This means that 4 disks can be seeking to a new cylinder at
the same time, and 2 disks can be searching for ID= at the same time.
C24 has only 1 control unit and 2 string controllers.

now thinks it's a TYMCOM-X system.  I may patch it on all systems if

Well, C26 is up and running with the "3650 DISKS"
as 10-Pack system and still have 158000 pages free.
So far, I have not discovered anything unusual except:
1) DSKCLN taking longer, 1 hr and 14 mins on KL.
2) After ASP dump, picked up 2 or 3 HDEV errors on
   most of the disks. Disks were running error  free
   during ALL-FILES restore.
3) SA10NW diagnostic tape which works when loaded on KI
   doesn't work on KL. Something we need to look into
   soon so that MAINT people have tools to work with.
   I have an idea what the problem might be, will look
   into it later.

We need to do everything we can to ensure the ISG meets its 1986 
revenue and earnings objectives.  In line with this need I am 
announcing, effective today, the following organizational changes:

o   The North American Marketing and Sales organization that 
    formerly reported within McDonnell Douglas Distribution 
    Systems Company is now part of McDonnell Douglas Computer 
    Systems Company.  This restructuring will better equip the 
    Computer Systems Company to compete in the business systems 
    marketplace while it continues to meet ISG's internal hardware 
    manufacturing needs.  The restructured company will be headed 
    up by Otis Brinkley as President, with Vern Smith as Executive 
    Vice President.  In the coming weeks, Otis and Vern will work 
    together to develop an optimal structure for the Computer 
    Systems Company.

o   McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company has been 
    dissolved in an effort to narrow the range of our business 
    activities and focus more on profitability.  The business 
    units within the Distribution Systems Company have been 
    reassigned as follows:

    -     Our Commercial Distribution Systems and Electronic Data 
          Interchange businesses are now part of McDonnell Douglas 
          Diversified Information Systems Company.  As such, these 
          businesses will continue to pursue their 1986 Operating 
          Plan objectives.

    -     Our embryonic Retail Systems business is being assigned 
          to ISG Marketing and Planning, where it will continue to 
          develop its strategy, though at a much lower level of 
          investment than we had planned for the balance of 1986.





1'm confident that these actions will increase our chances of 
achieving our 1986 objectives.  I'm counting on you not only to 
support these moves, but to do whatever you can to ease the 
transition for the people affected by them.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS GROUP         BENEFITS FACT     March 1986



TO:           ALL ISG EMPLOYEES WITH MEDICAL COVERAGE


SUBJECT:      (l) Coordination of Benefits
              (2) Oral Surgery Coverage For Employees
                  Covered By A Health Maintenance Organization
              (3) Toll Free 800 Numbers To Group Insurance


Coordination of Benefits

    The  rules  on  primary  and secondary coverages for children's
medical claims changed January l, 1986.

    Prior  to  this  change the father's coverage was automatically
primary  for  the  children  and  the  mother's coverage was always
secondary.    January 1, 1986 the parent with primary coverage will
be the one who has the earlier birthday during the calendar year.

    As  an  example,  if  the  father's  birthday  is  June 20, the
mother's  birthday  is February 15, and both parents have insurance
covering  the  children, the mother's insurance will now be primary
and  the  father's  secondary.    The  parents'  year  of  birth is
immaterial.

    This  change  comes  about as a result of policy established by
the  National  Association  of  Insurance  Commissioners.    It  is
effective  for  service  received    on  or  after January 1, 1986.
Claims  filed  after  January  1, 1986 for services received before
that date will be handled according to the old rules.

    This  change does not affect the order of primary and secondary
coverages  where  the  parents are separated, divorced, or are both
MDC employees.

    Health  Maintenance  Organizations (HMO's) in St. Louis will be
making  this  change.   If you have HMO coverage outside St. Louis,
check with your local HMO.

Oral Surgery Change

    If  you  have  elected medical coverage from an HMO, and dental
coverage  from  General  American, the dental plan has been changed
and  might  now  cover certain oral surgery procedures that are not
covered  by  your  HMO.    If  you  have HMO coverage and need oral
surgery, check with your HMO first.









Toll Free 800 Numbers And Extended Hours For Group Insurance 

    Employees  who  live  or work outside St. Louis and do not have
access  to an MDC telephone during working hours can now use a free
800 number to contact Group Insurance.

            1-800-392-4010                    1-800-523-1952
    (Missouri but outside St. Louis)        (outside Missouri)

    In  addition  the  telephone hours have been expanded.  The new
hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. central time.

On Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 March 1986 the parking lots
at 20605 and 20705 Valley Green (VG1, VG2 and VG3) will be
resurfaced and striped.  Those employees needing access to
these facilities should park on the south side of VG2 and
the west side of VG1 and VG2 adjacent to the lobby entrance.
All employees entering VG1 and VG2 can do so through the
front lobby entrance.  This entrance will be open 24 hours
a day during this weekend as well as the lobby to VG3.
All employees should have their vehicles moved to the
appropriate spaces no later than 5:00 AM on 8 March 1986.

Contrary to rumors you may be hearing, no final decision has been 
made to discontinue company matching contributions to the ISG 
Employee Savings Plan.  Our current need to cut costs, however, is 
causing us to look for ways to more closely link matching 
contributions to ISG's profitability.

I believe we can make the plan's cost more appropriate to ISG's 
current financial condition and at the same time keep it an 
attractive investment option for you.  In the coming weeks we'll be 
giving a representative sampling of employees a chance to comment 
on the various alternatives under consideration.  I'm committed not 
to make changes until we have thoughtfully looked at the plausible 
options and can select a course that serves both your needs and the 
needs of ISG.

I'll keep you posted on our progress.

Subject: 26: BPA1/BPA10 == DSKB5 

Joe,
  The reason that this happens is that the BPA1 is a left subset of
BPA10 and since there is no BPA1 at the moment (powered off) it picks
the first unit that matches... i.e. BPA10 and returns DSKB5.  As for
DSKB1 (BPA15) and DSKB11 (BPA2) both returning BPA2, again this is
doing the same thing... it's searching the physical tables for a left
subset and stops when it finds a match.  *** THIS IS A BUG ***  It
ought to check for exact matches first, then if it cannot find one
return the left subset.

  I manually checked each unit, and got the correct results in BPA
order.  SY checks using logical device names.  If Osman had not reversed
the order of the logical units and the physical units, this would never
have shown up!  Osman did a good thing!!!  It means we need to fix it
at some point.

Osman,
  Just as I said... the code looks for a left subset.. thus, in looking
for DSKB1 in the list: BPA0=DSKB0, BPA1=DSKB14, BPA2=DSKB2, ..

  DSKB1 matches the first 5 characters of DSKB14, so it returns BPA1.
This is done by the DSKCHR UUO in trying to match BP, BPA, ..etc.  The
ONLY solution is to check for exact matches first, then look for any
partial matches.   *Sigh*

Carl:

      It was a hardware problem.  DEC had spent the whole weekend working on
the RH-11, and cleaimed that they had fixed any problems, "so it must be
software".  Last night I talked to Bud Reinhardt, Mallenkrodt's chief
operator.  Bud told me the problem was also occurring with MAGCON!

      I told Frank Huels (Mallenkrodt's data center mgr.)  that it had to be
hardware, as you and I had discussed.  He called DEC back in this a.m.  Their
F.E.  found that one of the three new replacement boards in the RH-11 was
cracked!  He swapped it out, and they have successfully completed an all-files
backup.  We now have Huel's confidence.

After the last time X62 came up, it was beeping waiting for the time.  The
ADM3 connected to node 10115 got no response.  So I logged into system 39,
created (MPL)RELOAD.115, and ran it.

How are we going to reload the PDP-11 microTYMbases once C39 is on BUBBNET?
Is it simply a matter of putting a Gateway command and password in RELOAD.* ?
What password will LOADII need to build a circuit to 3163 for reloading?

Unknown as to how that will work.... I've obsconded with a copy of SMITII
and it is in (SMITHDE) which seems to be the only place that it will run
from without logging you out.  So, if 930 & 6657 is up, we can load from
there, and after copying it to 62, we should be able to go the other way
with some ease.  TELECO works fine through the gateway, and LOADII will
go through a gateway, but I do not know the procedure.

System 57 is a backup of some fo the code on 39, but (CURR11) and (NEW11)
are not backed up anywhere as far as I know.  maybe we should also find
the reason whay we cannot load 6657 from 930... I believe it has somethng
to do with CIOPR... sigh.  History bites us again!

         DEFERRAL OF ISG MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT

CC:      Business Unit Coordinators



One  of  the  principles  given  to us this year is to manage ISG's
operating  results month by month.  In so doing, we have determined
a  need  to  minimize  ISG costs in the first half of the year.  To
respond  to that need we have moved the Management and Professional
Development  Phases  I-VII  provided  to  MDAIS  into the first two
quarters of 1986.

To  accomplish  this adjustment, MDAIS Phases have been substituted
for  ISG  Phases.    Subsequently, those ISG Phases scheduled after
March 17 will be deferred into the last half of the year.
 
In  addition  to  having  a  significant  favorable impact on ISG's
operating  results  for the first half of this year, the completion
dates  for  Phases  III  and V are moved forward.  As a result, the
full  line of Phases will be in production for the ISG beginning in
June.

The  revised  schedule  and allocations will be available from your
business  unit  coordinator  on  April 8.  It is important that you
continue   to   plan   for   your,   and/or   your   subordinates',
participation  in  the  proper  Phase.  Advance planning allows for
timely  notification  of  participants and for time to complete the
required prework for Phase attendance.

Distributed  Systems  has  been operating at a loss  for  several 
months, with no relief in sight.

Subject: Using the GATEWAY command in TELECOPY. 

To TELECOPY files to or from system 39, you have to start on a PDP-10 on the
public net, build a gateway to BUBBNET, then copy the files.  The host numbers
of the gateways are: 5946, 1461, 1579, 5516, 5981, 1552, 2866, 3171, and 7255.
For example:

	.R TELECOPY
	: GATEWAY 7255;JMS:39
	Password <password for JMS on BUBBNET>
	: (*6NEWS:39)TELECO.DOC,(JMS:930)		;Pull a file from 39
	: (JMS:930)SWITCH.INI,:39			;Push a file to 39
	: QUIT

The gateway host numbers are listed in (*6NEWS)BUBNET.DOC on most PDP-10 systems.

Subject: 3650 disk project. 

Remaining items in the 3650 project:                    17-Mar-86

1) Verify that APT10 works.  It is designed to transfer files between the
   TYMCOM-X system and KLDCP DECtapes via the CTY.  Use it to put SA10NW on
   a DECtape.   This requires a standalone KL, brought up in CONSOLE mode.

2) Determine why the paper-tape version of BOTLOD does not work like the version
   in MONBTS.  This requires a standalone KI with 3650 disks for complete veri-
   fication, although most of the work could be done on C24 with Ampex disks.

3) After the KI version of BOTLOD works, put the KL version on the DECtapes
   using APT10.  This can be done during a scheduled downtime.

4) Determine where PAKCP5 fails when writing the secondary HOM and BAT pages.
   This is the only thing keeping the COPY command from working.  This requires
   standalone time on the CPU with 3650 disks, not more than one weekend.

5) Make a single version of PAKCOPY that understands 3675 in blocks and pages.
   This means that the size of the areas used for channel command lists need to
   be determined at run time, not as an assembly option.  This can be done on
   C24 with Ampex disks.

6) Locate the routines in the monitor that assume that all units of a structure
   are the same size.  Determine whether it is feasible to have a DSKB composed
   of a mixture of packs formatted in blocks and in pages.

7) Modify BOOTS to understand all 4 disk types.  Right now, "BOOTS" understands
   3675 blocks only, and "BOOTX" understands 3650 pages only.  This requires
   standalone time on C24 with Ampex disks, and can be verified on C26
   during a scheduled reload of the system.

8) Add a command to BOOTS telling it which set of packs to look at.  This is so
   that a one-pack test system can be kept spinning and not confuse the Monitor
   by having two packs claiming to be "DSKB0".  This will have a side effect of
   making BOOTS much faster in loading the monitor, and can be done on 930.

9) Install 2nd upgraded SA10 for continued testing on C24.

10) Add code to PAKCP5 that can rewrite HA/R0 on 3650.  I have disassembled the
   relevant portions of SA10NW.SAV, and will put them in PAKCOP.MAC.  Testing
   requires days of standalone time on C24 with new SA10 and 3650 disks.

11) Merge PAKCP5 with the pages version of 3675 PAKCOP.

12) Determine whether bad blocks really work.  Verify that PAKCOPY assigns
    alternate tracks correctly.  Make it look at the BAT block that SA10NW
    creates.  Make the monitor add new entries when it discovers bad pages.

Subject: Re: PAKCOP 3675 blocks/pages 

It might be a nice idea to "read-only" blocks and "write-only" pages with
a version of PAKCOP... Yes, I realize we will have extra pages after just
such a transfer, and that SAT.SYS would need to be fixed up, but it might
well be worth doing the formatting to pages and using only the same size
in blocks until the next REFRESH. That way, we save having to do a reformat
and a full-rebuild at the same time.

Bill,
  This was updated to handle node numbers > 7777 for SYSTAT and it's
obvious that some programs out there need to be fixed... i.e. SCREAM
and ACSCAN... but the problem probabluy is not in the fact that the
arrays for node numbers is smaller than NODES.MAP, but that there are
people logging in from nodes larger than 7777!

%FROM: Per_Lindberg_QZ@ODEN

Have I told you about the large computer now installed and running at
Stacken, the computer club at the KTH (the Royal Institute of
Technology) in Stockholm? No? Well, then...

A few years ago, DEC (Digital Equipment Corp) in Sweden had a sort of
"white elephant" on their hands, a DECsystem-10 (the same type you are
running COM on), but a very old model with a KA10 CPU, single
transistor logic boards and good old core memory. Big as hell, lots of
blinkenlights, and with an appetite for kiloAmpere that would ruin any
computer hobbyist. The customer that had leased the thing did not want
it any more, and DEC did not even try to find another. But instead of
scrapping it, they gave it to us in Stacken. Sure, we could take care
of it, and even payed the transport (about 3000 SEK). But where would
we house such a beast? Fortunately, KTH promised us a place to run it.
For two years it was kept in a garage at KTH while we lobbyed the KTH
administration to give us that place. (There is a constant shortage of
space at KTH, alas). It was not after a new guy in Stacken, Peter
Lothberg, had renewed the efforts by pestering the Principal himself
for a while that we finally got the promised room to install it in.

Then around last spring (1985) the work started. During the summer of
1985 the place was refitted with a real raised computer room floor,
electrical power, terminal lines, a cooling machine with outdoor
condensors, and everything else needed to make the place a
full-fledged computer center.

Meanwhile, our DEC-10, now named "KATIA" (a pun on "Nadja" which is
the DEC-2020 at KTH and "KA-TIA", where "tia" is 10:er in swedish),
was temporary installed and tested at CCCC (Colossal Cave Computer
Center), Peter:s playroom where he already has a DECsystem-10 going.
That DEC-10, (named KICKI) was used for testing and debuggning Katia.
Without it, it might still be nonfunctional.

When the room was finished, Katia was moved in and re-debugged. (You
don't move such a beast without dislocating at least a few wires). And
then, one night last autumn, the champagne bottle, which had been
bought for just this reason, was opened. Katia was installed, and up
and running! According to the tradition, which begun with the
installing of Kicki a year eariler, the bottle is uncorked when you
can give the command MAKE LOVE on the console, which makes a file
named "LOVE" with the venerable TECO editor, and get the resonse "NOT
WAR?" on the console. (This is a "hack" in TECO, installed for obvious
reasons long ago, probably way back in the sixties).

Then on the 23rd of October 1985 Katia was officially inaugurated as
Stacken was throwing its first Big Party in its 7-year history, where
participants could awe at the extremely rare sight of over 100
computer hobbyists, nerds and hackers in (get this!) ties and jackets
(some of them even pinstriped!) The members and a large number of
specially invited dignitaries met at a splendid Dinner With Everything
at the KTH student corps house. Speeches were held, glasses were
raised, jokes were cracked and the atmosphere was high. After the
coffee everyone walked over to the room where Katia stood happily
humming since a few days, where the Principal inaugurated Katia by
cutting a punched tape spanned across the door.

Such a project can't be done without two things: many highly skilled
enthusiasts and a lot of money. Fortunately, Stacken had both. The
latter came from selling copies of our EMACS workalike editor "AMIS"
for about 500 USD a copy to other installations of DEC-10s, VAXen,
PR1MEs and Norsk Data. AMIS was our first success back in 1980, when
me and six others got fed up with not having a really good editor.
(I'm using it right now for writing this text). So AMIS, aside from
preventing us from going berserk, gave us the means to install Katia.

By the way, we can use more hardware. All sorts of donations are
appreciated. Especially disks, but we'll take anything that could
possibly be connected to a DECsystem-10. Also terminals, cooling
machines... anything. Send inquiries to me, or better still, to:
Datorforeningen Stacken, c/o NADA, KTH, S-10044 Stockholm, SWEDEN.

Katia is a neat hobby computer. Those kids and their daddys with
CBM-64:s can go suck on a BASIC manual. The DEC-10 is a REAL COMPUTER,
36 bit words, real tape, disks, DECtapes and a glorious collection of
blinking lights. It runs the TOPS-10 timesharing operating system, one
of the finest and most user-friendly OS ever made (it beats both VMS
and UNIX singlehandedly), rivalled only by TOPS-20. And the awesome
sight of Katia:s 12 large blue cabinets with the blinking lights, its
designed front panel and the rest of the hardware filling the room
stirs the heart. Katia looks like a computer should! This machine and
its worshippers are not unlike the phenomenon of people lovingly
restoring old steam engines and cars. But while Katia definitely is a
veteran computer, it's still modern. It outperforms a medium-sized VAX
and has a much neater instruction set. (Long live the DECsystem-10
designers!) And there are gigabytes upon gigabytes with highly
sophisticated software which we can run on it. Our only problem so far
is what to do with all those unused CPU cycles.

Anyone wants a million prime numbers?


(Text 16633)------------------------------


[Actually the MAKE LOVE trap is in COMPIL and in the old days when tops20
 exec still had the compil interface in it, you could get the not war
 response on tops20 as well. Although this code has been conditionalled out
for some time it was only with tops20 version 5 that it went alltogether.
A sad day !! To the maintainers of PCL : If goto hell on the dec10 responds
with get stuffed can't we have something like that or better under tops20 ?

South on 101 for 60 miles to San Juan Bautista, then 11 miles (another hour) to
Fremont Peak State Park.  We arrived at 4:07am; the moon was still up.  But you
could see Halley's with the naked eye.  At 4:30 the moon went down and the view
got better.  The tail of the comet took up half the field of view in 7x35
binoculars ("It looks like all the pictures of comets!").  It started to fade
at 5:00am when the sky got light.  ("We saw Halley's comet!")

Through a telescope, the field of view is too small to see the entire tail all
at the same time.  One guy had an 8-inch by 7 foot reflector - it showed the
nucleus as a distinct disk in the middle of a fuzzy spot.  And Saturn's rings
are quit spectacular even in the smaller telescopes.

The moon sets 1/29th of a day later each time, so it will still be in the sky
at 4:45 Sunday morning; that's the last time Halley's will be visible for
about 2 weeks.

IF YOU CAN FIND OUT WHETHER IT IS OCTAL OR DECIMAL WOULD BE A GREAT
HELP TO ME.

Information Systems Group      BULLETIN           DATE Mar 19 '86


         MDISG LISTS A THROUGH D

         INTERCOMPANY PRICING BOARD CHANGES



    Effective  immediately,  the  charter  and  composition  of the
    Intercompany Pricing Board are changed as follows.

    The charter of the Intercompany Pricing Board is to:

    o    Establish  operational  ground  rules  and  procedures  as
         necessary to ensure effective implementation of policy.

    o    Review   and  approve  proposed  changes  to  intercompany
         Pricings.

    o    Review  operation of intercompany pricing policy, Pricings
         and  supporting  systems  and  make recommendations to ISG
         Executive  Management  as  necessary  to  ensure effective
         operation of intercompany pricing policy.

    o    Resolve    issues   relating   to   intercompany   pricing
         including,  when  appropriate,  making  recommendations to
         and obtaining approval of Executive Management.

    o    Interpret  intercompany  pricing policy as required in the
         operational environment.

    o    Determine specific handling of exceptional situations.

    o    Ensure  that decisions reached by the Intercompany Pricing
         Board  are implemented in the organizations represented by
         members of the Board.

    With  the  undersigned  as  Chairman,  the Intercompany Pricing
    Board will include the following representatives:

         Craig, S. L.:                  Payment Systems Co.
        *Donovan, J. R.:                ISG  Marketing and Planning
                                        (ex officio)
         Elbert, J. B.:                 Network Systems Co.
         Freeman, F. R.:                Information      Processing
                                        Center
         Frey, D. J.:                   Manufacturing             &
                                        Engineering Systems Co.
         Horn, E. T.:                   Government Services
         Johnson, R. W.:                Computer Systems Co.
         Kintsch, H. J.:                Field Service Co.
         Kos, J. J.:                    Health Systems Co.
        *Krone, L. H.:                  ISG     Marketing    Policy
                                        (Alternate Chairman)






             *LeCroy, E. P.:     ISG Finance
             *Mundloch, R. A.:   ISG Finance
              Schenk, R. W.:     Diversified Information Systems Co.
              Schneider, D. A:   Communications Industry Systems Co.
              Vickroy, W. R.:    Information Systems International
             *Wiedenmann, P. W.: ISG Finance (ex officio)

    Those  Pricing  Board  members  indicated  by * are also members of the
    Intercompany   Pricing  Board  Executive  Council.    This  Council  is
    established  to  provide  timely  and  efficient  resolution of pricing
    questions  at  such  times  when  business conditions do not permit the
    assembly  of  the  full  Intercompany  Pricing Board.  The Council will
    meet only as occasionally required.

    Don  W.  Gerth has successfully completed his assignment to develop the
    policy  and  supervise the implementation of ISG's intercompany pricing
    mechanism.      Without   his  energy  and  attention  to  detail,  the
    intercompany  pricing  program would not be as complete as it is today.
    Effective  14  February  1986,  Don leaves ISG Marketing and returns to
    the  McDonnell  Douglas Manufacturing Industry Systems Company.  Please
    join  me  in  expressing appreciation to Don for his outstanding effort
    over the past year.

    With   D.  W.  Gerth's  departure,  responsibility  for  the  continued
    operation  of  Intercompany  Pricing  is  transferred  to ISG Marketing
    Policy,  the  focal point for Intercompany Pricing administration.  All
    future  intercompany pricing matters should be addressed to L. H. Krone
    (I014/301/4E; Phone:  314-233-0002, ONTYME:  ISGHQ.L/KRONE).
    Your continued cooperation will be appreciated.

1. Made one pack (PAGE) and one pack (BLOCK) 3330 Ampex
   test system pack. Used the all files tape which I made
   before disolving the 3650 page disk. I used P19 making

Subject: LOGON and SWITCH.INI 

It is "nice" that LOGON will let you select options based on node-port
or simply node.  TYMNET nodes on the otherhand do NOT, (I repeat, do NOT)_,
report the physical port number anymore.  Not just the micro-nodes... all
TYMNET nodes are that way...  so, physical port number is meaningless in
99.9 percent of the cases.  (On a micronode,connected to a host, it has a
little meaning, by co-incidence).  The port reported is more likely the
circuit number reported to ISIS (or it's look-alikes).

So,  please don't feel that you are having problems with LOGON if you
cannot get it to select on a specific port.  TYMNET isn't really reporting
the physical port to the host anymore.  The Node information IS correct if
you are coming from a real node, and sometimes is a lie for internal circuits
on a micro-node host.  All "real" circuits, are supposed to be correct.

Sigh!

Symptom:  SPOOL not running, SPLFIX gets a fatal error on file SPOOL.GBK
        Renaming files, wait...
        LOOKUP failed for (SPOOL)SPOOL.GBK.
        Fatal error.
        Enabling SPOOL . . . Enabled.
         Can not continue !
        Please call the TYMCOM-X Support Line : (408) 446-6709

Diagnosis: SPLFIX had created SPOOL.GNW, SPOOL.FNW, and SPOOL.MNW.  The files
        SPOOL.MBK and SPOOL.FBK were dated 28-Feb-86 but SPOOL.GBK did not
        exist (maybe DSKCLN deleted it).  SPLFIX thought it needed to find
        this BAK file just so it could delete it.

Cure:   "COPY SPOOL.GDF,SPOOL.GBK", "RUN (UTIL)SPLFIX".  Done.

Note:   Carl and I both agree that this is not really a hotline problem.
        Maybe we need another policy for this kind of support on weekends.
        Anyway, SPLFIX needs to be changed so that it does not use the old phone
        number.

Woke up at 3:56 Monday morning with the bed shaking.  KGO says it was 5.6 on

No damage, some knick-knacks fell off the shelf, and the cuckoo clock started.
All the PDP-10s are up (except 74); I expected to find some down due to disks
powering down.

I am in the TTE 235 class until Friday.  I cam across some interesting info.

SUB HOST ADDRESSING - Allows a user to connect to a particular line or set of
lines on a TYMCOM (async host interface).  Selection is based on two 
characters in the username.  For instance, "TRAINING78", "TRAINING75", and
"TRAININGKL" would allow connection to the 780 host, the 750 host, or the
KL host.

PORT ADDRESSING - Allows a host (or user) to connect to a particular line
on a CONSAT (async terminal interface).  Selection is based on digits after
a period in the host number.  For instance, "JMS:931.19" and "JMS:123.1".
Each addressable line can have many HOST.NUMBER combinations assigned to it.
Any host can seize an addressable port as long as no one else is using it.
These lines can also be used to log in from.

Addressing features must be enabled on a line by line basis in the TYM file.

SUBJ:  Users to validate for LOADII. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following users need to be validated for use of LOADII.  All users
are members of the Tymcom-X Systems unit -- the organization which writes and
maintains the Operating System and utilities for the Tymcom-X hosts.  

      The reason for their use of LOADII is to re-load the node code for the
micro-Tym-Bases in the "micro-network" (currently 5 nodes) which supports the
unit's lab hosts.  These hosts (930, 62 and 95) are used for development and
testing of the Operating System and utilites for Tymcom-X hosts.  The hosts
from which we will need to run LOADII are those on which the micro-Tym-base
code is developed and stored:  39 and 57.  The users are:

       -  C22 swapped with C24 in Bldg. 'C'.
       *  Dependent on SA10 13350 upgrade project in Bldg. 'C'.
 
 6/86  -  Two (2) Augment F3 systems removed from service
 
 7/86  -  Systems C8 and C16 taken out of service.
       *  Requires new Tymvalidate program to be running on a
          PDP10.  Dynatax users will also be required to use
          another electronic mail system.
 
       -  System C11 will be taken out of service per MDSI
          contracts.

       -  C24 to be moved to an available PDP10 in Northern
          California or taken out of service.
 
 
The  Tymnet  and Ontyme groups will need to determine what to  do 
with network and outdial equipment located in  Bldg.  'A'.   Also 
maintenance will be canceled on the 940 hardware on their removal 
date from service;  but all equipment should be left in place and 
declared excess on 12/86.

Subject: XEXEC monitor requirements! 

We need some sort of %KSYS timer... maybe reasonable for TAKEIT to set
and reset this timer instead of doing whatever it does at the moment...
Then when KSYS goes off, TAKEIT kills everything (a la OPSER used to),
then the monitor itself runs a HANGUP job like INITIA/DSKCLN/KMCLOD at
the moment.  This way, the monitor doesn't have to do a while lot, and
we have a "clean" way of taking the system down... (and for BATCH to
know when to stop scheduleing jobs).

To:      ISG LISTS LEVEL A-E

Subject: CLOSE OF THE ISG ST. LOUIS CLIENT SUPPORT CENTER



1.  The MDIPC St. Louis Client Support Center is in the process of 
    being dissolved in order to reduce costs due to current ISG 
    business conditions.  This will necessitate the integration of 
    several services into MDIPC Production Services, and also 
    means some functions will no longer be offered by MDIPC.  This 
    transition will occur during the next 45 days.

2.  The following items will be integrated into MDIPC Production 
    Services:

    o    Validation of Logon ID's for the St. Louis Center 
         mainframes.  These include TSO, JES, VM, Cyber, ONTYME 
         for MDIPC personnel, and ACF2 validations.

    o    Online messages to users, and Service Bulletins to ISG 
         personnel only.  ISG Business Units will be responsible 
         for informing their clients of significant service 
         changes.

    o    Dispatching of calls regarding MDIPC services to 
         appropriate functional areas for action.

3.  Functions no longer supported by MDIPC are:

    o    Call logging on the Information/Management data base, and 
         feedback reporting via the "Close to the Customer" 
         report.

    o    "Level 1" consulting will no longer be provided.  Calls 
         will be dispatched directly to "Level 2" areas.  Calls 
         regarding application product use or malfunction will be 
         dispatched to the appropriate Business Unit.  Calls 
         regarding network or operational problems will be 
         forwarded to the appropriate MDIPC area.

    o    Maintenance and publication of ISG user documentation and 
         manuals which describe the use of processing services.

    o    Maintenance of mailing lists of commercial clients.


    o    Publishing of MDIPC Service Descriptions.

    o    Vendor manual's purchasing and distribution, e.g. IBM, 
         DEC, CDC.

    o    Service Level Tracking report publication.

4.  Some of the functions which will no longer be performed by 
    MDIPC may be considered essential to a particular ISG Business 
    Unit.  In these cases the Business Unit should begin planning 
    to meet the requirements.  MDIPC will cooperate and assist in 
    any transition activities that are necessary.

5.  Telephone call dispatching and published telephone numbers 
    will continue to be staffed.  They are:

    o    1-800-325-1761 is the Host Monitoring Area (HMA).  This 
         is the number to call for terminal problems and for 
         cancelling or re-initiating terminal sessions.

    o    1-800-325-8953 Remote Monitoring Area (RMA).  This number 
         should be called for remote job entry host connections.

    o    1-314-232-8818 Production Management Area.  This number 
         is available for batch job status inquiries and priority 
         asssitance.

    o    1-800-MDC-HELP (1-800-632-4357) or 1-314-232-6943, in 
         Missouri are numbers that may be called when you do not 
         know who to call.  You will be connected with an 
         appropriate MDIPC area to resolve any processing 
         problems.

    Any changes in contact points for MDIPC services will be 
    coordinated in advance with the appropriate ISG Business 
    Units.

As the final step in the division of responsibilities and personnel 
between the Diversified Controller's and ISG Group Controller's 
organizations, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Jerry L. 
Welsh as head of Commercial Contracts Administration for the 
Diversified Controller.

With MDC since 1972, Jerry originally was involved with governmental 
contracting for McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company and in 1976 
joined the McAuto Commercial Contracts group.  Subsequently he has 
held a series of positions of increasing responsibility within that 
organization and is well prepared to now assume a leadership role in 
the Diversified Controller's organization coordinating contractual 
activities in support of several Business Units - predominately 
Diversified Information Systems Company.

Jerry replaces Richard G. Hatz who, along with James G. McDaniel, 
will form the Contracts policy and coordination section of the ISG 
Group Controller's organization.

In addition to his existing contract development and negotiating 
team, Jerry will also have the Diversified contracts administrative 
groups in St. Louis and Vienna, Virginia reporting to him.

Please join me in wishing Jerry success in his new assignment.

	  was caused by null-job or non-zero LDC.. Added PFLNUL in
	  patch area & system crashed at PFLNUL a while later...

Solution: Still unknown, Steve Atwell in Dallas maintenance tried
	  swapping various boards, the latest were E/UBR and address
	  decoders and after the PFLNUL crash the diagnostics finally
	showed a positive fault in the PI clock interrupt and they
	took over to run diagnostics about 18:00.  Will call me at
	home if it starts crashing again after fixing the problem.
	They feel it is definately HW but wanted help in pin-pointing
	the problem.  (they had replaced all of the pager boards and
	the problem still wouldn't go away).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On 7 April, System 74 was scheduled down from 0030 until 0600 for 
PM and a packcopy of pack 740009 (BPA12), disk drive C2.  FSC,
according to the system logbook, had the system from 0030 until 0405.
At this time it was returned to Operations for the packcopy.  Packcopy
was not started until 0444.  Why did it take 39 minutes to get a
scratch pack out of the pack cabinet and mounted on system 74?
Packs should have been already off-line and the supervisor should of
had a pack available hours before for the Operator to use.

Packcopy was loaded by tape using FTALOD.  From this step on everything
was performed correctly until they got to giving the NEW DESTINATION
pack the correct ID.  Instead of using the command NEW as stated in the
document, they used the command INIT and OVERWROTE the home blocks.
My understanding that when this is done, it changes the pointers and this
pack/unit is no longer recognized by the system when brought up.  This
is where the problem started.  Instead of answering YES to this message,
a NO response should have been given and then the NEW command reissued.
Then too, if those involved, did not fully understand what this command
(INIT) meant they should have called. 

From here on, the packcopy was continued and completed.  After the 
                                                                Page  2

packcopy, they proceeded in bringing the system up.  After all drives
reported being off-line that were supposed to be off-line, a warning message
"LOGICAL UNIT 9 MISSING FROM STR DSKB" printed out.

Ignoring this warning, they continued to bring the system up.  At this
time, the damaged was uncorrectable and everything else that was done
was fruitless.  Lenny and I both suspected that the HARDWARE was at fault.
After spending many hours checking out the hardware and proving that it was
okay, it was decided that something else was wrong.  This is when I got
TYMCOM-10 software support involved.  They came over and went through all
HARDCOPY and  located the  problem.  They were able to fix this problem,
but many more showed up after trying to bring the system up.

I was on the phone with SOFTWARE SUPPORT throughout the rest of swingshift
clearing up these problems.  After copying the pack out once more and clearing
up other errors the system finally came up at 2158 with only two files
reporting as losing data.  One of the two files was restored - the USER
was notified about the other one as it was an accounting file.

TOTAL TIME LOST DUE TO OPERATOR ERROR:  15 hours 58 minutes.



OTHER PROBLEMS
--------------

Monitor tapes not done correctly.  All monitor tapes are to be checked by
swingshift on 9 April and new ones made.  Both SYSTEM.SAV and BACKUP.SAV tapes
will be checked and redone if needed.

Too many disk drives not useable.  Two had red hats on them after getting
system back and drive D1 has a compatability problem.  I used drive A4
for the last packcopy not knowing for sure it the drive was any good.
Fortunately it was okay.

ITEM OF INTEREST
----------------

COLLECTOR.  While in Cupertino yesterday, I had a talk with Nancy
Burriesci and she will submit to me new procedures for us on this.
As soon as I get them, they will be passed on to all concerned.

                                                 April 8, 1986


A message from Bob Fischer to all ISG employees. . .


     Over the past month or so, we have been taking dramatic new 
measures to ensure that ISG meets its 1986 earnings objective.  In 
this message I hope to give you a better idea of what we're doing 
and why.

     Before I go any further, though, I need to make one thing 
clear: By now you probably know that the actions we're taking 
include reductions in ISG's workforce.  I'm not at all happy about 
that, but, for reasons I'll explain in a moment, we've had to cut 
our costs significantly.  Because such a large percentage of our 
total cost is people, force reductions were something we simply 
could not avoid.  I know there is nothing I can say that will be of 
much help to the people affected by these reductions, but I assure 
you we're doing everything we can to help those people find new 
positions elsewhere in MDC or with other companies.

     With that said, let me try to clear up some of the 
misunderstanding caused by the sweeping actions being taken to cut 
costs within ISG.  These actions, most of which are being carried 
out on an individual business unit basis, are designed to give ISG 
a reasonable chance to achieve its earnings objectives in the first 
two quarters as well as for the year.

     Behind these actions is the fact that MDC's top management is 
understandably concerned about ISG's 1985 results.  Rather than 
spend time discussing this here, I want to refer you to the 
newly-published MDC Annual Report.  (A copy will soon be delivered 
to your home if it hasn't been already.)  The ISG section of the 
report, together with Sandy and John McDonnell's discussion of ISG 
in their introductory message to shareholders, does a good job of 
putting our 1985 results into perspective.

     What you need to know here is that MDC is watching our first- 
and second-quarter performance very closely for evidence that we 
have turned things around.  When the ISG Management Committee met 
in February, those first two quarters looked pretty shaky.  (The 
members of this committee, in addition to myself, are: Mike Becker, 
Staff Vice President-Human Resources; Otis Brinkley, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company; Rich Calvert, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information Systems 
Company; Jerry Causley, President-McDonnell Douglas Information 
Systems International; John Clancy, President-McDonnell Douglas 
Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Company; Jim Donovan, 

Page 2



Vice President-Marketing and Planning; Leo Mirowitz, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Health Systems Company; Warren Prince, 
President-McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Company; and 
Paul Wiedenmann, Corporate Vice President-Finance.)  Based on the 
business unit forecasts available at the time, we recognized that 
ISG was not on track to meet its operating plan objectives in the 
first two quarters.  Our performance in January and February has 
shown that our concern was justified.  For the first two months of 
1986, our sales and performance earnings were both behind plan.

     While the Management Committee agreed that a permanent 
solution to our problems will only come from selling more and 
getting higher margins, we decided that the need to stay on plan in 
the short term demanded that we take bold steps to get our 
performance on track.  We realized there is a limit to how many 
times we can do major costs cuts. We concluded, therefore, that we 
needed to cut enough costs out of the business now to give us a 
high probability of making our first-half and annual plans, even if 
revenue grows at the moderate rate experienced in January and 
February as compared to the more aggressive plan rate.

     Here's how we proceeded: Each business unit identified the 
amount of cost reduction it would need in order to be confident of 
making its own operating plan.  As a group, we then examined every 
alternative we could think of, not only for business unit cuts, but 
also for ISG-wide actions, Group-level cuts, reorganizations, and 
elimination of activities.  From that list, we collectively decided 
on how to achieve the level of savings we need.

     That's a brief look at why we're involved in this round of 
cost cuts and at how we determined where and how much to cut.  Now 
I want to describe some of the actions we're in the process of 
implementing.

     There are four ISG-wide actions.  First, we have suspended all 
merit increases within ISG until the Group is on a much firmer 
financial footing.  The increases will be reinstated only after ISG 
is virtually assured of making its 1986 earnings objective, and 
also after I'm satisfied all business units have taken the 
necessary steps to ensure they are on target to make their 
individual 1986 plans.  At that time, we'll develop a merit program 
that takes into account the fact that some employees have been 
disadvantaged more than others by the timing of this suspension.

     Second, we have suspended Management and Professional 
Development classes for ISG managers.  We have, however, kept the 
organization intact and we're continuing to conduct MDAIS training 
sessions, for which we are reimbursed.  We'll reinstate ISG classes 
as soon as possible.

     Third, we are rethinking the ISG Employee Savings Plan. We're 
looking for ways to tie company matching contributions to ISG 
business performance.  No action has been taken at this time, but 
we'll keep you informed.

Page 3



     Our fourth ISG-wide action is a reduction of about 10 percent 
in the number of ISG senior managers.  Past force reductions at all 
levels and the reorganization of the former McAuto, Microdata and 
Tymshare left us with a management team that was just too big for 
our present size.  We had to reduce the number of managers to get 
our organizations into somewhat better balance.  Middle managers 
have also been affected by force reductions, though these have been 
carried out at the individual business unit level.

     We've also taken action to reduce the size of our group staff, 
both management and professional, by more than 25 percent.  These 
cuts include the elimination of many worthwhile activities that we 
may restore at some point.  For now, though, we just couldn't 
afford to keep them.

     We've also moved to narrow our range of business activities 
and consolidate organizations for more efficient operation.  For 
example, you may have read in the ISG Spirit or elsewhere about the 
dissolution of McDonnell Douglas Distribution Systems Company and 
the restructuring of McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company.

     All other actions -- about two-thirds of the total -- are 
being taken within individual business units.  These actions vary 
based on what the business units felt they needed to do to achieve 
their objectives.  Along with making their own decisions about 
where to cut costs, the business units are implementing the cuts in 
their own ways and on their own schedules.

     As a result of this decentralized approach, it's hard to see 
the whole picture right now.  Also, the actions being taken aren't 
over with as quickly as if everything were done at once.  But it 
was the Management Committee's feeling that these actions can be 
more intelligently implemented in this way than by taking the 
all-at-once approach we used in the third quarter of last year.

     I can't give you a detailed rundown of all the business units' 
activities, since many of them are still in progress.  But I am 
putting the word out to your business unit management to 
overcommunicate with your organization when the steps being taken 
within your business unit have been completed.

     I know it's been difficult to function in the uncertain 
climate that has resulted from our recent actions.  And I'm afraid 
that in some organizations that uncertainty will last a while 
longer.  But again, I expect your business unit management to 
report to you on what's been done as soon as all actions are 
complete.  As soon as possible, we need for people to be able to 
stop looking over their shoulders and concentrate fully on the 
business of serving our customers.

     I hope I've cleared up at least some of your questions.  I'll 
answer more specific questions in the April 11 issue of the ISG 
Spirit.  In fact, I'm changing my monthly column to a question and 
answer format so that I can stay in closer touch with the issues 
that concern you the most.  I'll also periodically use messages 
like this one to give you my perspective on the state of ISG.

     That's about it for now.  I know we're going through tough 
times.  But let me tell you something: I believe that our business 
reached its low point on September 30, 1985.  As painful as things 
are now, I believe that on June 30, 1986 -- and for that matter, on 
December 31, 1986 -- we'll look back and see that we've done what 
needed to be done to get ourselves on track.  In the meantime, I'll 
keep you posted.

Sincerely,
