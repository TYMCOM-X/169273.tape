Is unknown what caused the TTYZNE, but ZNE means Zapper Not Echoed; the base
tried to re-use a port that was in the process of being zapped.  The engine
then took a Dispatcher crash in slot 1, which caused stopcode BASE to be
output.  The PDP-10 realized that the base was down, and got TTYFLM while
trying to detach all zapped circuits.  The noname stopcode SCNSER+6145 is
a side effect if TTYFLM - Free List Messed-up.

In summary, F38 went down as a result of a Dispatcher crash in its base.
Paul Krumviede says we are unable to determine the cause of
the crash because there is no dump of the dispatcher rings.
