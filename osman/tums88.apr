Attention ALL Operators!!!!!!!!!!!

Software Support has modified the PSPPDP software to have the
BEEPER sound off when a system is down.  At this time it is only on this
host.

The way it works is after the PSP has completed listing out it will BEEP
for about 10-15 seconds and will stop running.  The BEEP will repeat
every 60 seconds until something is done.

When you hear this BEEPER, you must check to see what system is down.
If it is a system that you know is not scheduled down, you have to
check that system.  If it is a system that you know is scheduled
down, then press the RETURN key ONCE to start the 20 minute wait;
TWICE to run IMMEDIATELY.

Once you are aware of a system down, and something is being done, press
the RETURN key as mentioned above.

The BEEPER will sound until the System has returned to TIMESHARING.

                                                                Page  2

Subject   : F74 another problem    
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Rick,
     
Now, we have another problem on F74 (or the Base for F74).  
     
Our customers have sent files on to F74's KANA files by BIONIK, I will mentione 
about the BIONIK below, and the sent files had a problem.   
     
Some portion of the files, 8chars or 12 chars string, was replaced  as
unexpected same length string.
     
1. The characters which were replaced seemed to be by some Word unit. 
   (In KANA file,a word is 4 chars.)    
     
2. BIONIK is modified version for KANA file creation of BIONIC, and was    
   generated by ex-Tymshare person for NIS, ex-KTL. The program is located 
   on (UPLKT:74).   
     
3. About the timing of the problem, following 4 cases are reported.   
     
        In JST 
     
        '87  Dec  21st  morning    
                  21st  evening    
                  24th  morning    
        '88  Jan  06th  evening    
     
4. In those cases, the customers had made an access to F74 through 2 or 3  
   kind of HSA slot in Japan. 
     
5. We also know some unstable condition about I/O to F74 from the end of the    
   last year to the begin of this year. 
     
6. We have changed nothing in past one month, about BIONIK, HSA slot, etc. 
     
     
Regarding above matters, even though we have no explicit evidence, sorry,  
I suppose there might be some problems about I/O for F74 (or Base ?). 
And about the problem, the customers are very frustrated on our F74 system.
     
So please check and advise me on it, or please pass this letter to appropriate  
person. (Who is responsible about F74's system program now ?)    
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ken-san,  
     
How do you doing ?  
I heard you come to nis on Jan. 18. I look forward to meeting you again    
in Japan. 
By the way, I think you read Mr. Ogura's ontyme ( msg# M40201 dated 07
Jan. 88 ).
Now, I have serious problem of katakana version "BIONIK" which is
described in his ontyme. 
Our clients asked to us many complain about this matter.    
However, I have no evidence which I can supply you now.
But, I think I like to get the evidence as soon as possible.
Then, when I get the evidence, I don't know the right person which I contact.   
     
Please let me know the name of persons and his ontyme-id.   
     
In my old memory, Carl Baltrunas and Dennis Cofley were responsibilty 
for PDP system. Are they still be responsible ?   
     
See again in Tokyo. 
Best regards.  
Kamoi

Ken,
  Without more details of what data was substituted, we cannot reasonably
determine the exact nature of the problem that NIS was experiencing with
regards to their point 1, (modified or substituted characters in units of
a word).

  However, what is known is that on December 22nd, there was a problem on
system 74 with the SA-10 (the interface between the PDP-10 I/O buss and the
disk and tape drives).  My understanding is that system 74 was taken down
at 7am PST and brought up on the spare KL-10 CPU in the Fremont data center
by 11am PST.  The spare cpu worked fine, however the base hardware connected
to this cpu has a known problem with BLOCK-IO (which affects TELECOPY, BIONIC,
BIONIK and others).

  When the SA-10 on system 74 was fixed, the system came back up on it's
proper hardware at midnight (PST) of the 22nd and the problems that NIS was
having went away.

  On December 31st, more spurious disk problems were reported, and again the
SA-10 was suspect.  So system 74 was again brought up on the spare cpu at 9:45
PST with the "broken" base.  As of this message, system 74 is still running on
the spare cpu.  It is scheduled to return to it's own hardware on the 15th of
January.

  On January 3rd NIS again reported problems with BIONIK to operations and I
was called in to look at them.  I determined that the problem appeared to be
related to BLOCK-IO since all other network I/O appeared to behave correctly.
I asked operations to reload the base, so that we could rule out corrupted
base code.  They had reloaded the system a couple of hours earlier to try to
fix the problem.  The problem didn't change and I looked at the base with
probe and found that F74 was on the spare cpu and there was a good probablility
that it was connected to the "broken" base hardware.  I had operations call in
maintenance and swap the base hardware.  This was done in the early a.m. on
January 4th.  When the system came up, we tested BIONIC and TELECOPY and the
problems appeared to be solved.

  As regards to the "broken" base that is referred to above.  We use the spare
cpu and it's base as our working test system for software support.  From time
to time we have experienced problems with BLOCK-IO due to an intermittant
hardware problem.  I believe it was an oversight that when F74 was moved to
the space cpu, the base hardware was not immediately swapped with a known good
base.  Once the problem was identified as the base, the "broken" base was
swapped out and I do not expect that NIS will encounter any more problems due
to the base.

Ken, please check with Rick Daniels to verify that no other changes were made
to the hardware configuration than those mentioned above (before responding
to NIS).  If their problems occurred during the times specified above, even
thought they may not have been detected until a later date, then we have
pin-pointed the cause of their problems.  If not, we need to try to reproduce
their problems before we can try to fix them.

Rick, the times for the hardware swaps came from the system log book and the
center log book.  We didn't see any additional reports of problems or hardware
swaps.  Please verify that there were no additional changes.   Thanks!

Rick, we need to be aware that whenever we swap cpu's in the future, that we
do not swap to the "broken" base hardware, until we know it has been fixed.

Ken,
  As for software support for the PDP-10s, our group still exists.  We are now
only 3: Carl Baltrunas, x6206;  Osman Guven, x6236; and Joe Smith, x6220.  Our
manager is Craig Fletcher, x6213.  Best way to reach us is via the secretary
at x6224 and that is the published number to call for software support.  Again
we do not usually deal with customers directly... they should call operations
at their local data center or their customer representative.  There is a group
in IPC or RCS in St. Louis which is supposed to support customers directly.
The contact name I have is Sheldon Rundell.  I don't have his number handy.

/Carl

PS.  About BIONIK... my understanding is that it is a version of the "old"
     BIONIC program before the modifications that I made 2 years ago when
     the new HSA code was put in place.  I really would prefer that NIS
     move their applications (I realize that many of their command sequences
     are burned into ROMs and cannot be changed) by having all new applications
     use the new (SYS) BIONIC program.  It has a KATAKANA command which then
     allows it to do the job that BIONIK was modified to do.  The default is
     ASCII.  We could modify BIONIC to immediatly use KATAKANA mode if the
     user's terminal is in set to KATAKANA, as most of the japanese customers
     are.  I just don't like having multiple versions of programs around to
     be supported when one version can do the job.

Subject: Summary 

Ken,
  I realize that I may not have been clear in summarizing what I said in the
previous memo.

  Basically, if the problems reported by NIS occurred entirely during the
periods when the "broken" base was known to be connected to the spare cpu
while system F74 was running on the spare cpu, then the problems are all
explained by the faulty base hardware.

  If they have other problems and we can reproduce them, we will try to
solve them as they provide sufficient information about reproducing them,
or when they occurred.

  We have seen some BLOCK-IO problems that are similar to those described
in the earlier mail messages, but those were pretty well fixed in recent
(within the last year) changes to the base code or the interface between the
base and TYMCOM-X.  If the character substitution problem continues to occur
we want to be able to reproduce it.

There is a hard read error on DSKB15(BPA16) page 3.  Since this page is the 15th
duplicate copy of BOOTS, the error does not affect the system.  However, it
does cause an "HRE" indications on (SYS)HOME.SYS and can only be corrected by
copying out the pack and manually resetting the HRE bit in the UFD.

I suggest running PAKCOPY at the next scheduled downtime.    /Joe

     Carl, yet another Ontyme sent by NIS Japan.  I note it was sent to
     your FSC ontyme name so I'm forwarding to your TXS name.
 
     Please let me know if the additional data gives you adequate infor-
     mation to follow up further on problem.  Also, do let me know if
     additional specific information is required by you, in order to fol-
     low up on this topic.
 
     I plan to alter your memo of yesterday and send to Japan; primarily
     so they are aware that problem has been, and is being, checked out;
     also to obtain a clarification on the dates of problem.
 
     I'll remove any sections which should not be seen by them and suggest
     that problems of this type be reported to Rick Daniels and myself,
     and that we'll follow up with you as needed (also that Dennis no lon-
     ger works in the Tymcom X group).
 
     Look forward to your comments.  Regards. Ken

Subject   : F74 PROBLEM  
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Carl and Dennis,    
     
At first, I'm sorry I'm not sure that you are the right person to be contacted  
on such problem. However, in my old memory, you have been the responsible  
persons for PDP-X system software. 
     
The problem on F74 reported during the middle of the last Dec and today, by
many users.    
     
And the problem is becoming very critical.   
     
So please check and advise me, or please pass this letter to appropriate person 
and let me know the name of the responsible person.    
     
The problem is 
     
        When users sent files onto F74 by BIONIC or BIONIK, the modified BIONIC 
        for KANA file input written by ex-Tymshare, they found that some   
        characters (8-12 char string) was replaced as other string.   
     
        For your checking, I located one of the troubled files onto (OGURA:74)  
        CHKDAT.NIS. (The original file in user area is (HAL:74)RHAMK2.020.)
        In that file, you can find a string "WW@@ZZ Z" at 15th column of the    
        307th record. But the original string for the 8 chars is ";  YVWYS",    
        and also we can find the "WW@@ZZ Z" at the 302nd rec in the file.  
        So I guess the 8 char string of 307th rec is overwritten by the 8 char  
        string of 302nd rec.  
     
        Anyway, our users found that the sent files on F74 were different from  
        the original files on their terminals.    
     
        The users tried to send the files through HSA in Japan. And regarding   
        the HSA, no Tymcom-370 user, who access to the host through the HSA
        slot, report such kind of problem.   
     
Thanks and regards, 
Makoto    
     
P.S. I also find some strange matter on creation date in dir information   
     of (OGURA:74)M28250.OTM. Year 1999 was indicated for the creation!!   
     I feel there is something wrong in the current F74.

Ken san,  
     
Thanks for your OnTyme regarding the matter. 
     
I understood what was happened on F74 after the last December. And it explained 
about the status on 22nd Dec 87.   
     
However, one of our user reported the problem on the file which were sent onto  
F74 at 09-Jan-88 JST. ... This is just the case which I mentioned in my last    
OnTyme.   
Also Mr.Nakano made a test file and found the problem at about 15:30 12-Jan-88  
JST by BIONIK with the test file after some trials.    
     
So I think there is still the problem on the current F74.   
     
However, we will wait and coduct the test with the test file on 16t Jan after   
the hardwere return on 15th Jan. Fotunately, 15th Jan is a national holiday in  
Japan. So we, NIS and the customers, have only 1 bussines day by the hardwere   
returning.
     
About the hardwere returnning, please let me know the scheduled time, what time 
on 15th Jan PST, and please notify the time when the returnning take place.
By that information, we may identify the cause of the problem.   
     
Regarding the BIONIK, what Carl mentioned was just correct. In near future,
no user will use the BIONIK.  
     
Best regards,  
Makoto    
P.S. See you in Tokyo the next week !!

I put the TUMS.DOC in your directory on D35.  Yes, TUMS can deliver

help you on that. If you need to, I could help you set thing up for

Subject: Block I/O problem 

Joe,
  In memory of my previous patch to track down a similar problem with
block i/o, I think it would be a wise idea to install a similar check
in the monitor to verify that the base did indeed write a full/partial
block-i/o buffer and if the base skips a word somehow, do one or more
of the following:
	Issue a black-ball received on port (data lost)
	Issue a new messge type to the base to retransmit the block-i/o buffer
	Error return to the user, cause is data lossage?

I think that there should be some handshake to tell the base that we did NOT
receive the buffer when it sends a message in the ring saying it is done
writing a block-i/o buffer.

Subject: Chinese lunch on 1st Street. Fri 1/22. 

Next week Mary Coppernoll's annual birthday reckoning is due, and her immediate
(D23) work group will be treating her to lunch at the House of Cathay, 1339 N 
1st.  Anyone else on D2 is invited to just come along and buy a single share of
this Chinese lunch.

We'd like to start lunch sometime between than 11:30 and noon, because some of 
us have an interest in attending a 1:30 presentation that afternoon at the 
Apple 4-Phase auditorium on "Hypertext Publishing and the Evolution of 
Knowledge".

ThThe beeper went off quite a few times while Ed Hall was trying to put in
the digits... I guess the 4th or 5th time in rapid succession he got through.

Date: 16-Jan-88 8:40ish, Contact Ed Hall, 206 697 6402.
      Actual contact, Danny King @home 713 721 4101, for system 370.
      Yes, this is Fayez sarofim...

Problem: Support in diagnosing the hardware problems, cause of system crashes
      over the past month.  FE would like some assistance.

History: Looked at the crashes on disk, CRA004-CRA008, CRA011-CRA014, CRA015.
      All but CRA015 were of the same type; in FILIO, DTASAT+4 had received
      an i/o interrupt for the disk, the PGYIO table says no i/o in progress
      so crash!

      CRA004-CRA007 were on RMA0, CRA008,CRA011,CRA012 were on RMA1, and
      CRA012-CRA014 were on RMA0.  (Danny says they had Fayez swap drives
      for a time).  CRA015 looks like a shutdown... SYSCRS/ NOCRS.

      I looked a little deeper, and tracked the CONO/DATAI info to see if
      there were any common patterns and relayed the info to Danny.  Spent
      a little over 2 hours.

Follow up:  We can look on Monday to see if there is anything else we can
      give to Danny, otherwise, hope the info already given was enough for
      him to track down the problem.

To:      Kuni Kamoi

From:    Carl Baltrunas (TXS.C/Baltrunas)

Mr. Kamoi,
  As mentioned in your ONTYME regarding your test data... Could you please
up-load to the TYMCOM-X system the data multiple times, each time putting
the data into files with different filenames (such as TEST1, TEST2, etc.)
and send to me a copy of the results, so that I may examine the data files
directly.

  If you need more disk space temporarily, contact me or Jan Krivanec.

  I would also like you to try up-loading the data using the (SYS)BIONIC
program with the "KATAKANA" command.

    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....


    -R BIONIC                     << - normal ASCII mode
    *KATAKANA                     << - change to KATAKANA mode
    *RUN
    FILE NAME: ....

  I do not suspect that the problem is with your version of the BIONIK
program, but I wish to eliminate that possibility from my thoughts.  If
you can provide incorrect data transferred with BIONIK "and" incorrect
data transferred with (SYS)BIONIC using the KATAKANA command it may help.

  I am looking for a pattern for how the data corruption is occurring
during the data transfers and I need to be able to compare one copy of
the test data (which is known to be correct) against all copies of the
test data which transfer incorrectly.  Please make one file to keep on
disk that transfers correctly, and as many files containing bad transfer
data as you think reasonable.  The more data I can compare, the better
I will be able to find a pattern.  Please send an ONTYME with the file
names and any additional information you wish to send.

  It is 4:45 am PST now.  If you can send this information in the next 4

Notice this is NOT a 4-pack system...

  I know, I was working on X32 on Friday when it was taken down... I created
a few more files than exist on this system... but only a few... and nothing
that cannot be reproduced... so, if I was the only one that lost, let's not
worry about it.

  I would like to recount my experience with logging into X32 at the time
it was being taken down...  please remind me.

Oh yes,
  there were some files that didn't have enough license on SYS on this
particular system... I fixed up XEXEC, EXECX, SUBMIT and OPER.  I would
not have noticed anything except OPER said no-password-file instead of
saying it didn't have proper license itself...  I ran CTYLOG and that
told me XEXEC died.  {sigh}

  we need a little bit of training for FSC in the data centers, so they
don't do to a live system what they've done to the test systems.

I noticed that at 5pm on Friday, user RICHARDSON was logged in running TITO.
Were you doing a "STORE ALL CHANGED" just before the system went down?
Please save the hardcopy from the TITO restore.  We need to look at all the
"FILE NOT GIVEN LICENSE" messages to track down which files were not
restored properly.   /Joe

O.:

  I just looked at one of these (SPOOL:*)SPLLOG.mmm files.  (I must admit:  I
had not looked at any of them before now.)  They are, as the name implies, a
log of work done to SPOOL (if the work was done with SPFIX or SPLFIX).  I am
not certain, but I believe that any work done, with any of the SPFIX or SPLFIX
commands, is logged to the file.  You had better check that out.

  Each log entry is appended to the existing contents of the log file.  It
might make the logs "cleaner" if the old stuff were deleted, but it's probably
not worth the effort.

Re: Study of test files

Makoto,
  I have looked at the test data files on (OHTA:74)  including the new files
produced 18-Jan-88.   I have not found any particular pattern as of this
message.   I will check the logic in the BIONIC program to see how it counts
characters and records to determine if additional bytes of data are inserted
when a carriage-return or line-feed is encountered.  I do not expect any
suprises, but I cannot detect any reason why this problem can be happenning
at this time.   Both the hardware and software appear to be reliable... but
as we can see, the data is corrupted.

  Please notice that I moved the test data from (OHTA:74) to (TXSINFO:74)
because there was room for only 300 more pages in directory OHTA.  I also
copied file JAN.XT and created a file JAN.CAB which is the correct data
from JAN.XT, only in ASCII.  [I have a program which will do that very
easily, in case you have a need for someone to read a KATAKANA file on an
ASCII device, I will tell you where it is and how it works.]

------------------------

Re:  Additional tests.

  I would like you to perform two additional tests at this time.  First,
we want you to up-load the same test data that you have used on system
74 to another system.  I believe you are valid on systems 34 or 35.  If
you could make this test, we could rule out the CPU/Base hardware.

  The second test, will be to re-run the test data again on system 74
after we have put some diagnostic patches into system 74's operating
system.  If both of these tests fail, we will have to try to use the
same hardware, only change the load that is running on the system at the
time of failure.

  One last item...  how many times did you run the test in the past few
days and how many times was the data transferred successfully (if at all)
and how many times unsuccessfully.

  What hours of your working schedule overlap with pacific standard time?
It may be better if I re-arrange my schdule for a few days so that we can
overlap and work on this problem at the same time.

Subject: HSA question... 


Osman,
  I expect to be in by noon.  If you get a chance, could you contact Linda
Maurer at x6261 and ask her who is responsible for HSA at the moment, in
NTD and (if she knows) TYMNET.

  Also, does she know if the HSA converts the EBCDIC data records which
come in as <data-record><irg> etc, into...
           <data-record><cr>  etc  or
           <data-record><cr><lf> etc.

I ask, so that we can determine if the 132 characters records from Japan
are being converted by HSA-BBXS into 133 ascii characters or 134 characters.
That will tell us how they are packed in the block-io buffers.

You may also hint that, we may need some of their assistance in tracking
down this problem (assuming that it is not a hardware problem).

re: Additional testing on F74

------------------------------

Matoko,
  I would like you to please continue to run the tests again on system
D34 in Dallas.  Since the problem is spurious, it is possible that the
conditions were not right for the error to occur on D34.

  We have also reloaded F74 today with my patch to gather information
about a possible cause of the problem.  Please re-run the tests again
on system F74 today and let me know the results.

  I will be working and observing the system from time to time during
your working hours today.  So, messages can be sent and returned on
the same day.  I will check my mail messages every 2 hours today.

  Thank you again for your assistance in tracking down this problem.

Re: Testing of F74 problem

As of this message, we have not seen a reported instance of the situation
we are expecting to occur with our diagnostic patch.  Please continue to run
tests on system F74.

You do not need to run any more tests on D34 unless we find an error on F74.
We do not expect the information gathering patch to solve the problem and
now we must wait until we have a data transfer failure on F74.

Makoto,
  At this point, I would like you to continue testing, only on F74.  My
trap appears to have caught something two times, indicating that the
condition that I thought might happen has occurred.  I have made a fast
revision to the trap and need to verify the repeatability.

  As you say the problem has not occurred, and my trap caught two times,
I believe that someone else (not your test) caught an error.  I am stopping
at the data center to review the trap output and will report to you the
results before tomorrow.

  Please continue testing on F74, so that I may gather more data.  Thank
you again for your help in tracking this problem.

This is the latest info on our connections to TYMNET, as of 25-Jan-88.
Node 6657 (X17's base) is connected to line 6 of node 5416 and to line 5 of
node 5561.  Node 6760 (X14's base) is connected to line 7 of node 5416 and
to line 6 of node 5561.  All 4 lines are at 4800 baud because the bases keep
crashing if one or more lines run at 9600 baud.  

The BND files are stored on X14, X17, X32, and F33.  If it is necessary to
load the bases from TYMNET, log in to system 33 and give LOADII on of the
following:
	L,5416,3732,6,(NEW11)ND6657.BND

Makoto,
  At this point, I do not expect that your testing will uncover anything
more.  I suggest that we stop the testing until the problem occurs again.
My trap has uncovered a potential problem with information passed from the
PDP-10 Base to the host with the wrong byte count.  I believe that it may
be caused when the base is overloaded.  I have attempted to overload the
base a few times since last week to trap the condition and we have trapped
three (3) times for certain, and numerous other times we suspect but are
not certain.

  I will leave the current trap in system F74 until we decide that a fix
has been found for the problem.  I will have resources verify which other
hosts use BIONIC or BIONIK and will install the trap on those systems as
well.  I believe that the problem we are seeing is not limited to system
F74, and may occur when the base is overloaded and some other conditions
exist at the same time.  At present, we cannot reliably re-create the
problem.

  As for your customers... if they report a problem, please see if they
can keep the erroneous data long enough to compare with a re-transmission
so that we can check our trap.  Their good data should be replaced with
a multiple of four (4) bytes of the ascii character "U" (octal 125, hex 55).
This same value will be found both in ascii text and ktakana text files
due to the nature of how block-io input is stored in memory.

  Thank you again for all the testing that you have done.  I will send
you a copy of the "suspicious" traps with username, program and times that
we saw a possible transmission failure.

Subject: Sun unix mail. 

Hi:

  I'm trying this stuff out, on the Sun host.  Soley wrote TUMS to resemble
the unix mail utility, so I'm checking it out.  I'm also, when I can find 
the time, learning the unix Emacs we have.  I've found a way to get stuff
from B39 printed with a laser printer on this floor.  Bill has written a
unix-like PDP-10 utility for B39 ("lpr") which copies the file to the Sun,
has the Sun send it to the laser printer and then delete it.  the name is 
unix-like and the syntax is unix-like: switch is delimited with "-" (only
1 switch value:  default format is landscape, "-op" makes it portrait),
and the list of file names is delimited with blanks.  You gotta be valid
on a Sun system to use it.

  Enough prattle:  I'm just trying to get familiar with the Sun.


till later,
-D.-

Rick was concerned about not being able to run more than 1 tape at a time
during month-end.  It looks as if the UIL crashes occured only when 2 or
more tapes were being used at the same time.  The culprit was in stopcode
FTACFC (which was added in /B08) left T2 pushed on the stack when it POPJed.
(M33)FTACFC.PAT changes the reference from CPOPJ to T2POPJ and is being
applied to NEWMON and the running monitor on all systems.  /Joe

Subject: BLOCK-IO buffers 

At the moment, BLOCK-IO buffers are gotten right out of freecore along
with everything else that comes out of freecore.  This will make it  very
inconvenient to uncache them, since we would be uncaching whatever else
is interlaced in freecore on the same pages.

A suggestion... in addition to GET4WD, we add a routine which works from
the top of freecore backward (much like the stack and heap on many micros)
looking for space.  This way, only when freecore gets full would we ever
mix cache-able and non-cache-able data structures in freecore.  A second
routine could take a page number determined from the address and re-cache
the page whenever a buffer is released to freecore (only if all bits in
the free-core map say no one else is using that memory page).  Then, always
turn off the cache bit for any pages used for block-io at buffer creation
time.

Block-io buffers are only created when one is needed and no free ones are
available.  Block-io buffers are normally returned to the pool until 2*jobn
buffers exist, then they are returned to freecore as they are released once
more than 2*jobn buffers have been created.  No telling if this limit is
ever crossed in either direction (since not all jobs use block-io and they
would have to get backed up somehow to use more than 2 per job).

(internals: See GETBB and RELBB, page 205 [/N] or /N-fiche #10 D2 & E2).

Subject: Blockio note 

OOPS, my mistake.. I remembered what I read wrong... it's not 2*JOBN for
the number of buffers in the pool.  It keeps up to 2*<biocnt> which is
the number of ports using block-io.  No distinction is made for input or
output.  So, yes, when no one is doing block-io the buffer pool is empty.

Subject: X32 needs to be rebuilt. 

In addition to "CAN'T ACCSS LUD.SYS", one of the SAT pages on DSKB2 got
wiped out.  Which means that when I restored LUD.SYS from tape, it scribbled
on top of 226 pages, wiping out several files.  I did an incremental backup
and showed Ali where the bALL FILES tapes are stored.  X322 will be rebuilt on
3652 disks as soon as the disk controller is fixed.  In the mean time,
system 32 is limping alon on the four 3675P disks.   /Joe

Subject: REFLAG games. 

Setting REFLAG via DDT doesn't work anymore.  It was decided to zero REFLAG 
when leaving ONCE if the disk was not refreshed.  In order to login when there
is file damage (to LOGINN.SAV or LUD.SYS), you have to set REFLAG from KLDCP.
For instance: go in to DDT, type "REFLAG=", bring the system up, and deposit
from KLDCP.  "^X", "DM 23537,1000004", "MC".     /Joe

Subject: P035/D Monitor release .. 
----------------------------------

	This is an announcement of official release of "Monitor Version
P035/D".  Included with this mail is a brief document describing the
significant changes and improvements made to the monitor.

	(SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all PDP-10 systems now have the P035/D
monitor.  This monitor is already tested.  All of Fremont D.C.
PDP-10's have been running with this monitor since December 1, as P035/C10.

	If you need a copy of the Monitor release notes, they are located 
on all of the PDP10s.  They are named as: (OSP)P035D.DOC and (OSP)STOPCD.MEM

	Any questions or comments please call (408)922-6224 and ask for
Carl Baltrunas, Osman Guven or Joe Smith.  Thank you.
(OSP)P035D.DOC - List of changes from P035/C to P035/D.            3-Feb-88
These are the "release notes" for the P035/D monitor.


New messages for the OPR:
  RIBHRE - Hard read error trying to lookup the RIB of a file.
  RIBERR - Software detected error in the RIB of a file.
  REDSAT - Hard read error trying to read a page of the SAT.
  BADSAT - Software detected error in the count of bits in the SAT.
  BADPAG - Hard read or hard write error detected, page gets marked in the BAT.

New UUOs:
  More entries in GETTAB table .GTCNF - see P035D.MEM for details.
  Set KSYS command and UUO give programs warning when the system is
    scheduled to go down.
  Notice-in-Child and inactivity timer added (for XEXEC and SUBMIT jobs).
  SYSDVF function 6 returns named buffers.  (Makes CTYLOG program faster.)
  KS2020 can have up to 8 tape drives defined.  Don't die if no LP20.
  Output event stopcode PTYSBL when a PTY gets a buffer-zap.
  Fixed the problem of "slot out of ports" by no allowing excessive input.
  Monitor edit number stored in GETTAB(70,11) where programs can look at it.
  GETTAB table 130 has date/time job logged in.

Performance enhancements:
  Files are created with contiguous pages if possible.  This speeds up
  sequential access to files (such as TITO saves) and makes BOOTS much
  faster in loading the monitor.

ONCE dialog:
  TYPE BAD will decode the BAT pages and output a list of bad disk pages.
  The date and time must be entered before refreshing the structure.
  The creation date for SAT.SYS and HOME.SYS is the date when refreshed.
  The command to dissolve the structure is spelled correctly (not DISOLVE).
  The front-end file (FEFILE.SYS) on the 2020 is created correctly now.
  TSTSUP commands have been added to allow for patching absolute pages on
    disks.  This disaster recovery procedure has already been used to
    salvage disk problems that would otherwise require a system rebuild.
  A new startup command - NOINITIA - starts DSKCLN but no other part of the
    autorestart procedure.  This was specifically added for TITO rebuilds.

Miscellaneous:
  The date and time defaults from SAT.SYS, so we should never see the
    phony date of 1-JAN-64 ever again.
  The current date/time is now more accurate on KS-2020 systems.
  Stopcode SAXINY has been removed.
  Device errors on 3650 disks are now logged in BAT pages like data errors.
  The EBUS base can be reloaded without reloading the PDP-10.
  Problems with the host/base interface are reported as INFO stopcodes instead
    of DEBUG stopcodes, so that the system will not crash when they occur.

Changes which affect general users:
  The SEND command uses SENDMAIL to send TUMS mail instead of RPG mail.
  The MAIL command now checks for both RPG mail and TUMS mail.

License and privileges:
  The ENABLE and DISABLE commands can set/clear specific licenses.
  A new license has been defined - HR allows home-files read privileges.
  New UUO to allow operators to get all license when doing TITO restore.
  SET AUTOLOGOUT modified to not allow users to disable inactivity timeout.

Hi Rick ..

o  Thanks for catching F26, now (SYS)NEWMON is a /D monitor also.

o  For F74, bring it up with (SYS)NEWMON also.  Carl is working on
   a different patch to put on F74 under /D.

o  Continue to bring B39 with /P-17 for now.  In about a week or two
   we will try to run /D on it also.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The Tymnet Training and Education schedule for the 1st quarter '88
is now available via ontyme  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL

As a result of your feedback after class and the recommendations of the
training advisory task forces we have made some changes in our
courses.

  1.  The length of  TTE 455 Utilities Code Generation has been
      increased to 8 days to provide more time for hands-on labs.

  2.  SmarTym has been added to the TTE 230 Tymnet 3270/CMT/SmarTym
      course and the length has been extended to 8 days.

  3.  The name of TTE 260 has been changed to Async Error Correction, we
      now cover X.PC, Network Server, Menu Server and 2 new
      protocols - MNP & AFT

  4.  The CPU III, MAC III and Nano engine were added to the TTE 330
      TYMNET Hardware Maintenance and Troubleshooting.

  5.  The requirement for either TTE 455 or TTE 445 as a prerequisite 
      for TTE 450 has been revised.

The enrollment procedure remains the same - use  :EXEC *** TTE.ENROLL
In the last quarter we had some students show up who were not on our
roster.  Please be sure to send an enrollment form at least 5 weeks 
before your class.  That way we will be sure we have enough materials
and lab equipment available for you.  You should receive confirmation of
your enrollment within 2 days of your registration.

We look forward to seeing you in class next quarter.  If you have any
questions about the schedule or prerequisite courses, please give us a
call.  Our new phone number is (408) 922-7620


Sincerely,

Robert C. Grandey

I just telecopied 3 files, OPRSUB.SAI, .REQ and .REL from system 33 to
system 32.  I can't look them up with any program that uses .CHUFD because
of the dumb *BUG* that .CHUFD doesn't look at the in-core rib (or maybe
cannot get the in-core page that the rib points to?) anyway, I guess my
UFD expanded a page... sigh.

I can lookup a particular file, can edit it, but cannot get a directory,
or use any of our tools [eg. CPY] to copy the changes back to 33 for safe
keeping.

I think we need to at least fix .CHUFD as part of /E.

Osman,
   Hi. This past Saturday when I was starting to run the weekly
ASP on system D55, I noticed that we were unable to come up in
console mode. When I got to the procedure where the operator types
a ctrl z followed by 'L' to login, I received the following message
on the CTTY 'user invalid on this computer'.
   I tried several variations in the 'reflag'.. command while in
DDT (such as 'reflag! ,1'  'reflag! 1,0'  'reflag! 1,1'  ...etc
but none of them worked (kept receiving the invalid user msg).
( the usual syntax used is 'reflag! ,0' )
   If you could send us the correct PPN to use it would be greatly
appreciated as we usually bring the system up in console mode when
running the ASP backups.
                                       Thanks a lot,
                                        Paul Miller

We forgot the mention in P035D.DOC that "REFLAG" is no longer works.
They don't need reflag to come up in console mode, I will send them
documents showing how could they do it without reflag.

Subject: Console login. 

The message from Paul Miller on 16-Feb stated that the operator had
problems "where the operator types a ctrl z followed by 'L' to login, I
received the following message on the CTY 'user invalid on this computer'.

What exactly did the operator type?  "^ZL" is not sufficient.  To login
in CONSOLE mode, the operator must type:
	Control-Z, "L", "O", "P", "E", "R", Return.
The first character gets the CTY's attention, the "L" signifies a login
request, and "OPER"+Return is the username.

If this procedure does not work, please send us more details.
When properly logged in, an ASP dump does not need to use REFLAG.

     SUBJECT:      Changes in M&PD Staffing and Programs


     It is with both pleasure and regret that I have decided to leave
     McDonnell Douglas, effective February 11, 1988.  I have accepted the
     position of Domestic Training Manager for Seagate Technology, in Scotts
     Valley, California.  

     I am extremely pleased to announce that Kathleen Corcoran, formerly
     Senior Training Specialist in M&PD-San Jose, has been appointed to fill
     my position.  Please join me in congratulating Kathleen on her new
     assignment, which reflects her outstanding accomplishments over the
     last year in a variety of M&PD programs.

     I am also pleased to announce that Becky Spencer has taken the position
     as Department Secretary of M&PD.  Becky was previously an MDC employee
     with Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach.

     Kathleen's former Training Specialist position is currently available.
     Interested candidates should contact Kathleen at (408)922-7651.

     Questions about M&PD programs and services can be directed as follows:

         Kathleen Corcoran (408)922-7651 -- Questions on program content of
         M&PD programs.

         Becky Spencer (408)922-7653 -- Questions on enrollment in M&PD
         programs; borrowing films and tapes; ordering Ethical Decision
         Making supplies.

         LaVonne Hage (408)922-7652 -- Educational Reimbursement questions
         and forms.

     The following is a listing of M&PD-San Jose programs scheduled for the
     next two months and their status.  (The 2Q88 M&PD-San Jose schedule
     will be published in early March.)  Employees wishing to enroll in any
     of the following programs should see their senior section manager for
     an enrollment form.  If additional enrollment forms are needed, contact
     Becky Spencer.

Dispatch said caller had right number and right department and had an emergency
on system X0DDD74.  The memo is working!

The Japanese users are quite upset that they were getting A016 errors trying
to run MAGNUM ever since F74 came back up.  Bonnie said that the accounting
files from yesterday were missing, and day shift had remedied the problem.
I recommended she get a hold of the people in charge of royalty accounting;
it appears the database is not correct and is rejecting access from the
nodes the Japanese users are on.  There is nothing I can do.     /Joe

Dear Mr.Baltrunas,  
this is the first time for me to sent you a mail. First I'd like to   
introduce myself, my name is Kazuo Watanabe, Application System  
Dept. in NIS. I have some customers on host F74.  
     
By the way, the F74's problem was returned to our customers. They have
sent  files on to F74, and the sent files had a problem. About the timing  
of the problem, following 5 cases are reported.   
     
     
 JST    01-Feb-88   evening      (Username: MPPC) 
        09-Feb-88   evening      (Username: MPPC)

        15-Feb-88   18:13        (Username: MPPC) 
     
     
Please investigate again, and let me know result. I will try to test, 
if necessary.  
     
Best regards.

Subject: REFLAG and ^ZL 

The reason why they never had to enter ^Z L O P E R <cr> when they came
up console was that they set reflag non-zero.  That meant ignore the
normal LOGIN procedure and just log them in.  Without reflag, they needed
to enter a login name so that LOGINN would do the right things for them.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System F74.
Problems: Japanese users got "FATAL ERROR A16.xxx".
Diagnosis: While restoring some missing files to directory UAS, the protection
          of (UAS)RTYACT.CTL got set to ALL RD NO.  This meant that no-one
          could run MAGNUM without setting RF license.  RDIST reported that
          all other systems had it as ALL RD RD.

20-Feb-88 02:10/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, Rick Daniels, (415)498-2588, System F26.
Problem:  He was attempting to add BPA10 and BPC10 to DSKB:.  After enterring
          the name, the system did nothing.
Diagnosis: The routine to refresh a single pack (PAKREF) can handle the case
          where SPAGES.SYS never existed, but cannot handle the case where
          SPAGES.SYS got deleted.  There was a nonzero pointer in word 21 of
          the HOME page pointing to page 13 of DSKB0:.  What it pointed to,
          however, was not a RIB.  Had to manually bypass that part of PAKREF.
Cure:     A dummy SPAGES.SYS has been created.  DSKCLN needs to treat SPAGES
          as a critical file if its pointer exists, ignore if not present.
          The monitor needs a new routine to verify the RIB, designed to be
          called from REFSTR and ONCDSK as well as FILRIB.

Investigate connecting RM05s (we have at least one DCL and 4 drives, and
we were supposed to swap Dallas a drive for a DCL) to the 2020s.  If they
are more reliable than some of the hardware we have (they are newer) they
may be another solution to the RP06 problems we continue to have.

Talk about procedural problems....

System D55: Contact Louie, 214-637-7435

Problem:  Their customer RAILTRACK, calles them complaining that their
          SUBMIT jobs are not running.  They've entered them a few times
          and they are not doing anything.

Research: (SUBMIT)*.JQL shows that nothing has run since 21-Feb-88.  The
          isn't any problem with (SYS)XEXEC or (SYS)EXECX.

          CTYLOG shows that the system has been up since Sunday 20:05 in
          "MANUAL" mode, no DSKCLN has been run, system was unshut after
          running ASP.   (An aside: we need to have ASP write to the CTY
          so that we can detect this condition.)

Solution: I masked as PERPOPER and started XEXEC.  I also impressed on the
          operator and shift supervisor the gravity of what "could" be a
          major file-system integrity problem due to the failure to reload
          and run DSKCLN.  I advised them to reload and do a FULL DSKCLN.

As we left it, Marconi was due in at any moment and he would authorize them
to do whatever they feel is necessary as far as scheduling down-time to try
to correct the problem.   I'll follow-up and contact Marconi later today.

1. We have been facing very serious problem of character change  
   ( including digit change ) of customers' data in TYMCOM-X
   service between input, storage and output since Dec. 87. 
     
2. We would like to ask you so urgent solution of the problem    
   as soon as possible.  
   Because we will be in a position to lose customers' reliability    
   by the nature of the problem.   
     
3. The following are blief history of communications and actions 
   between your and our people.    
     
     
        About F74 problem
        =================
     
        04 Jan  Makoto Ogura of NIS sent a report to Rick Daniels regarding
                - Some user program could not work normally.
                - I/O tools like BIONIK, SPOOL could not work normally.    
     
        04      Rick replied and mentioned that it came from a hardware problem 
                and was already repaired at that time. Also he informed the F74 
                has been running on a spare hardware after the middle of Dec 87.
     
        07      NIS reported to Rick about data garbling on F74 after solving   
                the hardware problem on 4th Jan.  
     
        13      Ken Bedell sent an OnTyme to Makoto Ogura and mentioned you
                were working for the problem.
     
        15      F74 went back to it's home hardware.   
     
        21      You mentioned that you caught something which you beleave  
                someone else caught the error. You found it from your trap 
                observation.  
     
        From 12nd Jan 88 to 28th Jan, NIS conducted 88 trials on F74 and 19
        trials ob D34 for your traps and checking, however, unfortunately, the  
        problem appeared a few times after your trap setting. The problem on our
        trials did not appeare after 20th Jan.    
     
        28      You suggested to stop making trials for F74 by NIS, and the trap
                on F74 was still continued to check by you. Also you mentioned  
                you guess the cause of the problem was overload of the Base.    
     
     
We would like to hear your response in earlier opportunity. 
     
Best regards.

Subject   : Again, F74 Problem
     
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  
     
Carl,
     
One month has been passed since we talked each other. How are you doing.   
     
Now, we are facing te F74 problem which is the same as we found on Jan., again. 
     
  - At the end of the last week, one of our customers called me and complained  
    about the problem. He mentioned that he had experienced to it on 6 files    
    during Feb. The garbled file were sent from San Jose and London HSA node    
    to the host.    
    Also, other users reported the problem during the last week. 
     
  - So, 26th Feb., we made 6 trials in the same manner which we conducted it in 
    Jan., and found 2 error files which were renamed as ERR.05 and ERR.06 for   
    your reference. Please check (OGURA:74)74.FIL for trials log.
     
  - I've reviewed the problem, and found that at the address which is replaced  
    string address - approx. 400 charas, you can find the same string image.    
    In other word, when the problem appeared, some string (maybe 12 charas)
    is overwritten at the address which is the original address pluse approx.   
    400 bytes. 
    The exact figure about the overwritten (including CR LF count) seemes to    
     be depending on it's file record length as follows. .  
                                        ... We can't understand why ...    
     
        Rec length      The figure 
     
                80           405   
               162           403   
     
    This manner is found in both ASCII/KANA files. And in one file, the relative
    figure is only one.  
     
    So, I also guess some problem appeared at the line interface portion in the 
    Base for F74, as you mentioned. Because I think in the host, the data  
    handling method for ASCII/KANA is different (ASCII: 5chars/word, KANA: 4chars    
    /word).    
     
  - You mentioned in your Ontyme at the end of Jan., the problem might come
    from the overload of the Base. 
     
    And now, in Japan, the problem is becoming very critical.    
     
        So, what is the counter plan of such overload problem,   
        who can take place it,
        who is responsible on it ? 
     
  - Please check your traps every day and let me know the usernames and time    
    if you find error log.    
    (We did not get the list of usernames and times for Jan's error, which 
     your trap found.)   
     
  - Please let me know the best way to solve this problem   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Re:     A temporary solution to F74's problem

================================================================

Makoto,
    So sorry for the delay in answering messages from NIS in the past
week.  We have been investigating the problem further and working on
a solution.

    The problem as we currently understand it is caused by a flaw in
the implementation of the high-speed BLOCK-IO input from the network
base to the PDP-10.  The KL-10 hardware uses special cache memory to
increase the processor speed by only reading physical memory when it
is absolutely necessary.  The network base writes BLOCK-IO input into
physical memory and then notifies the PDP-10 when data is available.
If portions of the BLOCK-IO buffer still exist in the hardware cache
the old memory contents are passed to the user instead of the new data
from physical memory.  This problem did not exist on the KI-10 cpu and
was apparently overlooked when the monitor was modified to run on the
newer KL-10 cpu.

    A final solution will have to be made as part of our next cycle
of development on the operating system, however we have worked out a
temporary solution of forcing the BLOCK-IO input buffers to be read
directly from physical memory.  We expect to finish the testing of
this fix this afternoon and will make it available for system F74 as
soon as possible.

    My only question at this time concerns what other PDP-10 systems
will we need to apply this fix.  On what other systems do you and your
customers use the BIONIC or BIONIK programs?

    In regards to the list of usernames found in our traps... we have
determined that the trap caught many more events than actually occured
and we could not depend on any of them.  What happenned was that the
trap detected an event when the base message passed BLOCK-IO to the
operating system because cache had not been updated, but by the time
the operating system passed the data to the user, the cache data was
correct.  This is why we thought we trapped an error, yet you and your
customers found no errors in late January.

    Now, we are sure the problem is due to cache references and have
disabled the trapping while we work on the solution.

    I will send you another message at the time we are ready to reload
system F74 with the "fix" version of the operating system.

I'm all ready to send them the info.  Looking at F74, it appears there

Are we ready to go with your current patch?

patch to the operating system and it was installed on system F74 this
morning.  Please let us know if there are any additional problems.

 -  System F74 was reloaded with the patched monitor F74-P035/D-1 on
    2-Mar-88 at 11:33 PST.

 -  There is some confusion with the meaning of "newer KL-10" cpu.  The
    KL-10 cpu is newer than the old KI-10 cpu which system 34 used to
    be when it was located in Cupertino.  System 74 has always been a
    KL-10 cpu.

 -  The problem you have been experiencing with BIONIC and BLOCK-IO has
    always existed on the KL-10 cpu.  However, since it has always been
    intermittant, it was never brought to our attention until December.
    It was thought to be a host-base interface problem due to a similar
    problem discovered 5 years ago on system D54.  Now, we understand
    that the problem on D54 was probably the same as F74.  The changes
    made to D54 5 years ago changed the timing of the memory references
    and the problem was never seen again.  This time, more research was
    done and the problem with the cache holding "old" information gives
    us the ability to duplicate the problem and provide a solution.

 -  Why the problem "suddenly" appeared is unknown.  Probably a subtle
    change in the operating system timing or the mix of applications on
    the system is the answer.  Also, it is clear that the problem may
    have been present but undetected since September when the customer
    base of NIS was moved from system 34 to 74.

 -  So that you may provide an explanation of the problem to your own
    customers, here is the technical detail about the problem we have
    found and corrected with our patch to the system.

     o  The BIONIC and BIONIK programs both use a special high-speed
	communications protocol which allows large amounts of character
	data to be passed between the host and the network base without
	causing the host to process each data byte.  This is BLOCK-IO.

     o  BLOCK-IO utilizes multi-ported memory on the PDP-10 to place the
	data directly into buffers which the PDP-10 then passes directly
	to the user application (BIONIC).

     o  On the model KI-10 cpu all memory references were buffered by the
	hardware, but retrieved from physical memory, so all BLOCK-IO data
	coming in from the base was passed to the user application.

     o  On the model KL-10 cpu all memory references are still buffered by
	the hardware, but a second high-speed cache retains data recently
	referenced by the cpu and references to data stored in those memory
	addresses are retrieved from the cache whenever possible.

     o  Normal host-base messages are uncached and are always retrieved from
	physical memory.   BLOCK-IO data buffers currently reside in part of
	the dynamic memory pool which is cached for fast data access.  Since
	the BLOCK-IO buffer headers were referenced by the cpu to setup the
	data transfer, these memory addresses and some nearby addresses were
	stored in the cache.  After the transfer the cpu references the data
	to pass it to the user application and instead of retrieving all of
	the data from physical memory, some data is retrieved from the cache.

     o  Cache is filled in 4-word chunks.  The format of the BLOCK-IO block
	is 6-words of header and 100-words of data.  The header is always on
	a 4-word boundary and thus the last 2 words of the header and the
	first 2 words for the data are in the cache at the same time.  The
	last word of the header is the byte count and is always referenced
	prior to the transfer (pulling all 4 words into the cache).  Thus,
	the first 2 words of the data buffer are retrieved from the cache
	instead of physical memory for most of the transfers.

     o  Most of the time the cache data containing the above 4-word chunk is
	flushed or overwritten with a different 4-word chunk of addresses.
	That is why this problem is not repeatable upon demand.  In the few
	instances when the job mix on the system does not flush this 4-word
	block, the user application receives 2 words of "old" data.  Each
	word contains 4 bytes and that is why we see 8 data bytes with bad
	information when the problem occurs.

     o  The temporary solution for the problem is to mark the part of the
	dynamic memory pool used by BLOCK-IO buffers as uncached.  In this
	way we will achieve the same reliability that we had with BLOCK-IO
	on the model KI-10 cpu.

     o  The long-term solution will be to separate the BLOCK-IO data buffers
	from the rest of the dynamic memory pool and place them in a separate
	pool of uncached memory.  This will be done during our next monitor
	development cycle.

 -  The explanation above should answer any of the questions you may have
    had about the problem.  We have installed the temporary fix to system
    F74 at this time.  If you wish that we install the temporary fix to
    system D34, please let me know in your next message.

 -  The file (HAL:74)SHAMK2.NIS appears to be a victim of this same problem.
    BIONIC and BIONIK translate occurances of CR or LF in the data stream to
    CR + LF.  Therefore, if each record is transmitted as 80 characters + CR
    then the data file will contain 80 characters + CR LF, and if the 8 bytes
    including the CR are overwritten, we will see 80 + 80 + 1 + CR LF which
    is confirmed by the 161 characters + CR LF see in the output file.

Thank you again for your help in researching the problem and in testing
the modifications made to track down the source of the problem.  Please
let me know if the problem occurs again.

Best regards,

/Carl

B39 had some base type problems today, it seems slot one was
"restarting".  Somehow the memory buffers had been corrupted
and needed to be cleared.  When you see slot 0 running ok and can't 
log in try pushing the "INI" button or the "bubble switch" on the
left corner of the CPU board.  This refreshes all memory and restarts the
node from ADDR 70 just the same as a reload.

Any questions just call me........Kal

Well Ops, it did it again today.  B39's base 2674 slot 1 went bad.  I
don't know what is causing this problem because there have been no changes
to the base code.  Have there been changes to the system monitor?
Since I was logged into the dispatcher of the base I was able to "HALT", 
"INIT" and "EXECUTE" the 'bad guy' from here.  If this problem
continues I will look into it further.

Regards, Kal

-----------------------------------------------------------------------



Software Support has modified the PSPPDP software to have the
BEEPER sound off when a system is down.

The way it works is after PSPATO has completed listing out it will BEEP
for about 10-15 seconds and will stop running.  The BEEP will repeat
every 60 seconds until something is done.

When you hear this BEEPER, you must check to see what system is down.
If it is a system that you know is not scheduled down, you have to
check that system.  If it is a system that you know is scheduled
down, then press the RETURN key ONCE to start the 20 minute wait;
TWICE to run IMMEDIATELY.

Once you are aware of a system down, and something is being done, press
the RETURN key as mentioned above.

The BEEPER will sound until the System has returned to TIMESHARING.

All the appropriate files are under FREMONTDOC:74.  The file UPDPSP.MEM
contains instructions on how to update the PSPPDP software.  This file
                                                                Page  2

is also under FREMONTDOC.

Thanks

Subject: VT100 terminal status. 

Before 4-Mar-88:
  VT101 at VAX Lab - good video board, but logic board goes bonkers after
    it has been on for a few minutes, many beeps and goes into SETUP.
  VT100 in KL Lab - good video board, logic board stuck with white background.
  VT100 in Nicholson - video board dead, logic board good, no AVO.

After 4-Mar-88:
  VT101 in VAX Lab - has bad video board and bad logic board.
  VT100 in KL Lab - has good video board and good logic board.
  VT100 in Nicholson - has good video board and so-so logic board.

(The video board can be easily repaired.  One diode runs hot enough to scortch
the board and evaporate the electrolyte from the adjacent capacitor.  When
the capacitor dries out, it blows the fusable link.  Replace link and capacitor,
and board works again.  The previous info came from a DECUS session.)  /Joe

Osman;

What version of PAKCOP are you using on System 32?  Want to set up tapes
for this system and have tapes made for FSC for rebuilding.

Will make monitor tapes of (sys)system.sav, (sys)backup.sav, and tapes of
(sys)tito.sav and (sys)asp.sav.

12-Mar-88 05:02/Joe  (Pager said 817-637-7435, did not go thru Central Dispatch)
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size".  It did not say whether there were too
          many or too few units in the new structure.
Solution: Told them to verify that the new DSKB had exactly the same number of
          units as when the ASP was done.  The highest unit can be found at the
          end of the hardcopy from when ASP was run.

11-Mar-88 00:23/Joe
Contact:  Fremont Operations, David Jorgenson, (415)498-2588, System 32.
Problem:  When bringing up the system READONLY to run ASP as part of operator
          training, it died with a NONAME stopcode in SCHED1.
Diagnosis: LOGINN was trying to update the LUD to turn off the 6 letter bits
          to indicated that OPER had seen the "system is going down" message.
          During READONLY, updating ENTERs are allowed.  However, when the
          program issues an OUT uuo or VALPAG chanio, the system crashes.
Solution: Told them to come up MANUAL this time to do the ASP.  Later analysis
          showed that they could have come up MANUAL, run TAKEIT to HANG the
          system, and then come up READONLY.
Note:     Looking at the monitor source code implies that this bug existed
          prior to P034/N.  One way around it is to come up using "NOINITIA"
          and "FULL", then login as OPER (which clears the bits in the LUD)
          to run TAKEIT and "HANG" the system.  That leaves the files is the
          proper state to bring up "CONSOLE" and "READONLY" so the OPER can
          login and run ASP.  This will be fixed in next release of the monitor.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Bonnie, (415)498-2588, System 30.
Problem:  One user had 30 jobs logged in, all detached, all running MAGNUM
          programs.  The jobs would not go away immediately - LOGOUT and TAKEIT
          only evicted them.  System was heavily loaded and very slow.
Solution: None.  By the time I logged in, all these jobs had logged out.
          MAGNUM enables notice-to-quit (NTQ) so that it can clean up after
          itself and leave the database in a consistent state.  Until the clean
          up is done, the job can be evicted but not killed.

ASP version 7 has been installed in SYS on all Dallas systems.
The previous version of ASP could not handle a structure of 14 units of 3652
disks (like system 55).  This new version of ASP has been running in
Fremont for several months.  /Joe

Subject: Revised status of D55 

12-Mar-88 05:02/Joe (Pager said 817-637-7435, they didn't call Central Dispatch)
Contact:  Dallas Operations, Allen Smith, (214)637-7435
Problem:  System 55 lost an HDA on a 3652 disk.  After redefining the structure,
          ASP said "bad structure size", even though the new DSKB had the same
          number of units as the old DSKB.  7 spindles of 3652 = 14 units.
Diagnosis: Dallas is still running ASP version 6.  That version cannot restore
          from an tapes written from a system using 14 units of 3652 disks.
Solution: They started a rebuild from TITO all-files tapes.  After they had
          restored SYS, I copied ASP version 7 from OSU to SYS on D55 and all
          other systems in Dallas.


At 23:20 Saturday, the restore had gotten as far as the "N"'s.   /Joe

Subject: Performance Monitoring Info 

Landa,

  As I promised on Friday, I have looked over your requested specifications
for PDP-10 tools to improve performance monitoring and assembled a list of
things which are currently available:

    TYMCOM-X Monitoring Tool Info

     o  CPU usage 0-100%, as determined by 100% minus idle time

     o  MicroCycles used, for comparison against CPU usage

     o  CPU lost time 0-100%, as determined by the operating system:
	time which the CPU could not run any otherwise runnable jobs due
	waiting for sharable or non-sharable resources

     o  Memory capacity, determined by amount of physical memory on line

     o  Memory availability, determined by usage

     o  Virtual memory (disk space) available, number and type of drives

     o  Disk transfers in blocks (4 blocks = 1 page), includes all page-i/o
	performed on behalf of the user:  direct file i/o, page mapping and
	page swapping done by the system

     o  Disk page mapping:  page mapping and swapping i/o for each job

     o  Terminal activity:  characters input, output and block-transferred

     o  User usage:  Logged-in, active, idle and in disk or terminal i/o wait


  At present, information about TOP CPU users or most accessed programs could
incur a large amount of sampling overhead and additional disk storage to keep
track of the information.  This information can be calculated from data in the
stream accounting files and I feel it would be best to get it from directly
those files.

  Let me know if this is sufficient to start with.  We can add or delete any
additional information that we feel is necessary.

/Carl

Tom;

Forgot to mention to you on the telephone that  we use a program called
CM10 to send all crash mail.  This file is under (UTIL) on all our hosts
at Fremont.  Files needed are CM10.TBA, CM10.LST.  All are under my username
on System 55 if you want to look it over and desire to use it.  Also
under my USERNAME is a file CM10.SAM

Using this prompts for all information that Software Support requires
in the mail

Get back to me on itand let me know what you decde.

Thanks Rick

NEWMON.SAV has been patched to be D37-P035/D-1.  (M33)PEKCHK.PAT was applied
to fix the problem where the system would die with stopcode PCBFL1 whenever
TAKEIT (or ICP) was run.  This bug is at least 8 years old but was only
triggered on systems with 4 meg of memory and 32 logical disks (2 real
strings of 3652 disks).		/Joe Smith

Subject: Cause of PCBFL1 stopcodes on D37 located and fixed. 

Whenever a program such as TAKEIT or ICP tries to peek on physical core,
the PEKCHK routine is called.  It had the following code:
	LSH	PG,-^D9		;Convert word address to page number
	LDB	T3,PGYNXM	;Is page known to be nonexistant?
	CAIL	PG,340		;T3 can't be trusted for unmapped area
	 JUMPN	T3,CPOPJ	;Give error return, page not accessable

PGYNXM is valid only for user core.  There are no entries allocated in the
PGY tables for monitor core (since it never swaps).  That is, if the monitor
has 754 pages allocated to itself and the system has 20000 pages total, then
the PGY tables are set up for PGYXXX[754:17777].  Using a value below 754
will access a word that is lower than the start of PGYXXX.  Depending on the
number of disks, number of jobs, and number of physical pages, the PGY
tables may be allocated at 400000 and above.  On system D37, the tables
moved to 400000 when the 2nd string of 3652's were defined.  Due to the
bug, a check on page 26 would cause a reference to the word at 377052.
The page fault handler knows page 377 belongs to %SAT, however %SAT was not
in used at the time, ergo stopcode PCBFL1.  The fix is:
	LSH	PG,-^D9		;Convert word address to page number
	CAMGE	PG,SYSSZP	;Is it part of the resident monitor?
	 TDZA	T3,T3		;Yes, page exists and has no NXM entry
	LDB	T3,PGYNXM	;Check if user-core page exists
	JUMPN	T3,CPOPJ	;Give error return, page not accessable

That stopcode was caused when any program that peeks at the monitor (such

It looks like TYMNET had to turn off their circuit-breaker panel.
All the engines were down around noon today, but the 2020's kept running.
Nodes 5416 and 5561 were down so we couldn't get to 17 or 14 via TYMNET,
and we couldn't get thru via the micronet because node NICK and its modem
were plugged into TYMNET power.  I located a 30-amp extension cord, now
node NICK, node FOON, the sync modem, and both async modems are now
plugged into our conditioned power.  We need another 10-foot 30-amp
extension cord so that all the terminal by the Foonlys can be plugged into
our conditioned power.  		/Joe

On Friday, 18 Mar at 18:20:24, Joe Smith sent an Ontyme to bring
F26 up on NEWMON.SAV.  If proper procedures were followed
the problem with ASP Dump could have been avoided.  See messages

NEWMON.SAV has been patched to F26-P035/D-1 to fix the PCBFL1 stopcodes.
That stopcode was caused when any program that peeks at the monitor (such
as ICP, TAKEIT, and CTYLOG) tried to run on a system with 4 meg and 2
real strings of 3652 disks.  The bug is at least 8 years old but hasn't
shown up until now.             /Joe Smith

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitors have been rolled.  Update (SYS)SYSTEM.sav and (SYS)BACKUP.sav
monitors tapes.  Run and post an updated DSKMAP and post on mainframe.
If F26 should go down, it will come up on monitor F26-p035/D-1.

Thanks Rick

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


TYMCOM-10 Software Support will at times send mail to Operations
with instructions to bring a system up on NEWMON.SAV.

Normally it is done during regular scheduled downtime.  The exceptions
to this rule are:

     a.  If a system is continuously going down; or

     b.  If USERS' are having problems with their software; or,

     c.  Problems of an EMERGENCY nature.

In these cases, they may request the system be recycled immediately
after they have solved the problem.  The crash code to use during
this recycle is the same crash code that was used when the problem
first developed.

Whatever shift this occurs on, the Operator should contact their Shift
Supervisor or Senior Operator.

                                                                Page  2

The Shift Supervisor, or Senior Operator, should insure that the system
logbook has complete information entered into it.  They should also 
insure that:

     a.  SSW #4 is set

     b.  A note put on the CTY as to what monitor to bring system
         up on when recycled again or if the system should go down.

     c.  Run R CRSHID;/SYS on the host to check monitor versions
         installed.

     d.  Run RU (QASYS)MAPUPD to update DSKMAP and post on
         mainframe.

If after a few days no problems has occurred with the NEWMON, then
ALL monitors will be rolled.  To do this, GFD to UTIL and enter:
RUN COM;MONROL.CMD.

This COMMAND file will automatically copy files, run (QASYS)MAPUPD,
and print out an updated DSKMAP.  This copy will be posted on the
mainframe.

When this is completed, update (SYS)SYSTEM.SAV and (SYS)BACKUP.SAV
monitor tapes for the host.

To update these tapes, GFD to UTIL and enter: "RUN COM;_______"(one
of the following):

    BUMON.FT#                  (# = TAPE DRIVE ID)

    SYSMON.FT#

After tapes are made, they are to be put back in the cabinet with
the other monitor tapes.

Sense switch #4 should be removed and all notes referring to bringing
the system up on NEWMON.SAV.

Please contact me if you have questions.

Thanks;

Whenever you receive the following "?INFO stopcode 'BADUFD' on any host
CTTY, Software Support must be notified.  WHat this means is that a USER's
directory has been completely wiped out.

After the system up, software has to repair the damage, or will let you
know what has to be done.

Thanks for your attention in this regard

Please refer to the attached memo from Warren Prince.  I have been
assigned to collect your input by April 1 regarding your PDP-10
application usage.

My OnTyme name is:  QSATS.G/WALKER

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at:
408-922-7523.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

To:  MDNSC President's Staff

From:  Warren Prince

Subject:  DEC-10



It is the intent of MDNSC to get off of DEC-10 systems and convert our
existing applications, as necessary, to appropriate alternate
environment within the next 12 months.  This decision is based on the
recommendations made by an internal task force on hardware planning.
This migration will eliminate excessive IPC charges and also get us off
an archaic and inflexible computing environment that we have been using
for nearly 15 years.  While purchase of departmental processors might be
appropriate for applications specific to your groups only, common
hardware/software strategy may be required for applications such as code
management, validations, documentation, accounting, etc.

Please collect the information on your current DEC-10 based applications
in the format suggested by April 1 and return it to your representative
of the Hardware Planning Task Force.  The members of the task force are:

Raja Rajaraman - Operations 
Ken Holcomb - NTD 
Gary Walker - Marketing and Sales 
Sateesh Lele/Fred Canning - Finance (HR, Legal, Business Planning, if 
necessary)

Your cooperation in this matter is extremely critical in order to put
together an intelligent and consistent hardware/software strategy.

Thank you for your compliance.

Subject: AR/ARX failures show up as "IME" on current monitor. 

The "IME" stopcodes on system 33 were a result of an AR/ARX parity error
being detected.  I suspect a bad cache board.

.CPUP1+0 = saved contents of UPT+500 = page fail word
.CPUP1+1 = saved contents of UPT+501 = PC at time of page fault
.CP7+0   = saved contents of AC 0 of block 7 (contents of AR)
.CP7+1   = saved contents of AC 1 of block 7 (contents of ARX)
Page fail type 36 is AR parity error (data word from cache or E bus)
Page fail type 37 is ARX parity error (instruction PC points to from cache)

Crash  Date   Time  Type  UPT+500 UPT+501    Good data      Bad data    Where
CRA002 24-MAR 02:49 36=AR  177163  170473 574212,,000000 554210,,000000 .CP7+0
CRA003 24-MAR 03:42 36=AR  177163  170473 574212,,000000 554210,,000000 .CP7+0
CRA004 24-MAR 04:18 37=ARX 072163  072163 370005,,000054 350000,,000054 .CP7+1
CRA005 24-MAR 06:54 37=ARX 005702  122163 270340,,015274 250340,,015274 .CP7+1
CRA006 24-MAR 07:08        SAVAPR=4411=SBus+MemParity, SAVERA=636005,,416160
CRA007 24-MAR 07:32 36=AR  376163  062664 564422,,222321 544422,,222321 .CP7+0
CRA008 24-MAR 07:55 36=AR  376163  062664 232521,,302200 212521,,302200 .CP7+0
CRA009 24-MAR 08:35 37=ARX 005702  122163 270340,,015274 250340,,015274 .CP7+1
CRA010 25-MAR 10:36 37=ARX 005702  122163 270340,,015274 250340,,015274 .CP7+1

CRA006 was a parity error detected at the S-bus, the sector lights should have
been on for this particular crash.

On all the other crashes, the bad data came from cache and the good data was
read after doing a cache sweep.  The difference in each case is 020000,,000000.

Patch #3 (IMEPAR.PAT) has been applied to NEWMON on all systems in the
data center.  It causes all AR/ARX detected faults to output the standard
"PARITY ERROR" message and then stop with an APRFAT stopcode.

I will look into the possibility of continuing after an AR/ARX error.  /JMS

Subject: Patch #4 for P035/D stops on AR/ARX errors. 

Patch #4 has been applied to NEWMON in the Fremont Data Center.
This patch causes the system to stop with CPU stopcode AR.ARX whenever
an AR or ARX parity error occurs.  The previous patch invoked the old
parity error scanning routines when AR/ARX problems were detected, but
that caused misleading information to be typed out.  It produced a
"USER PARITY ERROR" messaged, scanned memory, couldn't find any errors
in memory, output "SPURIOUS PARITY ERROR", and then marked all pages of
the user's core image as being bad.  This in turn triggered many BADPAG
messages.

With patch #4, AR/ARX problems will cause an immediate stopcode.
The way to recoginize an AR/ARX problem is by looking at the "UPT+500"
word printed as part of the "CPU STATUS".  If the first 2 digits are "36",
it is an AR error, AC 7:0 has the bad data.  If the first 2 digits are "37",
is is an ARX error, AC 7:1 has the bad data.

Will be backing off of (SYS)NEWMON.SAV on all hosts until Hardware/Support
personnel can come to an understanding of what is going on.

F22 has gone down twice with the CPU stopcode AR/ARX already today.  Cannot
have system going down this frequently with this stopcode.

Let's get together ASAP and determine which way we are to go with 
monitors.

Subject: What went wrong on F22, F33, F58. 

Patch #3 from the original IMEPAR.PAT had a bug.  It picked up the page-fail
code from UPT+501 instead of UPT+500.  This means that when a page fault
occured, if the PC flags had CARRY0 + CARRY1 + FLOAT_OVERFLOW + FIRST_PART_DONE 
+ USER all set, then the patch would say it was an ARX error, and jump to
the parity error routine.  APRER1 saw the USER flag set and tried to locate
the word with the bad parity error by scanning all of the user's core.  Since
it couldn't find any parity error in memory (the problem was in the cache,
not in core), the routine had no alternative but to wipe out all of that
user's core.  It marked all his pages as having read errors.  The routine
that frees up user core saw the read error bit set, so it added all of
those pages to the BAT page.

The final fix did not get installed into P035/D-4 until about 6pm, Tuesday
March 29.  The AR.ARX dumps on F22 and F58 prior to that time are bogus.

All Fremont systems are now up to date.  The way to check the crash dumps,
NEWMON, and/or the running system is to look at location PATCH+26 and
verify that the RH is UP%500, not UP%500+1.   /Joe

Subject: B39 crashes. 

Hi, O:

  B39 has been dependable--we can depend on it to crash every afternoon.
It seems to possibly be running out of disk space.  Heck, I did 3 NAD
assemblies today, and had over 1500 pages of .TMP files.  (I didn't know
before today that NAD saves a humongous >TMP file--mine were over 480
pages each.)

  Is the problem one of running out of disk for memory backup?  I don't
ever think of checking CORE until the machine has crashed.  These daily
crashes are getting tiring, and I'm wondering what's causing them.

		Thanks!    D.

Problem:  LOGICAL UNIT 0 MISSING FROM DSKB and HOM PAGE CONSISTENCY ERRORs.
Diagnosis: Pages 2 thru 10 on DSKB0 got overwritten by ASCII text.
	It was a log file from someone generating node code from T12014.TYM.
	Page 1 had SIXBIT/*PEAK*/ in the first word, most likely it was
	(DGRAHAM)046PEA.001[11334,427741] (since fast DSKCLN complained that
	that file was not marked in the SATs).
Fix:	Pages 1 and 6 re-created using DSKB1:'s HOM pages as a template.
	Pages 2 and 7 reset to be empty BAT pages.  Pages 3,4,5 rewritten by
	running BOOTS, page 10 rebuild using F29's RIB to SAT.SYS as a guide.
	Running fast DSKLN in check mode reported only the 046PEA.001 file.
	B39 answered at 18:53.

The two stopcodes DIEBPC on X32 should be ignored.  When the correct patch -4
was applied, it was put on all systems in Fremont EXECPT 32.  I don't know
how I could have missed that one.  Therefore, these two crashes were not
the result of running the KL with a fast clock.   /Joe

Explanation of INFO stopcode BASE.
This particular stopcode occurs when nonzero is deposited in location 30,
the value there matches IRP620 and ORP620 (or the saved copies of the IRING
and ORING pointers), and the KEY is other than 04.  If the key is 354 (octal),
it means that ISIS has told slot 1 (and the 68000) to crash.  After the
stopcode message is output, location 30 is zeroed and the PDP-10 continues.
If a second INFO stopcode BASE occurs, it means that ISIS has restarted the
slot, then halted it again.

At 8:39am 1-Apr-88, the INFO stopcode "BASE" was occurring approximately
every 4 seconds.  This means that either A) someone was running DDT in
slot 1 and restarting it every 4 seconds, or B) ISIS in ND2674 was screwed up.

At 8:41am, the INI button on the node was pressed.  This stopped the
continuous "BASE" stopcodes, produced "BASEOK" and "TIMEOK" events when
the Bubbnet supervisor resumed communication.  However, the excessive "BASE"
stopcodes had confused SCNSER to the point where 20 minutes later it
crashed at SCNSER+6145(TTPUTC+10) when all the bufferlets were full.

In general, whenever the INFO stopcode "BASE" comes out, the base is not to
be trusted.  It should be INIted or reloaded before continuing.

Subject: B39 base crashes. 

I got your note and agree that you people should be responsible for INIting
B39.  But how long should operations leave B39 down waiting for someone to
look at 2674 via DDT?  I mentioned using INI only if it is necessary to
get B39 back up quickly.

Is it possible to do an up-line dump of node 2674 to ELF or 33 via
gateway?  Right now, I don't think anyone has logged in to 2674 to determine
if slot 1 was stopped due to an ISIS error or a Dispatcher error.

By the way: Although we did generate new code for NW2674, it has never been
loaded.  We had scheduled using the new code, but due to a communications
mixup it was not loaded.  As far as I know, 2674 is running the same code
it always has.

Subject: Subtle solution 

After talking with Bill Soley today... we hit upon a solution that lets
MAILER run every 20 minutes (on system 29) and doesn't kick-start polling
our ONTYME mail each time.

  Remove our names from (MAIL:29)ONTYME.DAT
  ...actually modify them to allow sending, but not to poll.

This removes the 1500 logins per month.  To still receive mail, I've
setup a batch job to run once a day at 14:00 to pull our ontyme mail
to FSC.* and TXS.* on system 35.  To do this we run ONTMTP on system
35 once a day, and MAILER knows nothing of this.  ROUTER.DAT is unchanged.

The first pickup will be at 14:00 on Thursday.  The last pickup was at
16:20 on Wednesday.  If once a day is too infrequent, please let me know.
Osman and I agreed that once a day is enough for us.

/Carl

PS.  TXS.C/FLETCHER will still forward to FSC.C/FLETCHER (once a day)
     and FSC.C/FLETCHER will still NOT be polled at all, so whatever
     arrangements you (Craig) have with Karen will continue.

Subject: X14's power supply went bad. 

Both 2020's, both bases, and both ADM3s lost power sometime this afternoon.
X17 was up but its base hadn't been reloaded.  X14 was down.  Attempting to
power it up produced a big blue spark as the circuit breaker tripped.  Then
I saw Chuck's note in the log saying that a new power supply for X14 is
expected tomorrow.  X17 keeps dying with PAR ERR - its power supply may
need adjusting too.  It stayed up long enough to load 6657 but not 6760.

Subject: Hotline Call 

System D56, -- 214-637-7435 -- Beeped directly, did not go through Dispatch.

They were received a number of disk related stopcodes, BADPAG etc.. and Lucian
told Dallas Ops to move the pack in question and run a full DSKCLN.  Ops did
so and DSKCLN reported SYSTAT.SHR missing data.

Lucian could not login, LOGINN.SHR page i/o error.  I had Lisa deposit -1
in REFLAG's location via KLDCP so that I could login.  I copied LOGINN.SHR
to itself and all was well with the world.  Lisa restored SYSTAT.SHR and I
restored WC HF licenses on the file.

Done.  Approx 30-45 minutes to handle the call. Talked to 2 operators... Lisa
       handled all the legwork and had a better understanding of what happened
       than Dan (? not sure of his name).

o  Chuck is working on X17 to see if he can find anything why the system
   would not stay up.

o  X14 is back up with the same P/S.  Spare P/S would not work at all.
   So, Chuck put back the old one and made it work some how.  Base

DZ11 on X14 does not appear to work.  When I brought up TOPS-10 on X14, I
could not get any response on any of the DZ lines.  I tried all of the
first 8 lines with no luck.  Could you get someone to run diags on the DZ?
there are two loop-back connectors inside of X14.   /Joe

The most recent change to 39's base code was 4-Apr-88 by BBUNYAN.
(BUBBNET:39)BB2674.BND is loaded with version 5.22 of node code.
The previous BND file (dated 1-May-87) was loded with version 5.21 of
node code.  Did B39 have many base related problems in Jan, Feb, and Mar-88?

Subject: New base code on F38. 

Paul Krumviede (who has a cubicle next to mine in building F) was talking
about upgrading F38's base to the latest version of ISIS and node code.
Something about the old node code being a bottleneck - the maximum amount
of data going thru the base was limited by inefficiencies in node code, not
by the number of sync (or SIO) lines.

Subject: Suggestive steps for B39 .... 

To isolate and/or fix the problem B39 is having, these are
suggestive steps to take.

o  Most of the system crashes in last 2 weeks always started
   with TTYZNE event stopcode, follewed by some number of BASE
   event stopcodes and than crashed with some kind of STOP 
   stopcode.  To find out more information about the crashes, 
   made the TTYZNE a STOP stopcode and monitor should goto
   BOOTS when it detects it.  A crash dump should be taken to 
   be  analized.

o  B39's Base code should be tested running with the same
   base code as the rest of the systems, which is:
   Node code version 5.10
   ISIS code version 7.01
   to see if B39 will run as well as the other PDP10s.

o  Put diagnostic patch in monitor to save I/O ring messages 
   between the Base and the PDP10 to find out the message sequences 
   just prior to crash.

o  Run one of the Fremont D. C. hosts with the same base code
   version as B39:
   Node code version: 5.22
   ISIS code version: 7.03
   to see if it will experience the same problem as B39 is having.

It appears that CHTFNF is not related to the problem we have seen on both
F33 and F38. The running job was (ANDERSONK) running TUMS.  UP%MUU was a
PERSET T1, at CLRCOW+32.  UP%UUO was a CHANIO T3, for the user.

Since I'm looking for something else, I didn't do any more checking into
the real failure in this crash.

Subject: SY related crashes F33 & F38 

  I say we are "in luck"... it appears that SY is not crashing the system
by peeking or spying with SYSDVF.  In fact, what appears to be happening
is SY does a FRMOP 1,addr trying to read the node-port of a frame and then
we see FILAMO or FILAUU ...  (FILAUU says ATB: Private pages for frame 985)
I forsee this as significant information but I don't know what Joe is trying
to print when we see this message.

  My guess is that there's a problem with dummy ATBs and keeping count if
sone number of users are trying to get/release something for a specific frame.

Subject: Strange zaps on MUX thru gateway. 

Around 11:20am today, my circuit to B39 got zapped.  I had logged in from
the MUX on host 2096 to username BUBB to JMS:39.  When I trie to login again,
the gateway said that host 39 was down.  However, when I tried 5 minutes later,
I got thru and the system had been up for 20 hours.  There were not a bunch
of detached jobs; the base had not crashed and the host had not crashed.
Osman had the same experience - for a short period of time he could not log
into 39 from the gateway, but people in Bubbnet had no problems.

Around 5:30pm, I was again zapped from the mux and could not get back for a
while.  When I did get thru, my previous job was still logged in and had a
port (it was not detached).  
SYSTAT said "4067(n1B3)" for both jobs, which is public net host 5981.
It looks like the portion of my circuit between the mux and the gateway got
zapped, but the portion between the gateway and system 39 was not.

Has anyone else reported similar problems?  Who should be notified?

Subject: (SYS:39)CRA015 is a TTYZNE crash. 

Login request (message type 6) received on port 172.
LDBLOG is 200000,,0 which means not logged in, zap in progress.
L2LOWT is set meaning SCNSER is waiting for orange ball to come back before
releasing the zapper.  L2LOWS is set meaning that L2LOWT has been on for 10
seconds (zapper will be unleashed if no orange ball within another 10 seconds).

This one might be SCNSER's fault.  I find it strange that the rest of LDBLOG is
all zero.  If the base thinks that particular port is not in use, it probably
will ignore the yellow ball instead of reflecting an orange ball.  Since the
base thinks the port is not in use, it is quite reasonable to send a login
request on that line.  The 68000 gets upset when we zap its login request.
I haven't checked to see what SCNSER does with the rest of the login request
(4 bytes of node id, 12 chars user name).  If it sends zaps for every one
of those bytes, I wouldn't blame the base for getting upset.  The 20 second
delay between yellow ball and zapper send by SCNSER is consistent with the
CTYLOG on CRA003.
  16:19:29 Something makes SCNSER think it should send a zapper on port 71.
           It sends a yellow ball first, starts the 20 second timer.
  16:19:32 Base wants to use port 71 for an aux circuit.  TTYZNE stopcode.
  16:19:49 Orange ball timer expires, SCNSER sends zapper.
  16:19:49 INFO stopcode BASE, Key=354.
  16:19:57 Stopcode IME (probably due to loop in TTYBMT output).

We should modify SCNSER to allow incoming logins to quietly cancel pending
zappers.  As long as the sign bit in LDBLOG is off, it make more sense to
take the base's word for it that the port is available to be re-used.  /Joe

Any FRMOP that accesses another job has to map the other job's context pages
into %UPX.  This access increments the use count stored in the other job's
dummy ATB (since context pages and private pages use the same ATB).
Therefore, the FRMOP that reads UPTLOG (as opposed to GETTABing LDBLOG) causes
the shared count of the target's job to be temporarily incremented.  If there
is a bug that doesn't decrement the count when the UUO finishes, then you
should be able to crash the system consistantly by simply doing that one
FRMOP to 2 or more different jobs until the field overflows.

rick,  I can't explain it but nothing has been done to allow the system
to stay up. I have genned new code for the base using ISIS version 7.01
and the latest version of node code but since the system has not crashed
I have not loaded it. Paul Krumvide (sp) has been looking into it for me
and has sent me some mail which I will forward to you, but no real reason
for the extended uptime.

  It seems that the crash code reported by the EBUS slot means that the
EBUS board crashed, told ISIS it did so, ISIS told the slot, and the slot
responds by crashing (and in this case restarting).  The board writes a
crash reason down to the kernel, but it doesn't seem as if the actual
reason gets saved anywhere.  It would be nice to know why the board was
crashing...
  I think that the slot restart also restarts the EBUS board, but the
monitor and the board are probably hopelessly out of sync by then. Do
you know if we have ever recovered from such a situation without having
to do something manually?

Subject: EBUS crashes 

  I think that the EBUS crash routine does actually save some usefull
information in the slot memory after all.  The EBUS slot has an extended
DDT command handler (the ?STAT handler available in the slot) which has
a command (RDUMP?) that should display some crash information (such as
the PC, 68010 registers, etc.).
  This information may be sufficient (to start) if a crash dump is not
convenient.

Just a reminder...

  I'm scheduled to be on Jury Duty from 4/18-4/22 and have to report to
superior court on Monday 4/18 at 8:15 am.  Jurors 1-200 must report.  I am
number 197 {sigh}.

  I'll let you know what happens, what kind of schedule I'll be on as soon
as I know myself.  I will plan on keeping up my work schedule in the evenings
where possible, (as time permits).  See you all when this is over.

Subject: Loop found in ISIS to 68K initialization. 

Paul Krumviede found a bug in ISIS where it sends the wrong command to the IPI
(68000 board) whenever slot 1 crashes.
1) Something goes wrong, ISIS crashes slot 1.  IPI sends KEY=354 to host.
2) Because CRASTOP is not set, ISIS does not stop on the crash, and instead
   tries to restart the slot.
3) Slot 1 executes SVC SYS,CONIP to connect to the IPI.
4) The kernel checks to see if the requesting slot was started as a result of
   a startup command or a crash restart condition.
5) Seeing that it is not an 'E' command from DDT, the kernel tells the IPI
   to reload itself.
6) The IPI sees the message to reload, doesn't recognize it, sends 354 to the
   PDP-10 and sends "I give up" to the Kernel, which crashes slot 1 again.
7) Go back to step 2, repeat every 4 seconds.

The original problem that caused step 1 is still unknown.  Any data about it
has been wiped out.  Dave Smith agrees this is a bug in the ISIS kernel.
Paul is trying a hack to the IPI code so it responds to message to reload
itself.

Subject: Research on FILAMO/FILAUU 

I wrote 2 quick programs...
  KILLER  - sleeps a second, then does .FORFA for LDBLOG on each frame
  CF      - creates a frame and runs LOGOUT in it

Running both of these programs has produced the following:

  1 crash - (SYS:32)CRA015 [FILAMO] at INSSP2 in FILFND
  2 jobs in CW state - stuck, I believe - both running KILLER

I think the jobs are stuck waiting for the context pages or the ATB for
jobs which have gone away?  Since they shouldn't be waiting for much else
with only 6-9 frames on the system.  When I just run a fresh copy of KILLER
it stays in SL state mostly...  When I startup CF then KILLER prints a $
for each frame it does the .FORFA on that doesn't have JNA set at the time
it does the FRMOP call, but did when it did the SYSDVF call 1 second before.

I will leave them stuck... maybe even start a few more to get stuck to see
the results.  Anyway, a wedged job or a cras is reproduceable!!!!

   All the files in BETATEST were marked bad by FULL DSKCLN on 4/16/88.
   I was called that day about 26 crashing during BACKUP on username
   BETATEST.  System was crashing because of these bad files.  After the
   Full DSKCLN all was OK.

   Probably oper left the bad files for user the see it but deleted
   (SYS)RECOV.SYS.  Any way, they are all gone now.

Subject: "Always clear OPER mail before"... 

Always clear OPER mail before running ASP.  The noname stopcode in SCHED1
is an indication that OPER had an unread MAIL message or LETTER.  This
problem does not usually show up because OPER's mail is usually cleared
before before running ASP.  (Running a FULL DSKCLN before ASP has a side-
effect of clearing mail when OPER logs in to run TAKEIT.) 

If the system crashes while trying to login to a READONLY system, bring
the system up MANUAL, login as OPER, then run TAKEIT and HANG the system.
At this point you will be able to come up READONLY.		/Joe

Subject: B39-P035/D-6 in NEWMON. 

Patch #6 (TTYZAP.PAT) has been tested on X32 and applied to (M33:39)39N35D.
It is in NEWMON as B39-P035/D-6 and is ready to be loaded.
Patch #6 tests if TTYZAP has been asked to send a zapper to a not-logged-in 
port.  If so, it outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 with the job # and program
name, then goes ahead and sends the zapper without a yellow ball.  This way
we can determine if a program running on B39 is causing the problem.

To refresh your memory: B39-P035/D-6 and X32-P035/D-6 both include the SCNSER
log of IRING/ORING traffic and treat TTYZNE as a DEBUG stopcode (which goes
to BOOTS on B39).

Paul will build new node code for BB2674 that will halt the Engine when the
slot crashes so that a dump of the Dispatcher rings can be made on hardcopy.
Operations should force 39 to take a dump when the Engine halts so that
SCNSER's rings and slot 1's rings can be compared.

Subject: Annoyance: Zappers send when INITIA detaches. 

TTYZAP.PAT outputs INFO stopcode TTYZP1 whenever SCNSER tries to send a
zapper to a port that is not logged in.  The idea is to catch programs
doing that.  Well, the patch has already caught one program, but not the
right one.

Whenever a program issues the ATTACH uuo with an argument of -1, the frame
is detached from its line.  If it is already detached, not thing happens.
If there is an LDB, SCNSER sends a zapper to that port.  The lines that
run INITIA at startup are a bit strange.  These TTYs have LDBs but to not
have TYMNET ports.  At system startup, 6 TTYZP1 stopcodes are output when
INITIA detaches from TTY0 thru TTY5.

We may have to live with this unwanted typeout until the real guilty
program makes its presence known.  It is my feeling that some program
which runs on B39 only is causing SCNSER to send bad data to the base and
the Dispatcher crashes the slot when it gets the bad data.  The bad data
is probably a legitimate message that is not allowed under certain conditions
(such as while the port is in the middle of logging in).

P.S.  Please bring the system up from (SYS)NEWMON.SAV, B39-P035/D-6

One obvious test we all overlooked - running the two pack DSKB on the
three strings using F30's monitor.  It works OK using X32's monitor, but
not using F30's or B39's monitor.  My guess is that some interrupt is
getting lost - it will require debugging at the CTY to find it.

was on call so she called me at home instead of activating the pager.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Mike Silva, (415)498-2588, System 30
Problem:  System 30 is moving to the drives system 32 has been running on.
          X32's monitor sees BPA0-7, BPA10-17, BPB0-7 as being present,
          BPB10-17 as unit error, BPC off-line.  That matches the hardware.
          F30's monitor sees BPA0-17 then hangs.  B39's monitor does the same.
Fix:      12:54/Joe Created KONEND.PAT and applied it to (SYS:30)NEWMON.SAV.


The patch was lifted straight out of CPXKON.MAC and is now part of BPXKON.MAC
in OSP on system 33.		/Joe

Subject: B39 crash 

  It looks as if the monitor tried to force a zapper on all ports when it
crashed the slot.  It seems that the monitor thinks that there is one more
port on the slot than does the dispatcher, so the zapper on port 7F caused
a slot crash.  In particular, I think that the monitor believes that there
are 127 ports, while the slot thinks that there are only 126 ports.  The
dispatcher doesn't check that the number of ports reported by the host in a
host status message is too large (it will never use more than the maximum
number defined in the slot control table anyway), so we never saw the dis-
crepancy).  I think that regenning slot 1 with one more port will fix this.

Subject: What happened to SCNSER? 

On System 33, there is no SCNSER.MAC....

I presume this means "all is lost" and we cannot build a monitor...

Actually, I presume this means it will simply not work in it's present state
and that Joe (?) is in the middle of doing something to it.  However, this is
not good... there should at least be a .MAC which was the last "good" .MAC
file for all of the source modules.

Please decide what would be the best .MAC file so that things which search the
monitor sources will not beak when something is missing (broken).  Thanks!

The great mystery has been solved!  Hurray!
The mystery was: Why does B39 crash with P035/A or later but no P034/P ?
                 Why does B39 crash but no other systems?
                 How can it be fixed?

The answer is: Delete (SYS)ZAP.SAV.

In July-86, the MOVE, DUPLIC and ZAP commands were added to the command table
to augment the COPY, RENAME, and DELETE commands.  This was added to P034/P31.
On all systems other than B39, typing the "Z" command produces the message
"?ZAP not found".  On system B39, it ran (SYS)ZAP.SAV, which has WC license.
That program sends zappers to all ports that are presumably not logged in.
(MPL)ZAP.INF says that the program should be run on both hosts connected to
the same Varian dual-base whenever the host was out of ports.  Because it
had WC, anyone could run it.  The TYM file for 39's base was set for 127
ports, numbered 0 through 126.  B39's monitor is set for 128 ports, numbered
0 through 127.  When ZAP.SAV sent a zapper to TTY177 (port 127), the ISIS
Dispatcher decided that was an illegal port number and crashed the EBUS slot.

Now that the problem has been located and fixed, I have disabled the TTYZP1
stopcode from B39-P035/D-6.			/Joe

SCNSER.MAC exists on X32 and was in the process of being TELECOpied to F33
when X32 was taken down (for F30 swap).  Renaming SCNSER.D05 to SCNSER.MAC
would have worked, however the correct version has been copied over now.

Osman:

Had no problem withthe ASP Dump for F22 - everything went fine.  Swapped
in different tapes for tapes number 8 and 9.

As usual there were tape drive problems, but nothing we couldn't handle.

Will see what happens on next scheduled dump.

Thanks Rick

Ray ..

Will you please send me some information about the KL10 diagnostics
which you patched to run on the KL10R's (MCA25 upgrade).  I wanted to
make sure that I am giving the correct information to the people
who are interested in using the patched diagnostics.  Information like:

  1. will it run on both models of KL10
  2. will it check all of cache and PT modules on KL10R's etc..

or anything else you can pass on.  Thank You.

P.S. John Healy is now responsible for making the diagnostic packs
     for the field.  I still have the floppy discs with the patch
     diagnostics which you made.  Should I give them to John Healy?

Subject: "D54's crash had the same buffered"... 

D54's crash had the same buffered message as D34 - INFO stopcode BASE just
before the IME stopcode.

Let me see if I've got this straigt:
18:11 D35 dies with a KL10 CLOCK STOP - FM PARITY.
18:11 D34 dies with IME stopcode (and has a buffered BASE stopcode).
18:18 D25 dies with APRFAT stopcode from NXM=Nonexistent Memory.
18:22 D54 dies with IME stopcode (and has a buffered BASE stopcode).
18:30 D65 dies with NONAME stopcode in SCNSER (it ran out of TTY buffers).
--:-- D56 did not die, mail from D56 is duplicate of mail from D65.

Was there a sudden burst of ionizing radiation in Dallas?  A power fluctuation?
D35 and D25 are hardware failures in the PDP-10, D34 and D54 look like a
failure in the base.  Very strange.

Subject: "is not a memory failure. The buffered"... 

(SYS:25)CRA001.SAV is not a memory failure.  The buffered output for the CTY
is the same as on D34 and D54 - "INFO stopcode BASE, Key: 0".  SCNSER got
an illegal memory reference (IME) trying to free up all the TTY buffers as
a result of zapping all ports due the the base crash.  However, due to the
way the EPT was set up to size memory, this particular IME got reported as
a NXM.  The chain of events was started when the EBUS base crashed.
D25, D34, D54, and possibly D65 all had base initiated crashes.
