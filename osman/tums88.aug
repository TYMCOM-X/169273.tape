Subject: EBUS and time 

Joe,
  Ron and I were a bit curious about the simultaneous crashes of the PDP-10s
in Dallas, and noticed that the base on all the machines that were crashed
by the EBUS had been up a bit over 41 days, which is about the resolution of
31 bits of FASTC.  It looks like the half-second logic in the EBUS saw that
FASTC wrapped, and we then got bit by the nature of signed arithmetic on a
68010.  The EBUS decided that a half-second had passed, looked for a key,
etc.  I guess I should change the branch to something other than BLT...
  I hope this resolves the problem.  Ron commented that this was real
familiar.  So we can get about 41 days 10 hours 12 minutes 20 seconds on
a base.

I had wondered about FASTC overflowing, but did not pursue it.
Friday must have been 41 days after the last power failure.

Paul Krumviede came up with this diagnosis: The "FASTC" clock on the Engine
overflows every 41 days 10 hours 12 minutes 20 seconds.  When this occurs,
the base mistakenly thinks the PDP-10 is not responding and crashes the host.

My diagnosis is that this causes "INFO stopcode BASE" with KEY=0.  In the
process of outputing this message, the PDP-10 dies with an IME stopcode
(or possibly an APRFAT with NXM).

Until new EBUS base code is generated, I suggest reloading the base
at least once a month, while the PDP-10 is down for PM or ASP.

NO ALL-FILES will be taken on 17 May.  An ALL-FILES, using SET #6,
will be started at 0000 (PDT), 24 May and will continue during ALL
SHIFTS until completed before 1600 (PDT) Friday the 27th.  If the
ALL-FILES completes before this time, a BACKUP will be taken.  A
FINAL backup will be taken after the System is SHUT.

Make a HARDCOPY directory of Tape #1 and keep with the ALL-FILES.

Final procedures for the conversion will be given to ALL SHIFTS the
week of 23 May.

Any questions, please contact me.

MCAUTO.Q has been taken care of.  I created a TECO-macro called SPLIT.TEC.
Using "MUNG SPLIT,MCAUTO.Q" produced MAILQ.100 thru MAILQ.348 - where each
message was stored in a seperate file.  I then used FINDIT to get a list
of the file names with their checksums.  Using the list sorted by checksums
I deleted all names from the list that had a duplicate checksum.  (For the
most part, only the messages from Office-8 showed up.)  The resultant CMD
file was given to "COPY @MAILQ.CMD" to append all the good messages together.
(Did you know the limit to "COPY 1+2+3+...+63,SUM" has a limit of 64 files?)
The end result was a new MCAUTO.Q that was 109 pages long, which was
processed with no further problems.  MAILQ.### and the old 1511 page MCAUTO.Q
have been deleted.

We have had similar problems twice before.  SMTP needs a command that will
refuse all mail from a particular host, giving it an error code that the
SMTP interface is temporarily out of service.

Joe - sorry the Tumsgate seems stressed.  My view is that I am not getting 
useable feedback from something.  Either Augment, or Tumsgate. I certainly 
never get any feedback from Profs.  The messages are representative of the 
reports we are distributing electronically and it is valuable to see if they 
make it completely in a useable form.

Is this the new Sun based Tumsgate?  If so, does that mean you are checking 
things out also?  We would treat it more delicately if we thought you were also
testing new stuff.  Too many variables at one time.

Thanks for your response to us.      Dave Carter
------------------------------------------------------------------

The TUMS gateway is system F29, a PDP-10 approximately 100 feet south of
Office-1 in Solar way.  Since Bill Soley has gone to the Turbo-Engine project,
the TUMS mail system is under the TYMCOM-X Support Group.  The TUMS gateway
has not changed for over 2 years.

I got involved when I notice that username MAIL was chewing up an inordinate
amount of CPU time.  There appeared to be two problems.
  1) The message was truncated, in that TUMS did not get the End-Of-Message
     indicator.  The log shows "time out waiting for command".  This is
     most likely a bug in the SMTP program on Office-8 because logged in
     another circuit and resent the entire message immediately.
  2) The message had no blank lines, and the body got smushed up into
     the header.
Problem #1 created a message queue that was 1511 disk pages long.  It
contained about 100 copies of 3 slightly different messages.  The only
difference was the subject: "Testing TUMS format with quick body" or something
to that effect.  When I sent the "please use smaller messages for testing"
message, I was under the assumption that TDC and/or YOUNG was repeatedly
sending messages manualy.  If Office-8 hadn't timed out or did not try to
resend the messages, there wouldn't have been a problem.

As a side note: I did see two copies of the message that did go out OK.
I believe it was 9 pages long and had lots of blank lines.  Sorry, I did not
take notice of the sender or recipient.

Jan,

    We noticed this problem Tuesday of last week,I cannot give you the names
of all the operators I personnaly spoke to,as I just asked for the sys 26
operator.I beleive Mike Walters spoke to a Mr lew.

   Our main problem is that due to the way Elf builds circuits to the DEC 10
systems,it is now impossible to access (SOURCE)ELFSLV.* because RF licence
is required.
   This problem is also seen when running (SOURCE)NAD from a command file
that does not have RF licence.

The user names we know have this problems are as follows.

BILLTEMP
MWALTERS
JSCREECH
TCLERK
BPTYME
                                                                Page  2


These are the names we know of,but their may be others who have not reported
the problem to us.


Best regards
John

John,
     
Osman Guven, Software Analyist, has told me that your SOURCE file has 
a protected shield. It was once removed, then recently it was added   
again. I presume it was added last week.
     
Osman said the only way to get to this file is to use RF license to   
clear security to access this file. Please let me know which OPER names    
need RF license. I will check to see if they are valid with RF license.    
If not I will add the userids with license. I will also need OPER
passwords for the new users. Please let me know what they should be.  
     
For security reasons, I can see why the person of (SOURCE)ELFSLV.* has
put a shield up. Since we don't know who owns this file, we can not call   
to announce your troubles.    
     
I sorry that this news is unpleasant. We hope to get you back in working   
order as soon as possible.

Subject: UPDUFD.PAT created to try to solve UFDER1 crashes on F29. 

It looks like the MAIL programs were trying to set the "dumped" bit on a
file that was marked for deletion.  The code in FILUUO:CLOSIN at CLOSRN
says to jump to CLSIN2 only if no one else is reading the file and the
file is NOT marked for deletion.  The crash shows that the ATB got marked
for deletion between the time it took to get from UPDUFD+0 to UPDUFD+14.
Since that section takes two page faults, there was time for this to occur.

Scenario:
1) Job 1 runs ONTYME or SMTPX or other MAIL program that creates *.FEM file.
2) Job 1 does a CLOSE trying to set the dumped bit (so that TITO won't store
   the FEM file to tape).  At the time, no other job is looking at the file.
3) While doing the CLOSE, job 1 gets a page fault while reading the RIB of
   the UFD and gets a page fault while reading the UFD data page.
4) While job 1 is waiting for disk I/O, jobs 2 deletes the file.
5) Job 2 lucks out, finds the UFD data before job 1 gets a chance to run, and
   the monitor removes the FEM file from the UFD data page.
6) Job 2 finally gets a chance to read the UFD data page, can't find the
   file (because it was deleted).   Crash with UFDER1.

Fix: Before calling DIRSRC to search the directory, make sure ATPDEL hasn't
     gotten set.

To isolate and/or fix the problem B39 is having, these are
suggestive steps to take.

o  Most of the system crashes in last 2 weeks always started
   with TTYZNE event stopcode, follewed by some number of BASE
   event stopcodes and than crashed with some kind of STOP 
   stopcode.  To find out more information about the crashes, 
   made the TTYZNE a STOP stopcode and monitor should goto
   BOOTS when it detects it.  A crash dump should be taken to 
   be  analized.

o  B39's Base code should be tested running with the same
   base code as the rest of the systems, which is:
   Node code version 5.10
   ISIS code version 7.01
   to see if B39 will run as well as the other PDP10s.

o  Put diagnostic patch in monitor to save I/O ring messages 
   between the Base and the PDP10 to find out the message sequences 
   just prior to crash.

o  Run one of the Fremont D. C. hosts with the same base code
   version as B39:
   Node code version: 5.22
   ISIS code version: 7.03
   to see if it will experience the same problem as B39 is having.

Present monitor on F26 will work when doing the PAGE coversion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Jan,

John is out of the office today so I will respond on his behalf.

The problem we are seeing has nothing to do with our personal RF licenses.

The problem can be defined as follows:-

When one is using ELF to load into a private network one must log into
the Dec-X system to "pull" down code for future loading. This is done by
instructing ELF to login and ELF automatically runs something that calls
the (SOURCE)ELFSLV program.
     This 'something' is now unable to start ELFSLV. If this were to happen
     on system 31 as well, ALL private networks supported from these
     2 hosts would be unable to function any further!

When we in the UK are changing code on our network we do final assemblies
via the PCOM/DCOM program in order to leave a trace file of the assembly
output.
     PCOM and DCOM are unable to read (SOURCE)NAD program anymore.

I believe that the problem is that either
     a) the RF licenses have been taken away from these programs
or   b) The Source directory has been changed.
                                                                Page  2


WHen referred to Jeff Liu at NTD on the ELF problem, he did manage to correct
the situation for a short time, but it came back.

I trust this will help in finding out what is going wrong.

monitors.)  On each system, OSP has P035D.MEM, P035D.DOC, STOPCD.MEM, and the
appropriate ##035D.SAV file.  A backup copy of ##035D.SAV is also on (OSP:33)
and 33's duplicate is on (OSP:34).

DMON.PAT is in M33 on all systems and has all patches up thru #7 for UFDER1.

The ##035D.SAV file in M33 on all systems was created from (OSP)##035D.SAV
using DMON.PAT.  They have the "###-P035/D-7" monitor.

Example of use:

System 37 added a second string of 3652 disks in March.  
1) Edit (M33:33)CONF37.MAC to add 2nd string, then "CPY CONF37.MAC/HOST:32".
2) GFD to OSP and run MONED1 there to create a new 37035D.SAV
3) TELECOPY from (OSP:33)37035D.SAV to (OSP:37)37035D.SAV
4) Login to 37 and apply DMON patches:
   GET (OSP)37035D
   DDT
   ^Y (M33)DMON.PAT
   SAVE (M33)37035D

To repeat: OSP has the virgin, unpatched monitor.  M33 has patches.

The new base code is stored in (EBUS:33)NW####.BND.
Duplicate copies are on (EBUS:25) and (EBUS:54) as appropriate.

Osman plans to test this new code before putting it into production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------   
     
     
     
In two weeks, I will be moving your accounts from F40 to D43. The move
will begin at 5pm pdt on June 3rd. 
     
A previous memo was sent to you on May 4th, listing all users found   
on F40. Several ids were found valid on a Dallas IBM host. These users
are responsible for moving their own files to Dallas. A memo regarding
information to transfer files to Dallas was sent on May 10th.    
     
Again, here is the list of userids that I will be moving to D-47:
     
MAINTFSC  
ABELE
AGTDMS    
CSS1 
CSS10
CSS11
CSS5 
CSS6 
CSS7 
CSS8 
CSS9 
DEPUY
FINNEGAN  
JACKT
LARRYB    
MIKEA
MORTON    
TDFOCUS

TDMSDB    
BAIGENT

JCCHEN    
JWILLOTT  
MIKEMO    
MSTRBRD   
NORTHRIP  
RBROWN    
SOLOMON   
SULRICH   
JCM  
     
And again, this is the list of userids that are responsible for moving
their files to Dallas by the closing of June 30th.
     
1213MGR   
OSMAN
TXSDOC    
ANVERM    
MOORING   
PKRUMV    
SALTYRON  
BUDGET    
     
And finally, this list contains users only valid on F-40 with one file:    
MAIL ADDRESS. These users will be removed from the move and will be   
removed from F40 on May 31, 1988:  
     
ARELLA    
FACILITY  
FSCLI
LAUVER    
WAGNERD   
WWPC 
WWPM 
BILLROD   
BROWNR    
CHINJEFF  
DBLISS    
GOLOBIC   
GUINASSO  
JGIUSTI   
KENNEDY   
KOLICZEW  
PATELN    
     
To ensure a smooth center-to-center customer move, the users that I am
moving must be FREE of bad files. If BAD FILES  are found on the day of    
the move, I will delete them from their directory.
     
Any users who have BATCH jobs, must be canceled on June 3rd and re-   
submitted on D-47.  
     
The users involved in this move, must be logged off at the time of the
move. This includes disconnect users. Any users found logged on when  
the move begins, will be messaged to log off within two minutes. After
a two minute lapse, the users will be forced off. 
     
If you have any questions, I can be reached at (415)498-2556.    
     
Thank you,
Jan

The new version prints the datestamp for each line on the current line
based on the time of the first character of the line instead of the old

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Plans are being formulated to convert System 33 from a BLOCK
monitor to a PAGE monitor starting on 2 July.  This conversion needs
to be done by ALL-FILES and will take approximately FIVE (05) DAYS
to complete once started.  Converting to a PAGE monitor will increase
the file storage by eleven percent (11%) and will handle the READ ERRORS
more effectively.

The system will be unavailable from 0000, 2 July (PDT) until approximately
2400, 6 July (PDT).

If this timeframe is unacceptable, please give us an alternate
timeframe.

Please contact McDonnel Douglas, Fremont Operations at (415) 498-2595
or Ontyme IPC.R/DANIELS with your proposals by 10 June.

Thanks

Sorry I took so long to get the BASE CODES in right system

Problem is: files are being deleted by some automated process
from (TYMNET) and (TYM5) directories.  Untill I find out what
is going on and why, you could use (EBUS) user name instead of
(TYMNET) and (TYM5) on D25, D54, F33.  (EBUS) userame is valid
on 25, 54, 33 and have the BASE CODES for all the systems.
Name of the BASE CODES are NWxxxxx.BND.

I will not be in tomorrow but if you have any question give me
a call at home or send mail. (408)224-5457.  Joe will be in
tomorrow if you want and need to you can call him at work also.

X17 is down - it printed out 60 pages of "Unit RMA0 Hung" before the CTY ran
out of paper.  I tried to restart it, but the system halts with
%HLTD 000102,,7xxxxxx.  I'm not sure what 102 means, but the PC is not that

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


During the past 18 months, the TYMCOM-10 Software Support Group, has
been a tremendous help in solving some long overdue problems on
these systems.

They have put in long hours to provide updated software for the
conversion of these systems from MEMOREX disk drives 3675's to 3650's
and 3652's; from BLOCK monitor to PAGE monitor; updated disk recovery
software; and numerous other software changes to improve the 
availability of these system for our customers.

The Fremont Data Center wishes to express our appreciation to:

     Craig FLETCHER

     Carl BALTRUNAS

     Osman GUVEN

                                                                Page  2

     Joe SMITH

for their untiring dedication, long hours and support for a smooth
transition during this period.

Subject: F30 problems & recovery 

Due to the apparent hardware problems with drive A1, it was not possible to
bring the system up for timesharing. The system was able to be brought up in
manual mode for disk inspection, however, none of the system files in (SYS)
were available.

I logged in "REFRESH MODE" and was able to run the disk reading programs and
disk repair programs (ASH and TSTSUP) from tape to determine the extent of the
damage to (SYS).  The retrieval block for [1,4].UFD contained garbage in
locations 131-777 which appeared to be UFD data.  Location 131 is the correct
word address for a UFD entry to start, so this confirms that somehow UFD data
was inadvertantly written into the RIB of the UFD instead of one of the UFD
data pages.  I cleared out the garbage data and fixed the pointers.

We also had read errors for the first BAT page and the third BOOT page.  I
copied the bad data for the BAT page to memory and corrected it.  After
rebooting the system, we ran ASP from tape to make an image copy of the bad
pack.  Then we restored the tape copy to a newly formatted pack.  All was
successful and the system came up with a FULL DSKCLN showing only 3 bad files.
Two of these were open when the system crashed and the third was caused by
a RIB error shortly before the first crash.

The message "BPB6 SECOND BAT BLOCK CONSISTANCY ERROR" was caused by the second
BAT page havinfg correct data which did not match the bad data from the first
BAT page.  This morning, I zeroed out the BAT page data to reflect running on
a newly formatted pack and this message should not occur anymore.

It is not completely certain that this was the only damage to the original
pack.  However, it was the only apparent damage to the file structure.  the
actions taken by the operations staff in taking the system down and calling
both hardware and software support was a significant aid in making the
successful recovery possible.

The following messages were found in "JZ(!.FEM" dated 28-Apr and "CA(!.FEM"
dated 13-Jun.  If TUMS dies for any reason (such as Illegal Memory Reference
or SAIL String Garbage Collect Error), it often leaves behind a *.FEM temp
file.  The way to recover is to recover is:
        DIR *.FEM
        RENAME *.FEM,MAIL.
        TUMS
        EXIT
If there are more than 2 *.FEM files, repeat the above procedure until they
are all taken care of.

Carl and Soley tell me the problem is in the way SAIL does its garbage
collection, which is part of the SAIL runtime routines.  It doesn't look like
this bug will ever be given the priority needed to fix it.

Paul noticed that the TYM files on F33 for nodes 6720 and 6415 were over a
year out-of-date.  In fact, the BND file for 6415 was also wrong.

When I added the changes to the TYM files, I assumed that TYMNET was keeping
the backup directory of (TYM5:33) up to date with the primary directory on
(TYM5:54).  (EBUS)NW6720.BND and (EBUS)NW6415.BND have been updated on
all three systems.

It only lists the Secretary number and the 800 number.

Need an answer on the following as soon as possible.

When Operators are using TAKEIT to take a system down for ASP dumps,
they are using deposit 1 in 30 in most cases when they get the message
"?can't halt frame with JACCT: job 2, user OPER <CHKPNT> RN".
Usually, they art at a -7 or -10 before entering the 1 in 30.

What I want to know is:

Is it a good practice to deposit 1 in 30?

How long should thy wait for this job to be HUNG?

Why doesn't it HANG JACCT within a reasonable amount of time?

Need clarification about HDEV, HDAT, SATFAILS, RIBS,
and THUNGS reported when running PSP on 3330's and 3350's.

ON 3330'S
---------

Are all of a serious nature that a FULL  disk clean should be
run before and after an ASP Dump?

At other times, if it can wait, should the system be scheduled
down for a FULL disk clean?

ON 3350'S
---------

Do we need to be concerned about HDEV errors and THUNGS?

If SATFAILS, HDAT, and RIBS show on the PSP, should a FULL
disk clean be run before and after ASP dump?

There seems to be a misunderstanding here on the above and I
want to get the correct information out about it.

As I seem to like to dredge up ancient history in this forum, these
thoughts sent me to my dusty closet of 'olde stuff' to fetch volume
1 (I also have V2) of a collection of papers produced by DEC called
"PDP-10 Applications in Science".
I think that I got this sometime in 1970, though most of the papers
seem to be from around 1967-1968.
The third paper in the book is

"Selecting and Evaluating a Medium Scale Computer System"
"A Study Undertaken for Louisiana State University at New Orleans"
by Jon A. Stewart, Director, LSUNO Computer Research Center

The paper is a summary of an in-depth comparison of three major
systems of the time; the SDS Sigma-5, the IBM 360/44, and the
DEC PDP-10. The paper is very fine at bringing back the memories
of the good old days, but of most interest to this discussion is
an appendix containing compiler-generated code for a simple
fortran benchmark.

The upshot was that the PDP-10 generated much shorter code,
that also ran faster. (I can publish a sample if there is
enough interest.)

While this paper drew no architectural conclusions (such as
are discussed in this forum) the main reason (if I
remember my DEC Propaganda of the day) was the very orthogonal
instruction set as opposed to a smaller number of instructions.

This clean and complete instruction set allowed the compiler
to use a large percentage of the instruction set. While I believe
that the clean instruction set came first, and the compiler
that used the large percentage of that instruction set came later,
rather than the current risc idea of profiling code to determine what
will be in the instruction set, it was a haunting hint of where
we would be today.

I recall seeing published statements about how many of the KA-10's
366 instructions were actually used by the FORTRAN compiler.
Does anyone still have these numbers??

I also have some DEC Propaganda from about 1973 bragging about
the optimization done by DEC FORTRAN. This includes examples
of generated code. Again, if anyone is interested...

The list of files with read errors came from a log file on F33 created 22-Jun
at 5:00am.  The files themselves look good; they have the right checksums now.
I believe the files got marked bad when the disk hardware acted flakey (the
system couldn't read RIB or data pages) but that's been fixed.  Any more
news as to what when wrong with the hardware?  /Joe

Subject: Strnage behavior? 

I looked at the ?ill mem ref for SYSDAT and it's kinda strange.  The code is
somehow mangling the byte pointer which initially points into page 777 and
in adjusting it to point to the right offset (using a subtract) the byte ptr
becomes ['10677,,-1].  The illmem ref appears when LDB 11,PTR is executed
and PTR contains the value in brackets above.

Don't ask me... but I think an illmem ref for 310000 or 50533 is out-to-lunch.
Someone has gotten the wrong info from somewhare.

Joe: any ideas?  Osman:  Isn't this strange behavior for hte hardware?
Any: Am I missing something rather obvious?

Hi,

I'm developing programs for both DEC VAX (VAX/VMS Ada compiler) and
SUN-3 (Alsys Ada compiler). I need to use some form of conditional
compilation. The Alsys compiler has the BEGIN_COMPILE/END_COMPILE
pragmas to control the compilation but I have not found any similar
mechanism for the VAX/VMS compiler. Can anybody out in Adaland tell
me how to do conditional compilation with the VAX/VMS compiler?

The LRM contains a reference [10.6] to conditional compilation but
it seems rather cryptic and it is not obvious to me how I could use
it in practice.

From this message it is obvious that DEC makes an Ada compiler for VMS, and
Alsys makes an Ada compiler for Unix, Sun in particular.

SUBJECT>   Checking NODE CODE Loads


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


On the TYMCOM-10's there is a utility  that identifies date and time,
slot, user and directory that a specified  file(s) was accessed on the
TYMCOM-10 currently logged into.

For example, I want to know when anyone loaded node or slot code for 
node 2430.  The output of this request and the full session is listed below.
The program is FIND.SAV.  To execute it, you must log into the system
you suspect the code was loaded from.  The code and documentation is located
in the SPL directory.

The following is the node 2430 session example:

R (SPL)FIND

Target 1:  2430.      For all occurrances of "2430." in my specified file.
                      Be sure to put a 'period' after the number.

Target 2: <cr>        At this point, more search strings could be entered
                      but this is all I'm interested in.  Also, rather than
                      2430 as a string, I entered 2430. to capture all
                      occurrances of ##2430.* and also avoid capturing
                      other loads that happened to be done where the time
                                                                Page  2

                      stamp had the string 2430 in it.

search in: .R         This is where all commands are entered.  ".R" to
                      file all lines containing "2430." in them.

Recording file: RICK.TMP      This is my file name.

search in: (SYS)LOADII.ACC     Search for "2430." in file (SYS)LOADII.ACC.

(SYS)LOADII.ACC: 1 (14)       Target 1 found 14 times.

search in: .Q         At this point, more command could be entered like ".T"
                      to enter new targets, etc.  ".Q" entered to close
                      file RICK.TMP and end the session.

The following is the file RICK.TMP and the format is the following:

File name that was searched:

DATE ! START TIME ! STOP-TIME ! ? ! SLOT ! LOADII-CMD ! SUCCESS !
USERNAME ! FILE-NAME ! NEIGHBOR ! LINE-# ! NETWORD ! ? ! ? !TARGET #) !
"STRING" ! # OF MATCHES

***********************************************************************

(SYS)LOADII.ACC

(PAGE 1)...
110485 155656 16 1 1        LD OK OPER  (TYMNET)ND2430.`BND 2355 1

************************************************************************

To obtain the above file, enter TYP RICK.TMP on terminal.

This could be useful for resolving erroneous code load problems, etc,
and can be tailored by inputing the appropriate search string.

This only lets you know if the code was loaded from the right directory
with the correct filename.  It does not tell you what version was loaded.

The output on the CTTY when the code is loaded should report the current
version loaded.

Subject: Found cause of F74 crashes with /D06. 

The dispatch table for the AUXCAL uuo was getting trashed.  This table was
followed by a table with counts of TTCALL uuos, called TTCCNT which was
set up for 20 entries (0 thru 17 octal).  The problem is that UUOCON sometimes
calls the TTYUUO routine with a negative number in accumulator W, such as
for "leave defered echo".  The instruction AOS TTCCNT(W) when W was negative
caused the damage.  This damage would not be noticed until the next poor
sucker tried to read the terminal CLASS setting.

Fix: Add room for -5 thru -1 to TTCCNT.    /Joe

Joe;

Would like to comply with your request to bring all Fremont Systems

The last time we brought F33 and F74 up on this monitor we had to
back off.  Have not heard if these were fixed.

My understanding is we do not bring anything up on NEWMON or any other
software unless I receive mail from Ingrid LOPES in Ed Roops department.

The bug in the SYSDATa program has been fixed!!! So, the CTYLOG output is
again being collected on all systems [except 32 which has been down].

Joe: By re-arranging the order of a couple of operations, everything now
     works as intended.  The problem was caused whenever data was added~
     to the log and the previous data ended exactly on a page boundary.

The new version is %2(17) and is installed on (SRA) on all systems except
the test system :32.  WHen 32 comes up, I will copy it over.

Subject: Free space on system 33. 

Just before the conversion, F33 was almost 100% full on 24 units.
Formatting in pages allows for 7 pages per track instead of 25 blocks per
track.  (7 pages = 28 blocks.)  The ratio of 28 to 25 is 1.12 = +12 %.
This makes 24 logical units in pages the equivalent of 26.88 block units.
The added 2.88 units at 103500 pages per makes for about 298000 pages free.

F33 now has 288270 pages free.  It's a lot better than the low of 14697 pages
it got down to on 30-Jun.				/Joe

Yes, it is a very good idea as to not to refer to X32 as "SPARE"
system.  SPARE has the connotation of being dispensable which
I don't like our system being refered to.

By the way, Joe tested the 41 day crash on the base successfully.

Subject: F30's problem was an off-by-one bug in ONCE. 

EVASIZ has the highest unused address.  When EVACLR rounded it up to a page
boundary, it did so using a method that failed if EVASIZ just happened to
be on a page boundary.  In particular, the monitor asked for memory up to
and including address 744777, which made EVASIZ be 745000 (the first unused
location).  The old code using IORI T4,777 and ADDI T4,1 would round that
up to address 746000, instead of leaving it at 745000.  (A kludge to get
around the problem was to bump PATSIZ up by a couple of pages - incrementing
it by any number that was not a multiple of 145 did the trick.)  The file
EVACLR.PAT has been created, and added to DMON.PAT as patch #8.   /Joe

(MPL)CTYLOG reads and displays all output to the CTY that is still in the
buffer.  Once it's caught up, CTYLOG sleeps waiting for new messages to
appear in the buffer.  When they do, these messages are reported to your
terminal in real-time.  If you are running CTYLOG at 4:00, 8:00, or 12:00,
you will see the BIGBEN messages on your terminal at the same time they
show up on the CTY.

CTYLOG will keep watching and sleeping until you type a RETURN.

Rourke McCusker (the head of QSATS) had a problem that when he typed

was working yesterday.  That obscure error message really means that one

SUBJECT>   Converting System 39 To A PAGE Monitor


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


To give system 39 more disk space, Fremont Data Center is planning
on converting it to a PAGE monitor the weekend of 6 - 7 August 1988.
Converting to a PAGE monitor from a BLOCK monitor picks up about 11%
of free pages on each unit.

While doing this conversion, system 39 will be unavailable for
approximately 48 hours.

Please discuss this with your Group/Users and let Fremont Data Center
know if this timeframe is acceptable.  It is is not, let the Center
know when it can be done.

Thanks

Subject: Dispatch wants us to close incidents. 

A typical call to Central Dispatch goes like this:
  o  The Data Center has a problem that may be software, they call Dispatch.
  o  Dispatch opens an incident number, pages us.
  o  We call Dispatch, get system number, this marks incident as answered.
  o  We look at problem, fix it, or tell them it's a hardware problem.
  o  Third Party Maintenance fixes the hardware, opens a new incident number,
     gives Dispatch a code number for what was replaced, closes the incident.
  o  Third Party happens to notice an open incidence number pertaining to
     the system they just fixed, and closes it for us.

We have been unaware of that last step.  If it is not done, a timer
automatically escalates it.  If the original incident was logged on Friday
evening, it may escalate to the Regional Manager by Monday morning.

To avoid this in the future, we need to be sure to get the incident number
when answering the page from Dispatch, and to call Dispatch back when we
are done working on the call.  The incident number needs to included in the
mail sent to MONITOR and included in (M33:33)HOTLIN.LOG.

Reason for transmittal of code:
-------------------------------

This release (19-Jul-88) consists of patches to the 68K object code
only.  All changes are stored in EBUS02.O00 ('oh', 'zero', 'zero').

Fix problem with restarting after a Dispatcher crash.
The symptom was that the IPI would immediately crash when the
slot was restarted, causing the slot to crash again.  After
several repetitions, the 68010's stack would overflow and the
entire Engine would have to be reset.

Fix problem with the base zeroing out the PDP-10's ring pointers
when the base was restarted.

Fix problem with the base crashing the PDP-10 host for no
apparent reason 41 days and 10 hours after the node was loaded.

Craig,
  As per the FAX that I received from Jerry Swanson requesting info on the
expert system that I will be working on.  [I did NOT bring a copy of the
newly written objective we discussed this week home.]  Could you please
check the enclosed info and send me a response via PDP-10 mail rather than
ONTYME as to content and the correct titles of the experts.

  Our titles probably don't matter, but since this is to be published for
all of ISC, I would appreciate that we all agree on titles so that Bill K
and each of us have no objections.  I don't care whether I am a Sr Systems
Programmer, or Sr. Systems Software Engineer, Maintenance Software E...  I
feel that we shoul dbe consistent among ourselves.

Joe,  any comments? please CC: Craig

Craig,  please indicate Osman's title,  I do not know if he is Sr or not as
        far as official titles are concerned, since he is definately Sr in
        his hardware knowledge!

Craig,  we didn't give the project a title, and I recal talking about a
        disk-repair expert system, so I wanted to clarify what our objective
        was to match the project to your job objective and mine.

Am I presuming too much in saying we will pool the knowledge from all three
experts?  Should I include anyone else?  (For diagnosis, i don't know if
anyone other than Craig could be added; Craig is good at pulling information
out of all of us in a directive manner;  For planned response/repair there
may be help from Rick or BIll R?  comments?)

PS.  I realize I should have asked this stuff while I was at the office, but
     my brain was on vacation even though I was at the office.

The July 11, 1988 issue of Federal Computer Week has an editorial
written by Fred Reed ("Ada: A View From the Field", page 19) which
supposedly presents both the pros and cons of Ada. The following
quotes are representative:

"What follows is one man's opinion, but it is an informed opinion --
he programs in Ada as well as C and other -- so I thought it was worth
passing along. We'll call him Bob because, Ada being a fairly sacred
cow, he didn't want to be named."

"... Ada has been called everybody's favorite 17 programming
languages." 

"Fewer programming errors. Among other features, Bob explained, Ada
has what are called strong typing and range checking. Strong typing
means that the programmer is forced to tell the computer the nature of
each piece of information he uses. This allows the machine to be sure
incompatible kinds of information are not mixed."

"Ada, said Bob, is well suited to being understood and maintained by
many programmers who will work on a large program over its lifetime.
This is why it saves money, he said."

"However, he noted, these strength also result in weaknesses. For
example, the programmer has to write extra code to do the strong
typing and range checking, and this, among other things, makes Ada
code slow to write."

"Further, because the program constantly has to check ranges and data
types as it runs, Ada produces much slower programs than some other
languages.

"An Ada program typically runs a tenth as fast as the same program in
C," said Bob. "I think we are seeing the bureaucratic attitude at its
ultimate. Ada is a prudent approa

ch to software. It is defintely
suboptimal in performance -- slow, bulky, verbose and slow to write.
But it is reliable and easy to work with after it is written. It is
safe. These are qualities prized by bureaucrats. DoD chose reliability
over performance."

     Osman, please note the attached Ontyme message from NIS (Japan).
 
     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Rick,
     
This morning on Japan, we have a problem about MAGNUM access on F74, maybe 
you know. I checked F-center on it and was respounded that it would be
followed at noon.   
Then, this afternoon, i tried and found some MAGNUM access was OK, however 
some MAGNUM access still have the problem. We, NIS,may be requested by
the Japanese users some conpensation about the problem, because adding
the current problem they have the big problem at the begin of this month.  
     
        1. NIS must explain about the problem to the customers.  
                What was happened on F74.    
                What was the cause.
           Please let me know it in detail.  
     
        2. Some user still has the problem. Some user can not use MAGNUM yet.   
           So please advise us how we can repaire it or what you can do for it. 
     
           Major usernames which is indicated messages from the system saying   
           the file was damaged.

           Especially, about MVX, it seems that the files on MAGNUM which  
           was not mentioned in the message was garbled. Simple command on 
           MAGNUM is NOT available. Please advise ASAP.
     
           I attached sample log of MVX access for your reference.    
     
NIS, and the customers want to repaire it by the next Monday morning. 
So please reply ASAP.    
     
Best regards,

     Osman, please note the attached Ontyme message from NIS (Japan).
 
     They're having problems with Magnum on host F74, and it's not appar-
     ant to me what must be done to fix the problem.
 
     I note no one from the Tymcom X support group was copied and Rick
     Daniels is presently out of his office, although I have phone call
     into him.
 
     Hopefully, we can identify and fix the problem prior to Japan's Mon-
     day (Sunday afternoon).
 
     Let me know if I can be of assistance.  Thanks and regards,
     Ken (x 6473).

Tracking down MM interlock problems on an SMP system is very nasty.
I looked at it, and found nothing obvious.  My guess is that it will take
over a week of solid looking to find the problem, which will undoubtedly
require a change to the software to fix.  As I understand it, this would
exceed the amount of software support we have promised (if any) to this
customer.  I'll leave it at that.     /Joe

I put the BOTLOD routine into PAKCOP.  It is in (M33) on 33 and 26 only and
needs to be tested to verify that adding the new routine to load BOOTS did
not impact anything else.   /Joe

Contact:  Fremont Operations, L T Smith, (415)498-2588, System 32
Dispatch: Called me at home, said they paged me twice with no response,
          however L T's page came thru (I was outdoors in Fremont at the time).
Problem:  X32 had  3 crashes after Lenny replaced some boards, an IME, a UIL,
          and PAGP3R.  System ran DSKCLN with no problems, died only while
          running diags (such as MEMEXR or XCORE).  Lenny wanted to know
          if this IME is the same as the previous ones.
Diagnosis:  IME caused when PC was set to the middle of CTYLOG.  There were
          no tracks as to how it got there.  The IME is not related to the
          SKIPLE J,.CPJOB problem this CPU was having earlier.

Contact:  Fremont Operations, Debbie Hightower, (415)498-2588, System 32
Problem:  Lenny was running diagnostics, trying to reproduce the problem on
          CPU 1336 (B39).  The two-pack test system would fail, but diags
          wouldn't.  Between the time I was paged and when I answered,
          DDQCB failed on bit 27.  All he needed at this point is verification
          that it was the same bit that was set in the IME dumps.

Thanks for your support on that matter. 
     
However, now, we still have the problem on username MVX:74. 
We still have the Fatal MAGNUM Error as I am indication with attachement

Subject: "The TYM file for node 4200 has"... 

The TYM file for node 4200 has some discrepencies which may have caused
NW4200.BND to fail.  It has ZITEL=0, NDP=128, and CONSAT=0 whereas all the
other EBUS bases have ZITEL=1, NDP=256, and CONSAT=1.  ZITEL=0 is valid
only for MAC I with core memory, not MAC II with semiconductor memory.

The new TYM file has been telecopied to (EBUS) and the new BND file has
been stored in (TYMNET:25) and (TYMNET:33)NW4200.BND.

Please try this file on the next scheduled reload of D34.    /Joe

        File access this Memo: (BETATEST)MEMO.962 
     
        Product Name:    E-BUS BASE FOR PDP-10    
        Code Version:   02.00        DATE:07/20/88
        Release Document:     (BASELINE)EBUS02.X00
        Release Description:  (BASELINE) NONE
        Modified Files:       (SOURCE)  
                                        EBUS02.O00   JOXRUW 
                                        EBUS02.W00   WEBSIR 
     
        Test Site Location(s): X32, all PDP-10 systems in Fremont Data Center   
     
        ================================================================   
        Summary of Changes:   
     
        Engine code now drives front panel.  
        Engine code now contains Operation Monitor.    
        68K code has been completely rewritten!   
        There now exists an ERS and an IMS for this product.
.    
        This release (19-Jul-88) consists of patches to the 68K object code
        only.  All changes are stored in EBUS02.O00 ('oh', 'zero', 'zero').
        The new checksum for EBUS02.O00 is JOXRUW.
.    
        Fix problem with restarting after a Dispatcher crash.    
        The symptom was that the IPI would immediately crash when the 
        slot was restarted, causing the slot to crash again.  After   
        several repetitions, the 68010's stack would overflow and the 
        entire Engine would have to be reset.
.    
        Fix problem with the base zeroing out the PDP-10's ring pointers   
        when the base was restarted.    
.    
        Fix problem with the base crashing the PDP-10 host for no
        apparent reason 41 days and 10 hours after the node was loaded.    
.    
        ================================================================   
        This  Code is intended for general deployment. 
     
        This  code is now  available on  NTD's  system 39.   For Tymnet    
        release  date and system information,  contact  Tymnet  Quality    
        Assurance.  
     
        Testing  should  be coordinated with JOE SMITH

As of 27-Jul-88, the new (SOURCE)EBUS02.O00 is on D25, D54, and F33.
This means that if PI (Project Implementation) makes a new BND file for
any base, they will automatically get Krumviede's patches.

     Ogura-san, received your Ontyme of today regarding F74 file problems.
     Rick Daniels is not in office today, so I cannot obtain additional
     information at this time.
 
     I am unclear as to the reliability of F74 Disk drives this week.
     Hopefully Rick and/or Mike Bellopatrick can supply you with present
     status, if this problem has continued during recent days.
 
     For your information, I've not seen message A25087 from Mike.
 
     As I'm sure you realize, we do not have personnel here to analyze and
     solve Magnum problems.  If the issues relate to hardware, IPC Ops.
     can respond accordingly; if they involve Tymcom X software other
     than Magnum, the Tymcom X Support group can analyze and solve.
 
     Accordingly, I'm requesting that Rick supply you with an update on
     the present status of F74 hardware problems, as they may be responsi-
     ble for the problems you're experiencing.
 
     Regards. Ken

Ken san,
 
Thank you for your support on our service on F74.
 
Right now, NIS found some file problems on F74.
Please pass this OnTyme to appropriate person.
 
Flat file problem:
 
        From Jul's 25th evening to 26th evening in JST, files  (MPPC:74)
        SHOHI.A29 and/or SHOHI.X29 were garbled. They are the element of ISAM
        and I don't know which one (or both) is garbled. 
        Yesterday, the user who is the owner of the username MPPC pointed out
        that illegal figures appeared in their reports. So, NIS checked, found
        the problem, and could recovered.
        Now, NIS is requested to explain the cause of the problem by the user,
        because he know troubles on Jul, (04th, 06th, and 21st), and is afraid
        of reliability of our host.
        
        Please check and let me know what was happened.
 
MAGNUM problem:
 
        Kazuo Watanabe got the all files of MVX:74 at 18th JUl from the backup
        files of the Fremont center, and we found the MAGNUM error at the 
        execution of programs on the (restored) MAGNUM. From 18th to 20th Jul,
        we could execute the programs without problem every day.
        I attached the execution log with this OnTyme, so please check it.
        You can find the fatal MAGNUM error at the middle of the log.
 
        So the MAGNUM is seeemed to still have a problem. Please check and 
        advise me.
 
        Also, Mike Bellopatrick mentioned in his OnTyme #A25087 about the
        missing MAGNUM file on MVX:74, so please let me know what kind of file
        is missed, and it's id if possioble.  ######.M??    .... ?
 
Again MAGNUM problem:
 
        Today, we found a magnum text file P.REP01(exec level id is MG5WI9.ME2)
        of TYMPAS (the name of the schema) on NETBILL:74 was garbled without
        explicit file modification in past 2 weeks. About the file, no warning
        is indicated. Regarding the file, it is recoverble, however we are
        afraid that there are this kind of silent garbled files which are not
        found by our check, yet.
 
All those problems have no explicit relation with the trouble on 21st Jul,
we can only supporse they were caused by it, however it is the fact that
after the trouble, we find this kind of file (especially MAGNUM file)
problems frequently. We feel something was wrong on F74. So please check it 
again and let me know the status.
 
At this moment, we find the problem on MAGNUM in MVX:74 and NETBILL:74.
And I hope no more MAGNUM id which has the problem appeared.
 
Best regards,
Makoto

Makoto;

Read through your Ontyme  M79463 today.  I do not know that much about
MAGNUM, only enough to clear up errors that we may have on our own, which
I learned from the MAGNUM Group that use to be here.

What I did this morning is the following:

The last change to relation SHOHIN.FIL terminated abnormally.
Some of the last changes have possible been lost.
The structure of the RELATION has possible also been damaged.
Do you want MAGNUM to attempt RELATION structure recovery?  I answered Y here.
Structure recovery is complete.
The RELATION structure is internally consistent, however,
Data loss may have occurred.  Execution proceeds.

The last change to relation GOZAN.FIL terminated abnormally.

(The same recovery procedures reported here and I did the same as above)

As menioned before, there may still be some files garbled on System 74,
but we have no way of knowing which ones until the USERS lets  us know.

The files can be restored if the Users know which ones they are from the
lastest all-files and backups.  Even after doing this, the User may have to
recreate some files.

Fremont Data Center needs to schedule this system down for the next three
Fridays in order to check-out/replace some HDA's  It is imperative that
system 74 be scheduled down this coming Friday to start this work.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: F74 SAT.SYS rebuild 

This afternoon, I had to rebuild the RIB to SYS:SAT.SYS while the system
was still up.  They had a SATRED error for a sat-page on logical unit 4.
The page was legitimately bad, could not read/write it.  I suggested they
PAKCPY it out as soon as possible, since DSKCLN would get upset trying to
re-write the SATs the next DSKCLN.

While checking, I looked at the rib, and gee-golly-oh-my it was garbage!
I was going to clear HRE on SAT.SYS initially, but hmmm...  So, I told
Rick what was going on and began the repair.  I rebuilt it using the RIB
from system F33 (also 365x's formatted in pages) as the template.
  Details:  Used PEAK to create FOO.DDT showing all page pointers then
            ^Y (read command file in DDT) in TSTSUP to do most of the
            typing in... 18 units x 13 page pointers ...

Anyway, all said and done, the system crashed for SAT2ND on a different
page on the same logical unit 4, before I could clear HRE from the status
bits in [1,4]UFD entry for SAT.SYS.  DSKCLN found my reconstructed RIB
to specification and the system came up.  I then fixed the UFD entry.

Again, if this tool we talked about last week existed, the reconstruction
would not have been necessary, a simple page copy would have been enough!

Rick and Ken san,   
     
Thank you for your investigation about the problem.    
However, the problem is growing more and more seriously for NIS. 
     
Today we found other problems on F74 regarding the MAGNUM files. 
     
1. MFUDO  
     
        Another garbled MAGNUM relation file of a customer was found this  
        morning. The relation is PLAC.FIL of MFSAIS(schema) on MFUDO:74.   
        The MFSAIS sesmed to be OK past one week, however last night monthly    
        reporting process on MFSAIS was executed and the garbling was found.    
        The file was heavy damaged and was very hard to recover. 
     
        Also we found some strange matter that the relation had 2 instances
        for one key value!!  For long time, we believe the key is an unique
        value insuch kind of file, but today we knew it was not fit the    
        actual filing system. 
        I've copied the all in the schema into username NISADM:74.    
        So please check it by yourself as follows.
     
                -GFD NISADM   
                -MAGNUM MFSAIS
                :DO FILE OGURA.CHK 
     
        Then you can get 2 instances which have the same key value.   
     
        Anyway Tadashi Takahashi is working to recoverthe MFUDO's system,  
        but he expects it is hard to recover whole data on the D/B and we  
        may be requested some compensation from the customer for the lost  
        of the data.
     
2. MPPC   
     
        A procedure of schema AIS on MPPC:74 had been broken sometime and  
        the last night's overnight execution was aborted by it.  
        So this morning, we, the customer and NIS, had to check the system 
        and made recovery shoot.   
        About the matter, we were complained by the customer because the delay  
        of reporting with checking and recovery was very critical for their
        monthly reporting processing which was done just this period of the
        month. 
        And, for the past few month, this user faced host problem at their 
        monthly processing every month. 
     
3. MAGNUM Command problem
     
        Some MAGNUM commands like  
                CRE .....
                BACKUP ....   
        are not enable, and (after we made arrangement to get the logging for   
        it) after re-login we find the commands work without problem. 
     
        About the matter, we have no evidence, however we experienced the  
        same problem few days ago. 
     
4. MVX    
     
        Schema AIS of MVX, as I mentioned many times in my OnTyme, was prepared 
        for some important project of NIS. But, as I mentioned too, it was 
        heavily garbled. So Kazuo Watanabe let it to go back at 18th Jul and    
        tried to execute 18th, 19th, and 20th operation on the schema.
        However it was failed by MAGNUM FATAL ERROR.   
        Andtoday, he tried to recompile schema and found also the MAGNUM FATAL  
        ERROR. 
     
5. Internal Billing 
     
        Our internal billing system is also damaged. (Maybe recoverble)    
     
     
From the observation of F74and MAGNUM past 2 weeks, we feel they are very  
un-stable. And the check for the machine, as Rick mentioned, is needed for 
the current and future service.    
However, please advise us what you can do for the those garbled files and  
systems.  
     
We feel and afraid that we find more non-awared garbling for the coming two
weeks, because the almost of monthly processing of the users are going to be    
executed for that period.
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

     Ogura-san, received your latest memo regarding F74 Magnum problems.
 
     Although we all appreciate and sympathize with the problems you are
     experiencing with Magnum internal file corruption, we can do little
     or nothing to solve the problems associated with Magnum code or
     files.
 
     As I have mentioned in past Ontymes, we have no remaining expertise
     with Magnum here at our facility, or anywhere in the U.S. for that
     matter.
 
     It is my feeling that NIS has the Magnum knowledge necessary to ana-
     lyze and correct the problems better than anyone else (i.e. re. MFUDO
     relation which reflects 2 instances for one key value: I assume it
     will be necessary to dump the relation to a 'flat' file and make nec-
     essary adjustments).
 
     However, we also realize the problems you are reporting are due to
     hardware disk failures on host F74.  Operations and the maintenance
     staff are doing everything possible to remedy these problems.
 
     I strongly suggest you keep close records of all problems, for future
     credit request requirements, and keep me posted on these problems if
     you wish.

     I'm not trying to discourage your communication to us on such issues,
     but wish to emphasize that we can do very little to assist you in
     resolving Magnum file corruption problems.
 
     We're all hopeful the hardware problems will be resolved soon.
 
     Best regards. Ken

Ken san,  
     
Thank you for your OnTyme.    
     
Today we could get more information about the current MAGNUM atatus.  
     
MAGNUM commands as  
     
        COPY TEXT .... TO FILE ....       and
        BACKUP ......  TO ......   
     
are not available on some schemas with error message "User Directory Access
Error", and available on other schemas. It depends on the directory which the   
schema is located. And if the destinaton file is not-existing (i.e. new) file,  
the problem is not appeared.  
The  problem is reproducable on the specific schema as 
     
                ONTYME.DB on DISTRICT239:74, 
                MMCAIS    on MMETAL:74, and etc.  
     
We guess the matter points is a part of MAGNUM copy mechanism which copies 
a MAGNUM file to a exec file as new file. And also, we found , on the same 
schema, a mechanism reading record from MAGNUM file and writing it onto exec    
(new) file works without problem, because    
     
        LIST FROM ..... TO ..... and    
        MAGNUM report writing 
     
has no problem.
     
I tried the COPY and BACKUP commands after the schema recompiling, however 
the problem still be appeared.
     
     
As you understand, this problem is very serious for NIS and reliability of 
MDC's RCS service in Japan.   
     
     
After host moving to F74 last autumn, we experienced heavy host problems every  
half a year, the cash memory trouble for over two months at the begin of this   
year and this disk un-reliability problem from Jun.    
Then our customers are going to feel something critical to operate their   
system, especially the financial system, on our service.    
     
I wonder that someone in IPC mentioned his MAGNUM on F74 had no problem, and    
hope he has no hidden problem as we are having.   
     
We know, you have no team for MAGNUM at this moment, however Mr. Matsumori,
the president of NIS, may not agree to pay the MAGNUM fee for such unstable
MAGNUM service and support, but may indicate some compensation from MDC for NIS.
     
At this moment, we can't evaluate the current MAGNUM on F74 run normally or not,
and only thing we need it to offer stable MAGNUM service to the customers. 
The simple example of the stable service is that the MAGNUM command, which 
I mentioned above,should work normally in anytime in any schema. 
     
Can we continue the MAGNUM service on F74 or should we change the service host  
to another host(X) ?
     
Please advise us.   
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

Ken san,  
     
Over Saturday and Sunday, we checked major relations and procedures of
customers on F74 by recompiling the procedures and accessing all instances 
for the relations. And we found several problem, however they were recovered.   
     
MFUDO's Problem
     
  However, about MFUDO's schema, by this moment, NIS can't complete to recover  
  it's destroyed data even though Tadashi Takahashi tried to do for last three  
  days.   
     
Problem   
     
  Right now, we still have the system reliability problem of MAGNUM.  
     
        1. Kazuo Watanabe recreated (NOT only recompile schema) the schema on   
           MVX:74, and found some program on the schema run normally sometime,  
           and run abnormally sometime without explicit changing for the program
           and execution environment.   
     
        2. And, I'm not sure this is related with the current problem, one of   
           person reported that temp files which was created by MAGNUM are still
           remained when he logged off all usernames related the directory (at  
           Saturday ecening) then logged in again (at Monday morning).
     
  I'm sorry I can not indicate the evidence for both case, but I feel something 
  unstable about F74 and MAGNUM.   
     
The Current Status  
     
  Again at this moment we can't evaluate what is incorrect. 
     
        - The current MAGNUM processer ?
        - Individual files on the MAGNUM schema ? 
        - Something others ?  
     
  Please set up the MAGNUM processer in normal status, or please point out 
  what is wrong if the cause is being outside of the MAGNUM.
     
     
Counter Plan   
     
  To avoid future problem, I'd like to discuss following matters.
     
        1. Moving host from F74 to other host.    
           Because almost of the current problems are believed to come from
           the disk problem. If we can get another host, the MAGNUM on that
           host works without problem. (Of cource, the support for MAGNUM has   
           still problem.)    
     
        2. Special BACKUPs for NIS's customer
           We supporse the backup operation at the center is taken when our
           our customers are operating their files by the time difference  
           between Japan and USA. So the restore operation from the backups
           is very complicated. Please arrange Following special backup for
           NIS.
     
                - NIS indicates file-list file containing username and file
                  ids.   
                - NIS indicates username-list file containing usernames.   
                - Center execute backup for all files indicated in the file-    
                  list file at 06:00 JST (Start 06:00 JST, and end the
                  operation within two hours, if possible.) every day through   
                  Monday to Friday/Saturday in JST.    
                - Center execute backup for all files under the usernames  
                  indicating in the username-list file at 06:00 of Sunday JST.  
                - All data should be remained for one month. (i.e. it's need    
                  31 Mag Tapes for this operation.)    
                - Backup information (backup starting time, backup ending time, 
                  file-ids, file creation date & time, size, etc.) for every    
                  operation is informed to NIS as on-line file just after the   
                  operation.  
           By above mechanism, we can easly follow the problem speedy.
           If this is feasible, we will discuss on details and charges.    
     
  How do you think about the matters ?  
     
Charges   
     
  Regarding the problem, we user a huge amount of TRUs by checking and
  recovering as compiling, programing, test run, and etc. And NIS will intend   
  to negotiate about the charges and costs after everything is over.  
     
     
Best regards,  
Makoto

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As part of the project to bring OnTyme to MDISC, training is
being delivered across the country to key offices.  If you
are in a smaller office, you probably did not see a flyer
announcing the class.  (Or perhaps you're so busy you haven't
read the bulletin board!)  Either way, below you'll find our
first training schedule.

If you are interested in participating, please register by 
phoning the appropriate contact as soon as possible - as class
size is limited.  Each session lasts 3 1/2 hours, scheduled either
in the morning or afternoon.  Most are morning sessions from 8:30 to
12:00.  When you call to register, you will be informed of the
class time.

I look forward to meeting those who plan on attending.




Best,

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


As everyone is aware of, or has heard, ASP can be used to copy
out a unit, or units, on the TYMCOM-10's.

ASP is only used if PACKCOPY cannot be used, or if it fails to
copy out a unit - it is not a general procedure to use instead
of PACKCOPY.

If not done correctly, a system can be wiped out.

It is requested that Shift Supervisors get together and let
me know the best time and day of the week I can instruct Operators
of these procedures.  Please submit a joint schedule to me by
19 August.

All other interested personnel are invited.

Thanks Rick Daniels

Subject: Average and max chars per second thru the base? 

A question came up while talking with Krumviede: what is the limiting factor
in getting characters into and out of the PDP-10s?  Is it:
 a) the number of characters SCNSER can handle,
 b) the speed in which the 68000 shuffles data from PDP-10 to Engine memory,
 c) the Dispatcher moving data to/from slot 1 and node code,
 d) the thruput of node code talking to the switchers.

The IRING size of 128 words and ORING of 256 means a maximum of 500 in
and 1000 out per tick, or 30K cps in and 60K cps out.  This does not
count block-I/O, but I'm sure that UUOCON can't provide that much
thruput on non-block-I/O lines.  Node code on D25's and D54's bases
reported an average of 700 in/out (at the time we were watching) and a
high-water mark of around 6800 characters per second in and out.

Carl: Did you determine that JBTCNI/JBTCNO was valid or bogus?  I looked at
a couple of systems (including F33-P035/D-7) and noticed that JBTCIN+0 and
JBTCOT+0 were between 1.0 and 2.0 times UPTIME.  That is, an average of 1
character per tick = 60 per second over a 131 hour period.

The question that started this discussion was "would enabling the trace buffers
in the 68000 code slow down thruput?"

The question itself is not as important as the fact that the metrics are not
available.

Subject: Average/max chars per sec base<==>PDP-10 

At 30 chars/msg = 8 words/msg gives 16 msgs in and 32 msgs out for a more
precise character count of 480 in and 960 out per tick (60th second).  If
the base keeps up with 1/60th second response, the total would be 28,800 in
and 57,600 out cps.  However, I do not know how fast the base polls the ring.
(This is important, since it checks the key each 1/2 second...)

On the KL, we can easily change the size of the ring on a heavily loaded
system to determine if SCNSER is the bottleneck.  The rings can be any size
we want as long as it's a power of 2.  (I'd like to see 1-page or 1K RINGS
for such a test.)  I had done this once, at the time we found the bug in
the KMC code for the 2020.

JBTCNI and JBTCNO are valid and presumed accurate not counting block-io which
is found in JBTBIO  (see (CARL:33)SYSDAT.SAI for actual table if JBTBIO is not
correct).  We do have sampling of the data you request every fifteen minutes
for all systems that ran SYSDAT since the beginnig of June-88.

I think you are right... the real bottleneck may be UUOCON and not SCNSER for
normal I/O.  If you'd like, I can finish whipping up my SHOVEL program to do
just that... shovel data through the interface, using regular I/O, TTCALLS, and
BLOCK-IO or even all three to determine the maximum rate.  (TTCALLS would use
things like OUTSTR/OUTPTR or .AXPTR/.AXSTR).

What did you guys decide?

     Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects
     and workloads to be planned accordingly. All of the conversions  
     are scheduled during weekends, and coordination with other data  
     center will take place to insure availability of its designated  
     back-up host. A system message will be posted prior to its  
     conversion date.    
     
     If any of the systems scheduled poses a problem, please call me

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The following proposal is submitted of the intended dates when the
remainder of the TYMCOM-10's are scheduled for conversion at the
Fremont Data Center.

     F58 - Weekend of 9 through 11 September

     F29 - Weekend of 11 through 13 November

     F38 - Weekend of 25 through 27 November

At the completion of this schedule all Fremont TYMCOM-10's
will be running on a PAGE vice BLOCK monitor  This will prevent
some confusion as to what type of monitor the systems are up on.
It will also cut down of remembering what PACKCOPY version to
use.  Instead of remembering FOUR version;s; only have to
remember TWO.

Please review and distribute this schedule to allow projects and
workloads to be planned accordingly.

If any of the systems poses a problem, please call me at (415)498-2595
as soon as possible and we can make arrangements to reschedule.

11-Aug-88 4:00pm  Sync line with multiple circuits brought up in Bubbnet.
12-Aug-88 4:29pm  Turbo Engine node 2155 came up using PROM based Rodney
                  and the local disk (i.e. not downloaded into RAM).

The node mentioned above was a 5-slot Turbo, in a box about the size of
a Micro Engine.  It is sitting right next to a full sized Turbo in the
Bubbnet Lab on B5.    /Joe

Osman;
    I just wanted to say Thank you for coming by here last week
and sharing your information and time with us. I know that what
you had passed on to us is greatly appreciated by the Operators
and by us Supervisors. It has opened new doors of thinking for
us all. Thanks again. It was really nice to finally get to meet
you in person after all these years of telephone contact. I have
to tell you that you didn't look anything like I imagined you, I'm
sure the same goes for you! Ha ha ...
 
Take care for now Osman, and Thanks again...

At one time Carl and I were toying with the idea of eliminating BACKUP.SAV
so as not confuse things with BACKUP.SHR - but nothing has come of that.
I copied SYSTEM.SAV to BACKUP.SAV on X32's 3675 packs - I think it is already
there on the 3652 packs.

What is the status of the disks connected to X32?  Are the 3675s there for
long term or short term?

When X32 is running on the 3652's an ASP Dump will be done.
It will be up to the Operator to determine what X32 is up on.


ALL-FILES will be taken whether it is up on 3652's or 3675's.

~jms/loadsfs.doc			17-Aug-88

To set up a Turbo Engine from scratch:
  I.   Set up the GP cards and disk hardware (done in Manufacturing).
  II.  Run MAKESFS to set up the sfs root directory.
  III. Run SFS and create top-level directories.
  IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to do it when BITS is working:

Part I will not be necessary if manufacturer sets up the hardware correctly.

Part II.  Load makesfs via BITS and run it.
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p u makesfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Go to the TTYA port on GP.133 and enter 51849.

Part III.  Load sfs via BITS and create top-level directories
  1.  Invoke BITS and enter "pl -p f sfs.e GP.133".
  2.  Enter "fo mkdir /isis".
  3.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.133".
  4.  Enter "fo mkdir /GP.135".

Part IV.  Load the six mandatory files using BITS.
  1.  "fs -p f sfs.e        /GP.133/load".
  2.  "fs -p i kernel.e     /GP.135/load".
  3.  "fs -t s isom.e       /isis/debugger".
  4.  "fs -t s dispatcher.e /isis/dispatcher".
  5.  "fs -t c syscon.e     /isis/syscon".
  6.  "fs -t s nodecode.e   /isis/slot00".

Part V.  Bring up Turbo Engine.
  1.  Enter "bs GP.133" and "bs GP.135" to BITS.
  2.  Copy any other files as needed after Turbo is up in the network.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to do it without BITS:

All board addresses and Unix directory names are what where used in the
demonstration given the week of August 15.  The actual names and addresses
will be different on your system.

You must be at the keyboard of a Sun workstation to do this.
  1.  Make sure GP board in slot 0 is strapped for VME arbitration master.
  2.  Verify File Server is addressed as GP.133 and ISIS is GP.135.
  3.  Both boards must have Probug ROMs, not Rodney ROMs.
  4.  Login to the workstation and start suntools.
  5.  Open 2 shell windows, and enter "skytool tb6" in one of them.
  6.  Use the other window to locate the following files:
      Sun programs: skytool, skyload, tw, skycheck, skyclock
      Probug bootables: dl.x, makesfs.x, sfs.x, filebug.x, rodney.x
      X.409 binaries: dispatcher.d, isom.d, nodecode.d, kernel.d, sfs.d
      Node specific: syscon.d, nodecode.d

Part I.  Set up the GP cards and disk hardware.
  1.  Connect a line from TTYA on the workstation to TTYA on GP.133.
  2.  (here we do somthing to run skyclock and skycheck on each GP card).
  3.  Enter "skyload -b dl.x tb6" to the shell.
  4.  Enter "j800a000" to skytool which starts dl.
  5.  Enter "in" to initialize the disk.
  6.  Enter "bl" to change block length.
  7.  Enter 3 blanks and then "1024"
  8.  Enter "y" to "make permanent" and return to "abort".
  9.  Enter "ex" to get back to Probug.

Part II.  Run makesfs to set up the sfs root directory.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/makesfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "j" to skytool.
  3.  Makesfs will type recommended disk size.  Enter this number to skytool.
  4.  It will take about 45 minutes for this to complete.

Part III. Run sfs and create top-level directories.
  1.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.x tb6" to shell.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  4.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  5.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start sfs.
  6.  Enter "m /isis" to the "cmd:" prompt (to make /isis direcory).
  7.  Enter "m /GP.133" and "m /GP.135".
  8.  Enter "f /" to list files.  The 3 directories should be there.
  9.  Enter "c /isis/syscon" to create an empty file (due to bug in "tw").
 10.  Enter "c /isis/debugger", "c /isis/dispatcher", "c /isis/slot00".
 11.  Enter "c /GP.133/load" and "c /GP.135/load".

Part IV.  Copy the six mandatory files to disk.
  1.  Disconnect cable from GP.133 and plug into TTYA on GP.135.
  2.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/calvin3/rodney/sfs/4.4e/filebug.x tb6" to shell.
  3.  Enter "skyload -b /usr/opus/diag/bergeron/rodney.x tb6" to shell.
  4.  Enter "m 8016970" to skytool (to patch Rodney to not look at disk).
  5.  Enter "1200" right after where "1A00" is displayed.
  6.  Enter "j" to skytool.  Rodney will output messages and start filebug.
  7.  Enter "tw /isis/syscon <syscon.d" to shell.  Note: tw is very slow.
  8.  Enter "tw /isis/slot00 <nodecode.d". 
  9.  Enter "tw /isis/dispatcher <isis68k/dispatcher/1.0/bin/dispatcher.d".
 10.  Enter "tw /isis/debugger <isis68k/isom/1.0/bin/isom.d".
 11.  Enter "tw /GP.135/load <isis68k/kernel/1.01/bin/kernel.d".
 12.  Enter "tw /GP.133/load <rodney/sfs/4.4e/sfs.d".

Part V.   Bring up Turbo Engine in the network, then copy remaining files.
  1.  Power card cage off, wait 30 seconds, then back on again.
  2.  Once the node has come up in the network, BITS can be used for all
      further transfers.

When taking an ASP dump of units running on 3652"s (if PACKCOPY

F29's AR.ARX crash on 23-Aug was caused by an ARX parity error in user mode,
probably bit 1.  I can't say for sure because the word of user core was not
saved in the crash dump.  The contents of (7:1) is reported as being
200000,,000000.  Assuming that the word was supposed to be 0, the bad
parity would come from bit 1 while doing an <IDPB 5,2> where AC 5 has
40 (an ASCII blank) and AC 2 has 350700,,561343.  Note that the latter
matches the page fail word (500) of 777000,,561343 as reported in the
crash mail.					/Joe

Subject: AUXMOX overloading of F33 to end in a couple of days. 

I talked to Phillipe Michel in Project Implementation about the many jobs
running AUXMOX.  The "522 Deployment Project" is modifying the TYM and
CMD files of all nodes in the Public Net to use Node Code version 5.22.
The BND files are being telecopied from D25/D54 to F33 as they are
created, because many nodes are reloaded the same night as when their
code is generated.  The people in PI did not know that you could enter
more than one file specification at a time when running (SPL)COPY.
Therefore each node was transfered as a seperate TELECO job.

Phillipe said they should be done in a few days.     /Joe

Subject: TYM files for all EBUS bases updated. 

The TYM files have been updated to include features that will help the
REBUILD option.  The new base code is now in (TYMNET:25)ND####.BND and
(TYM5:54)ND####.BND.  Please use them instead of the NW####.BND files the
next time the base is reloaded.

In each TYM file, the symbol REBTST is defined so that OPTION(REBLD) works
right and S0CORE has been bumped up from 240 to 350 to make more room for
the rebuild buffers.

The old BND files have been renamed to BK####.BND on (TYMNET:25) and on
(TYM5:54).

The primary directory for nodes 2000 to 4777 is (TYMNET:25).
The primary directory for nodes 5000 and above is (TYM5:54).
The secondary directories are (TYMNET:33) and (TYM5:33).

The only exception for EBUS node code is ND2333.BND which is duplicated in
(TYMNET:54) so that F33's base can be reloaded even if D25 is down.
The tertiary load files are to be used only if the primary and secondary
systems are not available.  Note that B39 is loaded from an ELF system.

SRA has all their mail forwarded to SRA:29, but when they log into
SRA:29 they do not received the statement [You have mail waiting.
To read it, type "MAIL".]

When they type in "R RDMAIL", it reports 'no mail'.  They have to 
READ all there mail by running "R TUMS" and read each one separately.

Any suggestions?  Thanks Rick

My rough draft of the MOD for performance analysis/monitoring is
in (CARL:35,33,29)PERF.MOD.  I would greatly appreciate any cand
all comments.  I need a fresh look before I'm done, but I think
I haven't left anything important to us out.

I'll also run it by Lloyd before I finish it...

To test out a theory that I discussed with Software Support, NO DSKCLN
will be run before an ASP dump on any TYMCOM-10's.

A FAST DSKCLN will be run at all times after the ASP dump.

Thanks for your cooperation with this.

Subject: Interval timer on 1307 

Looking at the CTYLOG on F26 shows that CPU 1307's interval timer is gaining
47 minutes a day; 2 minutes an hour.  Whenever that system is unshut, or a
new SUP takes over, the number of minutes of adjustment = number of hours sinc
last adjustment times 2.  I assume that adjusting the CPU's interval timer
is relatively easy and can be done when F26 goes back to hardware FFF.

Subject: Why character I/O is slow on F26 today. 

F26 is running on XXX KL#1307 base 2100 instead of FFF KL#1324 base 10350.
The two 9600 baud lines on node 2100 are the bottleneck for loading private
net nodes (node 10350 has 2 memory-shuffler lines).    /Joe
