   COME ON NEWMON. CARL FROM SOFTWARE SUPPORT WAS IN. HE 
   BROUGHT SYSTEM UP ON NEWMON, THEN LOADED DDT. HE CHECKED 
   SOMETHING IN DDT AND TOLD US THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE ALLOCATION
   OF MEMORY. HE THEN FINISHED BRINGING UP WIHT A FULL DISK. WHEN
   DISK CLEAN COMPLETED. CARL TOOK THE SYSTEM DOWN AGAIN AND LOADED
   NEWMON. WHEN IT FAILED HE SAVED THE CRASH, THEN MADE A CHANGE IN
   THE ALLOCATION. SYSTEM WAS THEN RELOADED AND CAME UP WITH NO OTHER
   PROBLEMS.

  System F30's base shows evidence of a semi-conductor memory board that is
is taking spurious single bit parity errors, which also result in bad
memory read cycles.  This caused the ISIS dispatcher to crash 27 days
ago and may be causing problems for the EBUS.
