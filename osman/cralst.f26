Contact:  "Fountana" Data Center, Mike Silva, System 26, no incident number.
Problem:  PAKCOP hung after copying cylinder 504 on BPA2.
          Select light off, no action in memory lights, no response to the
          attention button.  They wanted to know if it was OK to do an ASP
          save on the 3652.  BPC2 copied out OK.
Fix:      I suggested they try the OLDC command.  It got an unrcoverable
          error on cylinder 473.  Told them to do the ASP one-disk save.
          This worked, but BPC2 had a "missing or inconsistent pack set id",
          which was to be expected.  After putting a JFCL at STRFIX, the
          system came up running a full DSKCLN.

   PACK (260009) BPC2 COPIED OKAY, BUT PACK (260001) BPA2
   WOULD NOT COPY. PACKCOPY WOULD STOP WHEN REACHING CYLINDER 504.
   CALLED SOFTWARE SUPPORT AND JOE SUGGESTED WE TRY OLDC IN PACKCOPY.
   SAME THING HAPPENED AS BEFORE BUT AT CYLINDER 473.
   WE THEN DID A ONE PACK ASP SAVE AND FSC ADDRESSED A1 TO BE C1
   AND C1 TO BE A1. WE THEN RESTORED DSKB1 WITH NO PROBLEM.
   THE NEXT PROBLEM WAS A MISSING OR INCONSISTENT PACK ID ON
   UNIT BPC2. THIS WAS FIXED IN DDT.
   
   SYSTEM WAS RUN THROUGH A FULL DSKCLN AND CAME UP CLEAN.
