When operations copied HOME.SYS to itself,  the HOME pages got released.
Several files in (USEVAL) claimed these pages.  These files had to be
destroyed to get the HOME pages back, so that I copy put them back into HOME.SYS.

There aer 2 critical files on SYS: HOME.SYS and SAT.SYS.  The TYMCOM-X hotline
should be used whenever these critical files have problems.  Copying HOME.SYS
or SAT.SYS to itself will not clear up any read errors, but will clobber the

Subject: "System F29's file system was damaged"... 

System F29's file system was damaged when the file (SYS)HOME.SYS was copied
to itself in an attempt to clear a hard read/write error on this file.

Joe Smith responded to the mail from OPER regarding this problem and repaired
the damage enough so that a FAST DSKCLN was possible.  However a FULL DSKCLN
was not yet possible.   When the system went down Saturday morning, DSKCLN died
trying to repair the damage.

Carl Baltrunas responded to this problem and after verifying the state of the
file system, deleted all of the files which pointed to the same pages required
by (SYS)HOME.SYS.   DSKCLN was then able to verify and fix the remainder of
the problems with the file structure.


Please examine the file (SYS)RECOV.SYS and restore any file listed so that
all-files taken for the block-to-page file-structure conversion records
valid data for the files that were damaged due to HOME.SYS being overwritten.

Thank you.

Joe,
  I was trying to create a version of LOADII that has DDT linked in (as that
seems to be useful to see why it is crashing sometimes) but don't remember
how...  It does seem that LOADII will crash if compiled/linked on 33, but
not if built on 56.  Something seems strange here also.

thanks,
Paul

  I talked to Don Murtaugh, who added a hack to record load statistics in a
1022 data-base (SYS)LOADII.DMS.  It appears that escaping out of it damages
the data-base, and it can't recover.  I guess somebody is having problems
with Bubbnet loads off of 25 also.
  Ron Saltgaver has a program to install things like LOADII and NAD that uses
SSINSTALL.  Don Murtaugh is going to hack the data-base stuff and re-install
LOADII (over our objections).  Don't know more... Don was going to call
Debbie.  Looks like a few ill-advised changes screwed things up real well.
  We were wondering if any other systems had problems, but I guess we will
wait and see.
  Can somebody look at the XEXEC job on D34?  It seems to be hung...

Subject: SPAGES.SYS on F29. 

The hotline call this morning was justified.  (SYS)SPAGES.SYS is a "critical"
file, and we need to be notified whenever it has problems.  In this case, the
file on F29 had been damaged some time ago.  Since F29 was scheduled to be
converted, we chose to leave SPAGES.SYS alone until the rebuild.  The
REFRESH option in the FILES dialog creates SPAGES at the same time that it
creates HOME.SYS, SAT.SYS, and CRASH.SAV.

I consider this hotline call my fault, since I forgot to set the bit in the
RIB of the damaged SPAGES.SYS that would have told TITO to not save the file
to tape.  In this particular case, the error message when TITO could not
enter the file must be ignored.

Thanks for your concern, I don't expect any other problems during the restore.

This means that no SUBMIT jobs were running, and may have had something to

to keep the MAGNUM database intact.)

Problem:  MAGNUM reports errors in the KEEP.OPEN file when users logged in
          as NETCON and DBCSERV try to use NETDB.
Fix:      Restarted XEXEC and forced it to run (NETDB)DCOMUP.  When MAGNUM
          starts in directory NETDB:23, it says:  "To report system problems,
          please contact: Mike Agne at (602)893-2963"  On D56, it still says

Subject: Correlation between RCCDBG stopcode and EXECX:"Lost command port" 

There are 3 problems I want to make you all aware of:
1) SUBMIT jobs abort for no apparent reason; EXECX says that it lost the
   command port of the currently running job.
2) (MPL)TTYTAB sometimes reports PTYs that are "zapped" and "gone" but one
   half of the pair is still marked as being in-use.
3) The TTY buffers get messed up which cause IME stopcodes on monitors prior
   to P035/D08.  They get reported as INFO stopcode RCCDBG in new monitor.

The following evidence indicates that the 3 problems may be related:

Carl: I recommend a quick hack to EXECX to make it output a message on the
CTY whenever it loses the command port, so we can compare its timestamp
with that of the stopcode.  I would like this on all systems before
P035/D09 is installed.    /Joe

Subject: Free space on F58. 

I got a call from Frank Rodriquez at the Fremont Data Center asking me if I
could delete some files from SYS on F58.  He thought that (SYS:58) was using
more space than most other systems.  It is using 57000 pages, which is about
what is used on other systems.  The encloses SZRPT listing shows that SYS is
using up only 2% of the disk.

Rick, do you wish us to pursue this matter?  It would probably be more effective
to prune directories other than SYS.   /Joe

Subject: NONAME bugged by SIMPL compiler 

There is a new NONAME on F29 which will be propagated to SYS on all systems
if it lasts a week with no problems.  It fixes a *BUG* in all known versions
of code caused by the compiler.  (Or lack of understanding by the author,
[not me]).

        HW(DUL(1),1)     Generated  HRRZ ac,@DBLK(ix)
                         instead of HRRZ ac,DBLK(ix)

I tried a couple of things and finally changed the code to a byte field
instead of a half-word field and it works fine.   The HW construct is used
all over, and only in this one instance did I see the bad code.  {Sigh}!

Problems like this are hard to find, the source code looks good!

Subject: More info on RCCDBG stopcodes. 

I tried to reproduce the problem by running TRW's monitor on X17 and having
EXECX run several jobs all at once.  (The problem has been seen when the
system has been down long enough so that many SUBMIT jobs are overdue at the
same time.)  On X17, there were 2 RCCDBG stopcodes, and then several minutes
later an IME stopcode.  I haven't looked at the IME yet, but the RCCDBGs
were complaining about invalid forward and backward links.  The real problem
is that U is zero, and not pointing to a valid LDB.   /Joe

Joe,
  Could the problems we see have anything to do with running out of PTY
ports, or not reusing them, or garbaging ddb pointers when they have
something to do with PTY allocation/deallocation rather than real-port
allocation/deallocation of ddbs?

Subject: Changing BUBBNET passwords. 

I have not been able to change my BUBBNET password.  The PASSWO program on
(SYS:39) fails with "?lost sync with CUD slave".  On 16-Nov, I logged into
host 83 directly to change my password.  It accepted the change, but the
SUP hasn't been notified.  I did this again on 18-Nov, and again today, but
the BUBBNET sup is still expecting my 3-month old password.

What is the procedure required to notify all the SUPs of a change of password?
Could the PASSWORD program on 39 be modified so that LOG-II is handled 
transparently?  It's a little disconcerting to have to use one of 2 passwords
based on the phase of the moon (or other nondeterministic factors).

		/Joe Smith

(end forwarded message)

The format of the MUD is completely different on a LOG-II supervisor as
compared to the traditional LOG-I sup.  Since Bubbnet is running both types,
they can't run a MUD consistency check.  Very confusing.  /Joe

I'm sending each of you a copy of the updated PDDREC.M5A Mini-Manual
(DISK RECOVERY PROCEDURES) for review.  Page 3 lets you know what I
have done.  Please check each item for accuracy.  As soon as I hear
from you about it, whether changes need to be made, or if it is
okay, I will let everyone know where it is.

I'm working from 2000 to 0400 (approximately) for the next two weeks.

Thanks Rick

P>S>  Joe - thanks for your information about the configuration.

Subject: TRW 

Joe, Osman:
  Craig and I were talking about the revised memo from Healy about TRW
and that they do NOT really have anyone looking out for their interest.
For example, no one in particular is interested in making sure that they
get what they need as far as multiple lines on their LSI, or upgrade to
11/23, etc...

  I mentioned that we once discussed (in terms of multiple networks in
the same node seeing the same host) having TRW use a KL-10 or have direct
access to one.

  I went on to conjecture...  What about attempting to solve their real
problem?  Which I perceive to be growth...  they need more processing
power from their 2020 and they need more connectivity to the network to
be able to load nodes faster...

  Are they asking for anything else?

Why not propose that TRW take over system 29 or system 55 (or both) as
they are decommissioned from TYMNET.  Leave them on site in Fremont or
Dallas (multi-region access?) and let IPC continue to run them.  Then
have TRW obtain leased lines to the data center(s) and connect the bases
to TRWNET directly.  At their option, they may rent or place their own
engines in the data center...  [maybe even their SUPs?] ...Letting IPC
or (TYMNET, if they decide to take over the data centers) handle the day
to day operations.  FSCO already does their maintenance and of course, we
could maintain a PDP-10 a lot easier in the data center.

  Just as System 39 is on BUBB-NET, they could put 29/55 in TRW-NET and
we could maintain them just as we maintain 39.

  Of course, this is simply an interim solution, until NSC releases their
products on SUN or other UNIX-based systems.  Just because TYMNET is moving
off the PDP-10s, what is to say certain private-net customers such as TRW
or SouthWestern-Bell might not be interested in direct network access for
their large-area nets?

/Carl              Think about it...  let me know if you know who we ought
                   to discuss this with in NSC.  Especially since they do
                   expect to decomission 29 and 55 soon!

Subject: TRW-NET KL/BASE/HOST 

PS.  This may be yet another reason for us to develop slot code which
     links to another slot, so that host 39 (for example) on TYMNET is
     able to access "directly" host 39 in BUBB-NET with maybe a similar
     "direct" connection back to a single host in TYMNET?  eg. Host 32
     on all nets builds a circuit to out host 32?

Like I said... just an idea to think about.

It looks like NDT has no plans for supporting the ATC or microtymbase from
the Sun systems. To make sure that we can still re-gen the code to our micronet,
I have duplicated NEW11, CURR11, OLD11, DOC11, and TOOLS11 from B39
to F33 and X17.  I have also located the config files for the French 2020's
(S59, S83, S263), Ranier Bank (W1051), Fayez-Sarofim (H370), and TRW.
This way, even if B39 goes away, we should be self-sufficient.   /Joe

I am trying to see if we can avoid a reubild.  It may require swapping

Right now, Rick is trying dto do a save to tape, but it tool 10 minutes
for ASP to save the first 5 cylinders.  One tyme I stopped it when it got to
the 2nd cylinder to type "PSP".  It reported that BPB6 had
SDAT:12, SDEV:5, HDAT:6, HDEV:20.  PACKP5 died at cylinder 21, we're hoping
that ASP can make it to the end of the disk.  If not, rebuild time.   /Joe

To Carl, Osman:  I have set up a MAIL.FWD in SYS to forward to mail to
us (for PERPOPER mail when jobs run logged in as username SYS have
problems).  One system had mail from OPER to PJ about a file with a hard
read error that was several weeks old.  So I made PJ forward mail to SYS
which gets to us.  That is why you got a copy of this message:

I don't know who SIRTITAS is and why he/she sent a message to PJ, the Phantom
Job.  I guess people don't realize that PAM stands for PJ Activity Monitor,
and has nothing to do with Pam Johnson.  (My wife made the same mistake.)

Subject: QIKSAV on F38 

Yesterday, one of F38's problems was that the first RIB pointer in [1,1].UFD
got clobbered.  There was nothing in SPAGES because no-one ran QIKSAV after
the conversion to pages.  The correct pointer was easy to determine, since
the remaining 6 were sequential.  But all that effort was for naught, as
a result of BPB6(DSKB24) having too many unreadable pages.

I ran QIKSAV on F38 and F29 today.

Symptom 1: Could no log into X32 - "?LOGINN.SHR not found".
Symptom 2: Later on, while trying to login to X32, got no response;
  typing any character produced a beep.

Problem 1 = WRTSAT on the SAT that had LOGINN.SHR.  This message would
output many times.

Problem 2 = Something had halted the console fron-end.  The CONSOLE light was
on.  Pressing the "CONT" switch got it running.  It said KL10 halted, which
was not true - the lights on the memory box were still flashing because jobs
were still running.  Then the WRTSAT messages came out - many pages of
them.  They had all been buffered up.  The beeps were because SCNSER had run
out of TTY chunks and could not process new login requests.

System OK after a full DSKCLN.  I modified (DIAG10F)STARTU.CTL to start up
DCMMD, HUMP1, HUMP2, as well as XCORE.        /Joe
