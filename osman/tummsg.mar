Subject: I'm back!!!!

Hi,

  I just crawled in from SF airport...  had an interesting time, on the
way back our luggage flew UNITED and we flew TWA... sigh... I reccommend
NEVER doing this to SFO since the terminals are at opposite ends of the
airport...

  Anyway, I see Osman's wife is still expecting... and there didn't seem
to be any major crises while I was gone... RIGHT! (?)

  I'll be coming in to the VG2 office later this afternoon, since I doubt
that I'll wake up before noon, long day today and all that.... If you need
me for anything... feel free to call, anytime after 9am & I'll come in
then... if you don't need me, don't wake me... thanks again... see one or
both of you later today.

Sometime this afternoon I called the new answering service in a test
and the lady dutifully took my name, organization, system 99
and phone number (7942403).  You should have been paged.

Were you?

I don't know if I was paged or not... my pager was off on top of my
refrigerator this afternoon.  It's now turned back on...

Ref: Tentative meeting tomorrow...

  I was planning on being there by noon, but the storage company that
has my carpets and padding in storage is going to deliver them sometime
between 11am and 2pm.  Since I'm the only one who knows what they have
I have to be here for the delivery...  So, at the very latest, I should
be at the office by 3... If you'd like, we can have the meeting then, or
we could even have the meeting here at my home... it is closer for Osman
to get home than from VG2, and you'd save from running into traffic at
that hour...  let me know... call me after 11:00am

do a test, with me "linked" to who-ever is receiving the error when they

I've put together a sail program to read CRSHID output, assuming one-line
per crash, which builds a set of tables nearly identical to the CRASH.TAB
file that I was keeping by hand in directory (CRASH).  It will print to a
file or to the terminal.
  It's also setup to provide additional tables, and it's very easy to get
various different combinations.   Right now it's setup to do each current
year.. later it can be made to do any range of months.

(CRASH)CRASHES.84, CRASHES.SYS are possible input files...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Effective immediately, the following significant changes have been made in
Travel Policy for the ISG Blue Sector to bring us more in line with
the needs of our working environment.  A major ingredient in these
changes is the increased responsibility and authority assigned to
management to exercise judgement in approving various travel expenditures.

Weekend Travel Policy is revised as follows:

   a.  Travelers may return home every other weekend.
   b.  Travel home every week may be allowed at the discretion       the immediate supervisor (Manager or above) and the Project 
       Manager (if applicable).  The decision to allow travel home every
       weekend should be based on these guidelines:
       
          Travel is paid by the client;
          The cost of travel home is less than or equal to remaining

If you need them back, get them from all files.

Well,
  I went in and moved the jumper between the 9600 and 4800 clock pins and
that seems to have made a big difference.  We'll get to see how it works
on Monday when the rest of the world comes into work.

  So, it's up that way until we get around to ordering the line drivers.
'Tis a pity we didn't think of this earlier in the week... sigh.  Dennis
knows about it, and as far as the line drivers, he said there are literally
hundreds of loine drivers we can buy... all that we need to know is that
we want SYNCHRONOUS and (I'd guess) 9600 baud.  My best guess would be to
check with Liz or Mary what they last ordered for anyone else, or Tymnet
and ask them what they usually buy for internal Tymshare use (for example,
what do they use in the field offices?).

Subject: Lab Key....

Osman, Dennis,
  On friday, the last thing I did was to have the terminal people look at
the two consoles for the micronodes, (552's vertical video went out) and
the ADM-31 for 554 looks dead...

  Anyway, on the way out of the lab, I locked the Key inside along with
the two validations requests that I had Craig sign for usernames TXSSUP
and RING.  (I put them down when I walked in with the terminal repair guy).
I left a note for Liz Johnson telling her about the key, but if either of
you happen to get there early, please check the lab (or with Liz) and
return the key to it's box.  -- Sorry... --

  Also, please give the validations requests to Liz.. Thanks...

New Subject:  Monday's schedule for me...
   I'm not sure where I'll be...  Cherie's car died Saturday morning and
won't be fixed until Tuesday, so I'll have to drive her to work in Santa
Clara until it's fixed...  I will also need to stop in Cupertino to get
my Paycheck.  So, beep my beeper if you need me and I'm not at home......

/Carl

PS. Yes, I know Osman is on vacation, but he's been on vacatin and he keeps
    showing up at the office... so, I want both of you to know.

Subject: Batch problem on system P90
 
I tried to run the BATCH program to test the problem that was reported and
it seemed to work fine from the user end.  I tried it as myself, username
CARL and as Arlette B, username ABLAM to check the district 0/3 vs. 38 code
and they both worked fine.
 
Operations may see something else, but I'm not sure if that's a 940 problem
or not, if they do indeed see something wrong.  If it is a 940 error, I do
not believe that there is anyone available other than Guy Blood who knows
what to fix.  Please advise.  Does the problem still happen?  If so, can we
do a test, with me "linked" to who-ever is receiving the error when they
try it.  If the problem is gone, then this is superfluous.

  If you're going by building C or A, could we get a tape and copy all

I've put together a sail program to read CRSHID output, assuming one-line
per crash, which builds a set of tables nearly identical to the CRASH.TAB
file that I was keeping by hand in directory (CRASH).  It will print to a
file or to the terminal.
  It's also setup to provide additional tables, and it's very easy to get
various different combinations.   Right now it's setup to do each current
year.. later it can be made to do any range of months.

(CRASH)CRASHES.84, CRASHES.SYS are possible input files...

our personal usernames, plus a few major system-related directories that
are necessary, plus a few currently being used software development

          Travel is paid by the client;
          The cost of travel home is less than or equal to remaining

Well,
  I went in and moved the jumper between the 9600 and 4800 clock pins and
that seems to have made a big difference.  We'll get to see how it works
on Monday when the rest of the world comes into work.

  So, it's up that way until we get around to ordering the line drivers.
'Tis a pity we didn't think of this earlier in the week... sigh.  Dennis
knows about it, and as far as the line drivers, he said there are literally
hundreds of loine drivers we can buy... all that we need to know is that
we want SYNCHRONOUS and (I'd guess) 9600 baud.  My best guess would be to
check with Liz or Mary what they last ordered for anyone else, or Tymnet
and ask them what they usually buy for internal Tymshare use (for example,
what do they use in the field offices?).

Osman, Dennis,
  On friday, the last thing I did was to have the terminal people look at
the two consoles for the micronodes, (552's vertical video went out) and
the ADM-31 for 554 looks dead...

  Anyway, on the way out of the lab, I locked the Key inside along with
the two validations requests that I had Craig sign for usernames TXSSUP
and RING.  (I put them down when I walked in with the terminal repair guy).
I left a note for Liz Johnson telling her about the key, but if either of
you happen to get there early, please check the lab (or with Liz) and
return the key to it's box.  -- Sorry... --

  Also, please give the validations requests to Liz.. Thanks...

Subject: New monitor o

for D56
Tom Marconi called the other day while 930 was still down and requested
that we send them a monitor cut for 90 frames (as per Roy Roskilly).  I've
generated (OSP)56034N.SAV and F01269.SAV and telecopied the to (M33:56).
Installed patches are BADSPT.PAT and RTCONT.PAT (mask bits 1&2).  /Carl

Subject: Hotline call... 

Maybe it was a mistake call?  It went off while I was driving to Aloha
about 10 minutes before I called you... I guess the F28 call was the
previous call & I misread it... I checked the beeper & the last call
says ----- 1 ----- so I guess it was a mistake.

Sorry to call you, I didn't want to... I tried to call the answering
service from the rink, but couldn't hear well enough to try to do
anything... I got as far as the pay-phone operator saying to deposit
45 cents for the first 3 minutes & decided that it was ridiculous to
try to do anything...

We need to get a "local" number to call for the answering service --
local to San Jose/South San Jose...  (if one exists)... anyway.. I'll
see you tomorrow? (or are you now waiting till thursday?)

I'm getting ready to go for my lesson, now... so bye.

Subject: JBTINA(J)  JBTPRV(J)[ PVDINA

I think Todd put in the inactivity timeout stuff... but I'd like to
first bounce this off you before I do anything with it.  Right now
there are three ways to set/clear an auto-logout time limit.

1)  setting bit PVDINA in JBTPRV using SETPRV will set the default
    autologout limit of 15 minutes.
    clearing this bit with SETPRV clears any limit set, however set.
2)  SETINA AC,  will set an arbitrary limit up to 17 bits wide or
    zero will clear it.  In the current monitor, this pays no attention
    to PVDINA in JBTPRV and could care less about it. (UUOCON)
3)  SET AUTOLOGOUT n   and  SET NO AUTOLOGOUT
    This too ignores PVDINA completely!  (COMCON)

This seems to me to be a sheer waste of a PRV bit since SETINA and the
command provide the same capabilities...  and checking is easy, 3 fields
in JBTINA(J) available in the gettab tables!

 2 proposals.  --- 1) Remove (FREE) PVDINA from JBTPRV & use -1 in
		      SETINA to set the default value.
	       --- 2) Make COMCON & UUOCON set & clear PVDINA.

In either case, I was thinking that the hardcoded 15 minutes could be
made into a "nice" NSWTBL entry so that operations or someone with the
right license could change it depending upon system load.

================================

Let me know what your thoughts are, so I can document it... I'm trying
to get the YAMM out and I'd like some of these things to be "ACCURATE"!!!!

Well, the idea behind the JBTPRV bit is that it can be specified by noname.
I'd much rather a value be specified by noname and do away with the bit.
If the value is '777777, then the operator settable system default will be
used.  This will make programs like FREE alot simpler (maybe).  The biggest
problem is that this would require changes to both LOGINN and NONAME.  But,
its probably worth it.

If you agree, you can just "not document" the default bit in JBTPRV, but
leave it in until LOGINN and NONAME are changed.  You would need to change
the code to check for '777777.

More research.... System 56 has 4 of these, only instead of being trapped
from OUTBLT, these 4 are all from INBLT...  Same symptoms... T1[ 1,,3
Getting the error FLVEX% (3) for a page that already exists in the VM
address space for the monitor...  It may be reasonable to check the pages
mapped in the EXEC 340-377 pages directly and counting how many times it
happens...
  We need a DEBUG stopcd that prints a console msg!!!!!! sigh!

TWO NEW UNIVERSAL DISK HEAD TESTERS AVAILABLE FROM TYMSHARE

     CUPERTINO, Calif., January 11, 1985 -- Tymshare's Computer
Systems and Support (CSS) division has developed two new universal
disk head testers that provide significant cost savings to users
by substantially reducing down time from incorrect diagnosis, and
by the device's ability to quickly certify the head.

     Developed by the Depot Repair Group in Westlake Village,
Calif., the new products are models 4060P, a portable device for
use in the field, and 4060D, a stationary unit.  Both are
designed for the testing and certification of 100, 200 and 300
megabyte removeable read/write disk heads for most original
equipment manufacturers, including Ampex, Control Data, Cal Comp,
Century Data and Memorex.

     Test data includes reading at highest and lowest write
frequencies, resolution percentage and overwrite in decibels.

     Testing is done on inner and outer tracks with surface
range adjustable.  Test data is available in both CRT display
and hard copy.

                                                                Page  2

     Prices of the testers currently start at $19,500 and
include a CRT, printer and 8-hour training class.

     Tymshare's CSS division provides professional field
maintenance, equipment staging and field engineer training for
the computer industry.  It is part of the Information Systems
Group of McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis.

**************************** MEMORANDUM ***************************
 
   DATE:  January 28, 1985                    COPIES:  Nancy Vittum

   FROM:  Joe Walton - Director, Human Resources
          
SUBJECT:  EMPLOYEE LOAN PROGRAM FOR ACQUIRING DESK TOP COMPUTERS
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
Beginning in February 1985, Tymshare/Tymnet employees will be able 
to participate in the MDC interest-free loan program for the pur-
chase of specified desk top computers.  At present, the IBM PC, 
IBM PC-XT, DEC PRO 350 and Wang PC have been identified as 
meeting MDC hardware and software standards.  Employees are free 
to choose configurations and any available software for these 
desk top computers.
 
The key elements of the program are:
 
   o  Interest-free computer purchase loans are available to
      permanent, full-time employees.
 
   o  Interest-free loans to employees will be provided through
      payroll deduction.  The program permits one loan trans-
      action every three years.
 
   o  Loans will be limited to a maximum of $4,000 or 80% of the
      purchase amount, whichever is less.  Repayments are made 
      by weekly payroll deduction of not less than $10/week up 
      to a maximum of 24 months.  Employee will be required to 
      sign a note in the amount of the loan.
 
   o  Employee may purchase desk top computers from any vendor
      who in some cases offer significant discounts to MDC
      employees.  A list of vendors offering discounted prices
      may be obtained through the Human Resource Division.
 
   o  Employee accepts full responsibility for the purchase, 
      including performance, support, maintenance, or training
      for all items obtained.
 
   o  The entire unpaid loan balance remaining at the time of 
      employee termination (for any reason) becomes due and
      payable immediately upon such termination of employment.
 
If you are interested in taking advantage of this program, con-
tact Nancy Vittum at MDC/Tymshare Human Resources Division for
additional information.  OnTyme to HRD.PERSMAIL or call at
408/446-6379

I put my new CRSHID on all systems except 25 & 33 which were down.
Almost all systems that you had (CRASH)CRASH.JAN have been updated
except one where you had a MIC error crash but deleted the crash.

To get output for CRSTAB, use the /FORMAT switch.  To get output similar
to what was previously generated, leave the switch off.  The NOTICE.???
files are supposed to default to /FORMAT... we shall see.

Not counting 25 & 33 & the one MIC-Type 11/12? I came up with 28 crashes.
(I know 33 had a bunch... so I will re-tabulate before the meeting if I
have time.)

Actually, here is a case where I would like more numbers just to make 
the argument more convincing, e.g.
	162 in 1983

	1xx of 1984 for various reasons

	100 of 1984 for "Base type 7"
	 50 of 1984 for illins+2
	 40 of 1984 for xxx
	----
	290

forgot about
	25	1984 system 5780 Tops20 crashes



This is a sample of what I would like to show to JFS.

Cherie hasn't been feeling well the past 2 days and it seems that this
morning I'm beginning to feel bad myself.  She's had a stomach flu, and
I'm showing the same symptoms as she did 3 days ago... so,

  I may not be in at all today (friday) depending on how I feel when
I wake up later.  Please don't call me before 10 or 11 unless it's a
real emergency....  I'll give one of you a call to let you know how I
feel later.

PS.  It's not supposed to be contagious... so, my feeling ill may not
     be related to Cherie's flu at all... sigh.

Joe,

  we can try for this morning to go over to fremont to dump your tapes...
I had a flash  **<><zap><flash><zingie>*<>** about why you had trouble
with the tapes in CUPC.. not in the program?  1600/6250 ?  /DENSITY ?
the default is possibly "low" instead of "high" and we may have to play
with the density, although I know the tape drive really only needs to know
what to write it at... it should be able to read either regardless of the
"assigned" setting, just like on tops-10.
  anyway, my version of BACKUP/HACKUP may work...

sigh... anyway, when I wake up, I'll be in.  Call me anytime after 10 if
you need me before then...

Payroll input is normally done on Monday mornings.  It must be

I am requesting that I receive all time cards, call in and stand
by by 5:00 pm, the working day before payroll input day. This
will normally be on a Friday.

When Monday is a holiday, such as next week, the payroll input day is
the previous Friday.  In this case, I will need the time cards by
5:00 pm on Thursday.

If I do not receive a card, I cannot input your hours, and
you will not get paid.

If you have any questions, my extension is 2537, or you can
ontyme me at ths.t/halley.

(EX. ZENITH,BALL BROS.,MOTOROLA,ETC.) FOR THIS UNIT , BUT NONE OF THE
MANUFACTURES PARTS ARE INTERCHANGEABLE.OUR RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS 
TO KEEP THE VIDEO MONITOR AND TUBE AS AN ASSEMBLY.THE VIDEO BOARD MUST
NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE ASSY.THEY ARE TO BE RETURNED FOR REPAIR AS AN
ASSY. (P/N-5-017-5019). DO TO THE HIGH USE OF THIS ITEM , ALL DEFECTIVE
UNITS SHOULD BE RETURNED TO NDC.MRA AS A PRIORITY - RUSH (FEDX-STD.).

Subject: 34 crashes

I think CRA001 and CRA002 are due to TUMS.  I put TUMS up on 34 over
the weekend (including XEXEC) and put SCM and PRVMSK patches in as
they are necessary for TUMS.  TUMS was behaving quite strangely and
operations says it crashed several times on Sunday.  They backed up
to an old monitor and it stopped -- not because the patch was bad, but
because without the patch, TUMS wouldn't run.  There isn't much to go
on in the crash files - no UPT saved (why?).  Anyway, its probably
safe to go back to the current (K-17 I think).  TUMS seems to be
tickling the old framing CRAFRM bug, so I just un-installed it until
we get /N up on 34 (soon I hope).  -Bill

Subject: Stupid ACTSER bug

I doubt very much if this bug is ever being exercised, but it can't
hurt to patch it out.  In ACTSER, we check to see if the record type
is .ge. 40 and if so, we do a JRST @SPCACT-40(type) where the SPCACT
table consists of JRST's and STOPCD's.

Why this is interesting is that STOPCD produces JSR SYSCRS and the
JRST @SPCACT(x) will simply JRST to SYSCRS which is definately a
no-no causing an illins trap immediately!!!

Note: OSMAN, please install this patch to teh new monitor just built
      for system 56.  See (OSP)SPCACT.PAT

Subject: Input ring time-out crashes

Just thought that you'd be interested in a little tidbit and may
have some comments or info...

These are our most frequent crash type, and until yesterday we've
had no inkling of what could possibly be causing them.  It appears
that in > 95% of the crash files still on disk, PISTS shows CH1 in
progress at ITMINT (interval timer) with a garbage PC word.

Comparison shows that most of these couldn't possibly be PC words since
bits 13-17 are non-zero.  Also, it seems that bits 32-35 are always 1's.
What else looks like that?  The IRING data!  Looking at ITMINT or CH1
in 8-bit format produces what looks like data destined for the IRING.
In each case the message type and the arguments following agree fully
with the formats described in SCNSER and look like valid ports as well.

Conclusion:  Somehow when the processor is executing the JSR ITMINT at
EPT+514 for the interval timer, a data word destined for the IRING is
getting stuck in ITMINT instead of the PC word.  However, this only seems
to happen about 3-5 times a month.  Any ideas on how it can be happenning?

Yes, I've come to the same conclusion in the past - this goes back to Sutton.
These are very interesting and puzzeling.  The state seems to lack any
plausible explanation.  Is the data at CH1 base->host data or host->base or
can't you tell (hopefully some of the msg types you've seen are only legal in
one direction).  I haven't ruled out base bug, MIC hardware timing wrong for
new memory, microcode bug, monitor bug, cache bug.  The sequence is unclear
but I want to say something like:
   1. some problem occurs
   2. base gets borred and clobbers key and 30
   3. clock fires
   4. wrong value is storred by JSR *OR* return PC is clobbered
   5. CLKINT notices non-zero 30 and bellies-up
The key is to find the common link between #1 and #4.  Until you can solve
why CH1 is clobbered, you shouldn't assume anything about events prior to
event #4.  Possible experiments:
   1. move location CH1 to a page that has cache disabled
   2. make a copy of CH1 as first thing in service routine
   3. put a logic analizer on the MIC bus and look at write cycles to PDP
      memory with a range check on the memory address to see if base ever
      writes out of bounds
   4. turn off cache for a couple weeks - see if crash stops (gross)
   5. try using a different instruction to call service routine - be careful
      not all instructions are allowed by microcode for interrupt service -
      have to check this out
Questions:
   1. does crash code do a cache sweep and wait?
   2. does this happen on KI?
   3. does it happen only on ARM-10LS memory systems?
   4. how long before crash did SCNSER last run?

This one has my curiosity peaked so please keep me in on the discussion.

Experiments in progress:
  1. C33 when next recycled has JSR XXX instead of JSR ITMINT setup
     which checks PC to see if legal (i.e. bits 13-17 clear)
  2. C39 will be testing newest uCode tonight & if ok, will run for
     awhile to see if any other problems, & if fixes this problem
Answers to q:
  1. Crash code does a cache sweep & waits.
  2.  Seems to only occur on KL, but am still researching this.
-----
  3.  ARM-10LS? I suspect is all we have on the KL's now?
  4.  Haven't checked when SCNSER last ran, but will let you know.

Osman will keep you abreast of the uCode status... we may even consider
running RSX-20F instead of KLDCP... we shall see.

Also of note... we've been under the impression that the base crashes the
host after some time-out... not seeing the base code, no one is sure of
this or not.  Looking at these crashes, IRP620 is always 1 less than IRPPDP
indicating that the base has written the entire IRING in a loop and is ready
to overwrite itself if the 10 doesn't read the ring soon.

Who is the person in NTD "maintaining" the base code?  Where on disk can we
find the sources to look at?  Do you think that we could entice someone to
patch the base to write a repeating pattern in the last 4 bits of data sent
from the base, i.e. 0001 0010 0011 0100 ... 1110 1111 0000 0001 etc.. so we
can use that as a diagnostic aid?

          TUMS (Tymnet Unofficial Message System) is an
     SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) based message
     system which is distributed across the entire net-
     work allowing users of different hosts to exchange
     electronic mail.  This document describes the pro-
     gram, TUMS-X, which is a user interface to TUMS on
     Tymcom-X hosts.  Enough background is given  about
     TUMS  for  the  user  to  take  advantage  of  its
     features through the TUMS-X program.

     The _T_y_m_n_e_t _U_n_o_f_f_i_c_i_a_l _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _S_y_s_t_e_m (TUMS) is  a  dis-

_M_a_i_l _T_r_a_n_s_f_e_r _P_r_o_t_o_c_o_l[1] (SMTP) and _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _f_o_r _t_h_e _F_o_r_m_a_t

     This system allows users to  exchange  electronic  mail
with  other users on the same system, as well as other, dis-
similar systems connected to  Tymnetr  either  directly,  or
through  a  gateway.  In particular, at the time of publica-
tion, a user on a Tymcom-X can  send  a  message  using  the
TUMS-X  program,  to  other  users  on  that  host, users on
another Tymcom-X, users on Ontyme, users on almost any Unixr
system,  or  users on any ARPA-NET system.  The advantage of
such a system is that it does not require users to have com-
mon  access  to  any  one  host (such as Ontyme) in order to
exchange mail.

_1._1.  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _F_o_r_m_a_t

     A message consists of header fields and, optionally,  a
body.   Header  fields each begin with a label followed by a
colon, some data, and a CRLF.  A long header  field  may  be
continued  by  beginning  the next line with a blank or tab.
The body is simply a  sequence  of  lines  containing  ASCII
characters.  It is separated from the headers by a null line
(i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF).

     The fields _F_r_o_m and _T_o are required.  Other fields  are
optional.   Below  is  a  partial  list  of standard fields.
Non-standard fields are allowed, but discouraged.

     The address fields, _F_r_o_m, _T_o, _C_c, and _B_c_c, are used  by
the  system to direct the message and its replies.  The for-
mat of data in the fields must be of  the  proper  structure
for  message  integrity  to  be  preserved.   Each  of these
fields, except _F_r_o_m,  may  contain  more  than  one  address
separated  by  commas.   Blanks  and  case are not important
except inside of quotes.  Each address must conform  to  the
address syntax described below.

_1._2.  _A_d_d_r_e_s_s_i_n_g

     The term _a_d_d_r_e_s_s_i_n_g, here,  refers  to  the  method  of
expressing the recipient of a message as a character string.
The issue of addressing can become  quite  involved.[3]  The
description  of  addressing presented below is very abbrevi-
ated and makes several assumptions about  operation  in  the
TUMS environment.  It should be adequate for the TUMS-X user
in most every case.

     An address consists of a _l_o_c_a_l-_p_a_r_t optionally followed
by an at-sign and a _d_o_m_a_i_n.

_1._2._1.  _L_o_c_a_l-_P_a_r_t

     In the case of a Tymcom-X (and most other  hosts),  the
_l_o_c_a_l-_p_a_r_t  is simply the user's login name.  In the case of
Ontyme, the _l_o_c_a_l-_p_a_r_t always contains the account name fol-
lowed  by a dot and the id.  If the message is being sent to
a user on the same host as the sender, it is  not  necessary
to specify anything beyond the _l_o_c_a_l-_p_a_r_t.

_1._2._2.  _D_o_m_a_i_n

     _D_o_m_a_i_n_s usually name a host  within  an  administrative
hierarchy.   For  Tymnet, a _d_o_m_a_i_n is the _h_o_s_t-_n_a_m_e followed
by a dot and the name _T_Y_M_N_E_T.  Tymcom-X hosts are  addressed
by  using  the  system  name which is displayed by the SYSNO
command.  This consists of a single letter designating which
computer center|- the host is located  in,  followed  by  the
_________________________

decimal host number.  For example,

     JDoe@C39.Tymnet

will address the username _J_D_o_e on Tymnet host 39.  Users  of
one  of  the  inter-Ontyme  systems may be addressed using a
host name of _O_n_t_y_m_e._T_y_m_n_e_t.  For example,

     Corp.Smith@Ontyme.Tymnet

will address the user  id  Smith  in  account  Corp  in  the
inter-Ontyme  system.   Other  hosts, such as _t_y_m_i_x (the NTD
VAX), or any  of  the  Augment  Office  systems  are  simply
addressed as in the following examples:

     roguer@tymix.Tymnet
     ident@Office-2.Tymnet

     If both the sender and recipient share a  part  of  the
domain hierarchy, then the common portion need not be speci-
fied.  For example, a Tymnet user addressing another  Tymnet
user may simply specify the _h_o_s_t-_n_a_m_e:

     JDoe@C39

Further, if the user is on the same host,  only  the  _l_o_c_a_l-
_p_a_r_t need be specified:

     JDoe

_1._2._3.  _C_o_m_m_e_n_t_s

     Addresses may  contain  comments  in  parenthesis,  for
example, in

     JDoe@FunnyHost (John Q. Doe)

the name in parenthesis is ignored by the system, but  makes
the  address more user friendly.  Another form of comment is
followed by the actual address in angle-brackets:

     John Q. Doe <JDoe@FunnyHost>

_1._3.  _A_s_s_i_g_n_e_d _D_o_m_a_i_n_s

     The following _d_o_m_a_i_n_s are assigned at  this  time.   An
attempt  to  send  a  message  to a non-existent domain will
result in the message (eventually)  being  returned  to  the
_________________________
satisfy  the restriction that _s_u_b-_d_o_m_a_i_n_s may not begin
with a digit.  Within TUMS, this character is optional,
and  if  present  is  ignored (so it doesn't have to be
correct).

     Note that when sending messages to Usenet  sites,  they
should be addressed relative to the _t_y_m_i_x system:

     hosta!hostb!...!hostz!user@tymix.Tymnet

where _h_o_s_t_a!_h_o_s_t_b!...!_h_o_s_t_z is the routing from _t_y_m_i_x to the
destination host, _h_o_s_t_z, and _u_s_e_r is a user known to _h_o_s_t_z.

_2.  _R_u_n_n_i_n_g _T_U_M_S-_X

     The  TUMS-X  program  is  only  installed  on   certain
Tymcom-X hosts.  On these hosts, it may be run with the com-
mand

     -R TUMS

or, if the user has an INIT program which sets _S_p_e_c_i_a_l  _C_o_m_-
_m_a_n_d _M_o_d_e, it may be run simply as

     -TUMS

     TUMS will respond with a welcome message containing the
version  and  the  date it was compiled.  If it is the first
time the user has  run  TUMS,  it  will  create  two  files,
TUMS.MSG  and  TUMS.TIX,  which  will always remain present.
Further, if the user has any mail in the file MAIL, it  will
be  copied  into  TUMS.MSG  and deleted.  This may take some
time.

     The default prompt is a greater than symbol which indi-
cates  it  is  ready  to  accept a command.  Commands may be
abbreviated to their point of uniqueness.  If the  user  has

_2._1.  _F_i_l_e_s

     Several files are used by TUMS-X to maintain  the  mes-
sage  database.  In most cases, the user has no control over
the names used for these files.  The files always reside  in
the logged in directory to allow the user the freedom to GFD
free of concern over the mail database.

_2._1._1.  _T_U_M_S._M_S_G

     This file contains the headers and bodys  of  all  mes-
sages.   Since  the character position of each field of each
message is known by TUMS, this file must not  be  edited  or
otherwise  tampered  with.   Each message in this file has a
message number which is assigned sequentially  as  the  mes-
sages  arrive.   As  messages  are  deleted  and their space
reclaimed, the message numbers are reused.  Each message has
associated with it a set of status flags:

_2._1._2.  _T_U_M_S._T_I_X

     This file contains pointers and selected  fields  along
with  some  bookkeeping information.  This file is in binary
format and must not be edited or  otherwise  tampered  with.
If  this  file is damaged, it can be reconstructed, but mes-
sage status will be lost.

_2._1._3.  _T_U_M_S._I_N_I

     This file contains profile  initialization  information
in the form of arguments to the SET command.  It is normally
created with the PROFILE command, but it is an ordinary text
file and may be edited directly.

_2._1._4.  _M_A_I_L

     Mail which is read by RDMAIL is placed  in  this  file.
At  initialization,  TUMS  will  copy  these  messages  into
TUMS.MSG and then delete MAIL.  Since  these  messages  were
put  in MAIL as a result of being read, TUMS will mark these
messages READ when they are copied.

_2._2.  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _E_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s

     Many commands in TUMS take an argument which is a  _m_e_s_-
_s_a_g_e  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  This specifies which messages the command
is to operate on.  A message expression may be a simple mes-
sage number or a complex infix expression.

     The syntax of message expressions is  described  below.
A  similar  message  can  be  displayed online by entering a
question mark anywhere  a  message  expression  is  expected
(i.e., LIST ?).

     The dashed line seperator may be specified by the  user
to  be  any  string by setting the INCLUDE.SEP profile vari-
able.

_3._1_4.  _H_E_L_P _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The help command (also a question mark) produces a list
of commands with a brief description of each one.

_3._1_5.  _K_E_Y_W_O_R_D_S _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The specified keywords are added to the Keywords  field
of  the  specified  messages.   Keywords  should  be  single
tokens, with hyphens for word seperators if necessary.  TUMS
converts  all keywords to upper case to facilitate matching.
The syntax is

     KEYWORDS _k_e_y_w_o_r_d-_l_i_s_t _m_e_s_s_a_g_e-_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n

where the keyword list is a comma seperated list of  tokens.
If  the message expression is omited, it will default to the
current message.

_3._1_6.  _L_I_S_T _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The messages specified in the argument  are  listed  on
the   terminal  in  a  format  determined  by  the  variable
LIST.FORMAT.  The default format is "#!DAS" which produces a
table  with  one  line  per message and the columns: message
number, message status, date, to/from address, and subject.

_3._1_6._1.  _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e _L_I_S_T._F_O_R_M_A_T

     The LIST.FORMAT variable specifies the  format  of  the

output  from  the  LIST command.  Each non-numeric character
specifies a column in the output.  The column width  may  be
altered  from those shown in the table by preceding the for-
mat character with the desired width in decimal.

_3._1_7.  _L_O_G_O_U_T _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This  command  detaches  the  terminal,   performs   an
expunge, then logs out.

_3._1_8.  _M_A_R_K _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The messages specified  in  the  argument  are  marked.
This  can  been  seen  in the status on the LIST command and
used in selecting messages  with  the  MARKED  and  UNMARKED
selectors  in  message expressions.  The meaning of the mark
is left to the user to define.  One possible  use  is  as  a
memo  to  indicate further action is required on the subject
described by the message.

_3._1_9.  _M_O_V_E _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This behaves like the COPY command except  the  message
is marked for deletion after it is copied.

_3._2_0.  _N_E_T_M_A_I_L _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This forces the network mail deamon to run and possibly
process  some undelivered mail.  This is normally not neces-
sary since the program is started automatically  whenever  a
message requiring network transport is sent.  This may cause
other people's mail to be processed at your expense.

_3._2_1.  _N_E_W_S _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This command displays notes about changes to TUMS-X  in
reverse  version  order.   Version  numbers  are octal.  The
first time a user runs a new version of TUMS-X, the news for
that version is automatically displayed at initialization.

_3._2_2.  _N_E_X_T _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This command reads the next message in  the  read  set.
The  read set is the group of messages specified in the last
READ command.  If the read set is  empty,  this  command  is
identical  to  READ.   The  macro |^N (_C_o_n_t_r_o_l-_N) is normally
bound to this command.

_3._2_2._1.  _N_E_X_T _D_E_L_E_T_E _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This variation of the NEXT command deletes the  current
message  before  displaying  the next message.  The macro |^K
(_C_o_n_t_r_o_l-_K) is normally bound to this command.

_3._2_3.  _P_R_E_V_I_O_U_S _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This command displays the previous message in the  read
set.  The read set is the group of messages specified in the
last READ command.  The macro  |^P  (_C_o_n_t_r_o_l-_P)  is  normally
bound to this command.

_3._2_4.  _P_R_I_N_T _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     This command may take two forms:

     PRINT _e_x_p
     PRINT FILE _f_i_l_e _e_x_p

The first form prints the specified message(s) on  the  file
TUMS.PRT,  while  the second form allows the user to specify
the file name.

_3._2_5.  _P_R_O_F_I_L_E _C_o_m_m_a_n_d

     The file TUMS.INI is written with  the  values  of  all
variables which have been changed from their default values.
The SHOW command indicates variables which have been changed
with an asterisk                        - 22 -

Hmmmmm,
   Interesting.  We got a garbage PC from the interval timer interrupt
and crashed.  Looking at the crash briefly, IRPPDP[ 57  IRP620[ 63
PC from interrupt[ 116224,,14417  $8o; 47,45,1,220,360
Now, see IRING+62[ 116224,,14417    ... Hmmmm ...  It appears that the
very last piece of data written by the base, (?before updating IRP620)
is the same as the garbage PC stored by the JSR PAT+3.  I think this is
the correlation that we were specifically looking for. !!!!

Hello,
  I've been staying with Carl since last Thursday.  It seems that because
of me, he's been in bed all week end and is still too sick to come into
the office.  He's been trying to get rid of me, but I keep hanging on.  He
will try to get rid of me by tomorrow so that he can come in for the weekly
meeting.
  Right now, his head is all stuffed up and his eyes are buring a little
so I'm keeping him in bed.  Send him mail if you want something & he'll try
to get back to you.

Bye.

   Hello there Mr. C...

o  How is the "FLU" man doing? Hope getting better w/o too much misery.

o  I have not looked at the crash on C33 yet, but will.

o  C34 crashed twice (Sunday 3/3) just with /K-17 patch without TUMS
   runnung. That leaves either a bad patch (more likely not) or a big
   "BUG", will experiment running /K-17 under a control environment.
   System now running with /K-15 (SYS)BACKUP. I talked to WRS about
   this and he is very much interested.

o  All the crash reports are finished and the files under CRASH
   CRSHID.NAJ and CRSHID.BEF are the output from CRSHID with /Format
   switch.

    Oh..well I got to go eat dinner, so see you when you get in..

This morning's crash on C39 was my fault.  I was looking at the IRPPDP
location and as my cursor went off the screen instead of .[ .[ .[
we ended up with .[ .[ .<return>  thereby depositing the wrong value
into IRPPDP (or was it IRP620?), anyway I was [write enabled] and the
system went down, I'll bet with an input ring processing timeout crash.

Hi there Bill..

I didn't make it to Carl's house warming party, had a very bad cold but,
I plan on coming to yours. I was just wondering what is the age limit
for the party?. Do you remember the "OLYMPIC MATERIAL" son I had on
January 8, well he is nursing and he likes to eat all the time(so it seems).
Please let me know if there is any problem over bringing him.

Subject: Recent crashes on 33,56,39

Craig,
  Yes!  The crashes mentioned above ARE of the type that we've been
discussing.  On 33 & 39 we have one crash each at the PC format check
patch address, and CRA001 on system 56 is indeed another crash with
"base" type data in the PC word.

  On 33 & 39 I've located data in the IRING which matches the bad PC,
however it is not conclusive at this time, since on 33 the data appeared
in dozens of locations, and on 39 it appeared at IRING+161/163? while
both IRP620 & IRPPDP said 14.

  However, it is conclusive that the PC address is being clobberred by
data from somewhere (even if we can't assume that it's the base).

Thanks to Osman and Carl, we've found BOOTS.SAV for the F3 and demonstrated
that it works properly on 930.  (SYS)CRASH.SAV is also "fixed" now, so we
are able to save crashes on 930 as well.  I tested this by depositing 'CARL'
in 30 from home today, and it worked fine!  (SYS)CRA001.SAV was saved just
a short while ago.

Subject: F3 boots & CRASH.SAV on 897

We found the correct BOOTS.SAV to write boots out to the F3s, so I
made a point in re-writing it on system 897 and then I expanded the
(SYS)CRASH.SAV file to the correct size (512 pages).

The next crash should be automatically saved and the system should
re-boot itself without operator intervention.  We should probably
test this sometime to make sure it's all setup, but if either of you
happen to notice that 897 gets reloaded and the OPER didn't do it,
please let me know.

Subject: Base type 7 (KL), ILLINS (KI)

I don't know how much you were told before you left for Maynard, but
it has been determined exactly as we thought, that the base type 7
crashes and the illins+2 crashes are caused by the same series of events.

In both crash types, the frame pointed to in c<JOB> has "just" received a
LOGIN request message from the base.  In each case c<IRPPDP> points just
past the LOGIN message in the IRING for the port assigned to frame c<JOB>.

The reason reason we're seeing the bad-PC is because the CURUPT and the
UPT page are being set to 0, then some memory reference fails, it takes
the page-fail vector [location 501] using the current UPT page 0, i.e.
it fetches the PC word from physical location 501, which just happens to
be IRING+161, thus EUREKA! the PC looks like a base word.  I've checked
and the only cases where this is not apparently true is where the base
has already overwritten location 500/501 with new data.

Anyway, in most cases, this new PC attempts to do something, and most of
the cases I've researched, the PC is in another section, and either ERASTS
or SAVERA has reflected similar information.

I'm still looking, but I have NOT YET found where anything happens with
the new frame, thus causing all of this stuff.  On the KI, if you remember
I followed it all the way to job termination.  On the KL, I've followed
it through to where the scheduler gets involved, but have not seen where
the particular frame is setup...

(m33:930)TIMOUT.LOG is a "pretty'd up" log of some of the stuff I've been
looking at.  You and Joe can look over some of it and let me know when I
come in today, what else we can look for.  Finding the right place in the
sources may sound easier, but if we can't trace it to pinpoint it to the
same place in the source by the register and memory contents, we are still
guessing.

Subject: Base type 7, aka KAF

More discourse on our base type 7 (KL), illins+2 (KI) crashes,
also known as (aka) KAF or the 10-year bug [at DEC].

I think our KAF is "not" the same as DEC's bug, although I have made
no real conclusions.  Tracing the code, I've found more info, but not
the cause or the cure....

  Darren's new code in COMCON et al is straightforward & careful.  If
  the problem is "newly created" there, I'd doubt it.  Frame creation
  from the forced-login follows along just fine, including context-page
  generation, rescheduling again ... until LOGINN is in core & running.
  [The code, that is... not the frame in our crashes... that's our mystery]

  Somehow, we have a frame, with no context pages, a command pending,
  jbtnam/"LOGINN"  DDB & LDB assigned ok, jbtsts/JNA only, presumably
  in the RUNQ, [STOPQ=32, and jbtq(j)/-34,,-34  or -33,,-33 in most
  cases] and jbtctx/0 jbtupm/0.

  My suspicions are that in killing a previous frame, something didn't go
  completely away yet, due to rescheduling, or something... and that we
  should try to fix it as the previous frame is going away.

Subject: "CPU" program requires PERF. uuo

To get the cache hit ratio, the program issues a PERF. uuo (CALLI 162)
to enable the performance meters in the KL hardware.  The monitor translates
this to do a WRPAE instruction (BLKO TIM,=702100,,0) which tells the
KL to count the number of cache misses.  This number is divided by the
MBOX count to get the cache miss ratio.

I believe that this feature needs a change to the Monitor sources, and
is too complex to be done as a DDT patch.

Subject: WRPAE and RDPERF

We're discussing performance gathering... I'm not sure how complicated
a patch for doing either the WRPAE or RDPERF might be, but I don't
think that it would be all that difficult.  It looks pretty simple.
I'm not sure about where we have the MBOX count (except on an individual
user by user basis for accounting) but it should be easy enouh to
gather it together for a ratio.

We should discuss this more on Tuesday, at the 1:00 meeting.  /Carl

     THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHEN THE VALLEY FORGE DATA   
 CENTER WILL BE CLOSING.  INITIALLY IT WAS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE DURING THE   
 THIRD QUARTER.  WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT CLOSED BY THE SECOND QUARTER.    
 THUS, SHUTDOWN PROCEDURES ARE BEGINNING APRIL 19, 1985.  THE TENTATIVE    
 PLAN IS TO MOVE THE 370 SYSTEMS TO THE DALLAS CENTER AND DIVIDE THE  
 PDP-10'S BETWEEN FREMONT AND CUPERTINO CENTERS.  
     
     ALL BUSINESS UNITS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE VALLEY FORGE SHUTDOWN.   
 SOME SPECIAL CONTRACTS OR PROCESSING AGREEMENTS FOR CLIENTS MAY EXIST
 THAT THEY MAY NOT BE AWARE OF.  IF YOU KNOW OF ANY SPECIAL AGREEMENTS
 FOR CUSTOMERS PLEASE LET YOUR BUSINESS UNIT OR RPM KNOW.  GIVEN THE START 
 DATE OF APRIL 19, 1985 WE WOULD APPRECIATE NOTIFICATION BY NEXT WEEK,
 MARCH 25, 1985.    
     
     WE REALIZE THIS IS NOT ALLOWING MUCH TIME TO ACCOMPLISH SUCH A   
 COLOSSAL TASK BUT THE BENEFITS WILL BE A GREAT COST SAVINGS FOR ISG. 
     
     I CAN BE REACHED AT (408)446-6870 OR VIA ONTYME AT CPC.L/MORRIS.

Well guys,
  It looks like the MACRO idea is out... I looked and there's
actually too many places where it is really only switching ac blocks
plus one or 2 places where it really wants to turn off paging for
real...
  Anyway, I've added a new STOPCD in CLOCK1 @ CIP7+3 if the UBR is
set to zero.  That's all we can do for now until we know why/how we
are getting a zero JBTUPM /// sigh.

  The testing is still on...

(CARL:26) 26XN08.SAV has this new STOPCD
          26XNEW.SAV has the IRING @ some other place
          26XBAS.SAV has both the STOPCD & the moved rings

It will be interesting to see what happens... & while we're there
we can get Joe's tape stuff, & check the tape library situation...on
system 33's tapes.   ...

Subject: C39 P034/N08 (N09)?

Bill,
  We did some testing on C26 yesterday and conclusively found out that it
is both possible to move the IRING out of page 0 and change it's size.  We
ran 3 test monitors:
  1) to test whether the system would come up with code to check for missing
     context page base address & stopcd ...
  2) moving the IRING from location 320-517 to 4020-4217
  3) changing the size of IRING (SIZIRG) so we went from 4020-4417 (400 words)

Well,  everything worked fine.  The system came up on the network and ran
fine in all three cases.  So, as a result, we are going to put up a similar
monitor on C39 with the IRING moved to page 4, and some "special" trap
vectors setup in page 0 to trap our UBR=0 bug.  [We hope the stopcd @ CIP7+3
will catch it, but just in case...]  IRING & ORING will retain their original
size for now, but I want to talk to you about C39 performance and changing
the size of the rings...  remember we talked about this once before but I
thought we thought the location/size was hardcoded in the base...

Anyway, the new monitor should be up sunday night/monday morning.

Subject: Deleted files

We are **LOW** on disk space, due to whatever reasons... and the LOGINN
message says to move things which don't need to be done on 930 elsewhere,
BUT ** PLEASE ** don't delete files in directories which are not your own.
This means any system directory, or library directory.  If you created the
files there, it's ok to delete them, but if you didn't... please don't.

I've had to request files in SYS, UN1, XEXEC be restored 'cause someone
thought they could delete them... and other problems have occurred due to
OLD versions of files being restored over top of newer versions....

I will take care of LIBRARY directories on 930... please police your own
directories ONLY.  Thank you.

PS: As yet, no one has even owned up to deleting the UN1 files... this is
    why I'm being so vehement & sending such a long message about such a
    minor problem...
