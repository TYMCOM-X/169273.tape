Subject: "All 3 AR.ARX crashes on F29 show"... 

All 3 AR.ARX crashes on F29 show the same problem.
In each case, the PC is at PAGP3R+52, trying to execute HRRZ U,CLOCK.
The contents of location CLOCK are in the cache, and a parity error is detected
in the AR when it gains bit 1.

CRA009 07:32 good=004400,,006752  bad=204400,,006752  differ=200000,,000000
CRA009 08:37 good=004400,,006751  bad=204400,,006751  differ=200000,,000000
CRA010 13:12 good=004400,,006756  bad=204400,,006756  differ=200000,,000000

CLOCK is at address 111343.  I suspect the cache line that holds words at
addresses xxx340+xxx341+xxx342+xxx343.		/Joe

Problem:  Bad file (SYS)HOME.SYS on DSKB5(BPA16) page 4.
Fix:      This page is part of BOOTS.  As long as DSKB5 does not get moved
          to BPA0 or BPA10, this will not cause any problems.
          The bad page has been reassigned to the file DSKB5.BAD and
          marked NFS so that TITO will ignore it.

In-reply-to: your message of Sat, 13 Aug 88 12:15:16 PDT

In reference to bad spot on DSKB5 page 4:
No, DSKCLN will not fix hard read errors in HOME.SYS.  In fact, it will
complain that the RIB to HOME.SYS is wrong and refuse to bring the system
up.  Luckily, the read error on cyl 0 head 0 rec 17 was temporary.  I can
now read and write this page.  Therefore I have reset the RIB back to normal.

If the read error had been solid, you would have had to copy out the pack
before the system could be brought up for users.  It's probably worth
copying out the pack that is currently on BPA16 at the next scheduled downtime.
