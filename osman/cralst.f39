Testing DSKB14:(BPA3) for errors.
I am running some programs to check if there are any more read errors on
BPA3.  I expect the count of HDEV errors to increment while the test is
running and some BADPAG messages to be printed on the CTY.  Don't be
suprised if the select light on BPA3 stays on continuously.

Subject: Hotline call for B39 

20-Jul-88 22:08/Joe
Incident: none, just message to call Mike Silva at Fremon Data Center
Problem:  B39 crashed with IME again, 6th time today.
          It passed diags, including 'B' string, but died even on the two-pack
          test system.
Status:   I was unable to login with the system up MANUAL because username
          JMS does not have shut-override on BUBBNET.  (Neither does OPER!)
          System would not stay up long enough to run fast DSKCLN using
          NOINITIA.  I had Mike bring B39 up in CONSOLE mode to copy all
          the crash dumps to tape so they could be restored to X32.
Analysis: All crash dumps are very consistent.  Page fault at USRCLK+4.
          The only way to get there is via:
		CIP5:	SKIPLE	J,JOB##
			 PUSHJ	P,USRCLK	;See if user wants a clock trap
          Location JOB is zero but PREVAC+J is 400.  That is, bit 27 is set
          in ac 2 of AC block 1.  Looks like a problem with SKIPLE or FM.

Subject: "I gave explicit instructions on"... 

I gave explicit instructions on what to do on system 74 that were not followed.
I asked that FSC work on BPA12 until it could be made on-line, and that the
operator bring the system to the FILES dialog so that the monitor would
verify that all of DSKB was present and not come up to users.

I regret not having demanded that F74 be halted when I was informed that it
went into auto-restart anyway.  At least one SAT page on BPA12 was wrong, and
since a full DSKCLN was not run, it allowed new files to be written on top
of old files.

The list of damaged files is so long that it overflowed the CTYLOG buffer.
It is important that the hardcopy from F74 be saved for analysis.  Did
DSKCLN report all errors on one unit (DSKB6:)?

The RIB error on [11334,15162].UFD and problems when doing "GFD BSCDEV"
were caused by a read failure when BPA4 got hung (DSKB5 is on BPA4).

RIB error in DSKB:[11334,15162].UFD[1,1] on DSKB5: page 010164

The problem went away when I killed a detached job that had been trying to
GFD to BSCDEV.  This caused the monitor to re-read the RIB, which succeeded.

Subject: "The message user parity error"... 

The message '"Spurious" user parity error interrupt' means the system got a
parity error indication while running in user mode.  The monitor did a sweep
of all of core, but could not find the word with bad parity.  It then marked
all of the unfortunate user's core as bad ("ALL CORE REMOVED").  An unwanted
side effect of this is that each page of the user's core was reported as an
EVENT stopcode BADPAG.  The pages reported at 17:10:44 24-Jul-88 and on
06:58:25 25-Jul-88 are not really bad.  Their entries in the BAT pages have
been removed - run (MPL)TYPBAT to see the current list.     /Joe

THe file has been repaired so that normal TITO restore will work properly.

Please restore all incremental backups and the latest all-files for username
(FELDMAN) on system 39.  Use Mode Old Newest... One page of the UFD was lost
which account for about 100 files maximum.

Thanks.

Subject: B39 hotline call - disk problem fixed by a reload. 

27-Nov-88 18:01 /Joe  (800)678-3399 incident #37
Contact:  Fremont Operations (415)498-2588, Mike Silva
Problem:  One of the disks went off-line.  B39 got about 7 disk-related
          error messages (continuable stopcodes) pointing to several files.
Fix:      Told them to login MANUAL and try to do a DIR on each file that
          had been having problems.  If no BADSAT or BADUFD problems, just
          do a FULL DSKCLN.  No further problems were reported.
FSR: 246-1490-44     No fault found (problem went away)
