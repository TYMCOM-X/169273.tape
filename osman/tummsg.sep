Okay.  I think F3 uCode is the one who "knows" IRING/ORING locations.  I
also think there may be some backpressure side effects from expanding the
input ring.  Need to do some high bandwidth throughput tests to see if
any characters get lost on input.  -Bill

Hello There..

   Some of the things...You Should Know...

o  System F74 was brought on /N Monitor @3/31 0500 to see what happens.
   But system crashed @3/31 1330 with "Input Ring Process Time-Out" crash,
   just like the others. I asked Operations to bring the system with its
   old /K-13 monitor.Ohhh wellll....

Subject: Deleted files!!!!!

Ok everyone:
   *** We are low on disk space on 930 ***

  This means police your own directories and clean up things which don't need
to reside on system 930.  This does NOT mean to delete files which do NOT
belong to you.

  Someone has been deleting files from system directories & it is causing
havoc, and wasting my valuable time figuring out what was deleted (by whom)
and having it replaced.  Directories which we know have had files deleted
include (SYS), (UN1), (GAMES), (MAIL) and a couple of others.  If another
directory gets cleared by an un-authorized person, then this system will 
become a restricted system.  All usernames not personally known to me will
be removed.  License will be reduced or removed for any account which does
not show a definate need for said license.

SUBJECT>   INTEGRATION OF FIELD SERVICE WITHIN ISG GOLD SECTOR


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


During 1984 a Task Force, made up of the heads of the six independent
ISG service organization, was convened to determine an optimum 
organization of the Field Service function within the Information Systems
Group.  Criteria for the in-depth study included customer satisfaction, 
business and sales force satisfaction, efficient use of resources,
and operation of Field Service as a profit center.

The Task Force's recommendations called for rapid integration of Field
Service capabilities, using a phased approach.  The recommendations have
been approved for Gold Sector Field Service and, effective March 18, 1985,
McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company is established.  This company
will be headquartered in Irvine, California, and will consist of the
Field Service elements formerly based in McDonnell Douglas Computer
Systems Company, Network Field Engineering (Tymnet) and Computer
Systems and Support (Tymshare).  These organizations were chosen since
together they constitute approximately 80% of the service activity and
all provide service for horizontal businesses.

The second phase recommendations for further integration were not
approved.  Therefore, the Field Service operations in McDonnell Douglas
Health Systems Company and McDonnell Douglas Manufacturing Industry
Systems Company will remain independent and separate.  However, these
components will be encouraged to take maximum advantage of the field
service capabilities and economies of scale offered by the new Field
Service Company.
                                                                Page  2


It gives me great pleasure to announce the appointment of Vern Hart as
President of the McDonnell Douglas Field Service Company, effective
March 18.  Vern has served as Vice President of Field Service for
Microdata/McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems Company since May, 1982,
and brings to this new assignment over 20 years of computer service
management experience.  Reporting to Vern will be Curt Miller, Vice
President, Network Field Engineering, and John Swarbrick, Vice
President, Computer Systems and Support.  Vern will act as Vice President,
Computer Systems Company Field Service for the present.

Bert Novak, formerly Group Vice President, Computer Management Service
Group, will assume special responsibilities as of March 18, 1985,
reporting directly to me on a variety of ISG Gold assignments.  I look
forward to his assistance in working through the challenges which
await us in the immediate future.

Please join me in wishing Vern and all of his associates in the new
Field Service Company our very best as they embark on this exciting
and promising opportunity.

Apparently, this may be a real ILLINS+2 (INSSIM+2) crash.  I looked at it
but cannot conclusively convince myself that I found the physical memory
location where the [0] was executed from.  It may be one of our phanthoms
where it got a 0, when a zero wasn't really there... sigh!

Bill,
  Yes... I've known about 897's problem with the lud. I've spent some
time looking at it, but haven't completely diagnosed the problem.  The
LUD entries themselves seem ok, 'cept for a couple of non-matching
DUL entries... I'm sure that there's a block pointer that's messing
up the works...
  Since looking up a USERNAME that exists isn't a problem, I haven't
made fixing it a high-priority item.  I will get to it sooner or later.

One solution is to copy 39's LUD, lock stock and barrel, to 897 and be
done with it.  I think that's what I did when we first brought up 897
for NTD.  I don't think anybody's valid on 897 that isn't on 39.  They
may have different quotas, but that doesn't bother me if I have to fix
a few by hand.  What you think?  -Bill

Bill,
  If I can't straighten out the block pointers, then fine, we can copy
39's lud & dul.  (Actually that's where the problem started... then
validations started deleting usernames... and their software doesn't seem
to "always" clean up after itself, so it left bad block & bad entry pointers
around.)   At this point I wouldn't be too sure that 39's lud is perfect
either...  I'll send you all mail after I check out the pointers.

Subject: disk space

Not that I'm worried, but it's interesting to find a directory that has
more files in it than in (SYS)... do you know if anyone polices the files
put into directory (UTIL) on the customer systems?

System 26 has over 20K pages, mostly due to some data bases that someone
appears to be keeping in directory UTIL.  I suspect that they don't really
belong there... but...  do a DIR/STORAGE on (UTIL:26) and see what I mean.

Also, [SYSMON.FT0,.FT1,.FT2,.FT3] in same directory, since you have such
influence with operations... could I give you a lesson on how to use PCOM
and then you can show operations how, so that they can (or we can) re-write
these above-mentioned files to use PCOM instead of COM.  These files seem
to be used to build MONITOR BOOT TAPES, and if they rely on the COM program
then the results could be disasterous...  granted, they test the tapes before
they rely on them, but... I'd rather be safe & do things right.

** I hope you're having a good vacation **  See you Monday.

I was going to be in today, in fact I was going to be in CUPC myself
but things didn't work out as for that schedule, again.  I'm currently
stranded at home with Cherie's car but no keys, so I guess I won't be
in, so stay in CUPC.  Tomorrow - I will be in cupertino, lunch with
Bill, stop to see Adele, stop to help Jan with something, stop to see
the tape librarian in CUPC..., stop at AAA in sunnyvale before 5.

What's happenning with 58's monitor... Have you built a CONF58, CNFN58
and MON58 file yet?  and by the way, you do know about the PCOM files
setup in (M33) to build monitors?  You say, "PCOM MONED1 xx" where xx
is the system number.  That way you can't make mistakes ---- ok?  I
use it all the time.

I just copied DRWSPR.EPO from 34 to 58, & setup 58 in 34's PJ data file.
so that is done, hopefully everything else will work fine.

available in documentation at all or hard to find.

  I am sorting through a collection of tips from many sources and 
trying to verify or try each before adding it to the TECHLIB.
I'M off to a slow start and will be adding subjects as they are
edited.

  SHARE YOUR WEALTH of information. If you have tips,programs ,
testing procedures which you would like to share send it to me 
for incorporation in TECHLIB.



  TECHLIB is in the ** group of files.  To use TECHLIB  first
take a look at  ** TECHLIB.INDEX which will contain a short description
of each topic.  The topics each have a unique name such as ** TECHLIB.
MEMTEST1  which is a toggle in test for memory.

  Ingrid,
 
  A. Thank you for your advance  notice concerning the command package and

  I would like to  get release N running on all of our  systems as soon as
  possible, but I need to know if :
 
  1.  these monitors  have been  generated with  the appropriate  freecore
      parameter value for our 2020's.
  2.  The monitors have  been generated with or  without line-printer sup-
      port. (We do  not have printers on  all of our 2020's,  and a system
      without a  printer will not boot  using a monitor with  printer sup-
      port).

Resource Planning and Management (RPM) in a joint effort with Dallas  
Operations plan to permanently shutdown system D32 on April 23, 1985. 
     
All billable and non-billable usernames will be relocated to system D27,   
C29, C34, or D54 on April 19, 1985 beginning at 17:00 CST.  All files 
and tapes will be transferred to the new system by RPM at this time. The   
billable users and their support users assign to District 38, 70, 72, 
74, 79, and username TYMACS will be relocated to system D27. The bill-
able users and their support users assign to District 51, 52, 86, 92, 93,  
95, 96, 182, and 251 will be relocated to system C29. The billable users   
and their support users assign to District 10, 11, 12, 16, 26, 32, 44,
46, 49, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 127, and 146 will be relocated to system  
C34.  Tymnet usernames will be relocated to system D54. Files belonging

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


I just spoke with Osman Guven, who mentioned that about 2 months ago he
sent a memo to you outlining the information you need about the
P034/N monitor files.  The current configuration has changed since that
time: i.e., system 60 has been added, and 264 now has a printer while
301 does not.  The freecore parameter value is appropriate as before.
    
Osman says he will wait until he gets the go-ahead from you before
making changes to accomodate the new configuration.  Please feel free
to contact him directly to authorize this.  Many thanks,
                                                        Ingrid

Hi There..

Systems C36,C897,C930 and F58 are running /N10 monitor.
Systems C33, C39, C57 will be coming up with /N10 on next bring up.
System  D56 is still down, will take care of it when it comes up.

Subject: /N10

Bill,
  Systems C36, C897 are currently running /N10.  Systems C39, C57 will
be coming up on /N10 at the next scheduled reload.  57 is a KI and we
will get a chance to see if the ILLINS+2 crashes there are caught by
the same stopcd (if any at all*).

* /N10:  It seems that after our discussion, the last item we talked
about for checking if the job is in the NULQ started me thinking.  At
first I was going to check if the current PJBSTS field was the NULQ.
Well, that's not true in the case where PJBSTS == NULQ but JRQ is on!!!
So, we looked further... DECHJB which checks if a job going away and if
it needs to DECrement the HighJB variable checks JNA+CMWB+JRQ.  It seems
that FRMASN only checked JNA+CMWB.  SO... in addition to checking to see
if the frame is in the NULQ (JBTSTS==0; never used yet | PJBSTS==NULQ),
when I check JNA+CMWB I'm also checking JRQ.

  This is interesting in as much as if the job was in queue X and was
supposed to be put into the NULQ the next scheduler call (JRQ is set)
then someone comes along sees JNA off, doesn't check JRQ, re-assigns the
frame number, re-queues it for another queue, then it never goes into
the NULQ !!!  And I suspect something else thinks it can go directly in
the run queue and >BANG< we have our problem...

  It seems reasonable that this could happen, although following the code
it wasn't clear that this COULD happen at all.  Anyway, IF JRQ is set,
I think we shouldn't care what queue it's in or going into... since the
scheduler is expecting to have to do something to it, we shouldn't try
to assign it.. so we should skip it.  This being the case... we should
have solved the problem with this coding change.

  Cross your fingers... 'cause if it's fixed, we can then get on to some
other projects, like STOPCDs on the CTY, EXE files, etc...

It appears to have crashed in the diagnostic check which checks for
%upx+uptlkj = {_%upt+~ruptlkj = %upt++uptjob
what is interesting about this crash is that the user has 511 pages
in the lh(JBTUPM).  I'm not sure what was going on, haven't checked
it far enough, but thought I'd send this along to you to ask if you
remember seeing this kind of crash.... there must have been a reason
to put in the diagnostic check!  Was this Darren's diagnostic to make
sure that J doesn't get cleared by some uuo?

SUBJECT:       NETWORK SECURITY POLICY
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The security and integrity of our corporate information and 
our customers' information is vital to our business thus the    
attached policy on Network Security was developed to guide us.
 
We now have a Data Security function and a Security Policy
Committee  consisting  of:   Clint  DeGabrielle,  Al  Fenn,  
Rick Forberg, Curt Miller, Bob Tomasi, and Wayne Bartlett as
chairman.    This   committee   developed  this  policy  for 
my endorsement.  I strongly support it and the need for 
attention and vigilance in insuring that it is implemented.  
We  will be following this policy with appropriate procedure  
and auditing activities.  In particular the Personnel Security
Agreement for employees will be forthcoming in the near 
future.  There is much you can do at department level to insure
compliance with the policy.
 
Remember, safeguarding corporate assets is part of everyone's
job.
 
Questions about this policy should be directed to Wayne Bartlett,
Director, Data Security, at Orchard Parkway, San Jose.

               GENERAL POLICY ON NETWORK SECURITY
 
 
  I.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this policy is to provide safe-
      guards for the security and integrity of corporate informa-
      tion and customer information in our custody.  This policy
      is to be implemented by management and employees through
      appropriate administrative procedures and safeguards.
 
      For clarity, this policy will be separated into the 
      following categories:      
 
                    A.  NETWORK SECURITY
                    B.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES FOR CUSTOMER DATA
                    C.  PERSONNEL POLICY
 
 II.  POLICIES REFERENCED:  None 
 
III.  SCOPE:  This policy applies to our information and
      data and our customers'data that is stored and trans-
      mitted by TYMNET.
 
 IV.  A.  NETWORK SECURITY:
      
      Data security and network integrity are vital to our 
      business and the business of our customers.  To that end
      we will vigoriously track down violations and support
      prosecutions within the limits of the law.
 
      A data security and integrity function will be maintained
      to foster the development of tools and techniques, and
      to audit, investigate, and evaluate network integrity.
      This function will also support customers in their efforts
      to track, evaluate, and prosecute violations of their data
      security.
 
      Use of passwords provides a key basis for protection of
      information and data within the network.  The following
      policy relates to their use:
 
          1.   USE OF PASSWORDS IS MANDATORY FOR EMPLOYEES
 
          2.   THEY MUST NOT BE DISPLAYED, DOCUMENTED OR
               COMMUNICATED TO OTHERS
 
          3.   A PASSWORD MUST CONSIST OF A MINIMUM OF SEVEN
               CHARACTERS WITH ONE EMBEDDED NON-ALPHA
               CHARACTER
 
 
          
 
     
          4.   INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A HIGH RISK ENVIRONMENT
               OR WHO HAVE ACCESS TO CRITICAL RESOURCES OR FILES
               ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS EVERY 30 DAYS
               OR LESS.  OTHERS ARE REQUIRED TO CHANGE PASSWORDS
               EVERY 90 DAYS OR  LESS

          5.   EVERYONE MUST REPORT ANY SUSPECTED MISUSE PROMPTLY
               TO THE DATA SECURITY FUNCTION
 
      We will actively promote and support all legislative issues
      and all standards activities that we judge to improve or
      enhance the security, integrity, and protection of
      information.
 
      Appropriate  labels and access entry messages will be  used 
      to inform legitimate users and trespassers of the confiden-
      tiality and privacy of information.
 
      A.  CUSTODIAL ISSUES:
 
      We are responsible to protect and preserve all customers'
      data residing on our system with the same safeguards as
      for our own.
 
      Customers are required to use network security features 
      and controls in order to provide security of their own
      information.  We are responsible to inform and educate
      them in the use of these features and controls.  Customers
      are urged to use passwords in a manner similar to our
      requirement for our employees.  The use of passwords is
      a prerequisite  to our support of investigations of
      security problems.
 
      We will support customers in their efforts to investigate
      and track down suspected problems provided that:
 
               1.  They are using the available features and
                   controls
               2.  They are committed to prosecute violators 
 
      Operator  privilege licenses will  not  be  granted  to
      customers.
     
 
 
      C.  PERSONNEL
 
      A security agreement will be reviewed and signed by each
      employee and filed with his/her personnel file.  The agree-
      ment will cover the importance of data security and the

Patched in (M33) SCHED1.PAT and PRVMSK.PAT in running monitor only.  I'll
let you guys put them in SYSTEM.SAV whenever appropriate.  Right now N8-1
is in SYSTEM.SAV and I think the -1 is the two patches mentioned.  What do
you think about making the SCHED1.PAT in source code.  There really is a
noticable difference, at least with our job mix.  We should talk about it.

Osman,
  I've sent you this message on a bunch of systems... just to insure
that you get it.  We had arranged for a ride to the airport, assuming
that our flight was at 9:00 am.  Well, the flight is actually at 12:00
NOON and the person who said that they'd take us will probably NOT be
able to take us.

  Please call us at 408-945-4321 as soon as possible after 8:00 am and
let us know if maybe you could take us to San Jose Airport.  If not, I
will seek alternative transportation.  Thank You.

Subject: N10 monitor did not work on F3 or KS.

Osman built 2 monitors for system 24 and a monitor for 930, and all three
died during ONCE.  I tried putting MAPONC(DUM,1) back in, built F3XN11, and
it worked.  (Of course, changing S.MAC causes all REL files to be
recompiled).  Just to prove that this was the problem, I took MAPONC(DUM,1)
back out, and tried to build F3XN99.  I had to do it twice, because the first
time I used my default MACRO and it would not load.  F3XN99 is running as I
write this.

It looks like some of the REL files in M33 were assembled with the wrong
version of MACRO.  Simply changing S and reassembling ALL modules with the
right MACRO cleared it up.  I plan to look at MACRO more closely.  Until it
is fixed, ALWAYS remember to do ".CTEST SETPROC" before running MONED1.

Field Service Company and CSS.

We are all very proud of you and I offer my congratulations along
with the whole group for a job well done.

Since this contract is nationwide in scope you have provided some
new and challenging opportunities for our Field Service Group in
those 12-15 cities where equipment is located.

I am counting on you to help all of us administer the contract
very heavily during our start-up phase which will continue well
past the start date of May 1, 1985.

Thank you for all your past efforts as well and I am looking
forward to your continued bright future with the Field Service
Company.

Subject: Monitor Sources

Ok now,
  I've re-built an F3 monitor in M33, F3XN10 which is identical to the
monitor in SYSTEM.SAV in SYS.  This was accomplished by "editing" the
CNFNF3.MAC file after MONED1 was finished, and changing the serial number
back to 1305 and the date to 4-14-85.  UUOCON had to have the .N09 source
as .MAC and everything else matched fine.

  All is as was when I built the last set of monitors for the new systems.
I also built a monitor for 57, 58 and 24.  Osman, you can try 57's monitor
on the KI in building A, and I think 58 is now setup for only a single
disk controller (BPA) with up to 16 drives, and I re-assembled 24 with the
NOW current sources.

  *** Please do NOT (-D-O---N-O-T-) monkey around with the sources in ***
      ***  an effort to get system 24 up and running under /N10.  ***

If it still will not come up, please HALT the 2020, and examine the PC
address and see if we can figure out what it's dying on.  Maybe even use
930's copy of 24XN10 in DDT and check out the code...

ONCE can be funny... if it's "pre-BLT" then ONCSTT: is at ONCSTT-%ONC,
otherwise it's in the right place.  So, if it won't come up.. let me
know.  Also test 58[KL] and 57[KI] and get back to me with the results.

  I will be in today, but only for a little while... mostly to get my check.
Since I've spent all night rebuilding monitors.... sigh!

/Carl

PS: Joe, after we're sure the KS works we can think about your addition
    to the gettab tables.  "Think"... It's a great addition, but somehow
    I'd be happier if all of the locations in CNFTBL were put in, not just
    some of the ones we want for specific programs...  CPU/MONITOR-type
    can be determined pretty quickly using other means... sigh.

Subject: F3XNXX Synch with uNode

Well guys, it worked all along... having the system go through the
synch code at clock level lets INITIA get started and DSKCLN and all
that other stuff.  I still haven't added code to "guess" when the
base goes away, but that's the next step.

  What was wrong, and why it didn't come up was in editing SCNSER.MAC
one of the instructions XCT TYPTRN(P1) got clobbered to XCT TYPTRN(P)
i.e. the "1" got erased, and so SCNSER would loop forever as soon as
it finished synchronizing with the micro-base, executing some weird
instruction off in never-never land, always the same, and thus never
incrementing P1 or P4 to look at the next IRING location...

  Anyway, at the moment we're running that code... I'll probably put
some kind of timer or clock that sets a flag whenever so many ticks
have passed and the base hasn't changed the ORP620 pointer after the
host has completely filled it... i.e. output ring processing time-out.
This needs a little thought and a little research before the final
implementation.  Also, I'll need to test the new SCNSER on a KI/KL/KS.

Subject: Sys. 90 OPER username/password

I've found one more system on which we have no OPER username/password
valid, from among our standard set.  Neither "SYSMAINT"/"CEGI SYS" nor
"SSINSTALL"/"PROD PROD" works.  Please validate SYSMAINT in OPER on
system 90.  I believe this is the last of my requests for OPER
validation, until we get SYSMAINT validated on OPER on the CEGI systems
(currently:  59, 60, 83, 92, 170, 184, 264, 301 & 443).  Please let me
know when to expect to be able to user OPER on system 90.

I noticed that SYSMAINT is valid on OPER on 897, but DENCOFF is not.
Has it been decided to limit our OPER usernames on 897 to SYSMAINT, or
will we be getting personal usernames validated in OPER on that
'Tymshare'-related system?  Please let me know if DENCOFF will be valid
on 897.

Thanks!

Subject: system 22 base

Osman,
  I talked with a few people... it seems that the base for 22 is really
ordered for 67 (although it doesn't matter what host) and is setup for
2 201 cards, [Ed Roop thinks each card handles 32 lines], which means it
has 64 ports.  He is going to check tomorrow to see if they can upgrade
it to handle more ports, then will get back to us to cut a monitor for
it with the proper number of ports.

  It is node # 155.  The base for system 34 actually has more ports than
64, but we've only cut 34 for that many.  We will have to do some little
experimentation to find out what RPORTN to cut for a few of these hosts,
but for now.... we wait.

Effective Tuesday, 23 April 1985, security guards have been 
posted in VG l, 2 and 3 between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 
8:00 A.M. Monday through Friday and 24 hours per day Saturday, 
Sunday and holidays.  The presence of a security guard during 
non-working hours will help assist in the control of McDonnell 
Douglas property and will create a safer working environment for 
employees who work after normal working hours.
 
The security guards are employees of California Plant Protection, 
Inc., (CPP) and will be uniformed in a blazer and slacks with the 
CPP emblem on their blazer pocket.  These guards have been hired 
to control MDC's assets leaving these three buildings and to 
provide security to employees working at night and/or on the 
weekend.
 
Reference (a) will be strictly enforced by the security guards to 
control all MDC property leaving VG l, 2 and 3.  A copy of the 
Property Removal and Return Authorization Form must be left with 
the guard or the receptionist in the lobby of the building from 
which the MDC asset is being removed.  No property may be removed 
through any other exits except the lobbies in VG l, 2 and 3.
 
Please disseminate the above information to all your managers and 
supervisors as soon as possible.  The security guards will 
enforce the control of assets, and no property will be permitted 
to leave VG l, 2 or 3 without proper authorization in writing in 
accordance with Reference (a).  Copies of the Property Removal 
and Return Authorization Form are available from Barbara McIntyre,
Ext. 6777, Fixed Asset Accounting.
 
Please call me at Ext. 6548 if you have any questions regarding

Subject: PDP-10 Ports & Bases

FYI: Dave Smith of NTD is interested in whether we can dispense with
     the host/base message telling the base how many ports we have on
     our particular host.  What problem is there in assuming that we
     have the maximum?  (This is apparently 256 due to 8-bit fields.)

  I've looked through sections of the monitor and cannot find any real
reason why we cannot assume 256 real ports.  The two places that I've
seen that restrict the monitor's port capacity are the sixbit device
name in the Device Data Block (DDB) which allows 3 (octal) digits and
the 9-bit port field in the HIBER uuo (Calli 72).  In either case, we
have from 0 to 777 (512 decimal) available, plenty for 256 physical
ports and 256 additional PTY ports (128 PTY pairs).

  If any of you think of any reason WHY we cannot assume 256 physical
ports for the new base interface, please let me know as soo as possible.

Thanks!

give me a call at home, 408-945-4314.  I am keyless, as in we lost the
original, my duplicate and Cherie's copy of the key to one of our cars.
All of them are someplace in the house... so I will be at home, most
certainly.

Will see you all on Tuesday one way or another... send mail or call if
you have any questions.

Just thinking...I wonder how many times somebody does a linear search of
the PGY table.  I can't help but think that performance on 39 isn't what it
should be -- things get slow and I do a HOG and there isn't really anything
running that I would think should make it that slow.  A linear search could
take as long as 75 mS!  If we do one every time a page is mapped, that's
about twice as long as it takes to actually read the page off disk!!!  I
thought you might want to check it out some time.  -Bill

PS - 75 mS ~= 4096 x 2 x 9.16uS based on 12-13 memory references per loop

Well,
  I changed it from IMULI ac,^D1000 IDIVI ac,^D60  to IDIVI ac,^D60 then
IMULI ac,^D1000 and it seems to make absolutely no difference in the result.
I didn't check to see if it was overflowing... it may just be the routine

Just thinking.... I think that the PGY table is "cached"... does that
mean that every time it does a PGY table sweep, it clears all of cache
by putting the PGY table into the cache!

Also, what if we uncache the PGY table... does that mean that since the
KL reads 4 words at a time, linear searches would be slower if it's not
cached... 4 times slower, having to read 4 words again and again?

Suggestions?  Comments?

To set SSW2 just simply type the KLDCP command " SW 20 ".

Subject: .FOCFM - Create frame, NEW STYLE

Remember the bits added to this, 1B17 to run LOGINN, 1B16 to pass license?
I'm looking at what needs to be passed along to a child whenever a job
is started up by a PERP/PCOM/EXEC process.  I've come up with a slightly
longer list than what originally was installed:

	Original		My List
	========		=======
	PPN			PPN
	PRIVS			PRIVS
	AUN			AUN
	Username		Username
				Network Data
				Project Code
	License (if 1B16)	License
				Tru Limit ???
				Core Limit ???

I'm wondering what would break if I added any of these to the standard
list of things to do.  Granted, TRU limit and CORE limit should probably
be set by LOGINN as it is now [LUD DATA], but there has to be a way to
set UPTLOG/LDBLOG and the project-code for royalty & normal accounting.

It may even be reasonable to set these on the LOGIN UUO... I haven't
really looked yet....

Anyway, what have you written which passes license using 1B16?  And how
easy would it be to change it.  I don't know of many programs which even
KNOW about the new format, let alone use it.  It doesn't exist in /K!

Also, new thought:  I'm planning on changing something in this area, and
probably making a new LOGINN which checks to see if things like license
and project code are set already, so as not to haggle with any project-
code validations program if you are running LOGINN in a frame setup by
the .FOCFM FRMOP call.

Please comment now, before I do anything....

[ If the child is being "cloned" from the parent, that is, if it is
being created with the same PPN, etc. then it should get all these things
from the parent.  In fact, I believe that since Darren's work, it will
take all these things from the parent, except TRU LIMIT.  Remember that
Core limit is in JBTPRV so it always has been set.  On the other hand, if
the parent is logging it in with a new PPN, etc. and running LOGINN, then
these things are all specified in the LUD (and should be).  I don't think
Darren finished the changes to LOGINN to go with RUN LOGINN IN CHILD.
I'm not sure, this was in progress when I left.  At any rate, it was
intended (and maybe implemented) so that the user's INIT program and
project code verification program would not be run.  
]

I'm wondering what would break if I added any of these to the standard
list of things to do.  Granted, TRU limit and CORE limit should probably
be set by LOGINN as it is now [LUD DATA], but there has to be a way to
set UPTLOG/LDBLOG and the project-code for royalty & normal accounting.

[ I agree.  There should be a write frame attribute and maybe an
argument to CREFRM to specify a special value for UPTLOG.  This will
allow the submited job to be run "as if from the terminal it was
submited from".  The PERP control file would simply retain the UPTLOG of
the frame that submited the job.  I think that LDBLOG should never be set,
rather, change the GETTAB that everybody uses now to use UPTLOG if it
finds LDBLOG 0 or no terminal.  This is the only total solution since
you can't set LDBLOG if there is no terminal.
]

It may even be reasonable to set these on the LOGIN UUO... I haven't
really looked yet....

Anyway, what have you written which passes license using 1B16?  And how
easy would it be to change it.  I don't know of many programs which even
KNOW about the new format, let alone use it.  It doesn't exist in /K!

[ Yes, I have a few, I think all the MAIL stuff does, not sure.  XEXEC
certainly does.  Why do you want to change it? ]

Also, new thought:  I'm planning on changing something in this area, and
probably making a new LOGINN which checks to see if things like license
and project code are set already, so as not to haggle with any project-
code validations program if you are running LOGINN in a frame setup by
the .FOCFM FRMOP call.

[ Yes, I believe that Darren decided to use JLOG=1 and JBTAUN=0 as a
signal to LOGINN to do special stuff.  After all, when you're running
LOGINN, it will set JBTAUN from the LUD.  Also, it should leave JBTPPN
alone if its non-0, but set it to the AUN if its 0.  I don;t think you
want to run INIT program either.   Again, look in Darren's directory to
see if he started any work on LOGINN, it may just need testing. ]

I will be at a meeting for the "perp replacement" project at 3:00PM.

I would like to get together with you (Joe & Osman at least) for about
an hour or so before that meeting to discuss changes to LOGINN, INITIA,
the operating system and (possibly other cusps) to support the project.
Much that was thought to be completed already has not been done, and I
feel that some discussion as to the final design is in order.  I don't
believe that the decisions should be "arbitrarily" mine, without some
discussion.

Craig, you are welcome, but need not take the time, since this is more
of an information pooling and preliminary strategy meeting.

I plan to be in by 1:PM.  /Carl

Crash table data has been run using the corrected data files CRSHID.YAM

to ERRCON:ILLINS+2 and enpty module names filled in.

Note:  Osman, do we care for our records whether we call it INSSIM+2 or
       ILLINS+2 ???  since INSSIM+2 is really only valid on an F3?  I've
       tried to keep it ILLINS+2...

Anyway, I guess we can bring the results to the tuesday meeting.  In case
anyone has noticed, 6 ILLINS+2 crashes last month, NONE are the zero-UPT
type crashes as best I can tell from the PC contents.  Can we determine
from looking at what is coded in MUR whether there were considered software?
or hardware?

     Subject:      ISG Top Management Appointments



     1.  I am very pleased to announce effective immediately the 
         appointments of Bob Fischer and Gary Liebl as the Information 
         Systems Group Executive Officer and the Group Operating 
         Officer, respectively.  As such they will constitute the 
         headquarters of ISG and will have all business units and group 
         staffs reporting to them.  They will operate as a team with 
         Bob performing the chief executive duties, such as strategic 
         planning, policy formulation and coordination, 
         acquisitions/divestitures, corporate interface, group 
         organizational matters, and supervision of the group staff.  
         Reporting to Bob, Gary will perform the chief operating 
         duties, including overseeing the operation of all the business 
         units, operating plans, productivity programs, and business 
         unit organizational matters.  Both Bob and Gary will continue 
         as MDC officers with the title of Corporate Vice President.

     2.  The breadth and depth of the capabilities spread across our 
         business units offers ISG a unique opportunity.  Bob and Gary 
         will share responsibility for fostering intercomponent 
         relationships to maximize the benefits of this strength.  
         Strategy implementation and strategic and operating results 
         will also be shared responsibilities.

     3.  Temporarily continuing to report to Bob will be McDonnell 
         Douglas Financial Transaction Systems, McDonnell Douglas 
         Information Processing, Dynatax, Unitax and MSGI.  Most of 
         these should be transitioned to Gary by the end of this year.

     4.  I am very enthusiastic about the new ISG headquarters 
         structure and especially about the two new executives who 
         constitute the headquarters team.  Both are seasoned 
         executives with outstanding records, both are highly 
         action-oriented, both know the business intimately, both have 
         strong marketing backgrounds, both are strong advocates of our 
         new culture, both have contributed greatly to the ISG vision 
         and organizational structure as it has evolved, both are team 
         builders, both are outstanding, demanding leaders.   They also 
         represent a good balance in that Bob has extensive large 
         company experience, will continue to be located in St. Louis, 
         and is especially strong in strategic vision and in broad 
         communications/team building.  Gary on the other hand has 
         extensive smaller company experience, will continue to be 
         located in Southern California, and is especially strong in 
         tight operating control and in executive team building.


     5.  Needless to say, the Blue and Gold Sectors are hereby 
         dissolved, as promised.  With essentially all the business 
         units reporting to Gary, ISG will now be run as one integrated 
         group.

     6.  For now there will be a centralized finance support center in 
         St. Louis to provide financial support for those business 
         units which do not yet have fully functional financial 
         organizations.  The goal will be to achieve business unit 
         independence and have the people in this organization placed 
         within those business units no later than the end of 1986.  In 
         addition, decisions on how business units will continue to 
         obtain human resources and law support will be announced soon.

     7.  Concurrent with Bob's and Gary's promotions, Rich Calvert, 
         Jerry Causley, and Vern Smith are promoted to the positions of 
         President of McDonnell Douglas Diversified Information 
         Systems, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems International, 
         and McDonnell Douglas Computer Systems, respectively.

     8.  With these actions the top level organizational structure of 
         ISG is complete with the one exception of the communications 
         industry business unit.  That awaits the completion of the 
         study by the communications industry strategic task force.  
         That should be accomplished by the end of June.

     9.  With the implementation of this organizational structure my 
         active role in ISG will be complete, and I shall return to my 
         other role as President of MDC.  I can do that with great 
         peace of mind and confidence that ISG is in the hands of an 
         outstanding leadership team.

Lunch with Bill is still "on" for today.  However, Bill has a meeting
scheduled at 2PM so instead of lunch at 12noon, we're all meeting at
Bill's office in Bldg D at 11:30.

Joe and I plan to go to DMV and take care of business there first, then
drift over (I hope the time is such that we "drift") to Bldg D.

So... 11:30am at Bill's office!  See you there!

Subject: Status of 2020 hardware 

Craig, what is the status of the 2020 hardware?  Somebody move all three
RM03 disk drives over to the 780.  Is this a temporary arrangement for testing
out the RM03 drives?  When will I be allowed to try to bring up TOPS-10 on the
2020?  I see that Rhett got his RP06 connected to the 2060, but what about the
2nd RP06?  (As of Sunday, it was sitting in our lobby, and is missing all 4
Massbus connectors.)

I will be working at home on Wednesday.... most probably clearing off
disk space from the directories I archived yesterday and fixing up a
new version of CHKPNT to test.

Feel free to call me at home, or beep my beeper in case I step outside

Subject: FREE and XEXEC 

I decided to make some changes to XEXEC which made a whole lot of things
cleaner.  Also faster.  This eliminates the need for the FREE.DAT file I
had described to you on the phone.  Anyway, below is a copy of (WRS:39)
FREE.DOC.  You may also wish to look at (WRS:39)FREE.SAI and (WRS:39)
XEXEC.SAI.  XEXEC is documented on the first page of the .SAI file.  I'd
like to try this out on 39 for a few days and maybe the other systems as
well.  Let me know if you want to put it up somewhere in the next 2-3
days.  Comments and questions welcome of course.

FREE	-    patrol system for excessively idle jobs

	FREE [logfile=][options]

options:

	/IDLE:h		All jobs idle for "h" or more hours (real) will
			be listed.  If /KILL is specified, those jobs
			which are not immune will be killed.

	/FREE:n		The most idle jobs will be listed until enough
			non-immune jobs are listed to reduce the job
			population such that "n" jobs are free.  This
			may not be any jobs if "n" jobs are currently
			free.  If /KILL is specified, those jobs which
			are not immune will be killed.

	/KILL		Causes non-immune jobs to be killed as they are
			listed (see above).

	/IMMUNE:u,u,u	The usernames listed, "u,u,u", will be made
			immune from being killed, regardless of their
			idle time.  Note that OPER is always immune.

	/CYCLE:n	FREE will continue to run every "n" minutes for
			ever, or until the system goes down, whichever
			comes first.

	logfile=	A log of the output from FREE will be appended
			to this file.  If /KILL is specified, FREE will
			always keep a log - the default file being
			FREE.LOG[fpn].

	/LOGSIZE:n	The size of the log will be limited to "n" pages.
			If it grows larger than 110% of this size, pages
			will be removed from the front (oldest).

description:

	FREE is intended to run all the time.  It is typically started
	when the system comes up by way of (SYS)XEXEC.  a typical
	command line in (SYS)XEXEC.CTL would look like:

	  0,OPER,(SYS)FREE,FREE (M33)FREE.LOG=/CYCLE:10/FREE:10/KILL/LOGSIZE:10

	This would start FREE in a job logged in to user OPER.  FREE
	would be run out of (SYS)FREE.SAV, and keep its log in
	(M33)FREE.LOG.  It would run every 10 minutes, guarentee 10
	free job slots, and maintain a log of about 10 pages.

Ok,  New features/tables added seem to work fine now:

  1) New GETTAB table pointers to existing data.
  2) New FETTBL feature test table.
  3) New SET DEFAULT INACTIVITY command, SETUUO function, (OP license)
  4) SET AUTOLOGOUT will now default to the inactivitiy timeout if no
     value is given... zero may still leave flags set... will fix!
  5) Part of #1, STOPCD table pointer in place.  Need to build actual
     data area and setup pointers in COMMON & UUOCON.
  6) Part of #2, we will probably use the left-half bits for TYMCOM-X
     features and the right-half bits for equivalent features that DEC
     has in TOPS-10.
  7) C930 is now X930.

Subject:     EXECUTIVE BRIEFING CENTER PHOTO EVENT



As many of you know, we are remodeling our St. Louis Executive 
Briefing Center in Bldg. 300.  The remodeled area will provide us 
with a facility in which we will be proud to host our customers 
and visitors.

Currently, the entrance to the area has a large display of 
photographs from the Missouri Botanical Garden, which were taken 
by Jack Jennings, Director of Sales in the Diversified Information 
Systems Company.  We think it would be fun to use photographs 
taken by other employees throughout the area.  If you are 
interested in having your work displayed, please submit your 
entries to Al Schikore, Dept. I018, Bldg. 301, Level 2W, Post A5, 
no later than 15 July 1985.  Photographs will be selected for 
display by a panel of distinguished ISG judges.  In order to be 
considered, entries must meet the following guidelines:

     -   All photos must be the original work and property of the
         submitting ISG employees or their families.

     -   Entries should be submitted as prints or slides along 
         with the name, address and title of the submitter as well 
         as a brief description of the subject.  (We will attempt 
         to return all materials submitted, but you should not 
         submit your only copy of a treasured photo or slide.)

If a photo is selected for exhibition, it will be enlarged (if 
appropriate), matted, framed and displayed in the area, with 
credit given to the artist.  As photos are rotated out of the 
exhibition, the artists will receive their photos, as they were 
displayed, for their own personal use.

I want to wish all entrants the best of luck.  I am really looking 
forward to seeing the results of the event.

It's a good idea to make sure it all assembles on each processor after
any major set of changes.  BUT it is a bit of over-kill for every change.
Make sure it works on 930 and all the code works... then try it out on
each CPU.  If you change any MACROs in S, then try it on all, but just
making a code change in non-processor-dependant areas will work on all if
it works on one...  DEFINATELY make sure it works on any that we give to
ANY customer machine!!!!

Subject: FCR.E+4 crashes 

I've taken a preliminary look at all of them.  There is no set pattern
except for the function which they were attempting to execute.

FCR.E+4 is reached when there is either an FCREATE (VCREATE UUO) or
MAPPING (CHANIO FUNCTION .CHMFP) error.  In the crash case, it is clear
that the code first does a CREATE-FILE-PAGE then attempts to map that
same file page into memory.  That MAP is what appears to be failing.

I've patched all the systems which have this crash occurring to capture
the UUO AC before it clears the page number part.  Without the page #
in monitor memory it is difficult to verify that the page already exists

*****************************************************************
 
 
After  a 2 day meeting with the major logistics functions of  the 
three  Field Service organizations,  Microdata,  Computer Systems 
and Support (CSS),  and Tymnet,  an organizational structure  was 
identified.   The  structure utilizes the best talents within the 
organizations and will focus on combining assets to integrate the 
operations and at the same time be transparent to our customers.
 
The results will offer greater capability to improve our  support 
of  the  new  Field  Operations Division and  for  the  McDonnell 
Douglas customer.  We feel confident that our abilities, combined 
with the assets available will help make us successful in support 
of our company's customer service effort.
 
With  quality  in  the main focus and with  the  best  individual 
effort  by  our  employees,  we will make  a  major  contribution 
towards  the  Field Service Company not only meeting it's  goals, 
but  exceeding  them.   Good performance will breed  success  and 
allow opportunity for growth to individuals who contribute  their 
best.
 
The  new  organization  was effective June 17,  1985  and  is  as 
follows.
 
Quality Control - Manager - Larry Keniston
------------------------------------------
 
Larry has been the Quality Control Manager at CSS Agoura for five 
years.    Prior  to  that,  Larry  was  either  in  manufacturing 
supervision  or in quality control with Douglas Manufacturing  or 
North  American  for  about  30  years.    Larry  brings   needed 
experience  to  MDFSC in all areas of quality  control  including 
complete  knowledge  of quality control as specified by the  U.S. 
Government.
 
Larry  will  relocate  to  the Field  Service  Depot  at  Irvine, 
California,  after the Agoura facility is relocated.  This should 
be  some  time in September of 1985.   As manager of our  quality 
control operations,  Larry will be responsible for inspection  of 
repair  and refurb work done in our depots.   Larry will  install 

procedures,  guidelines  and  systems that will  standardize  our 
Quality  Control  operations  at the existing depots in  King  of 
Prussia, Atlanta, Irvine, Fremont, and Chatsworth.
 
Please refer quality problems or questions to Larry.   Larry will 
be  working closely with the Material Support,  Test  Engineering 
and  Depot  Repair functions in our division to  deliver  quality 
spare parts.
 
Test Engineering - Manager - George Turner
------------------------------------------
 
George  has  been  the  Manager of Repair  and  Test  Support  at 
Microdata's  Field Service Depot  in  Irvine,  California,  since 
1979.   Prior to that,  George had a long career with the Navy in 
electronics  and  testing.   George  specializes  in  electronics 
testing  and automatic test engineering (ATE),  his strengths are 
in  the  use of analytical methods to define  problems  and  find 
solutions.
 
Under  George's  direction,  ATE standards and problems  will  be 
developed   and   ATE  hardware  will  be  deployed  to   enhance 
productivity and quality of repair in the repair depots.  Failure 
analysis will be a key responsibility to establish priorities  in 
attacking  failures in hardware serviced by our Field  Operations 
Divison.
 
Material Support - Director - Jerry Bowman
------------------------------------------
 
Jerry has been the Director of Logistics Operations at  Microdata 
since  1982.   Prior  to  that,  Jerry put together 22  years  of 
professional experience in logistics.  Jerry has spent 9 years in 
administration  and  management and 13 years  in  supervision  of 
various  logistics operations.   Jerry was previously employed by 
Tymshare  for  5  plus years and is familiar  with  the  Tymshare 
business and products prior to McDonnell Douglas.   Jerry will be 
responsible for integrating the material support functions of the 
three former organizations and their various  locations.   Please 
refer  any  material supply questions or needs to Jerry.   I  can 
assure you that Jerry will be more than happy to respond  quickly 
in the most professional manner as he has in support of Microdata.  
 
Depot Repair - Director - Virginia Buhr
---------------------------------------
 
Virginia  has  been the Director of Microdata's repair depots  in 
Irvine,  California,  and Atlanta,  Georgia.   Virginia has  been 
employed  by  Microdata  since 1976 and has  been  a  significant 
factor  in  the  high quality and quantity of parts  supplied  in 
support  of  the field operations  activity.   Virginia  will  be 
responsible  for  integrating  the  repair depots  of  the  three 
organizations along with their various locations.   In the  event 
that  McDonnell Douglas ventures into any 3rd Party Depot Repair, 
Virginia  will also support that activity.   I am sure all of  us 

are  looking  forward  to working with Virginia  and  her  proven 
ability to organize and work effectively with  people.   Virginia 
brings  20  plus  years of logistics support  experience  to  our 
division  which  provides a valuable source to draw from for  the 
challenges ahead.
 
Material and Logistics Planning - Manager - Anver Meghji
--------------------------------------------------------
 
Anver  has  been the Manager of Worldwide Parts for Tymnet  Field 
Engineering  and was first employed by Tymshare in  1973.   Anver 
has a successful track record in project management, implementing 
such projects as Dialnet,  Bofanet and Marsplus along with  video 
banking  development.   Anver  resides in the Bay Area  and  will 
remain here for the near term.  The first priority for Anver will 
be  to play the major role for our divison in project  monitoring 
and  system specification for the management systems that will be 
used  for our logistics efforts.   This is a major  effort  since 
none   of   the  three  organizations  have  systems   that   are 
integrateable.  Anver's business background and education will be 
a   great   asset  in  the  management  system  development   and 
implementation.
 
Chatsworth Depot - Manager - Jay Webb
-------------------------------------
 
Jay  Webb  has agreed to manage the depot and inventory  for  the 
Chatsworth,  California operations.   Jay has been involved  with 
management  of  the Chatsworth operation for over 10  years.   We 
intend to keep this operation separated from other operations  at 
this  time  as  it is a 3rd Party Service Depot for  very  mature 
Ampex and CalComp products.   Inventory sales and remanufacturing 
are  the  main focus of business with 50% of sales  to  the  U.S. 
Government  and 50% to the commercial markets.   The sales effort 
will remain with our sales division.   Jay will work closely with 
Sales to meet all delivery dates.  
 
I am sure that all of you,  like myself,  are looking forward  to 
the  integration  of the different organizations and the  various 
synergies.   There are great opportunities ahead for our division 
in  support of the various business units.   We feel we have  the 
ability  and  capacity to keep pace with  the  various  marketing 
efforts and support the Field Service needs of our customer base.  
The  combining of the different organizations make us one of  the 
largest field service organizations in operation.   A major focus 
is now upon us and we welcome the challenge.

Joe, Your F3.SAV and my F3M46.SAV were built from the same sources

LOADER.  The are not the same size.  Delta = 187 words for the savefiles.
I'd say try running F3M46 and if it runs, then try F3 and see if it runs.
If they both run... we need more testing...

In 39's case (the only ones I was aware of, anyway) it really was out of
ports.  It could be a base problem.  Next time it happens, call network
control and ask them to do a NODE snapshot to see how many ports are in
use on the base (according to the supervisor) and then do a RETAKE and
anoter NODE snapshot.  -Bill  (could it be alot of aux circuits?)

Subject: Names of stopcodes. 

It doesn't really matter what names are chosen, but I have been using a
convention where the first 3 letters indicate the module and the last 3 are
from the description.  For instance, all STOPCDs in F3TSER, MAGSER, and FTASER
start with "MTA".  All in LPTSER start with "LPT".  Some in PICON start with
"APR" for conditions detected via APR interrupt, others have "PAG" if it is
a page fault or inconsistancy in the UPT.  Any that I put in SCNSER will use
the prefix "TTY".

For the one that are referenced via STOPCD(,XCT,name), I have been putting
"name::" in front of the full definition just to make it obvious to the code
reader that a global lable is being defined here.

Hi Osman, Dennis and Carl:

We have received only words of praise for the support your
group has been providing for the remaining DEC 20/20 
customers, from the ACS/CNS Branches. Thank you for the
excellent support you've always given to these sensitive
customers.               ------

Our IACS group in VG3 has been left out of the support 
cycle for 20/20 customers since last year. I still have
a few files and manuals re: 20/20 information, and
some equipment descriptions published by DEC. I was
wondering if you or anyone at your location would like
to have these files. Please contact me via Ontyme at
ACS.E/ADAMS or call me at (408) 446-8139 if you'd be
interested, and I'll send them over.

Thank you,

Edie

Subject: LOGINN license and TUMS 

LOGINN version 67-3 (current) which checks for (MAIL)ppn.MAI and
prints [MAIL WAITING] needs RF which the old version didn't.  It
has been unable to check for mail for non-gan-3 users (MAIL is in
GAN 3) for some time since I guess software distribution screwed
up.  LOGINN states correctly the license it needs when it is
assembled.  I talked to Dennis and he will cal the software dis-
tribution people to straighten this out.  In the mean time I have
changed the license on the systems with TUMS.  There is no security
problem since LOGINN reduces its license before running INIT files.

This is for your information, only, no action required.

Subject: Monitor changes 

Joe,
  I'd like you to put together a PCOM command file, whether it be done with
some sort of TECO macro or what... but something that will produce a set of
output files *.SCM or *.DIF (or something unique?) which can then be filed
with the transmittal or the MEM file to show all the changes made to all the
source files.
  I'd like to see an INCREMENTAL differences... such that

    COMMON.MAC <= COMMON.N13 <= COMMON.N12 <= COMMON.N11 <= COMMON.N06
    CORE1.MAC  <= CORE1.N12  <= CORE1.N10
    ONCE.MAC   <= ONCE.N12   <= ONCE.N02

We see for each module, differencs from the .N00 released monitor to present:

    COMMON.DIF <= {{.N00,.N06 + .N06,.N11 + .N11,.N12 + .N12,.N13 + .N13,.MAC}}
    CORE1.DIF  <= {{.N00,.N10 + .N10,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}
    ONCE.DIF   <= {{.N00,.N02 + .N02,.N12 + .N12,.MAC}}

Maybe produce a single file... (N to P)
    P034NP.DIF <= {{ COMMON.DIF + CORE1.DIF + ONCE.DIF + ... }}

At least think about it.  Because we need some sort of control over the
changes after they've been done, as a review to insure thaat we have not
added any problems by mis-typing anything.

SUBJECT:  ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------      
 
 
A number of changes to payroll input and personnel record keeping 
will be necessitated by the implementation of the ISG Benefit 
Plans on September 30, l985.  Some of these changes are:
 
   .  New payroll attendance reporting system utilizing new
      format of absence reporting for all employees.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled shift.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' schedule work
      week.
 
   .  Reporting to Human Resources employees' scheduled hours.
      Note:  ISG full benefit eligibility is based on full time
      status (40 hrs/week).  Partial benefit eligibility is based 
      on part-time scheduled to work 20 - but less than
      40 hrs/wk.  Employees scheduled to work less than
      20 hrs/week are not eligible.
 
   .  Check stub will indicate the balance of vacation days
      remaining.
 
   .  There will be no borrowed vacation days under the ISG
      Benefit Plan.
 
Due to the above changes during the week of September 23, all 
managers will need to submit the following information for each 
of their employees via a prompt program:
 
  1)  Scheduled Shift
 
  2)  Scheduled Work Week
 
  3)  Scheduled Hours Per Week
 
  4)  Number of Vacation Days earned in 1985 which have been
      taken up to 09/30/85.

1.  Distribution of the new ISG Benefits summary plan 
    descriptions is scheduled for Saturday, July 27, 1985.  As 
    managers you will receive the first packets.  This advance 
    copy will allow you to review the material prior to the 
    general employee mailing.

2.  Original plans called for you to receive your packets one 
    week prior to the mass distribution.  Due to printing delays 
    and the need to hold to the implementation date of 
    September 30, 1985, there will only be a two day difference 
    between packets mailed to management and those mailed to the 
    balance of employees.

3.  Enrollment meetings are scheduled at major business unit 
    locations throughout August.  A schedule of meeting dates 
    and sites is included with the packet.  Your support of 
    these enrollment sessions is critical to the success of the 
    program.

4.  Specific questions about the enrollment procedure or 
    benefits booklets can be referred to Karen Welch 
    (714) 250-1000 or Joe Hoffman (314) 232-8488.

          TYMNET TO MARKET TELENTRY DOCUMENT DELIVERY SERVICE


     SAN JOSE, Calif., July 23, 1985 -- Tymnet, McDonnell Douglas

Network Systems Company, announced it has entered into an

agreement with Telentry Systems, Inc. to market the Telentry (tm)

Document Delivery Service.  As part of the agreement, Tymnet also

will provide network access for the service.

     Telentry Systems, Inc., offers rapid and inexpensive document

delivery between different word processors and personal

computers, in a fully translated, electronically editable and

retransmittable form.  The service delivers memos, reports,

                                                                Page  2

proposals, contracts and other text documents within and between

companies, using the companies' existing word processors and

personal computer word processing software.

     According to Thomas Payne, president of Telentry Systems,

Inc., "We're very pleased to have entered into this relationship

with Tymnet.  It gives us the benefit of Tymnet's extensive

marketing coverage and communications network, and will be a

cornerstone of our objective to establish our worldwide document

delivery service."  Payne added that "Tymnet was extremely

thorough in its evaluation of our service, and as a result, the

company has a solid understanding of how it will meet the needs of

its customers."

    Users of the Telentry Service connect to the TYMNET(R) public

packet data communications network by means of a small unit called

the dataDRIVER(tm) device that is attached  to a word

processor or personal computer.  The user can choose to send a document

via one-hour service or overnight, to single or multiple

recipients.  A document can be sent overnight as late a 9 p.m.

(user's time zone), and will be received the next morning by 7 a.m.

(recipient's time zone).  Users do not have to coordinate document

transmission, and a document can be received even if a workstation is in

use, or is not powered-up.

     The Telentry Service is extremely easy to use, and generally

requires less than 15 minutes of operator training.  The sender

does not have to know the type of equipment or software used by

the recipient, and can automatically be notified as soon as a

document has reached its destination.  The service is designed to

send information error-free, by providing end-to-end electronic

error detection and correction.

                                                                Page  3

     "The Telentry Service offers many improvements over current

means of electronic document delivery," said Clint DeGabrielle,

Tymnet vice president of marketing and field operations.

"We're confident it will meet many of the document delivery needs

of our customers that other alternatives have not yet addressed."

     Tymnet operates the TYMNET public packet data communications

network, providing local access from more than 540 locations in

the United States and from some 65 countries.  The company has

installed more independent networks than any other supplier,

including half of all domestic networks designed last year.

     Telentry Systems, Inc., was founded in 1982 and has

installation and service capabilities in all 50 states.

SUBJECT>   ORDERING SPARE PARTS


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


In recent months there has been a steady decline in the number
of "P-2" (Initial Spares) and "P-3" (Replenishment) orders coming
from the field.  Accompanying this has been a rather substantial
increase in the number of "P-1" (Emergency, Machine Down) orders,
some of which have been for expendables.  Ordering parts P-1 is
very costly and inefficient.  It should be reserved for real
emergencies.  It has come to our attention that the current 
feeling is that ordering parts P-1 is the only way to obtain
them in a timely manner.  This is not the case.  Here are some
guidelines to insure that your spares orders are filled effectively.

1.  Plan Ahead:  Inventory levels, especially for expendables,
should be routinely monitored by those responsible for each respective
site or district.  You should plan on an 8 - 12 week turnaround on
routine orders from the date we receive them.  Some items may take
longer because of vendor lead times, so feel free to contact us
about any items in question.  Regularly scheduled P.M.'s should
be figured into this process.

2.  Paperwork:  Another way to insure prompt spares replenishment
is to complete all necessary paperwork.  If you have questions, feel
free to contact us prior to submitting the order.  On P-2 orders,
be sure to attach an Initial Spares Cover Letter.  All MOF's should
be accompanied by travelers.  Always include model numbers and the
manufacturer, along with your name, phone, etc. so that we may contact 
you in case we are unclear about what is needed.

We have taken steps to streamline the parts ordering process.  Fewer
signatures are needed and approval of legitimate orders is much
easier to obtain.  We encourage and appreciate any suggestions from
the field.  We are confident that we can provide you with the parts
                                                                Page  2

support you desire, and together we will continue to grow and prosper.

Subject: DELUFD 

I wrote a program called DELUFD to delete all UFDs that had zero files in
them.  Due to a bug, it deleted OSB.  I am having the COOP restore all
the directores that were deleted that had files in them (I have a SZRPT
from before and after).

Anyway, I am going to change the program so that it deletes only one UFD
at a time.  The main reason for the existance of a program such as this is
to clean up the MFD on system 95.

Deleted some files in (UN1) and ?????F.REL in (M33) to get disk space.
Had to store files on 930 temporarily, since neither 95 or 930 is capable of
doing a tape-to-tape copy.  There will be a lot of disk space when I delete
the files in (703-TOPS10), (703-DECNET), (703-ANF10), (703-SMFILE), (703-TOOLS).

You do know that I did generate 36,55 and 70... and did the telecopy?
So, I presume you just re-made "C"70 and re-telecopied it... right?
And then send all the mail.
  - Correct me, if you had to do more (generating them)...
  (yes, and I realize you put them into NEWMON, -I didn't!- )

In an attempt to clean up and organize things... M33 is being *split* into
two separate directories.  The monitor and things like MONED will remain
in directory (m33).. {includes MDDT,SYMAUX,???DDT,etc.}
  Things which are monitor utilities such as LOGINN,LOGOUT,TAKEIT,etc. are
all moved to directory (OSU).  This is an evolutionary project and will
take a little time for the dust to settle... so, please be patient...

  **** IF YOU HAVE (M33) IN YOU "DO-LIST", PLEASE BEWARE ****
	*** you might just add OSU to your list? ***
	*** This affects things with special-command-mode!!! ***

Subject: KL-10 Fixed for JSP 

After some searching... I found the problems with KL halted, JSP!
Joe modified the sources to cover this and rebuilt the monitors
with CPUS.CTL.  I ran MONED1 to update things to /N24 ...

I updated both the running monitors and (SYS)NEWMON on 35, 36, 39 & 55
to reflect the changes [/N23-1] of PUSHJ P,SAVE4 ==> JSP T4,SAVE4 at
REDSBC+1 and a POPJ P, at CVPPC both in ERRCON.

The test, using S$INFO,,CPOPJ1 did not seem to work completely since it
still caused the system to go to boots.  CUPC OPS is inter-office mailing
the CTY output to me.

Subject: STOPCDs don't continue if the base gets impatient. 

We got the CTY output from C36 from when Carl was testing INFO stopcodes
on the KL.  With the latest patch, the stopcode is output correctly, and
the system continues, but at the next clock tick it notices that nonzero
has been deposited in 30, and reloads the monitor.  In the first test,
30 contained 000404,,003337 and in the second test it contains 001070,,002177.

It appears that the base got upset that KEY620 was not being updated while
the stopcode information was being output.

The long-term solution is to tell the new base code that the PDP-10 is
experiencing a stopcode, and that it should not expect KEY620 to be updated
for 90 seconds.  A short-term hack would be to modify the routine that
outputs to the CTY and have it update KEY620 while waiting to send the
next character.

Subject: INFO stopcodes 

Hmmmm.  Seems we should put in the code that we discussed:
  If it is NOT a stopcode which is going to take the system down... this
includes JOB,INFO and EVENT stopcodes ...then we setup code which duplicates
the ITMINT code and we make sure that the key continues to be refreshed.
This means "possibly" saving the contents of the key...and restoring it,
but I think we don't need to do that.

Subject: Future dates! 

Osman got a complaint from MARCONI about a file in his directory which
had a date sometime in the future.  It was one of the MAGNRN.SHR files
probably copied or restored from tape into (MARCONIT).  Osman wanted
to know if we could explain how the date got set to the future...

Well,  the ENTER & CHANIO .CHENT calls both check the date value and
set it to today's date [THSDAT] if it is in the future.

But,  both RENAME (probably .CHREN too) and UPDATE-ENTER don't seem
to care at all.  We were able to set the date to any date we please
past or present WITHOUT ANY LICENSE.

This isn't really a problem, but unless someone knows of a good reason
why any file UUO can set the date/time field of a file to the future,
I vote that we should put the appropriate checks in the appropriate
places and stop this fiction before anyone else complains.

Mr. O's:

Thanks for your help on the backup.  It has come to my attention that I
should learn more on what to do if problems occur during the backup.  If
you have the time, I will like to spend some time and go over the last two
allfiles backup printouts with you.  I also like to ask you some questions on 
the backup procedures, they are listed as follows:

1.  After the tape got hung and the tape has been rewinded, is it possibile
    to tell TITO to find the tape position at where it got hung and then 
    perform the STO ALL W STARTING command ?

2.  What causes TITO to stop running the backup?  Is it the bad spot on the
    magnetic tapes that causes the problem?  It seens to me that less
    problems occur when the clean tapes were used on the backup, maybe it
    is a good idea to keep extra clean tapes on hands before the next allfiles
    backup perform.



  				Thanks, Colman

Subject: 14-bit node numbers 

Yes, I said 14-bit node numbers.  TYMNET NTD is looking at expanding the
current 12-bit numbers since they are currently at '7200+ and will soon
overflow the 12-bit field.

Gazel Tan has asked me to help identify potential software problems on
the PDP-10s if they were to go to 14-bit node numbers.  In the monitor,
the problem is minimal, we have a few extra bits and could easily make
room for up to 16-bit fields.

Various utility programs would falter badly, not to mention SPOOL, which
has relied on 11-bit node numbers and is already needing a fix.

I'd like you to examine the PDP-10 utilities and possibly applications
which do anything with node numbers and make a list: programs which key
off the node (eg. SPOOL,MAGNUM) and programs which simply report what is
read (eg. SYSTAT).

Once we have the list, we can determine what impact changing the node
numbers to 14-bits will have on our environment.

Please see MARKER for details, but I hope to have fixed the bug that
we've found in /N10 with the new base.  Dave Smith has put in the fix
to the base so that it won't re-use a port until it gets a reflected
zapper from us, but there were 3 (not 1) conditions where we may have
gotten a port for use, and it was already zapped.
  1) a second zap on the same port
  2) a login on a port awaiting a zap
  3) an aux circuit reply on a port awaiting a zap.

We're running my new code on 930.  I copied C12 to cupertino and tried
to load it, but the base went out to lunch again. Sigh.  We will have
to wait till morning ...

PS:  I guess I didn't say anything, but it is no longer system 5.  SRA

Subject: 12-bit node numbers 

Sigh... SYSTAT only reads up to node 3000!   That's why we see *6657* in
the systat listings.  FYI there are two places in SYSTAT that do a
  MOVEI M,3000   instruction then later CAMGE M,xxxxx to check the node
number.  I binary-patched (SYS:930)SYSTAT.SHR to  MOVEI M,7777  to test
it and "le voila" it now prints node names higher than 3000!

Oh, and since TYMNET may or may not have updated things... I wrote a
little program, DEFNOD which is in (TYMNET) that reads NODES.MAP and
does nice things to it.

It's basically DEFSYS/DEFPRI/DEFNOD hacked to work on the right file.
DEFSYS looks at (SYS)PERP.SYS,  DEFPRI looks at (SPOOL)NODPRI and now
DEFNOD looks at (TYMNET)NODES.MAP....

sigh... gee.. it's easy to write/modify programs which read binary files
and print out the entries, and modifies them... real easy... sigh...

Anyway... nodes should type out on 930 a little more sensibly now...
However, don't bother trying to transmit SYSTAT or anything like that
until we get the new 14-bit node standard implemented....

I've talked to Dave Smith, and since he was asked to co-ordinate with
me how to do the new standard, and the base gets it as a 16-bit word,
chances are that we will go to 2 8-bit bytes as I proposed the other
day.   (however, NOTHING will be done until the new bases are completely
deployed in the network and the varians are all gone!!!)

When the monitor changes to 16-bit node numbers, there should be a new bit in
the feature-test GETTAB table.  If the bit is off (or the GETTAB fails), then
LDBLOG has 12 bit numbers.  If the bit is on, then 16-bit numbers are in use.
I mention this now so that the programs can be modified before the change.

The power flickered many times in Fremont north of Mowry several times last
night.  Each time the power came back on, the model 912 modem I have at home
went into autoanswer - it took the phone "off the hook".  This is usually not
too bad, execpt that it did not hang up after 30 seconds like it was supposed
to.  As a result, the line was kept busy and PAC BELL sent nasty warning tones
on the line.  The model 912 is the only modem I have seen to be untrustworthy,
and should be unplugged when the power is unsteady.

If you don't use autoanswer on your 912, you can disable it with one of
the switches inside and that should eliminate the problem.  You should also
have it strapped to disconnect on false data-terminal-ready which it would
not normally get unless its in use.  -Bill

[you're right, the 912's only redeeming quality is the attribute of being

Subject: TYMSHARE's EDDT won't run on a KL with the MCA-25 upgrade. 

Any program that attempts to determine whether it is running on a KL versus
a KS by looking at the APRID (CPU serial number) won't work on KLs that have
the MCA-25 cache/pager upgrade.  For instance, EDDT does:

	APRID 17
	TRNE  17,10000
	JRST  KS

On the KL, bit 23 is one of the hardware options, it is set if the MCA-25
upgrade is installed.

The only reliable way to distinguish the two processors is to use the example
in the System Reference manual.  That is:

	MOVEI	2,777777	;High-order part of a 72-bit number
	SETZB	3,5		;Clear byte pointer, string is 0 bytes long
	MOVEI	4,1		;Set double length binary result
	EXTEND	1,[CVTBDO]	;Attempt to convert binary to decimal string
	TLNN	4,200000	;This bit is set by a deliberate bug in KL
	JRST	KS		;KS and later DEC processors do not set 200000

have the new initia (not available for 2020s at the moment).  However, I
do not think that this is their problem.

If we can check the BASE node number to see if they are running TYMNET-I
or TYMNET-II code, we may have an answer... or maybe not...

Joe, do you know what software you had to change on system 95 to get it
to do everything correctly?

Subject: USRFLT+3 really means "PC out of bounds", page 0 not in null job. 

If you do "START 147" and the processor was running the null job and you do
not reset the CPU first, the system will die at USRFLT+3=PFLLDC since the
processor is restarted in user mode, with the PC pointing to user page 0, and
the null job does not have the accessabile bit set for page zero.  It is
possible that all USRFLT+3 stopcodes occured as a result of the operator
trying to get to BOOTS by restarting at 147.  I say this because it occurs
fairly reliably on the KS, and for some of the dumps on D31, CRSHID reported
that the crash code was executed twice.  After P is out, we need to move the
test for page fault in the null job to a different location, earlier in the
code.  

The 147 restart only works if you reset the CPU so that it is in EXEC mode.
For the F3 and KI, both STOP and RESET must be toggled.  For the KS, the
command "KS10>SM" must be given to restart the microcode in EXEC mode.
(I'm not sure what is needed for the KL.)

Subject: 930 backups 


Since we are now without a COOP student to do the backups on system
930 we must have an alternative mechanism. After discussing with each
of you some suggested ways of handling the backups I am proposing
the following procedure in the interests of simplicity and reliability.
Each person in the list will have one day of the week assigned to
do incremental backups- this assignment will last "forever" and should
be easy to rememeber.  The monthly ALL FILES backup will rotate
across all memeb
across all members.

The winning assignments are:

Monday - Osman
Tuesday - Dan
Wednesday - Carl
Thursday - Joe
Friday - Bill

Monthly ALL FILES:

September - Dennis
October - Bill
November - Joe
December - Dan
January - Carl
February - Osman

See Osman if you have any questions about the procedure to follow.
Please do the incrementals at a regular time each day, say between
4 p.m. and 6 p.m.

If there are any problems with the assignments see me and we will
consider adjustments

Subject: EDDT vs MCA-25 

I fixed the version of EDDT in M33 to work with all KL-10s.  The monitor
built from OSP will work with the MCA-25, as long as you don't try to use EDDT.

To repeat: It is OK to use the CPU serial number to distinguish the KS from the
KL provided that you get the CPU serial number via GETTAB.  It is not OK to
use APRID to distinguish the two processors because APRID returns a bunch of
bits in addition to the CPU serial number.  For programs that run in EXEC mode
on all CPUs (such as EDDT), the only distinguishing feature is that the KL
returns different data on EXTEND[CVTBDO].

Subject: EDDT & P034/P 

The "jist" of the changes to EDDT are that P034/P, the monitor will run
on all processors, including processors with an MCA-25.  However, to use
EDDT on those systems with an MCA-25 you need to run the next version
of the monitor.
-Right?

Hi Bill..

Please let me know where is the source file for XEXEC and HELP file
if there is any. I will get together with Dennis and transmitt it.
According to Dennis, it will take 3 to 4 weeks to transmitt to all
the systems.

P.S Hamburger bet is still on if you still interested.
Osman..

The files are on (WRS:39).  I must emphasize that the file formats for
XEXEC.CTL are different than the previous version.  I suggest transmitting
an empty XEXEC.CTL file and then manually changing it on those systems
which should have something running (e.g. TUMS, FREE).  The documentation
is in the first page of the source.  Below is a session that'll help with
the transmittal.  -Bill

To: THS.GUVEN@Ontyme.Tymnet 
Message-id: E91910@Ontyme.Tymnet 
Subject: "ANNOUNCEMENT The Field Service"... 

                    ***** ANNOUNCEMENT *****
 
 
The Field Service Company now has its very own OnTyme account 
called EMSFSC.  Valid users on TCMS and THS now have usernames
on the FSC account.
 
The new FSC usernames all follow the standard format,
     eg:  FSC.C/REYES   acctname.first initial/last name
 
There is a ** DIRECT.FSC file available in the new account and
the public file will be updated shortly.  The TCMS and THS
account supervisors have been asked to place this directory
in their shared files.  This file contains over 300 names.
 
There are a few things that each of you must do to complete the
transition to the new account.
 
     1.   Log into your current username.
 
     2.   Read any messages you may have on your IN list.
 
     3.   Check your OUT list - :OUT  (If you have any messages
          you want to save, follow the procedure below titled
          "Saving")
          
     4.   Cancel all the messages on your OUT list - :CAN message#
          
     5.   Check your OUT OLD list - :OUT O - and cancel all the
          messages on it. - :CAN O message#
 
     6.   If applicable, check your private files - :LIST *  
          (If you have any files you want to save, follow the
          procedure below titled "Saving") 
           
     7.   If applicable, clear your private files - 
          :CLE * filename
 
After you complete this procedure, log into your new account 
(EMSFSC) and username.  Your key is CHANGE IT.  The first thing
you should do is change your key.  Your key must be at least 8
characters long and contain a non-alpha character, eg: GOOD2KNOW.
To change your key, type :KEY, press return and follow all of the
prompts.
 
An OnTyme has been sent to all internal accounts regarding this 
change.  If there is someone who sends you mail regularly, you
might want to let them know that your account has changed.
 
You have until September 29 to complete this procedure.  You will
receive messages on your old accounts until that time.  Do not
log into your old account after that date.  We will be deleting
the accounts.
 
If you have any questions or problems with this procedure, please
contact:
 
     Carmen Reyes   (408) 446-6940      FSC.SUP
 
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
 
 
 
 
     ********************    SAVING     *********************
 
Cancelling a message on your OUT list will also cancel it from
the recipients IN list.  Clearing a file will permanently erase
it.  If you have outgoing messages or private files that you want 
to save, issue a separate GET command for each one and SEND each
one separately to your new username.
 
     For example:   :GET message# or :GET * filename
            then:   :SEND FSC.X/XXXXX  (X.XXXXX = your username)
 
After you send them all, log out of your old account and log
into your FSC username.  Issue a READ ALL command.  Do a GET
command for each one and either SEND the message again or FILE *
your information.
 
After finishing this procedure, get out of FSC and back into your
old account and start from instruction #2 in the sequence above.

Subject: ? Deletion ? 

Oh well...   I thought that that might get your attention... give me a
call (work or home) to talk about this in more detail.

We've been working on this PERP-replacement project for a little while
and it seems that we have some duplication of effort...

  PERP  (runs on a 940) controls up to 10 jobs at a time and puts the
        logfile back out on the user's directory on the system it was
        run on.  Sends mail from PERPOPER about completion.  Will put
        a job in it's queue and reschedule it for another run date if
        the job is "periodic", otherwise it is deleted when completed

  PAM   (runs under (PJ) on most systems) controls up to 10 jobs and
        runs them as high-segments from a single job with periods that
        range from 15 minutes to 150 minutes.

  XEXEC (runs on some PDP-10s) schedules single line commands to run a
        particular program or a PCOM command file at periodic intervals
        of one or more hours.  The period may be offset by "n" hours as
        well, so that jobs do not all run at midnight.

  INITIA (runs on PDP-10s at startup) schedules a series of jobs which
        must be run in sequence (DSKCLN first) in order to bring the
        system up for general timesharing service.  Other jobs include
        CHKPNT, COPYCR, XEXEC (mentioned above), and KMCLOD.

  PCOM  (runs on all our PDP-10s) reads a command file and interprets
        the commands a la PERP by creating another frame and typing the
        commands to it.  If run in DETACH mode, it creates an extra
        detached frame to control the processing frame.

Well....
  As you can see there are a lot of similar programs lying in wait to do
the same kind of things.  PERP works in days, PAM in minutes, XEXEC in
hours (and at startup), INITIA at startup and PCOM once per invocation.

  I doubt that all things can be simplified into 1 (ONE) program, but
there seems to be a lot that can be eliminated with a perp-replacement
that understands date-time expressions down to the minute level.  Please
excuse the length of this message, but I will continue with a description
of what we intend to do in the near future:

1)  System startup.
    Force a .DSKCLN command on TTY0 to run DSKCLN
    Force a .INITIA command on TTY? (0 or 1) to run INITIA

2)  INITIA starts what it must ( CHKPNT, XEXEC ) or maybe just XEXEC
    and disappears altogether.  If run LOGGED-IN it runs your init file.

3)  XEXEC is the perp-replacement program/scheduler that I'm nearing the
    preliminarly completion on... description later...
    XEXEC starts up the jobs scheduled to run at system-startup:
          CHKPNT, COPYCR, KMCLOD, PAM (?), FREE, ....
    XEXEC hangs around and runs jobs which need to be run periodically:
          (PJ)TRUCTL, other PJ jobs, (MAIL)MAILER, other MAIL functions,
          anything else that any user may have put into the queue.

4)  CHKPNT is made responsible for un-shutting the system and saying:
    "initialization completed" since INITIA only chews up resources looking
    to see if CHKPNT got the date and time yet.  Since CHKPNT is already
    responsible for shutting the system if accounting dies, why not?

The system is now up, open, and operational... PERP is >dead< / >replaced<
(ding dong the [sic] PERP is dead, the PERP is dead, the PERP is dead, ...)


My new XEXEC, name chosen since no changes need be made to INITIA to make
it work, would replace your XEXEC program and provide the same services
via a more accessible queue.  It is basically a PCOM derivative that does
what PCOM used to do for up to "n" jobs at a time, instead of just one!

I've got it working now such that it reads a specially formatted queue-file
which is manipulated by a co-operating program called SUBMIT which replaces
the PDP-10 PERP/DEFER programs.  My current version makes an ordered list
in memory and then runs the jobs one at a time.  By the end of this week, I
hope to have all the bugs shaken out and have it run the jobs one by one at
their scheduled time (or as close as possible thereafter).  By the end of
next week, I hope to have a preliminary version which runs "n" jobs at a
time (as necessary) presuming I don't run out of channels for reading the
input files.

We should discuss the security aspect, license passing, etc pretty soon
before I cast it in concrete...  how about lunch sometime this week???

Call me at home (408) 945-4321, or after 1;pm at the office 116-2515 or
(415)794-2515 direct.   Talk to you then.  This message is already MUCH
MUCH too long.

 . . . . . . . . . . . . ACS SEMINAR NEWS . . . . . . . . . . . . .
 
The ACS Seminar is proving to be an effective way to guarantee ACS
leads.  St. Louis Diversified Sales representatives put together an
extensive prospect list with the assistance of ISM, mailed 300
invitations, did phone follow up on the majority of prospects,
confirmed 38 attendees, and identified seven solid leads, two of which
could close and bill by year-end.
 
"The credit really goes to Hank Spencer and his fellow sales reps,"
says Nancy Browning.
 
According to Hank, representatives from 18 different St. Louis
companies attended the seminar.  "The seminar solidified relationships
with two current prospects, both of which will be proceeding with
pilot programs."  Five other opportunities were "uncovered."
 
Hank thanks the "ACS organization, and especially St. Louis consultant
Carol Burkett and Houston consultant D'Juanna Beer, who did an
outstanding job in their presentations and demonstrations of ACS
products."
 
San Francisco just completed its seminar with similar results.
 
Says Nancy, "If you commit yourself and follow up, you'll get a
handsome payoff."  At press time, the schedule for future seminars is

 . . . . . . . . . . NEWS FROM ACS FEDERAL PROGRAMS . . . . . . . . . .
 
ACS Federal Programs expanded OnTyme and installed a local area
network (LAN) communications interface for the Army Corps of
Engineers.  "The number of Army Corps of Engineers staff using OnTyme
will increase from 2,000 to 10,000 in the next two months as a result
of a new contract," reports Russ Service, Manager of ACS Federal
Programs.
 
The Federal Programs organization markets ACS systems to the U. S.
Government here and abroad, and provides a 22-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week
hotline service to federal users.  In addition, the organization
provides pre- and post-sales technical support to commercial ACS
accounts in the Washington, DC area.
 
OnTyme training is one of the organization's strengths.  Using their
own hands-on training program, the Federal Programs staff has trained
1200 federal users of OnTyme worldwide.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 4
 
Federal Programs also provides ongoing support for Army Corps of
Engineers applications installed on the Tymcomm 370.  These
applications are accessed by users in the U. S., Europe, Korea, Japan,
Philippines, Panama, and other international locations.
 
Currently Russ's organization is installing micro engines at Army
Corps of Engineers sites in Washington, DC and Germany to interface
LANs with TYMNET.
 
If you have questions about federal contract procedures or want to
exchange information about LAN communications interfaces, contact Russ
Service at ACS.GOVMAIL.
 
 
 . . . . SEPTEMBER PROFILE:  MARKETING SERVICES, PART II . . . . .
 
ACS Marketing Services consists of five units managed by Shirley
Macemon.  These units are responsible for:
 
* Product documentation (user's guides, reference manuals, and
  primers) and marketing support materials (brochures, data sheets,
  and various other sales aids)
* Sales and training materials
* Public relations and advertising
* Building administration in VG-3
 
Last month's Newsflash profiled Marketing Publications, Production
Services, and Marketing Promotions.  This month, we focus on Training
Services, Building Administration, and Course Development.  These
three units are responsible for
 
* sales and professional development training and course development
* building administration in ACS headquarters
 
TRAINING SERVICES . . . .
 
At first, Training Services might sound quite a bit like Course
Development -- until you look at the primary purposes of the two.
Course Development develops; Training Services administers.  Carlota
Santa Cruz, Manager of Training Services, sees the function of the
department more as the developer of a career training path rather than
particular technical courses.  Training Services programs include
 
- ACS Product School
- AC Exchange Week
- Presentation Skills
- Selling ACS Workshop
 
The courses that happen to lie along this path can come from a variety
of sources - Deltak, Xerox, internal development, or other sources.
 
To develop career training paths, Carlota evaluates all the available
courses and arranges them into a logical sequence.  When holes appear
in this sequence either she or Course Developer Sarah Chamlee Kinkel
develop the needed material.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                PAGE 5
 
Valerie Minder, Training Support Specialist, has just begun to
facilitate the FOCUS Data Base Management class.  Additionally, she
checks for proper registration forms and tracks each student along the
proper training paths.
 
Training Services usually doesn't deal with technological concepts.
Training Services emphasizes the "how to sell" aspect of education;
for example, the "How to Sell ACS Products" Seminar deals primarily
with the consultative sale rather than the product sale.
 
The future should see more regional training schedules, including
workshops, facilitated by Carlota and Valerie or by ACS employees
trained in course facilitation by Carlota and Valerie.  For the
present, the training schedule is available on *** ACS.TRAININGSCHED.
Descriptions of the available courses are referenced from that file.
 
COURSE DEVELOPMENT . . . .
 
Course Development, in the words of Course Developer Sarah Chamlee
Kinkel, is responsible for developing courses not already covered by
Training Services or other packaged sources.
 
Course Development projects come from various sources:  ACS
consultants, product managers, or the training group itself.  Two
current projects originated with Terry Fujimoto and Shirley Macemon -
a Data Communications course called Bisynchronous Connections to the
Network, section one of four that will be delivered under the title
ACS Technologies Solutions Training.
 
Sarah manages the development projects from inception to completion.
This includes developing objectives, mustering resources to provide
technical input, writing handout and support materials, training
initial facilitators, and distributing packaged materials.
 
BUILDING ADMINISTRATION . . . .
 
A pleasant environment to do your work in is mandatory if you expect
to do good work.  Lighting has to be adequate, heating/air
conditioning has to work properly, telephones have to ring when
they're supposed to, and hardwires need to connect to the correct
equipment.  Even the colors need to soothe.  All of these working
condition concerns are in the care of Diane Gordon.
 
Her position as Building Administrator put her in the critical role of
supporting ACS while it supports you:  with security services,
maintenance, telecommunications, space planning, and construction.
Primarily, in her words, her job is to make sure ACS "gets its needed
services easily and quickly."

1.  MDC Standards, Ref (a), provides a list of preferred 
    hardware and software standards for office automation.  For 
    ISG use, we are continuing with only the IBM Personal 
    Computer and IBM Personal Computer XT devices for automated 
    office systems.  Encl (1) provides the current standard 
    configurations for these systems.

2.  IBM Displaywriter has been removed from the standard.  The 
    IBM PC and IBM PC/XT with MultiMate are the standard systems 
    for word processing.  User Support Centers will provide 
    support for all installed Wang and Displaywriter systems, 
    but expansion of these systems, which require procurement of 
    hardware or software, is not authorized.

3.  Configurations in Encl (1) were modified to add Lotus 1-2-3 
    productivity aids, high speed hard disk backup capability 
    and graphics software.

4.  The User Support Centers are available to provide

SUBJECT>   NEW PROCEDURES - CHANGES TO HRD ONTYME FILES


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Due to the Benefit Conversion and the new Payroll Attendance 
System, Human Resources has found it necessary to make some
changes to the *** HRD exec files on Ontyme.  The ONTYME 
programs will be revised effective September 30. All prior formats
after that date cannot be accepted, due to these changes.
 
 *  NEW HIRES, REHIRES AND CHANGES FROM TEMP TO PERM
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.NEWEMPLOYEE
 
We have added scheduled shift, hours and work week.  These items must be
entered for all employees. For part time employees also note that 
weekly/annual base pay is to be calculated on a 40 hour work week.  
All appropriate paperwork must continue to be sent to Human Resources and
your Personnel Coordinator if applicable.
 
Assigned shift times are as follows:
     
 1st Shift:  If start time is between  4:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon
 2nd Shift:  If start time is between 12:00 noon and  8:00 p.m.
 3rd Shift:  If start time is between  8:00 p.m. and  4:00 a.m.
 
 *  TERMINATIONS
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.TERMINATION
                                                                Page  2

 
Since vacation time will be tracked on PPS II we have deleted accrued
and carryover vacation from this exec.
 
 
 *  JOB STATUS AND PERSONAL STATUS CHANGES
 
Use:  EXEC *** HRD.CHANGES
 
This  exec has been added to,  due to the benefit  changes.   Use 
this exec to report and change to scheduled shift, scheduled work
week (days off), or scheduled work hours.  A memo from Dan Tosh
dated  Aug  15 is attached,  that clearly defines  these  fields. 
  
Leaves of abscences will also be reported on this exec, for all
absences  more than 5 consecutive days,  employees must be placed 
on leave.  All leaves must include the type of leave and the
projected date of return.
 
If you have any questions or problems you may contact me at
408/446-7756 or via ONTYME at HRD.PERSONNEL 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE: THESE CHANGES WILL BE SEEN ON THESE FILES MONDAY,
             SEPTEMBER 30.

SUBJECT>   ISG BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
1. This memo is a follow-up to the July 22 memo from Joe Walton, in
   which several ISG Benefit topics were introduced.
 
   * Scheduled Shift
     The PPSII (Payroll Personnel System) will require assigned shift
     for all employees in order to insure correct payment of shift    
     premium. The data collection system mentioned in the first memo
     will collect the assigned shift of all ISG Tymshare employees as
                                                                Page  3

     of 09/30/85.  This will be done from 09/24 thru 09/27.
 
     After the benefit conversion (09/30/85) changes to assigned shift
     for more than 5 consecutive days must be reported to Cupertino
     Human Resources no later than the week in which the employee 
     changes shift, in order to assure accurate attendance processing.   
     Changes to assigned shift of less than 5 consecutive work days do 
     not require a change to the personnel system. 
 
  
   * Scheduled Work Week
     For proper attendance and absence reporting, a correct record of
     an employee's work week (scheduled days off) will be carried in the 
     PPSII system.  The general data collection (09/24 thru 09/27) will
     supply PPSII with the correct work week for each  employee as of 
     09/30/85. Thereafter changes to this assigned work week will need
     to be reported to Cupertino HR for update.
 
 
   * Scheduled Working Hours
     For Part Time employees, an accurate record of work schedule will 
     be critical. Benefit eligibility will be determined based on
     scheduled hours per week.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
DUE TO SOME CONFUSION LATELY ABOUT THE PROCEDURES WE FOLLOW AT
THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER REGARDING CORPORATE ARCHIVES, I AM 
SENDING THE ONTYME TO CARIFY THE SITUATION.
 
1.  ANY ARCHIVE SENT TO THE ZANKER ROAD DISTRIBUTION CENTER FOR 
    STORAGE SHOULD BE IN STANDARD ARCHIVE BOXES, AND SHOULD
    BE MARKED CLEARLY ON THE FRONT PANEL WITH ALL THE NECESSARY
    INFORMATION:
 
    A.  DEPARTMENT WHO IS STORING ARCHIVE
    B.  CONTENTS OF ARCHIVE
    C.  DATE SENT OVER
    D.  DESTRUCTION DATE
 
2.  WE WILL THEN STORE THE ARCHIVE IN ANY AVAILABLE SPACE THAT WE
    HAVE WITHIN THE TWO DESIGNATED PALLET ROWS.
 
3.  IF YOU REQUIRE A CERTAIN ARCHIVE TO BE SENT TO YOU PLEASE CALL
    STEPHANIE AT 942-5330 AND GIVE HER ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION.
    SHE WILL THEN RELAY THIS INFORMATION TO OUR ARCHIVE CLERK,
    JOHN HEZLITT, WHO WILL SEARCH FOR THE ARCHIVE YOU NEED.
 
4.  STEPHANIE WILL CALL YOU BACK WITHIN 24 HOURS TO NOTIFY YOU OF
    EITHER 1) WHEN & HOW THE ARCHIVE WAS SHIPPED TO YOU OR 2) OF
    OUR INABILITY TO FIND THE SPECIFIED ARCHIVE.
 
5.  IF WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE REQUIRED ARCHIVE, YOU WILL
    NEED TO COME DOWN TO THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND LOOK YOURSELF
    WITH THE HELP OF JOHN HEZLITT, OUR ARCHIVE CLERK.
 
6.  IF YOU NEED TO COME TO OUR FACILITY TO LOOK THROUGH ANY ARCHIVES,
    AGAIN PLEASE ASK STEPHANIE AND ARRANGE FOR A TIME THAT YOU CAN COME 
    DOWN.  JOHN WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU IN ANY WAY NECESSARY AT THIS
    TIME.

Success!  Partial success anyway... it has effectively shown that
the mailer can be set to RPG or TUMS and it works!  (This is the
TUMS mail, in case you didn't notice.)

The message needs a little sprucing up, but that's trivial compared
to getting through everything successfully.   ...more later...

I just finished poing around trying to fix "serious errors" as reported
by DSKCLN on system 57.  It was dying with PCBIO stopcds, @ CTLFN1+...
when it searched throught the entire PCB list without finding the page
(rib, sat, or upt?) page it was looking for... sounds ominous like either
the disk or the memory was garbaged...  I couldn't find anything that I
could fix.  A few counts were off and a few bad ribs.  I left it with
Tom running a full dskcln to fixup the bad files... I did fix the refresh/
missing/inconsistant packset id problem and fiddled a few files to get
DSKCLN to decide that the errors were "serious to users" but not "serious
to the system"...

I've scheduled lunch with Bill Soley @ 1:30 pm in campbell, so after my
sleepless morning... I may or may not make it to the office this afternoon.

Call me if you need me., or beep me if I'mnot home...  /Carl

Subject: WRTST1 output on WRTSAT STOPCD wrong 

Joe,
  WRTST1 prints garbage on the CTY... at least the page number it's
printing is wrong...   PGYADR, PGYLMA, et al  are pointers which
depend on (PG) and the correct PG is on the stack somewhere at the
time the STOPCD WRTSAT is encountered.  The "bogus" value in PG
at the time is %SAT.C and gives no useful information.

  Can we determine how far down the stack has gone from the point the
actual STOPCD occurrs and it gets to the "additional typeout" routine
so that we can restore PG before the LDB T1,PGYADR ...   If so, can it
be made into a patch so that we can try to track down the problems on
system 29 & 57.

/Carl

The updated version of WRTSAT.PAT has been TELECOPY'd to 29 and 57 and
installed there.  I made the in-line text shorter to get 2 words of patch
space.  The contents of accumulator PG is now at WRTST1+7, not on the stack.
