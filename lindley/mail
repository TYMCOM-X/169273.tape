Subject: Tymshare Unofficial Mail System

Its here folks!
You can send mail with the command
    SENDMAil name@host,name@host,name@host ... name@host
It will prompt you for a subject and the body of the message.  While
you are entering the body, you have the choice of including a file
or calling an editor.  These options are invoked with ~ commands...type
~? for a list of valid commands.  The ~ must be in column one.

You can read mail (as you have obviously discovered) by the command
    RDMAIL
It will display your mail and append it to the file MAIL in your home
directory.

You can only send to "known" hosts which currently include:
    39,57,897,930
    tymix	(NTD's VAX)
    OFFICE	(no need to specify which one)
    ONTYME
I will add other hosts on request.  Send requests to WRS@39.

Notes on OFFICE:
    They can't send mail back to us yet (their restriction).
    Sending to name@host.ARPA will forward via OFFICE-14 to the
    DARPA internet, however, the OFFICE host tables are not complete
    so some ARPA hosts may appear to not be there in which case you'll
    get the mail back with a non-delivery explanation.

Notes on ONTYME:
    If you wish to receive your ONTYME mail through TUMS, you
    need to register your account.  If you are self-confident,
    you can edit (MAIL)ONTYME.DAT - follow the examples exactly!
    Otherwise, send your ONTYME account name(s) and passwords to
    me at WRS@39.  Also, if you register, mail that you send will
    show up as from your account rather than TUMS.GATEWAY which
    might confuse the more narrow minded Ontyme users.

Features forthcoming:
    *	more hosts
    *	better user interface
    *	automatic forwarding
    *	mailing lists

Please report bugs, problems, suggestions and praise to
	    WRS@39
-Bill

P.S.
If you find that SENDMAIL doesn't work as a command, you may use
    R SENDmail
or, include the line
    SetSCM( "(XEXEC)MEXEC" );
in your INIT.SAI.  (you should do this anyway)  If you're not using
.SAI init file, look at procedure SetSCM in (WRS)SETTRM.SAI and
duplicate its functionality in whatever you do use.  If you don't
understand why you should use SCM, call me and I'll tell you, it'd
be nice to hear from you anyway.  -Bill

Subject: HOTLINE.LOG; On-line log of hot-line calls

As per a suggestion by LOIS (and others) the file (M33:930)HOTLINE.LOG
now contains a reverse-chronological log of HOTLINE calls, giving the
approximate date and time of the call, who it was take by, who is to be
contacted, system #, description of problem, solution if known, and the
current status, i.e. PENDING, FIXED, HOLD, etc.

The file is also an INFO node, for somewhat page-able access to recent
problems.  Anyone taking a call should try to look at the file and update
it where applicable.  This should help to keep down the incidence of
multiple people working on the same problem without knowing what has been
done already.  (The info node is "HOTLINE" under node "SUPPORT").

Subject: ONCE - KMC command

Since the 2020 will not come up MANUAL or READONLY, because the KMC-11
is never loaded except on "GO", "FULL" and "KMC", ...  does anyone know
of any reason not to fold the KMC command into the other commands...

I.E. When the 2020 is brought up CONSOLE, don't load the KMC-11, and in
all other cases (NETWORK) load the KMC-11.  Albeit, it appears that the
KMC is loaded by KMCLOD which is run by INITIA, (I think), but there
doesn't seem to be any reason for the KMC command other than that.

Subject: ATTACH by OPER to detached CHKPNT without license

Problem:  CHKPNT has license that OPER doesn't have and with
          the new restriction that you must have same or greater
          license (or JL) to attach to a job, it is impossible
          for OPER to attach to CHKPNT when it dies.

Objective:  Solve the problem without giving OPER any additional
            license, and without having to wait for the time-lapse
            which occurs when OPER must contact software support
            who has the license.

Idea #1:  Have OPER Kill the CHKPNT job, then run CHKPNT by hand.
	  This would work in most instances, but could fill up the
          accounting buffer before completed.  It also is in-elegant.

Idea #2:  Change the restriction to allow a frame with sufficient
          ability to attach (old style allowed same AUN or ACCT-SUP)
          and when the attach is made, reduce the frame-license of
          the target frame to the lesser of the frame-license of the
          two frames involved, but leave the process-license the
          same.  Thus, the current program could be continued without
          loss of process-license, BUT the user would NOT gain any
          additional frame-license!

          This could be interesting when a terminal is voluntarily
          given away, then given back... One would not want to give
          the command port away to a frame with LESS license.

Idea #?:  ???

Subject: CHKPNT problem

The restriction says...
   if the FRAME license of the source is < the FRAME license of the
   destination, do not allow attach.  Please note that the FRAME license
   of CHKPNT ought to be 0.  That is, unless someone set it otherwise.
   The CHKPNT program has PROCESS license (as does any program) only.
Conclusion:
   Either there is something else causing the problem,
   or somebody started CHKPNT by hand and had more FRAME license than OPER,
   or there is a bug in the code in ATTACH that checks license.
Regardless,
   even if the current procedure worked, it is gross and usually faild due
   to operator error anyway.  If the operator types anything other than
   R CHKPNT after attaching, the system will hang in accounting wait
   forever, including the operator job.  CHKPNT should be made more
   intelligent about this so one can always say R CHKPNT.  Bear in
   mind that the only thing preventing doom is that the dead CHKPNT is
   still there with the ACT: device still init'd.  Once this frame is
   disturbed in any way which would cause a RESET or RELEASE (e.g. LOGOUT),
   the world will effectively end with a grand (but deadly) embrace.
Solution:
   Module ACTSER:
	1. Find check for username who owns ACT: being made exempt from 
	    accounting wait.
	2. Change it to be the username who most recently owned ACT:
   Program CHKPNT:
	0. if frame is detached, procede as normal (skip this junk)
	1. look for job owning ACT: and see if its running (JS.RUN).
	2. if ACT: owner found, and running, ask oper if it should be killed.
	3. if no frame already own ACT:, create one under OPER
	4. HALT - do not STOP - the old frame if running
	5. RUN CHKPNT (use .gtFPN) in the child frame (do not do .foCLR)
	6. print CHKPNT running in frame XXXX message and exit
Note:
   If the ACTSER change is made, the rest is sort of unnecessary since the
   kill old procedure Carl mentioned would then work (but won't now).

Subject: Systm 169 status

As of 8PM tuesday, two tapes P034/K with & without printer
support were shipped to St Louis.  The third tape, with /L25
on it would not even get to the ONCE> prompt.  In re-building
a new /L25 and copying it to 24, we had the same results on
booting from disk, so, ONLY two tapes were mailed.

Both monitors worked fine on 24's hardware, so if they do not
work in >St. Louis, we have our "PROOF" that it's not the
software, and that DEC needs to get their act together.  If
it does work, "our" problem isn't solved, but their dilemma

Since I wasn't clear on what happenned during those 4 days in may
that fall into this pay period, & since Craig said that it's ok for
more than one person to have been on-call, what was deci}ided was
to give each of us, 4 8-hour periods, total of 12, or 3 per day which
means that each of those 4 days had an overlap period where two people
were on-call.

As such, John had 15 periods, you had 13, and I had 8,  John sent
mail on emsee to ths.lois with the information for al three of us.

If craig has any questions, have him contact me, and I'll remind him

Well, it may be awhile before we get to write the monitor tapes
for Mallinkrondt.  I have both monitors, plus the new /L25 monitor
for system 24 over on 24, ready to test.

However, the tape drive "JUST" died.  I talked to Debbie & she said
they had to call whoever was on stand-by to come and look at it, so
it will be awhile.

More later... Debbie is supposed to call me at home so I can come in
and write the tapes & test the monitors, (all of 15 minutes work)
when the tape drive is fixed and they are finished restoring files
from Mallinkrondt's all-files tapes.  Sigh!

Subject: System 23, SRAVAL-?-NDT

Still not sure what the problem was.  Could have been a problem
with SRAVAL, but rather than worry about it, I took the easy route.
I renamed the files from SRAVAL into OSNF, then deleted the UFD's
for both SRAVAL and NDT.  Then I called Dallas ops, and asked them
to recycle the system, due to a file-system problem which I believed
would be corrected by the re-load.  I ran TAKEIT and the system was
back up in 3-4 minutes.  I GFD'd to SRAVAL and NDT, then renamed
the files from OSNF to NDT.  All is well and good.  IT WORKED!

Problem solved?  /Carl

Lois,
  I think that it would be a good idea for OSMAN to look at the config
files in OSP and in M33 and look through your systems list to verify
that all the configurations are correct.  This will both aid in getting
the transmittal through, and in making our files "consistant".  I don't
expect this to be very difficult, or need anything much except maybe to
show Osman how to get started doing it.  It will also give him a feel
for what is in the files and what kinds of things are different for each
system.

  Let me know if you both think that this is a reasonable thing to do.

Hmmmm.  Well, since it exhibits the same behavior on /L25 and /L28, I can
rule out the changes that I made to the programmable interrupt system.  I
can also note that the changes between /L21 and /L25 were all in places
which have "no" real effect on the tape drive.  (i.e. ONCE for new commands,
PICON/CLOCK1 for logout on stop, etc.)  Has anyone in Ray Jones' hardware
group been called to come and look at the drive?

As for TITO, it's looking for a tape header that says that it's a TITO tape.
If it isn't, it will complain and won't ever ask for tape positions.

Subject: Thank You!

Thank you very much for thinking of us, and for sending us a beautiful
wedding gift.  This is an "informal" thanks!  You and Jack should get
an "official" Thank You from both of us sometime this week.

Initially I was going to send mail to ask about luncheon schedules for
this coming week.  Please check with Adele, (I will send her a message
on 39 later today), and let me know what days are ok... Tuesday's are
out for me since we have a monitor meeting at 1:00 every week.  Cherie
says this week should be ok for her, preferably an early lunch... I'd
think around 11:30ish.

Lunch:  We are moving to VG2 on Tuesday, do that would not be a good day for
us either.  I'll check with Adele and let you know later.

Access message:  Someone might want to wander around 930 checking for .vue
and .bak files that could be deleted.  Adele did delete over 1300 pages from
her directory.

We are more or less moved.  My new phone is 7406.  What about lunch?

I hear you're here (as opposed to hereing you're hear).  I've been
scarce since my grandparent's have been visiting so I haven't been
much in touch.  Where are you working?  Anyway, welcome!  Lets have
lunch some time.  -Bill
