This  is  the  fourteenth  Autopatch  set.   It  contains  patches   for
ALGOL-10-V1-2,   ANF10-V703,   APL-10-V2,   APLSF-10-V2,  COBOL-10-V12C,
CUSTOMER-SUPPORTED-10-V703,       DECNET-10-V703,        FORTRAN-10-V10,
IBMCOM-10-ET-V4,    IBMCOM-10-HASP-V1,   MONITOR-10-V703,   MPE-10-V703,
SORT-10-V4D, and UTILITIES-10-V703.  To install Autopatch for the  first
time,  you  must  first  restore  the  second  save  set  and follow the
instructions found in the Autopatch Procedures/Reference Manual and  the
INSTAL.DOC  file.   Information  specific to each product is recorded in
section 5.0 of this document.



2.0  EXCEPTIONS


     1.  ANF10-V703,     CUSTOMER-SUPPORTED-10-V703,     DECNET-10-V703,
         MONITOR-10-V703,   MPE-10-V703,   and   UTILITIES-10-V703   are
         autopatched for the first time with this tape.

     2.  The following product(s) are no longer Autopatched  because  of
         new         releases:          ANF10-V23,        COBOL-10-V12B,
         DECNET-10-UTILITIES-V702,     FORTRAN-10-V6,     FORTRAN-10-V7,
         GALAXY-10-V4-1,   GALAXY-10-V702,   LINK-10-V5-1,  MCB-10-V702,
         MPE-10-V702,  MS-10-V10,  NFT-10-V1,  RMS-10-V1,   SORT-10-V4C,
         TOPS-10-DN6X-V701A,     TOPS-10-KI-V701A,     TOPS-10-KL-V701A,
         TOPS-10-KL-V702,       TOPS-10-KS-V701A,       TOPS-10-KS-V702,
         TOPS-10-MPE-V701A,  TOPS-10-TSK-V701,  UTILITIES-10-V701A,  and
         UTILITIES-10-V702.

         *NOTE* It is strongly suggested that you DESELECT any of  these
         products   before  proceeding  with  processing  any  currently
         supported products.

     3.  The following Autopatched product(s) do not have any new  edits
         delivered  with  this  patch  set:   ALGOL-10-V10B,  APL-10-V2,
         APLSF-10-V2, DBMS-10-V5A, and SORT-10-V4D.

     4.  (*new*) The version of BOOT supplied in the  7.03  distribution
         kit  will  NOT  load  the Autopatch 7.03 monitor.  BOOT version
         3A(50) MUST be installed on the front-end  file  system  BEFORE
         you load the Autopatch monitor.  This version of BOOT WILL load
         the distributed 7.03 monitor;  it will  NOT  load  any  monitor
         prior  to  7.02 without a patch to ONCE.  In ONCE, at ONCE4C+3,
         change the HRRZ T1,JOBFF to a MOVEI T1,MONORG.

     5.  (*new*) The MONITOR-10-V703 build process is designed to be  as
         close as possible to the standard monitor build procedure.  One
         set of sources is maintained from which any flavor or  multiple
         monitors  can be built.  However, Autopatch will track and move
         only one monitor.

         You must include a path definition for PAT:  in the  BUILDS.PTH
         file for proper operation of Autopatch.  You must also have the
                                                                  Page 2


         files created by START.CTL and GEN.CTL in the PAT:  area before
         selecting the MONITOR-10 product.

         If your monitor is to include DECNET support, then  you  should
         define DIS:  when selecting the MONITOR-10 product to be a path
         which includes the DIS:  area for the DECNET-10  product.   For
         instance, DSKP:[7,6,MON],DSKP:[7,6,DECNET].

         The following files must  be  in  PAT:   when  the  monitor  is
         Autopatched:
                
                BUILDS.DCL      BUILDS.PTH      TOPS10.CCL      TOPS10.CMD

         It is expected  that  you  will  place  a  customized  copy  of
         BUILDS.PTH  in  PAT:.   Please  observe  the  following  rules.
         First, you MUST specify directories other then  PAT:   for  the
         REL  (FGEN)  and  EXE  (BUILD)  areas.  The START.CTL procedure
         creates a START.MIC file which deletes  all  entries  in  these
         areas.   Second,  you  should  use explicit structures and PPNs
         when defining areas for FGEN,  BUILD  and  BASE:.   Third,  the
         distributed  START.CTL will delete all *.LOG files in BASE:.  A
         revised START.CTL with that command commented out can be  found
         in the second save-set of the Autopatch tape.  Fourth, you must
         include your definition for PAT:  and DIS:  in  the  definition
         of  CTLS:   and  MON:.   Lastly, invoking START.CTL is required
         before you  can  select  MONITOR-10  since  several  files  are
         created.   A  minimum  BUILDS.PTH for building a monitor can be
         found in the second save-set of the Autopatch tape.

         The MPE, DECNET and Customer Supported options to  the  TOPS-10
         Monitor,  if  used, must be autopatched before the Control file
         to build the monitor is submitted.

     6.  (*new*)   When   selecting   the   UTILITIES-10   product   for
         Autopatching  you  should  include  the DIS:  for MONITOR-10 as
         part of your path definition for  DIS:   for  the  UTILITIES-10
         product.  For example, DSKP:[7,6,CSP],DSKP:[7,6,MON].

     7.  (*new*) The ANF10 product is NOT  rebuilt  by  Autopatch.   The
         Autopatch process will update the supported sources in the DIS:
         area.  After the INSTALL command has been  processed,  you  may
         use the sources in DIS:  to rebuild the product with procedures
         which are appropriate for your site.

         Also, there are 11 .P11 files that were omitted  from  the  ANF
         distribution.   These  files  have  been included on the second
         save-set of this Autopatch tape.  You must restore these  files
         to  the  DIS:   area for ANF10 before ANF10 can be selected for
         Autopatching.  Use of  either  ANF703.A14  or  ANF703.P14  will
         attempt to restore thes files to DSKP:[7,6,ANF].

     8.  (*new*) This tape contains PEP at edit level 161.  This version
         is  required in order to update the DECNET-10 product.  Be sure
         that PEP.EXE and PEPB.EXE are restored to SYS:.
                                                                  Page 3


     9.  (*new*) The UTILITIES-10 product  now  includes  virtually  all
         products  found  on  the  CUSP  tape.   This  includes 11-based
         products.  All output files must  be  'seen'  in  INS:   before
         UTILITIES-10  can  be selected.  This includes components which
         don't normally reside in SYS:  such as BOOT.EXB and BOOTML.EXB.
         Be sure to read the UTILITIES-10 section of the INSTAL.DOC file
         in the second save-set for a complete list of files  that  must
         be intially found in INS:.

    10.  (*new*) The  version  of  SOUP  for  Autopatch  (SOUPR)  has  a
         filename  which conflicts with the original and still supported
         SOUP product.  The  name  of  the  SOUPR  file  in  the  second
         save-set has been changed from COMPAR.MAC to COMPR.MAC.

         If the COMPAR.MAC file has been  previously  restored  to  PAT:
         then  it  must  be deleted or the selection of UTLITIES-10-V703
         will report a checksum mismatch and the wrong  COMPAR.REL  file
         will be created.

    11.  (*new*) There is support for LINK-V6 provided as  part  of  the
         UTILITIES-10-V703  product.  Be sure that any obsolete versions
         of the C1PLNK.CMD and C1POVL.CMD files are  deleted.   The  new
         ones should be in the DIS:  for the UTILITIES product.

    12.  (*new*) There are three Patch Command Files on  this  save-set.
         They   are   APL1B2.MKL,  APL1S2.MKL,  and  DBMV5A.MKL.   These
         products have no patches on this tape.  Without these files, if
         you  were  to  'AUTOPATCH' the products with PEP and SUBmit the
         patch and  build  control  files  the  process  would  use  old
         patching  indirect  command  files.  This would cause a failure
         with DBMS.  The 'null' patching  indirect  command  files  will
         avoid  this  problem.   Any  checksum  warnings regarding these
         files may be ignored.

    13.  (tape 11) The Autopatch build for source-patched products  will
         delete  source files in PAT:  to prevent problems if a build is
         re-started.  This process may fail if  PAT:   is  defined  with
         SFDs.   Either  do not use SFDs when defining PAT:  or manually
         delete the source files  in  the  SFD  before  re-starting  the
         Autopatch build.

    14.  (tape 11) If you are using the new FORTRAN-10 V10 with DBMS you
         will need a revised DBCS1F.CMD file from the second save-set on
         the Autopatch tape.   This  file  should  be  copied  into  the
         FORTRAN  distribution  area.   The  copy of this file which was
         distributed with DBMS V5A must be removed or the FORTRAN  build
         will fail.

    15.  (tape 11) A revised copy of TGHA.EXE is contained in the  first
         save-set  on  this  tape.  This copy is required for use of the
         new MG20 memory.

    16.  (tape 10) If you are using DBMS with FORTRAN or COBOL,  do  not
         INSTALL  DBMS  with  PEP  until  FORTRAN  and/or COBOL has been
         built.  A feature of PEP which was new with tape 9 deletes  the
                                                                  Page 4


         autopatched files from PAT:  upon successful installation.  The
         COBOL and FORTRAN products depend on the necessary  DBMS  files
         being in PAT:.

    17.  (tape 10) There are three .REL modules for DBMS  (FML10,  INF10
         and MND10) which are null.  This causes a %CGV error message at
         the end of the batch job and when PEP is checking  the  results
         of the batch job.  These messages should be ignored.

    18.  (tape 9) There are two new features of PEP and PEPB  which  are
         worthy  of  note.  First, the new PEP will automatically delete
         copies of files in PAT:  which have been successfully installed
         with the INSTALL command.

         Second,  the  definition  of  ASL:   has  been  changed  to  be
         PAT:,DIS:,INS:.        The       old       definition       was
         PAT:,DIS:,REL:,UNV:,SYS:.   This  change  was  made  to  obtain
         better  control  over  all files used in the build process.  We
         have delivered what we believe to be a  complete  set  of  base
         building software on the Autopatch tape.  If your procedure has
         problems you may have to copy certain files into PAT:, DIS:, or
         INS:.

         The following files are required for Autopatch use, not put  in
         place by Autopatch, and may have been previously found in SYS:.

                        IBMCOM HASP and ET

                DDT11.EXE       GALCNF.UNV      MACDLX.EXE

                        FORTRAN

                BLIS10.EXE      BLIS10.ERR

         If these files are currently found in SYS:  they must be copied
         or moved to PAT:, DIS:, or INS:.

         The SORT product currently looks for FTDEFS.UNV amd  METUNV.UNV
         in  ASL:.   In  fact  the  SORT build does NOT use these files.
         This will be fixed on a future Autopatch tape.  Since SYS:   is
         no  longer  in the ASL:  definition, you may have to copy these
         files from SYS:.  Users who Autopatch SORT for the  first  time
         and  users  who have these files in PAT:  from a previous COBOL
         build will not have this problem.

    19.  (tape 9) The IBMCOM products have  a  module  named  MACROS.P11
         which  conflicts  with a module by the same name with different
         contents in the ANF10 product.  The IBMCOM  MACROS  module  has
         been  renamed  as  MACRO.P11.   For  users  of Autopatch on the
         IBMCOM products for the first time, if  the  IETV04  or  IHSV01
         .CCL  file  is  used to load the distribution directory then no
         action is required by the  user.   Otherwise,  the  distributed
         MACROS.P11  file  must  be  renamed  to  be  MACRO.P11  or  the
         MACRO.P11 file on the Autopatch tape must be put in DIS:.   The
         UTILTY.UPD file will update the Patch Database file.
                                                                  Page 5


    20.  (tape 7) Changes have been made to  the  PEP  utility.   It  is
         MANDATORY  that  PEP.EXE and PEPB.EXE be restored to SYS:  from
         the installation (second) save-set.

         Due to a limited amount of space  in  some  of  PEP's  internal
         tables,  we  are  now declaring some products to be "obsolete".
         These products will be removed from PEP's internal tables.  For
         the  most  part  this process is transparent to you, unless the
         obsolete  product  has  previously  been   SELECTed.    Suppose
         FORTRAN-10-V6  is one of your SELECTed products.  In that case,
         the following message would be displayed the first time you run
         the new PEP:

             [FORTRAN-10-V6 is now obsolete.
              Edits are no longer being delivered.
              You should DESELECT this product.]

         This message  will  only  appear  ONCE  PER  SELECTED  OBSOLETE
         PRODUCT.   Use  the  DESELECT  command  to  purge  the obsolete
         product from your database.


                                      NOTE

             The PEP101.PDF file  is  NOT  compatible  with  earlier
             versions of PEP.



         There is now a short version of the INFORMATION command  called
         STATUS.   It  displays  the status information and logical name
         definitions, but does not list any files  or  their  checksums.
         For example, you might see the following:

             PEP>status LINK-10-V5-1

             LINK-10-V5-1 is ready to be SETUP for patch and rebuild
              Patches retrieved through patch tape 7

              Logical names:
                PAT: (autopatching directory) defined as DSKP:[7,6]
                DIS: (distribution directory) defined as DSKP:[7,6,LINK]
                BAK: (backup directory) defined as DSKP:[7,6,BACKUP]
                INS: (installation directory) defined as SYS:
                ASL: (autopatch search list) defined as PAT:,DIS:,INS:


    21.  (tape 7) Edit 612 to DBMS-10-V5A eliminates the  need  for  the
         DBSINF.REL  module  which  was  introduced on Autopatch tape 5.
         Users who have Autopatched DBMS previously are urged to be sure
         that  the  new  version of the DBINF1.CMD file is restored from
         the patch set 7 save set on this tape.  Use of  the  DBMV5A.Ann
         file will accomplish this task.

    22.  (tape 7) The second chapter of  the  TOPS-10/TOPS-20  Autopatch
                                                                  Page 6


         Procedures/Reference  Manual  suggests a quota of 20,000 blocks
         for the [7,6] PPN on page 2-2.  Because of  additional  product
         support, it is now suggested that you use a figure of 140000.

    23.  (tape  6)  The  patch  directory   files   (.DPD)   have   been
         re-formatted;   the  same  number of edits, but less 'patches',
         are  described.   Also,  intermediate  checkpointing  has  been
         suppressed during the execution of the PEP 'AUTOPATCH' command.
         Checkpoint processing  time  has  been  SIGNIFICANTLY  reduced.
         These  changes  will  improve  PEP  performance, but will cause
         minor variations from the examples provided on pages 2-7,  2-17
         and 3-8 of the Autopatch Procedures/Reference Manual.

    24.  (tape 6) Users of FORTRAN with DBMS MUST create a file  -  read
         the INSTAL.DOC file.

         If  you  have  previously  SELECTed  DBMS  for  Autopatch   and
         indicated  that FORTRAN was being used than you may want to 're
         do' DBMS.  FORTRAN V6 is  no  longer  supported  by  Autopatch.
         With  FORTRAN  V7 and later the FORLIB.REL file is not modified
         for DBMS and the DBMSF.EXE file is autopatched by FORTRAN.

         The suggested procedure  is  to  use  the  DBMV5A.Ann  file  to
         restore  all  files  for  DBMS  from  this  tape  and issue the
         DESELECT and SELECT commands  for  DBMS-10-V5A  to  PEP  before
         Autopatching  DBMS.  Otherwise, the DBMS Autopatch process will
         'install' copies of FORLIB.REL and DBMSF.EXE which is also done
         by the FORTRAN Autopatch process.

    25.  (tape 6) There are  three  warning  messages  seen  during  the
         patching of REL libraries of the DBMS product.  Newer edits are
         trying to remove edits which were suppressed.   This  condition
         is non-fatal and has no impact on the success of DBMS updating.
         Ignore the messages.

    26.  (tape 6) BATCH time limits for FORTRAN and COBOL should be high
         to ensure that the product build BATCH jobs do not abort due to
         CPU time overrun.  Use  a  figure  of  5  hours  to  cover  all
         possibilities.

    27.  (tape 6) Some products can optionally use other products.  This
         means  that  one  product  may  have  to be patched and rebuilt
         before another product.  For example, COBOL can optionally  use
         the  DBMS  product.   The COBOL Autopatch process requires that
         DBMS and SORT be updated before COBOL.  In order to  apply  all
         patches  correctly  you must SUBMIT the Patch and Build Control
         file for SORT and DBMS before the COBOL Control file.  The MPE,
         Customer-supported  and  Decnet  options to the TOPS-10 Monitor
         must be Autopatched  before  the  Control  file  to  build  the
         monitor is submitted.

    28.  (tape 5) Before selecting the ALGOL product for Autopatching be
         sure  to  read  the  note  in  the  INSTAL.DOC file regarding a
         required rename of the OTS.

    29.  (tape 4) When PEP is the default directory must be PAT:.

    30.  (tape 4) It is advised that all desired  products  be  SELECTed
         for  Autopatching  before  entering  the  AUTOPATCH or RETRIEVE
         command for the first time.  The patch retrieval process is NOT
         product  specific.   This  process  can  be  invoked  with  the
         RETRIEVE command or the AUTOPATCH command.  PEP will then  read
         the  entire  patch  directory  file (.DPD) and update the patch
         database  file  (.PDB)  for  all  SELECTed  products.   If  the
         AUTOPATCH  command  is entered for a product which was SELECTed
         at the time of a prior retrieval process, a statement  will  be
         made indicating that all patches have already been retrieved.
