           Installation Information for Autopatch-10/20 V1.2
           -------------------------------------------------



     1.0  INTRODUCTION

     This document describes the procedures necessary  to  set  up  your
     DECSYSTEM-10  for  patching software with Autopatch-10/20 V1.2.  It
     augments the information provided in chapter  2  of  the  Autopatch
     Procedures/Reference  Manual.   This  initialization  operation  is
     required only once.  After it has been completed, you will be  able
     to  apply  the  patches  distributed  periodically in the Autopatch
     Kits.

     In order to set up your system for autopatching, you must create  a
     disk  directory  referred  to  as the autopatching directory.  This
     directory is used to  patch  and  rebuild  the  software.   In  the
     autopatching  directory you must install some of the files supplied
     on this patch tape as described in section 2 of this document.

     In addition, you must also prepare  a  distribution  directory  for
     each  product you intend to autopatch.  This operation is described
     for each of  the  autopatchable  products  in  section  3  of  this
     document.

     For  the  DECSYSTEM-10  the  following   products   are   currently
     autopatchable:
        
            Version 10B of ALGOL-10

            Version 7.03 of ANF10

            Version 2 of the APL products:
        
                APL-10
                APLSF-10

            Version 12C of COBOL-10

            Version 5A of DBMS-10

            Version 7.03 of DECNET-10

            Version 10 of FORTRAN-10

            Version 4 of IBMCOM/ET-10

            Version 1 of IBMCOM/HASP-10

            Version 4D of SORT-10
                                                                  Page 2



            Version 7.03 of TOPS-10 and Utilities
                                                                  Page 3


     Autopatch  V1.2  is  supported  for  applying  only  those  patches
     provided  by  Digital Equipment Corporation as part of an Autopatch
     Kit.  Furthermore, those  patches  are  supported  for  distributed
     (field-image)  software  or  distributed  software  that  has  been
     modified only by autopatching.



     2.0  INSTALLING AUTOPATCH

     If you are not using an  autopatching  structure  named  DSKP:,  we
     recommend  that  you make an entry in your login procedures so that
     DSKP:  is assigned to be the structure you will be using.   If  you
     do  this  and  use the default [7,6] ppn, you will not need to edit
     the BACKUP retrieval command files provided to set-up  the  product
     distribution directories and to process the patch tape.

     The second save set of the patch tape contains  tools  and  control
     files  that  are used in the autopatching operation.  A list of all
     the files in this save set is given in section 4 of this  document.
     Use  the  BACKUP  program  to  restore  from  this  save set to the
     appropriate disk directories those files you need.

     The following files should be installed in  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to SYS:
        
                PEP.EXE
                PEPB.EXE

     The following file should be installed  in  [2,5]  or  one  of  the
     directories belonging to HLP:
        
                PEP.HLP

     The following files should be installed in the disk  directory  you
     have set up as the autopatching directory:
        
                PEP101.PDF
                UPDATE.EXE

     In addition, a product-specific patch and build control file and  a
     product  description  file  must  be  installed in the autopatching
     directory for each product you intend to  autopatch.   These  files
     are  in  the installation save set of the patch tape.  See the last
     section for a list of these files.

     The installation save set also contains indirect command  files  to
     assist  you  in  setting  up  the product distribution directories.
     These BACKUP CCL files are intended to be run  interactively.   See
     the last section for a list of these files.

     For each product you intend to autopatch, you  should  install  the
     associated  control  files  in  the  autopatching  directory.   For
     example, if you intend to autopatch  the  APLSF-10-V2  product  you
     would install
                                                                  Page 4



                APL1S2.CTL      for APLSF-10 rebuild
                APL1S2.PDF      for Autopatch installation
                APL1S2.CCL      for preparing distribution directory
        
     in the autopatching directory.
                                                                  Page 5


     3.0  AUTOPATCH INSTALLATION OF SPECIFIC PRODUCTS

     3.1  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ALGOL-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  ALGOL-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                ALGOL.EXE
                ALGOTS.EXE
                ALGLIB.REL
                ALGDDT.HLP
                ALGOL.HLP

     *NOTE* The ALGOL distribution does not have a ALGOTS.EXE  file  but
     does  have  a  ALG310.EXE file.  For Autopatching this file must be
     named ALGOTS.EXE in  the  ALGOL  Autopatch  Installation  directory
     (INS:).   Unless  you  COPY or RENAME to create the ALGOTS.EXE file
     the PEP SELECT  process  for  ALGOL-10-V10B  will  fail.   An  edit
     supplied  for  the ALGOL compiler changes generated code to use the
     new generic reference to the OTS.

     The following file is required to build the ALGOL product.  It must
     be  available  either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution
     area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  ALGOL-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D608D-SB(1600  BPI)  or AP-5069D-SB(800 BPI)
     into  the  disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as   the   ALGOL-10
     distribution directory.
        
        From save set ALGOL-SOURCES
        
        ALGCOD.MAC      ALGCON.MAC      ALGDDT.MAC      ALGDEC.MAC
        ALGEXP.MAC      ALGFOR.MAC      ALGFUN.MAC      ALGLIB.MAC
        ALGMAC.MAC      ALGOTS.MAC      ALGPRM.MAC      ALGSER.MAC
        ALGSTB.MAC      ALGSTM.MAC      ALGSYS.MAC      ALGUTL.MAC


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
                                                                  Page 6


     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ALG].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ALG] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ALG10B.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                  Page 7


     3.2  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING ANF10

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS  10  V7.03
     Monitor  distribution  tape BB-X140B-SB into the disk directory you
     have set up as the ANF10 distribution directory.
        
        CHK11.P11       DN2741.P11      DNCDDH.P11      DNCDDQ.P11
        DNCDMC.P11      DNCDUP.P11      DNCNFG.P11      DNCOMM.P11
        DNCRD.P11       DNCTAB.P11      DNDBG.P11       DNDCMP.P11
        DNDCP4.P11      DNDEV.P11       DNDH11.P11      DNDL10.P11
        DNDM11.P11      DNDN11.P11      DNDTE.P11       DNDZ11.P11
        DNLBLK.P11      DNLPT.P11       DNNCL.P11       DNNSP.P11
        DNNSP3.P11      DNRDA.P11       DNRDE.P11       DNTRCE.P11
        DNTSK.P11       DNTTY.P11       MACROS.P11      S.P11
        TSKTST.P11

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,ANF].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,ANF] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:ANF703.CCL[7,6]
        
     The  MON703.CCL  file  will  also  put  the  files  for  ANF   into
     DSKP:[7,6,ANF].   Users of Autopatch for the first time do not need
     to  use  the  ANF703.CCL  file  if  the  [7,6,ANF]  area  has  been
     established prior to use of the MON703.CCL file.

     The ANF product is NOT rebuilt by Autopatch.  The Autopatch process
     will  update  the  supported  sources in the DIS:  area.  After the
     INSTALL command has  been  processed,  the  customer  may  use  the
     sources  in  DIS:  to rebuild the product with procedures which are
     appropriate to the site.

     The following files are supplied in  the  second  save-set  of  the
     Autopatch tape and must be restored to the DIS:  area for ANF10:

        DDT.P11         DNCDDP.P11      DNCDDS.P11      DNDEMO.P11
        DNLP20.P11      DNMOP.P11       DNLPT.P11       DNPTP.P11
        DNPTR.P11       DNRAM.P11       DNVFU.P11


     The Patch control file for the update of this product  as  well  as
     the   Autopatch  product  description  file  are  supplied  in  the
     Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last  section
     of  this  document  for  a  list of these files.  There is a BACKUP
     command file provided in the  first  Save-set  which  will  restore
     these  files to the proper directory.  See the README documentation
     file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.3  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING APL

     Both APL-10 and APLSF-10 are  autopatchable  with  Autopatch-10/20.
     Before  preparing  these  products for autopatching, they should be
     installed  on  your  system  as  described  in   the   installation
     documentation supplied on the APL distribution tapes.

     To make the product autopatchable,  some  of  the  files  from  the
     product  distribution  tape  will  have to be installed in the disk
     directory that you have set up as the APL distribution directory.
                                                                  Page 9

        * only if using the multi-segmented compiler (ONESEG==0)

     The COBOL V12C product may be patched via source file updates  with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     COBOL distribution tape.  You will need to copy the following files
     from the COBOL12C distribution tape BB-H580E-SB into the  disk
     directory you have set up as the COBOL-10 distribution directory.
     COBDDT.KEY CBL74.KEY       68274.KEY
     CPYLIB.KEY CBL74C.KEY      68274C.KEY

     If you desire to Autopatch COBOL via updated sources the  following
     files  are  required  to  build  the  COBOL  product.  They must be
     available either in the patching area (PAT:), the distribution area
     (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

        *NOTE* EDIT.MAC is renamed as EDITC.MAC in the distribution area


     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,CBL].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,CBL] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
     To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBL12C.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CBR12C.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        
     Use of any of these files will also restore the SORT files  on  the
     COBOL  tape  to  the DSKP:[7,6,SRT] area.  Also the following files
     are restored by these CCL files but not used by Autopatch:

        CRELD.MAC       GETERA.MAC      SETEOF.MAC      SRTTAB.MAC
        STRNGL.MAC

     If you will be Autopatching BOTH Cobol-74 and the 68274 Translation
     Tool  new files are required in the patching directory.  Obtain the
     COBASM.MAC file and make a copy named C74ASM.MAC.  You must  create
     a  copy  of  the COBASM.MAC file with the FT68274 switch set on and
     call it TRNASM.MAC.  For more information refer to section  6.0  of
     the COBOL.INS file on the COBOL 12C distribution tape.

     Do not eliminate the COBASM.MAC file -  the  selection  process  of
     Autopatch requires this file to be present in the DIS:  directory.

     When SELECTing COBOL with PEP you will be asked if  you  are  using
     the  multi-seg  compiler.  Unless you have set the ONESEG switch on
     in the COBASM.MAC file the correct answer is YES.  In order to have
     Autopatch  include  the  SORT  module in the OTS you must create an
     empty file named CBLSRT.FLG in the patching directory  (PAT:).   If
     the   process  can  find  CBLSRT.REL  it  will  then  be  included.
     Likewise, in order to have Autopatch include support  for  DBMS  in
     the  OTS  you  must  create  an  empty file named CBLDBM.FLG in the
     patching directory.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MON].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MON] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:CUS703.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Autopatch product description file for this product is supplied
     in  the  Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a listing of this file.   There  is  a
     BACKUP  command  file  provided  in  the  first Save-set which will
     restore  this  file  to  the  proper  directory.   See  the  README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.6  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DBMS-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DBMS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SCHEMA.EXE
                FORDML.EXE
                DBMEND.EXE
                DBINFO.EXE
                DAEMDB.EXE

     The following files are required to build the DBMS  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      SCAN.REL

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  DBMS-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D478D-BB(1600  BPI)  or AP-C804D-BB(800 BPI)
     into the disk directory you have set up as the DBMS-10 distribution
     directory.

     3.7  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING DECNET

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  DECNET-10-V703  is  referred  to  as  the product installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
                CTHNRT.EXE
                FAL.EXE
                NFT.EXE
                NML.EXE

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS-10  DECNET
     7.03 distribution tape BB-X116B-SB into the disk directory you have
     set up as the DECNET-10 distribution directory.
        
           From the first save set

                DECNET.FIL      CTHNRT.MAC      NFT.MAC         FAL.MAC
                NIP.MAC         TSC.MAC

                SCPAR.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to  DSKP:[7,6,DECNET].   If
     you   wish   to   use   this   command  file,  but  are  not  using
     DSKP:[7,6,DECNET] as your distribution directory you will  have  to
     edit this command file to change the /RESTORE command to correspond
     to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:DEC703.CCL[7,6]
        

     This product maintains the monitor modules  which  provide  support
     for DECNET.  When selecting the MONITOR-10 product for Autopatching
     you should include the DIS:   for  DECNET  as  part  of  your  path
     definition  for  DIS:   for  the  MONITOR-10 product.  For example,
     DSKP:[7,6,MON],DSKP:[7,6,DECNET].

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for   FORTRAN-10   is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
     directories  belonging  to  SYS:.   This directory must contain the
     files:
        
        FORTRA.EXE      SINGLE.EXE      FORTB.EXE       FORTC.EXE
        FORTD.EXE       FORTE.EXE       FORTF.EXE       FORTG.EXE
        DORTRA.EXE      DORTB.EXE       DOTRC.EXE       DORTD.EXE
        DORTE.EXE       DORTF.EXE       DORTG.EXE       FORO10.EXE
        FORLIB.REL      FORDDT.REL

     The FORTRAN V10 product may be patched via source file updates with
     re-build  and/or  via  encrypted  EXE/REL file replacement.  If you
     desire to use encryption then KEY files must be retrieved from  the
     FORTRAN  distribution  tape.   You  will need to copy the following
     files from the FORTRAN-10 V10 distribution  tape  BB-D480F-SB  into
     the  disk  directory you have set up as the FORTRAN-10 distribution
     directory.

        From the save set "Source files for FORTRAN V10"
        
        FORTRA.KEY      SINGLE.KEY      FORTB.KEY       FORTC.KEY
        FORTD.KEY       FORTE.KEY       FORTF.KEY       FORTG.KEY
        DORTRA.KEY      DORTB.KEY       DOTRC.KEY       DORTD.KEY
        DORTE.KEY       DORTF.KEY       DORTG.KEY       FORO10.KEY
        FORLIB.KEY      FORDDT.KEY

     If you  are  also  using  DBMS  with  FORTRAN  you  will  need  the
     FORDBM.REL  file  from  the  fourth  save-set  of  the  FORTRAN V10
     distribution tape and the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second  save-set
     of the Autopatch tape.

     If  you  desire  to  Autopatch  FORTRAN  via  updated  sources  the
     following  files  are  required to build the FORTRAN product.  They
     must  be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),   the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        GLXMAC.UNV      HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV
        RMSINT.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV


     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.
                                                                 Page 21


     You will need to copy  the  following  files  from  the  FORTRAN-10
     distribution  tape BB-D480F-SB into the disk directory you have set
     up as the FORTRAN-10 distribution directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,FTN].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,FTN] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN10.CCL[7,6]
                for source file updating

        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:FTN10R.CCL[7,6]
                for EXE/REL replacement updating
        

     If you use DBMS with FORTRAN and want to have the  Autopatch  Patch
     and  Build Control file build DBMSF you must create a dummy file in
     the patching directory (PAT:) called FTNDBM.FLG.  The  presence  of
     this  file  on PAT:  will cause the BATCH control file to branch in
     order to perform the processing required to build  DBMSF.EXE.   You
     will  also need the DBCS1F.CMD file from the second save-set of the
     Autopatch tape.

     The Patch and Build control file and utility command files for  the
     re-build   of  this  product  as  well  as  the  Autopatch  product
     description file are supplied in the Installation Save-set  on  the
     Autopatch  tape.   See the last section of this document for a list
     of these files.  There is a BACKUP command  file  provided  in  the
     first  Save-set  which  will  restore  these  files  to  the proper
     directory.  See the README documentation file in the first Save-set
     for more information.

     3.9  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING IBMCOM-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for IBMCOM-10 is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
                                        HASP only

                D6LQ3.BIN               D6LQH.BIN

                IBMSPL.EXE

                D60SPD.EXE

     The following files are required to build the IBMCOM product.  They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        ORNMAC.UNV      QSRMAC.UNV      UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     From a GALAXY build or installation you must  have  the  GALCNF.UNV
     file available in PAT:, DIS:, or INS:.

     You will need to copy the following files from the  TOPS-10  IBMCOM
     distribution  tape  BB-J992D-SB (ET) or BB-V552B-SB (HASP) into the
     disk directory you  have  set  up  as  the  IBMCOM-10  distribution
     directory.

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the  appropriate  files  to  DSKP:[7,6,IBMET]  or
     DSKP:[7,6,IBMHSP].   If  you wish to use this command file, but are
     not using the indicated SFD as your distribution directory you will
     have  to  edit  this command file to change the /RESTORE command to
     correspond to your directory.  If you do not use this command  file
     then  the  MACROS.P11  file  in  the distribution directory must be
     renamed or copied  to  be  MACRO.P11  before  the  product  can  be
     SELECTED.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.10  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING MONITOR-10-V703

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  TOPS-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
        MON.EXE
        MONGEN.EXE
        TOPS10.REL


     The MON.EXE file is a copy of your current monitor.  The  Autopatch
     process   will   create   a   new   MON.EXE   in  the  installation
     directory(INS:).

     The following file is required to build the  MONITOR  product.   It
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        EDDT.REL

     This file will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use one of
     the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will need to copy the following files  from  the  TOPS-10  7.03
     BB-X140B-SB  Distribution  tape,  and  BB-FP63A-SB/BB-X128B-SB CUSP
     tape into the disk directory you have  set  up  as  the  MONITOR-10
     distribution directory.

        JOBDAT.MAC      MACSYM.MAC      UUOSYM.MAC


     Indirect command files to perform this operation have been included
     in  the installation save set on this patch tape.  These files will
     restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MON].  If  you  wish  to
     use  these  command files, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MON] as your
     distribution directory you will have to edit these command files to
     change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use these command files, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:MON703.CCL[7,6]  for the 7.03 distribution tape
                and
        /@DSKP:CSP703.CCL[7,6]  for the 7.03 CUSP tape


     The following files are created by running GEN at your site and are
     a  required part of the build procedure.  They should be put in the
     Autopatch distribution directory for the monitor.
        
        F.MAC
        HDWCNF.MAC
        NETCNF.MAC

     The  following  files  must  be  in  PAT:   when  the  monitor   is
     Autopatched:
        
        BUILDS.DCL      BUILDS.PTH      TOPS10.CCL      TOPS10.CMD

     It is expected that you will place a customized copy of  BUILDS.PTH
     in  PAT:.   Please  observe  the  following rules.  First, you MUST
     specify directories other then PAT:  for the  REL  (FGEN)  and  EXE
     (BUILD)  areas.   The  START.CTL procedure creates a START.MIC file
     which deletes all entries in these areas.  Second, you  should  use
     explicit  structures  and  PPNs when defining areas for FGEN, BUILD
     and BASE:.  Third, the distributed START.CTL will delete all  *.LOG
     files  in  BASE:.   A revised START.CTL with that command commented
     out can be found in the second  save-set  of  the  Autopatch  tape.
     Fourth,  you must include your definition of PAT:  and DIS:  in the
                                                                 Page 28


     definition of CTLS:   and  MON:.   Lastly,  invoking  START.CTL  is
     required  before  you can select MONITOR-10 since several files are
     created.  A minimum BUILDS.PTH for building a monitor can be  found
     in the second save-set of the Autopatch tape.

     The MPE, DECNET and  Customer  Supported  options  to  the  TOPS-10
     Monitor,  if  used,  must be autopatched before the Control file to
     build the monitor is submitted.

     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 29


     3.11  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING MPE-10

     You will need to copy the following file from the TOPS-10 MPE  7.03
     distribution  tape BB-X133B-SB into the disk directory you have set
     up as the MONITOR-10 distribution directory.
        
           From the first save set
        
                CPNSER.MAC
                MPE.FIL

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,MON].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,MON] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:MPE703.CCL[7,6]
        

     The Autopatch product description file for this product is supplied
     in  the  Installation Save-set on the Autopatch tape.  See the last
     section of this document for a listing of this file.   There  is  a
     BACKUP  command  file  provided  in  the  first Save-set which will
     restore  this  file  to  the  proper  directory.   See  the  README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.
                                                                 Page 30


     3.12  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING SORT-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  SORT-10  is referred to as the product installation directory.
     In most cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the  directories
     belonging to SYS:.  This directory must contain the files:
        
                SORT.EXE
                FSORT.EXE

     The following files are required to build the SORT  product.   They
     must   be  available  either  in  the  patching  area  (PAT:),  the
     distribution area (DIS:), or in the installation area (INS:).

        From the first save-set of the Autopatch tape

        HELPER.REL      MACTEN.UNV      SCAN.REL        SCNMAC.UNV
        UUOSYM.UNV

     These files will be moved from the Autopatch tape when you use  one
     of the BACKUP CCL files described in the README file.

     You will  need  to  copy  the  following  files  from  the  SORT-10
     distribution  tape  BB-D489F-SB  or  from the COBOL-10 distribution
     tape into the disk  directory  you  have  set  up  as  the  SORT-10
     distribution directory.
        
           From save set SORT-SOURCE
        
        SORT.MAC        SRTFLT.MAC      SRTCBL.MAC      SRTPRM.MAC
        SRTCER.MAC      SRTSCN.MAC      SRTCMP.MAC      SRTSTA.MAC
        SRTUUO.MAC

     An indirect  command  file  to  perform  this  operation  has  been
     included  in  the  installation  save set on this patch tape.  This
     file will restore the appropriate files to DSKP:[7,6,SRT].  If  you
     wish  to use this command file, but are not using DSKP:[7,6,SRT] as
     your distribution directory you will have to edit this command file
     to change the /RESTORE command to correspond to your directory.
        
        To use this command file, issue the following commands:
        
        .R BACKUP
        /TAPE tape:
        /@DSKP:SRTV4D.CCL[7,6]
        
     This command file is valid for use  ONLY  with  the  separate  SORT
     distribution  tape.   Use  of the COBOL CCL file will load the SORT
     files from the COBOL distribution tape into DSKP:[7,6,SRT].
                                                                 Page 31


     The Patch and Build control file for the re-build of  this  product
     as  well  as the Autopatch product description file are supplied in
     the Installation Save-set on the  Autopatch  tape.   See  the  last
     section  of  this  document  for a list of these files.  There is a
     BACKUP command file provided  in  the  first  Save-set  which  will
     restore  these  files  to  the  proper  directory.   See the README
     documentation file in the first Save-set for more information.

     3.13  PREPARING FOR AUTOPATCHING UTILITIES-10

     Before preparing this product for Autopatching, you should  install
     the  product  on  your  system  as  described  in  the installation
     documentation supplied on the product  distribution  tape.   Unless
     the  product is correctly installed, you will not be able to SELECT
     it for Autopatching.

     The disk directory in which you have installed the executable files
     for  UTILITIES-10  is  referred  to  as  the  product  installation
     directory.  In most  cases  this  will  be  [1,4]  or  one  of  the
