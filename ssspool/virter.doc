        TYMNET has a number of parameters which can be set to control
a terminal.  This document is intended to describe the "virtual
terminal" described by these parameters.  Some of these parameters
are fixed, others are not fully deployed, some will become obsolete, and
additional parameters will be defined in this document.  Thus it will be
necessary to key each description according to the following codes:

  ! Is fixed, deployed, and will not be changed.
  > Originates only at TYMSAT (remote) node.
  < Originates only at BASE node.
  # Is new, and will be deployed in the future.
  $ Is deployed, but will become obsolete in the future.
  * Applies only to asynchronous terminals.
  @ Applies only to 2741-type terminals.
  & Applies only to 2780-type terminals.
  = this parameter only applies to CDC-type printer ports.
  _ Will become fixed once deployed.

        Unless otherwise specified, codes will be represented by octal
numbers.  The default is an 8-bit value (byte).  Multiple-byte codes
are designated by X\\Y, where X and Y are successive bytes.  Certain
codes have subfields of less than 8 bits.  these will be noted by
the form (X)Y, designating X bits of value Y.  Subfields will be
seperated by "\".

        Characters flowing through the network are all 8-bit quantities.
This provides a character-space of 256 (decimal) distinct quantities.
However, certain characters in this space are set aside for network
control, and some of the control commands are character pairs.  These
control functions are transparent to the actual data stream.

        Character codes 000 to 007 are control codes:

!       Code 000 is an escape character.  It is the first character of
a character pair, and the second character is the data character.  This
permits the distinguishing of data codes from control codes.

!       Code 001 is a prefix code, and is followed by a second character
which specifies the specific code to use.  These are described below.

!       Code 002 is known as a GOBBLER.  it is used to flush all
characters from a circuit, traveling in the same direction.

!       Code 003 is a CIRCUIT ZAPPER, and is used to empty all
characters from a circuit and tear the circuit down.

!>      Code 004 is a LEAVING-DEFERED-ECHO-MODE report.


!>      Code 005 is a GREEN BALL.  These originate only at TYMSATS,
and are held by the host until released again to return to the
TYMSAT.  The receipt of a GREEN BALL by the TYMSAT signifies that the
host is dismissed, waiting for input.  The GREEN BALL may be used by
the TYMSAT to decide when to leave DEFERED-ECHO-MODE on some terminals,
and to decide when to turn other (half-duplex) terminals around.

!>      Code 006 is a RED BALL.  These are used to cancel GREEN BALLS.

!>      Code 007 is a ENTERING-DEFERED-ECHO-MODE report.  This character
is send whenever a conflict occurs such that either:  1. a non-printable
character is received from the terminal;  or  2. if a character is
received while output to the terminal is in progress.



                PREFIX CODES

        Prefix codes are used to manipulate and test the terminal
characteristics.  As noted above, these consist of a pair of characters
of the form 1\\CODE.  In the following, the quantity [a; b] is the
basic value of the code, to which the appropriate number of bits of
value are to be "OR"ed.  a is octal; b is hexidecimal.

        CODE is subdivided into the form (4)SUBTYPE\(4)VALUE.  The
following list is in subtype order.

$<      1\\00 [000; 00].  Set ECHO-CONTROL.  The VALUE is a four-bit
quantity, of format:	(1)W\(1)X\(1)Y\(1)Z, where:
                W designates ECHO ON,
                X designates ECHO CONTROL-I,
                Y designates ECHO LINE-FEED with CARRIAGE-RETURN,
                Z designates ECHO CARRIAGE-RETURN with LINE-FEED.

#>      1\\01 [020; 10].  Terminal specific parameter.  Used for dial-
out to inform the host of special conditions (as yet undefined), such as
busy, ring-no-answer, etc.  The VALUE is the four-bit parameter.

$<      1\\01 [020; 10].  Set C/R DELAY and INPUT BAUD RATE.  The VALUE
is of format:	(1)X\(3)Y, where:
                X designates CARRIAGE-RETURN DELAY control,
                Y designates INPUT BAUD RATE (see 1\\10).

$<      1\\02 [040; 20].  Set OUTPUT BAUD RATE and PARITY.  The VALUE
is offormat:	(3)X\(1)Y, where:
                X designates OUTPUT BAUD RATE, according to the key
        under 1\\10,
                Y designates PARITY.  PARITY, if set, is set on output
        to the terminal.  Parity of characters input from the terminal
        is ignored.

$<      1\\03 [060; 30].  Set PARAMETER "A" and HALF-DUPLEX.  The VALUE
is of format:	(3)X\(1)Y, where:
                X designates the value of parameter "A",
                Y designates HALF-DUPLEX.


$<      1\\04 [100; 40].  Set PARAMETER "B".  The VALUE is of format:
		(3)X\(1),	where:
                X designates the value of parameter "B".
                The low bit is unused.

#_      1\\04 [100; 40].  Set PARAMETER "D".  When implemented, this
will superceed the current implementation.  Parameter "D" is a terminal
delay parameter which applies to the ALTERNATE of the normal delay
parameters.  That is, if CARRIAGE-RETURN DELAY is set, parameter "D" is
applied to LINE-FEED characters.  The mapping of parameter "D" value is
the same as for parameter "C".  The VALUE is the parameter.

!<      1\\05 [120; 50].  Set PARAMETER "C".  The VALUE is the
parameter.

!<      1\\06 [140; 60].  Set PARAMETER "B".  The VALUE is the
parameter.

!<      1\\07 [160; 70].  Set PARAMETER "A".  The VALUE is the
parameter.
        NOTE on PARAMETERS "A", "B", "C", and "D"...These parameters
are used to generate delays on output to the terminal to allow time
for the carriage to return.  The parameters can generate two different
delays, depending on the node involved.  In Varian TYMSATS, the delay
is in terms of CHARACTER TIMES;  In Interdata TYMSATS, the delay is in
units of 1/30 second.  For 30 cps terminals, there is no difference,
but there will be a difference in times for all other terminal speeds.

!<      1\\10 [200; 80].  Set OUTPUT BAUD RATE.  The VALUE is the output
baud rate, according to the key:

                baud rate       terminal speed or other
                0               110 baud (10 CPS)
                1               150 baud (15 CPS)
                2               300 baud (30 CPS)
                3               400 baud (40 CPS) (no terminals exist)
                4               600 baud (60 CPS)
                5               1200 baud (120 CPS)
                6               3767 type terminal (30 cps)
                7               2741 type terminal (15 cps)
                [10; 8]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [11; 9]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [12; A]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [13; B]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [14; C]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [15; D]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [16; E]         300 baud (10 CPS)
                [17; F]         300 baud (10 CPS)

<       1\\11 [220; 90].  Query FIELD PARAMETER.  The VALUE is the INDEX
of the appropriate field parameter as above (e.g., parameter "C" has
index 05).  The response generated by the TYMSAT is of the form of the
appropriate SET prefix code (e.g., in the example, the response is
1\\(4)05\(4)V, where V is the value of parameter "C").


<       1\\12 and 1\\13.  Query BIT PARAMETER.  This class of prefix
codes has the format 1\\(4)SUBTYPE\(3)INDEX\(1)UNUSED.  Note that this
pair of prefix codes can also be interpreted as the alternate format
1\\(3)subtype\(4)index\(1)unused.  The following list is in terms of
this format.  The response to these types is 1\\6\index\(1)value
(see section 1\14 and 1\\15).

!<      1\\5\06 [254; AC].  Query XON/XOFF ENABLE

!<      1\\5\07 [256; AE].  Query CARRIAGE RETURN DELAY

:	#<      1\\5\10 [260; B0].  Query ECHO CONTROL-H [backspace)

:	#<      1\\5\11 [262; B2].  Query REVERSE X-ENABLE

:	#<      1\\5\12 [264; B4].  Query KATAKANA


        1\\14 and 1\\15.  SET BIT PARAMETER.  This class is used to set
those terminal parameters which can be specified by one bit.  The format
is as described in 1\\12 and 1\\13, with "value" being the value of the
appropriate bit parameter. The quantity in "()" is the second byte,
where an even value turns the parameter off, and an odd value turns
it on.

        1\\6\00 [300; C0].  Set ECHO CONTROL

        1\\6\01 [302; C2].  Set ECHO CONTROL-I

        1\\6\02 [304; C4].  Set ECHO CARRIAGE-RETURN/LINE-FEED

:	#       1\\6\12 [324; D4].  Set KATAKANA


$       1\\16.  THis set is obsolete, and is used to transfer control
information.  The format is 1\\VALUE, where VALUE includes the subtype.

$@      1\\340.  ENTER 2741 TRANSPARENCY MODE.

$@      1\\341.  LEAVE 2741 TRANSPARENCY NODE.


!#      1\\17.  This set is used to transfer control information.  The
format is 1\\(4)17\(4)FUNCTION.  They will be tabulated according to
the 8-bit codes.

!<      1\\[360; F0].  HANG CHARACTER.  Causes the TYMSAT port to be
hung up (forced disconnect).

!<      1\\[361; F1].  TURNAROUND HANG CHARACTER.  Causes the tymsat
port to be hung if it is connected to a true half-duplex device.  (This
is necessary since, if the port is in input mode from an unattended
terminal, there is no way that the normal HANG command can be serviced
until the terminal turns around, and the port will be tied up for an
extended period.)

#@&<    1\\[362; F2].  ENTER TRANSPARENCY MODE.  Used for those
terminals which have character sets which are translated by the TYMSAT.

#@&<    1\\[363; F3].  LEAVE TRANSPARENCY MODE.  This function is also
effected if the TYMSAT receives a ZAPPER.

#=      1\\[364; F4].  ENTER ALTERNATE OUTPUT DEVICE MODE.  Used to
switch output on special devices or ports, ignored on all ports where
not applicable.  Used on CDC printer ports to divert output to printer.

#=      1\\[365; F5].  LEAVE ALTERNATE OUTPUT DEVICE MODE.  This
function is also effected if the TYMSAT receives a ZAPPER.

:	#       1\\[370; F8].  ENTER NETWORK COMPRESSION.  This function
:	is also effected if the TYMSAT receives a ZAPPER.  This code
:	originates entirely within the network.

:	#       1\\[371; F9].  LEAVE NETWORK COMPRESSION.  This function
:       is also effected if the TYMSAT receives a ZAPPER.  This code
:	originates entirely within the network.

#>      1\\[373; FB].  BREAK CHARACTER.  A "break" has been detected on
input.

!>      1\\[374; FC].  GRAY BALL.  Indicates a BLACK BALL has been
detected by the TYMSAT.


!       1\\[375; FD].  BLACK BALL.  Replaces the contents of a buffer
which has been zapped.  Indicates an unknown amount of data was lost.

!       1\\[376; FE].  ORANGE BALL.  The response to the receipt of a
YELLOW BALL.

!       1\\[377; FF].  YELLOW BALL.  May be used by any port to
determine when all preceeding characters have been flushed from the
circuit.


                COMMENTS

:	        1.  SEVEN-LEVEL MODE.  The network currently permits a
variety of compression techniques to be applied to certain terminal
ports.  These vary with the port and terminal type, and do not apply to
all ports and terminals.  An alternative is defined which is applicable
to ALL ports and terminals.  Because of universal applicability, the
network can use the feature for all circuits.  The data protocol used
in SEVEN-LEVEL MODE is herewith set forth:

        The network passes 8-bit characters, permitting a total of
400 (256D) unique codes in the character space.  The space is divided as
follows in SEVEN-LEVEL MODE:
:	        000-040 data character codes.
        041-077 character compression repeat count Rn.  The count is
biased by 040...code 041 is a repeat of one, 077 is a repeat of 37.
        100-177 ASCII blank repeat count Bn.  The count is biased by
077...code 100 means 1 blank, 177 means 100 blanks.
:	        200-377 data character codes.
:	        Any network escaped code (prefix-0) is also a data
:	character.

:	        Rn applies to the PRECEEDING  data character.  The
string "215\\212\\44" is expanded to the string "215\\212\\212\\212\
\212\\212", that is, "C-R\\L-F\\L-F\\L-F\\L-F\\L-F".  Simularly, a line 
consisting of 115 (=77D) dashes on a line can be compressed to the
string "'-'\\077\\077\\055".

:	        NOTES.  Codes 041-277 cannot be compressed.  They may
however be passed while under compression as escaped characters.

:	        SEVEN-LEVEL MODE is transparent to all users, except for
possible improvements in service.

:	Data flowing through the network has a transmitter at one end
of the circuit and a receiver at the other.  Implementation of this
compression mechanism within the network requires that ALL receivers
be modified to de-compress the data.  Only after this has been done can
selected transmitters be modified to compress the data.  The initial
candidates for modified transmitters will probably be the bases, to
provide immediate benefits for improved output.  It will be the
responsibility of the transmitter to decide when to turn compression on
and off.  In some instances (e.g., asynchronous terminal input)


compression will never be turned on: in other cases (e.g., asynch TYMCOM
nodes) it may be turned on at the beginning of a session and never
turned off.  In general, an examination of the data stream will be
necessary to make this decision.

        In addition to providing a uniform compression mechanism for
all ports and devices, such that programs or systems need not concern
themselves with special cases, this mechanism also permits higher-speed
devices (CDC printers, 2780/3780, 1200-baud terminals) to be services
at rates compatible with their output bandwidth without requiring a
corresponding bandwidth within the network.
