SPNODE                           v. 1.0               September 26, 1978


      SPNODE:  A Program to Examine SPOOL Printer/Node Assignments              



     One of the features of  the SPOOL program is that  it automatically
determines which printer to use  for a request based on the  Tymnet node
in  use by  the  job submitting  the  request.  In  addition,  the SPOOL
program informs  the user  of the  address and  telephone number  of the
printer site to make  it easier to track  down any listings that  may go
astray.

     These  features require  two data  bases:  a  list  that associates
printers to Tymnet nodes and  a list of addresses and  telephone numbers
for the printers.  The  node-printer associations are determined  by the
information in the file (SPOOL)NODPRI and the addresses are contained in
(SPOOL)PRIADR.  The  master files  are maintained on  system 8  with the
help of  the 1PNUPD  program.  There  is a PJ  job on  system 8  that is
responsible for  noticing changes  in the master  data bases  and moving
them around to all of the TYMCOM-IX's and TYMCOM-X's.

     The maintenance  of the  information contained  in the  master data
base is the responsibility of Validations.  But it is the responsibility
of  the SPOOL  maintainer to  insure that  the NODPRI  and  PRIADR files
accurately reflect the state of  the master data base.  This is  easy on
the TYMCOM-IX's because the files  simply have to be copies of  those on
System 8.  The  problem is more difficult  on the TYMCOM-X's  because of
the differences in the file formats.  SPNODE assists by printing out the
information in the  NODPRI and PRIADR  files in a  human-readable format
almost identical to that produced by the 1PNUPD program when  the latter
is  run  using the  PPA  option.  By  comparing  the output  of  the two
programs, the SPOOL maintainer can  easily determine if the data  on the
X's is the same as that on System 8 and take corrective action if  it is
not.(1)

     Because  the  program performs  only  a single  function,  the user
interface is very simple:  Run the program.  It will print a herald that
includes the version  number.(2)  It will then  ask for an  output file.
By typing a question  mark the user will  obtain a help message  and the
program will  ask for  the file  name again.   If the  file name  is any
initial substring of TTY:(3)  output will go to the  terminal, otherwise
it will go to the file named by the user.

     As SPNODE  reads the PRIADR  and NODPRI files  it does  some error-
checking on the internal format  of the files and any errors  it detects                
are reported to the  user.  A few are  regarded as drastic enough  to be
worth causing the  program to stop  and ask the  user if s/he  wishes to
proceed, though most are simply sent to the output file.  There  will be
a "fatal error" message if the  format of the NODPRI file appears  to be
drastically wrong, but all others may be continued from by typing a C to
the up-arrow prompt  that will be printed  on the terminal when  such an
error occurs.  The  error messages are  self-explanatory and so  are not
detailed here.


                     PRIADR and NODPRI File Formats                         


     There is separate documentation on these formats.  What  follows is
simply a sketch to serve as a reminder if you need to change  SPNODE for
some reason.

     PRIADR:  This  file contains the  address and telephone  number for     
each printer in the data base.  The file consists of a series of records
that are 64 (or  '100) words long.  Word 0  of the record should  be the
printer number stored as an  integer.  Since the printers are  stored in
numeric order (with blank records for printers that do not  exist), word
n00 (where n  is an octal integer)  should begin the record  for printer
number n.  The address and telephone number are stored in sixbit with 60
characters per line.   So there is room  for 6 lines per  record, though
currently the  6'th line and  the extra three  words are not  used.  The
address is contained  in the first 4  lines and the telephone  number is
the 5'th line.

     NODPRI:  Each (machine)  word in the  file represents a  node.  The     
maximum allowable node number is '3777.  The n'th word gives the printer
assignment for  node n  as follows:   the left  half of  the word  is an
integer corresponding to  the printer number and  the right half  of the
word will  be n.  Note  that this makes  it possible to  detect problems
with the file format.   For n < '4000, the  right half will also  be the
node number.  For n  greater than or equal  to '4000, the right  half is
the node number + '4000.

     Since customers and  Tymshare personnel often access  our computers
by  the same  TYMNET nodes  it is  often desirable  to have  one default
printer for customers on  that node and another for  in-house personnel.
To make  this possible,  words '4000-'7777 of  NODPRI contain  the node-
printer  associations for  in-house SPOOL  users.  Word  n  contains the
printer number in  its left half  and n in  its right half.   This means
that the right half contains the node number + '4000.

     The program begins with  a description, followed by  the definition

of some  frequently used  macros, followed by  the declarations  for the
global data  structures, followed by  the various procedures.   The last
page of  the source  contains the  main loop  and the  text of  the help
message.

     The main loop  begins by forcing input  from the terminal  to upper
case.  Then the herald  is printed.  This is  followed by a loop  to get
the name of the output  file (with any leading/trailing spaces  and tabs
removed) and to supply help if requested.

     The output file (if other than the terminal) is actually  opened by
the SETPRINT runtime.  The main processing follows.

     The procedure GetAddress opens the PRIADR file and reads it  in one
record at a time, checking it and storing the information.  Then GetNode
opens NODPRI and reads it in one word at a time, building a  linked list
for each printer that has nodes assigned to it.

     Then the list  of printer addresses is  printed, one by  one.  Each
address is immediately followed by the list of associated nodes.

     The final step is to close the output file if one was opened.

     The address and  phone number of each  printer is held in  a (SAIL)
record of class Printer.  This record consists of an integer to hold the
printer number, a string array to hold the address, a string to hold the
telephone number, a  pointer to the first  node assigned to  the current
printer, and a pointer to the next printer record.

     The information about the  nodes are contained in records  of class
Node.  These consist of  an integer to hold  the node number, a  flag to
indicate whether or not this is an "in-house" assignment, and  a pointer
to the next node.   Since there is a chain  for each printer, we  do not
need to save the printer number along with the node record.  (This would
be  needed if  we wished  to extend  the program  to allow  the  user to
specify a node number and be told which printer is assigned to it.)

     This should be enough  information to get you started  with SPNODE.
See  the  source file  for  internal documentation  and  details  of the
implementation.


                            Fixing Problems                             

     If, after  running SPNODE,  you find that  there are  problems with
PRIADR, you will have to fix them using FET.  This isn't  very difficult
given the layout of this file.  Simply copy the file to  your directory,

and change the offending record for the problem address.(4)

     If  there  are  problems  with  the  NODPRI  file  you  can  do the
following:

     1.  Log into system 8 and copy (SPOOL)NODPRI to your directory.

     2.  Use TELECOPY to move the  file to a PDP-10.  You MUST  give the                                                          
commands

MOD REC BIN FIL=R
MOD TRAN BIN FIL=R

to force TELECOPY to do the right thing while moving the file.

     3.  Then log into the system that you sent the NODPRI file to.  Run
the program FIXMAP.  It will simply ask for an input file and  an output
file.  The file you just brought in has the printer number in bits 12-23
and it needs to be in bits 0-17.  FIXMAP will do this for you.  Then use
TELECO to copy the file to all of the PDP-10's with bad PRINOD files and
install the new copy on the (SPOOL) directory on the problem systems.

     (4) It might be worthwhile extending SPNODE to allow editing on the
PRIADR file,  but since this  seems to  be a rare  problem, since  it is
fairly easy to fix the file  manually, and since there are a  great many
problems with SPOOL,  I didn't think  it was worth  the time now  to add
such a feature. /MCH
