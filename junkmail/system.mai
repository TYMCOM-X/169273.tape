   As of 12 Dec 85 code for the the majority IRC/PTT Subnet's can be
found as follows:
 
TRTNET     Primary System 33     Backup System 25
ITTNET     Primary System 33     Backup System 25

The code naming convention is the same as that used for the public
net.  
 
NOTE:  If in doubt on the location of any code please consult
       the Network Profile Database.  It has been updated to
       show the location of all code supported by this group
       that does not follow the convention used by the public net.
 
Field Engineering:  Please distribute this memo to the appropriate
                    field offices.

WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE BACKUP FOR THE TYM4000
DIRECTORY DUE TO LIMITED STORAGE ON SYSTEM 33.  AND AS I PERUSE THE
DIRECTORIES ON THE OTHER SYSTEMS, IT IS APPARENT THAT THE MAJORITY OF
FIELD OFFICES HAVE NOT REORGANIZED THEIR CODE FILES AS REQUESTED IN
PREVIOUS MEMOS.  THIS HAS RESULTED IN FOUR SYSTEMS WITH A LOT OF WASTED
STORAGE.

THE PURPOSE IN INSTALLING D54 WAS TO HELP RELIEVE THE RESOURCE CRUNCH
EVERYONE KEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT.  BUT I NEED YOUR COOPERATION TO MAKE
THIS SYSTEM WORK.  YOU MUST GIVE THIS MATTER A HIGH PRIORITY AND DO
THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY:

1.  TRANSFER, FROM YOUR DIRECTORIES ON SYSTEM 33, ALL FILES INVOLVED
     WITH NODES NUMBERED BELOW 4000 TO YOUR DIRECTORIES ON SYSTEMS
     25 AND 70.   UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRANSFER, DELETE THOSE SAME
     FILES FROM 33

2.  COPY, FROM YOUR DIRECTORIES ON SYSTEM 33, ALL FILES INVOLVED
    WITH NODES NUMBERED 4000 AND ABOVE TO YOUR DIRECTORIES ON SYSTEM 54.

3.  DELETE FROM YOUR DIRECTORIES ON 25 AND 70 ANY FILE ASSOCIATED WITH
    NODES 4000 AND ABOVE.

4.  DELETE ALL ###TEL.*   FILES  FROM ALL DIRECTORIES AND DO SO AT THE
    END OF EVERY SESSION.

5.  STORE ANY FILES NOT USED ON A REGULAR BASIS ONTO TAPE AND THEN
    DELETE FROM ONLINE STORAGE.  THIS SHOULD MOST ESPECIALLY BE DONE
    FOR NON-CODE FILES.

PLEASE HELP US HELP YOU BY PERFORMING THE ABOVE ACTIVITIES IMMEDIATELY.

THANK YOU.

   SUBJECT:   STORAGE POLICY ON PUBLIC NET CODE HOSTS
 
   ==============================================================
 
 
   As part of the system cleanup for hosts 25,  33,  54 and 70, and 
   to  maintain acceptable levels of storage for future needs,  the 
   following policy is now in effect:
 
   AT  ANY ONE TIME,  CODE FILES SHOULD ONLY EXIST IN ONE OF  THREE 
   DIRECTORIES:
 
              A)  YOUR PERSONAL DIRECTORY 
              B)  YOUR REGION'S CENTRAL DIRECTORY
              C)  THE MASTER DIRECTORY (TYMNET OR TYM4000)
 
   There is no reason to maintain duplicate files now that you  are 
   working on the master systems (25 and 54).
 
   Once you have genned code in your personel directory, you should 
   RENAME (NOT COPY) it into your region's central directory.   The 
   HQ  Code  Gen group,  upon receiving your backup  request,  will 
   RENAME  the  file(s) into the appropriate master  directory  and 
   telecopy it to the appropriate backup host.
 
   All  files currently in your personal directories for code  that 
   has  already been backed up must be deleted from all four  hosts 
   immediately.
 
   Until this is done,  we continue to operate with critically  low 
   storage on most hosts, particularly 33.
 
   Your immediate attention to this matter is required.
 
   Thank you.

Subject: SYSTEMS 25 & 54 DOWNTIME LAST WEEKEND 

                             MEMORANDUM

  SUBJECT:     SYSTEMS 25 & 54 DOWNTIME LAST WEEKEND
 
  ================================================================
 
 
  Several  complaints were registered this weekend about systems 25 
  and 54 being scheduled down for maintenance simultaneously.   I'd 
  like to set the record straight:
 
  They were not SCHEDULED down and will not be,  per Ed Barens, the 
  Dallas Data Center Manager.
 
  System 25 has been suffering from a DASD problem since  yesterday 
  which required a system rebuild.   Considering the size of system 
  25, this can take as much as a day to complete.
 
  System  54  suffered a base-initiated (EBUSS) crash at  the  same 
  time  25 was down.   Operations worked as quickly as possible  to 
  get 54 restored.
 
  Field Engineers also reported that they had no backup to 54 since 
  the TYM4000 files were not available on system 33.
 
  I  fail to see why this should have come as a surprise since this 
  was the song I was singing the loudest all last week:
 
        Since directories were not sufficiently cleaned up
        by field personnel, we were unable to load the tapes
        containing TYM4000 files.
 
  Until that was completed (late last Friday), it was fruitless for 
  the  HQ  CODEGEN group to try backing up the files created on  54 
  all  last week from 54 to 33.   Once they  received  confirmation 
  that  the  original  files were in place on  33,  they  issued  a 
  request  to cut a tape of all their work on 54 last  week,  which 
  was flown to Cupertino and loaded on Sunday (yesterday).  Both 54 
  and 33 are now in sync.
 
  I  wish  to express my thanks to the operators and management  in 
  Dallas  for their efforts to restore 25 and 54 this  weekend  and 
  for handling the calls from field personnel.:load off
