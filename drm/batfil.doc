                              Introduction                              



     (This  document was  revised  in the  light of  later  insights and
changes in the world at large by kmd on 11-Feb-82.)

     The  files  described here  play  an important  part  in generating
corporate  revenues, so  their  maintenance is  and will  remain  a high
priority task.

     NOTATION:   In the  following,  <CR> stands  for  a carriage-return     
(ASCII '15) and <LF> for a line-feed (ASCII '12).  <CRLF> is, of course,
a CR+LF.  All numbers are in decimal unless they begin with a ' in which
case they  are octal.  Most  of the file  names supply  some information
about the time and/or system  on which they were created.   This permits
them to be copied to  another system while retaining some  indication of
their source.  This is indicated in the file names as follows:

        sss  --  a 3-digit system number, e.g. 027 or 039.
        mmm  --  a 3-letter name of a month, e.g. JAN or NOV.

     FILES:   The  following  files,  all  located  on   (*1BATCH),  are     
described   below:   TTRMT.mmm,   BATsss.mmm,   RMTsss.mmm,  BAT370.mmm,
PARCHG.DAT, and SPLCHG.DAT.

     PROGRAMS:  The  following programs  read and/or  write into  one or     
more of the above files:  SPOOL, BATCH, LISTER, BCHARG,  RCHARG, 370CHG,
and (*1BATCH)RBCHG.

     WARNING:  This documentation  is still somewhat incomplete  and may     
contain  some inaccuracies.   It is  better than  earlier documentation,
but...   Documentation  on these  files  was allowed  to  slide  and the
following information has  been pieced together from  handwritten notes,
examination of copies  of current files, and  from reading the  code for
some of  the programs  writing into  these files.   More work  is needed
before  the following  can  be considered  to be  definitive.   Use with
caution and an open mind.

     NOTE:  All  of the  files are  formatted very  much alike  with the     
exception of TTRMT.mmm.  So we will discuss the others first.   See page
18 for a description of TTRMT.

     The remaining accounting files each consist of a series  of records
16 words in length.  All entries are in ASCII and, while they might look
somewhat strange, all of them (including TTRMT.mmm) can be listed on the
lineprinter.  With the  exception of words 11-15  and the first  two (7-
bit) bytes of word 0, they contain identical information.

     WORD 0:  The first two  bytes of word 0 sometimes contain  the two-      
digit system number.  In other  cases, they are interpreted as  a status
code.

         01  =  Voided Request
         02  =  Charging completed
         03  =  Charging not yet completed

     WORDS 11-15:  These depend on the job type.  The job type is stored      
in the last two bytes of word 10.  The valid types range between  01 and
13.(1)  They are interpreted as indicated in the following list.

  04                    Read magnetic tape
  05                    Write mag tape
  06                    (NOT USED--formerly miscellaneous)
  07                    Convert mag tape
  08                    (NOT USED--formerly foreign affiliate tape work)

  10                    Spool listing - part 1
  11                    Spool listing - part 2
  12                    Mag tape purchase only OR 370 tape purchase
  13                    Delivery charge only OR 370 delivery charge

     As mentioned earlier,  everything is in  ASCII.  The user  name and
project  code fields  are  alphanumeric and  padded with  spaces  on the
right.  Everything else is numeric and is padded with leading  zeroes or
spaces.


-------------------
     (1) But a code of "00" will often be found in PARCHG.DAT.  This can
be  understood to  mean "job  type not  yet known".   This  is necessary
because  of  the free-form  nature  of BATCH  requests--the  job type(s)
relevant  to  the request  will  not  be known  until  the  operator has
completed the work.

Problems:


     Some  of these  files are  written into  by several  programs.  The
formats (in particular,  whether a numeric field  is padded with  0's or
spaces) are not completely consistent.  Sometimes one convention is used
and at other times another.  This poses a potential danger  for programs
that attempt to take advantage of the special format of these files.

     Some of the files  are apparently supposed to contain  only records
that have a  status code in  word 0.  But  SPOOL and BATCH  (and perhaps
other  programs) sometimes  write records  that have  the  system number
instead.  The programs that read the files seem to interpret  the system
number as identical  to a status  of "03", so if  systems :1 or  :2 were
ever brought up as PDP-10's instead of 940's, SPOOL and BATCH accounting
would immediately collapse.  But there are no known serious  problems at
the moment.


                        Summary of File Formats                           

     BATsss.mmm:  This is the master accounting file for completed BATCH     
and SPOOL requests.  So it should contain all and only records for fully
complete transactions.  As far as I  know, the first field of word  0 of
each record  should be  the system  number.  Each  record should  have a
valid job type field.  As far as I know, only SPOOL, BCHARG,  and RCHARG
should write into this  file and only BCHARG, RCHARG,  and (*1BATCH)BCHG
(a program that summarizes the  data contained in the file)  should read
it.  It should  not contain records with  job types 00 (which  belong in                
PARCHG.DAT) nor 09  (which belong in  RMTsss.mmm).  Any other  valid job
type may occur.

     RMTsss.mmm:  This file is (probably) written by LISTER.   It should     
only contain records with job type 09.  Word 0 should contain the system
number.  Since  there are  no delivery charges  to compute  for "remote"
(i.e.  made by  the end-user  of the  listing, not  to be  confused with
SPOOL's remote listings),  no intermediate records  need to be  made for
job type 09.

     BAT370.mmm:  The master accounting file for 370 charges.  I believe     
that it should only exist on system 29.  It probably should only contain
entries for job  types 12 and  13.  The system  number should be  in the
40's.

     PARCHG.DAT:  The main file for partial BATCH and SPOOL  CENTER (job     
type 01) records.  The status  field in word 0 should always  be between
01-03 (but some programs write the system number, a potential  source of
trouble as mentioned above).   This file should not contain  entries for
job types 09-11.  Most of the  time the records will be for job  type 01
(completed SPOOL CENTER request  requiring delivery charges) or  for job
type "00" (which  can be interpreted as  "type not yet known").   When a
user submits a BATCH request,  BATCH makes an entry in this  file.  When
an operator  uses BCHARG to  complete the charging  on the  request, the



                                   3
M. C. Hinckley          Accounting File Formats             22 Nov. 1978


status is  reset to  02.  BCHARG  also makes  a copy  of the  record and
places it in BATsss.mmm.

     SPLCHG.DAT:   The  main  file for  SPOOL  REMOTE  (job  type 10+11)     
records.  If delivery charges are required, SPOOL will place  the record
here  for  use by  RCHARG  instead of  writing  a pair  of  records into
BATsss.mmm.  Notice:  The records should appear in pairs with all fields
except for  job type  and words  11-15 being  identical.  The  amount of
information required for proper  billing of a SPOOL REMOTE  request will
not fit into a single record, so pairs of records are written instead.

     BATCAN.mmm:  Contains canceled BATCH and SPOOL center records.  The     
PPN (GAN+AUN) field  is replaced by the  name of the  operator canceling
the request.  Like PARCHG.DAT, it should not contain any records for job
types 9-11.

     SPLCAN.mmm:   Contains  canceled SPOOL  REMOTE  requests  (hence it     
should  contain pairs  of records  of  job types  10 and  11).   As with
BATCAN.mmm,  the PPN  field  is replaced  by  the name  of  the operator
cancelling the request.  SPOOL requests canceled by the user  before the
listing was completed  will remain in the  main SPOOL data base  and are
not noted in the accounting files.

     The  diagrams on  the following  pages describe  the layout  of the
records for  each job  type.  The  differences in  words 11-15  of these
records are summarized in a table beginning on p. 14.

                               TTRMT.mmm                               



     This file is  (probably) produced by  LISTER.  Its format  is quite
different from the other files documented here.  Like them,  it consists
only of ASCII text.  But each record in the file will be either 24 or 25
(machine) words  long (see  "PROBLEMS", below).  The  file format  is as
follows:

        mm/dd/yy hh:mm<CRLF>
        EXTERNAL PRINTING<CRLF>
        JOB NO. ssnnn<CRLF>
        ENTERED BY: username<CRLF>
        BILLED TO: username2<CRLF>
        FILE: filename.ext<CRLF><CRLF>

     REMARKS:  There should  be one record  for each file  printed using     
LISTER.  The end  of the record is  indicated by a  <CRLF><CRLF>.  There
should be a corresponding  entry with a "job  type" of 9 (see  below) in
the main accounting file  (BATsss.mmm).  Note that there is  exactly one
space  wherever  a   space  is  indicated   above.   Mm  is   a  2-digit
representation of the month in  which the request was listed, dd  is the
date, yy  the year, hh  the hour (twenty-four  hour clock) in  which the
request was  listed, and  the second mm  is the  minutes.  Ssnnn  in the
third line will be the system number + batch request number (e.g., 27001
or 39762).  The username and  username2 fields will be a  directory name
padded with spaces on  the right if needed  to insure that it  is twelve
characters long.  Filename.ext will  be the file name that  was printed.
It is not padded with spaces.      

     PROBLEMS:  This  file has an  idiosyncratic format relative  to the     
other accounting files.   Each record will  usually look like  an ASCIIZ
string with one  or more NULL's  (ASCII '0) at  the end of  the record--
unless the file name contains exactly eight characters.  The record will
normally use 24 words--unless  the file name contains six  characters in
the name field and  three in the extension,  in which case 25  words are
needed.
