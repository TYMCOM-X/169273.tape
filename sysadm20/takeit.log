.
THE DISTRIBUTED MATCHING NETWORK SYNTHESIS PROGRAM, CADSYN, IS NOW IN
THE LIBRARY.  IT CAN BE ACCESSED BY TYPING "R CADSYN".  THIS PROGRAM
OFFERS EXACT SYNTHESIS WITH TRANSMISSION LINES, BASED ON THE PRINCIPLES
DEVELOPED BY KU AND PETERSEN. THE PROGRAM IS INTERACTIVE.
.
A NEW UPDATE TO AMPSYN (LUMPED MATCHING NETWORK SYNTHESIS) IS ALSO
AVAILABLE (VERSION 1.2).  THIS ADDITION OFFERS SEVERAL NEW COMMANDS AND
IMPROVED CAPABILITIES AS WELL.
DETAILED USER MANUALS AND UPDATE NEWS ARE AVAILABLE FROM COMPACT ENGI-
NEERING (PHONE 415-941-6223, OR TWX 916-370-7457) AND FROM TYMSHARE
DOCUMENTATION CENTERS.
A NEW VERSION OF COMPACT AND ADDITIONS TO THE DATABANK WILL BE AVAIL-
ABLE SHORTLY.  DETAILS ARE EXPLAINED IN APPENDIX 9 OF THE USER
MANUAL.
.
MAR 19, 1979: COMPACT VERSION 4.93, IMPLEMENTED 03/19/79
1. A MODIFIED FORM OF THE PROGRAM 'MSTRIP' (IEEE TRANS. MTT, PP. 418-
419; APR 1971) IS NOW AVAILABLE TO COMPUTE THE PROPERTIES OF MICROSTRIP
UNDER THE "TRLINES" OPTION.  IF THE "TRLINES" OPTION IS SELECTED, THEN
THE USER IS ASKED "BRYANT-WEISS OR APPROXIMATE (BW/A): ". THE CHOICE
"BW" CALLS THE 'MSTRIP' PROGRAM; THE CHOICE "A" INVOKES THE STANDARD
COMPACT CALCULATION AS DESCRIBED IN APPENDIX VI OF THE COMPACT REFERENCE
MANUAL.  THE PROMPTS FOR THE 'MSTRIP' PROGRAM ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE
FOR THE STANDARD PROGRAM.  THE FOLLOWING ARE SAMPLE DIALOGUES FOR USING
'MSTRIP' (USER INPUTS FOLLOW THE CHARACTER ":"):
A. MICROSTRIP
     FILENAME, "TRLINES", "TRXINFO", "NEWS" OR "STOP": TRLINES
     BRYANT-WEISS OR APPROXIMATE SOLUTION (BW/A): BW
     MICROSTRIP, SHIELDED MICROSTRIP OR QUIT (MS/SH/QU): MS
     ENTER SINGLE OR COUPLED LINES (S/C): C
     ENTER RELATIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT: 9.6
     FOR W/H, ENTER START, STOP, AND STEPSIZE: .1,.9,.2
     ENTER S/H RATIO: .4
     .
     END OF USER INPUT -- RESULTS ARE NOW PRINTED
     .
B. SHIELDED MICROSTRIP
     FILENAME,"TRXINFO","TRLINES","NEWS" OR "STOP": TRLINES
     BRYANT-WEISS OR APPROXIMATE SOLUTION (BW/A): BW
     MICROSTRIP, SHIELDED MICROSTRIP OR QUIT (MS/SH/QU): SH
     ENTER SINGLE OR COUPLED LINES (S/C): C
     ENTER RELATIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT: 9.6
     FOR W/H, ENTER START, STOP, AND STEPSIZE: .1,.9,.2
     ENTER H2/H FOR SHIELDED LINE: 2
     ENTER S/H RATIO: .4
     .
     END OF USER INPUT -- RESULTS ARE NOW PRINTED
     .
THE ABOVE VARIABLES ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
  W = WIDTH OF STRIP OR STRIPS
  H = THICKNESS OF SUBSTRATE (H1 IN MTT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION)
  S = SPACING BETWEEN STRIPS IN THE CASE OF COUPLED LINES
  H2= SPACING BETWEEN GROUND PLANES, IN THE CASE OF SHIELDED MICROSTRIP
NOTE: A SINGLE NUMBER IS AN ACCEPTABLE INPUT FOR THE "W/H START,
      STOP, AND STEPSIZE" PROMPT, IN WHICH CASE ONLY ONE W/H RATIO IS
      CONSIDERED.
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE 'MSTRIP' PROGRAM IS USED ONLY BY THE "TRLINES"
OPTION; INTERNAL COMPACT ANALYSIS AND OPTIMIZATION DO NOT USE 'MSTRIP'.
2. THE CODES 'SUM', 'PRD', 'DIF' AND 'RAT' HAVE BEEN MADE MORE
FLEXIBLE BY ALLOWING THE DEPENDENT AND THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES TO BE
IN DIFFERENT COLUMNS.  PREVIOUS RULES GIVEN ON PAGE 52 OF THE COMPACT
USER MANUAL, VERSION 4.8, STILL APPLY.  RULES APPLYING TO THE EXPANDED
CAPABILITY WILL BE GIVEN IN A FORTHCOMING NEWSLETTER.
3. WHEN OPTIMIZING 4-PORT COUPLERS (ELEMENT 'CPL') THE OPTIMIZER CAN
SELECT, UNDER SOME CONDITIONS, ZOO (ODD-MODE IMPEDANCE) > ZOE (EVEN-MODE
IMPEDANCE).  PRIOR TO THE PRESENT VERSION, THIS CONDITION, ZOO > ZOE,
CAUSED COMPACT TO TERMINATE.  VERSION 4.93 HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO RE-SET
ZOE AND ZOO AND THEN RESUME OPTIMIZATION USING RE-SET VALUES OF ZOE AND
ZOO ALONG WITH CURRENT VALUES OF OTHER VARIABLES, IF ANY.  ZOE AND ZOO
ARE SET TO PLUS AND MINUS 5 PERCENT OF THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO VALUES OF
ZOE AND ZOO AT WHICH CROSSOVER OCCURS; THAT IS, PLUS AND MINUS 5 PERCENT
OF THE AVERAGE OF THE VALUES SUCH THAT ZOO > ZOE.
4. A NUMERICAL PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED IN OPTIMIZING QUARTER WAVELENGTH
COUPLERS HAS BEEN CORRECTED.
5. COMPACT NOW WRITES DATA TO A USER FILE IN MORE CONCISE FORM WHEN AN
OPTIMIZED FILE IS SAVED AND WHEN S-PARAMETER DATA BANKS ARE USED.
JAN 10, 1979: COMPACT VERSION 4.83, IMPLEMENTED 01/10/79
1. A 'MODIFIED' OR AN 'OPTIMIZED' FILE CAN NOW REPLACE ANY PERMANENT
FILE INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL USER FILE.
JAN 10, 1978: COMPACT VERSION 4.81, IMPLEMENTED 01/10/79
1. THE INTERNAL EDITOR HAS BEEN CHANGED AS FOLLOWS:  AS BEFORE, THE COMMAND
'L,N' CAUSES 'N' LINES TO BE LISTED.  AFTER THE 'NTH' LINE HAS BEEN LISTED,
THEN THAT LINE IS AVAILABLE FOR EDITING, UNDER VERSION 4.81.  PRIOR TO
VERSION 4.81, THE 'N+1ST' LINE WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR EDITING IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE 'NTH' LINE WAS LISTED; THAT IS, THE 'NTH' LINE COULD NOT BE EDITED.
2. AN ERROR IN CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION HAS BEEN CORRECTED.
DEC 22, 1978: COMPACT VERSION 4.80, IMPLEMENTED 12/22/78
A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE:
1. IT IS NOW POSSSIBLE TO STORE THREE- AND FOUR-PORTS FOR LATER
USE.  THIS CAPABILITY IS DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED IN APPRENDIX VIII
OF THE COMPACT MANUAL, WHICH IS AVAILABLE FROM COMPACT ENGINEERING AND
FROM TYMSHARE SALES OFFICES.
2. MORE GENERAL CONNECTIONS OF COUPLED INDUCTORS ARE NOW POSSIBLE.  THIS
CAPABILITY IS ALSO DESCRIBED IN APPENDIX VIII.
3. 'INPUT', 'EDITED' AND 'OPTIMIZED' FILES CAN NOW BE THE SAME.
FURTHERMORE, IT IS NOW POSSIBLE FOR AN 'EDITED' OR 'OPTIMIZED' FILE TO
REPLACE ANY EXISTING FILE.
4. NEW DEVICES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE CENTRAL S-PARAMETER DATABANK.  USE
THE "TRXINFO" OPTION TO OBTAIN A CATALOG LISTING OF ALL DEVICES.
5. AN ERROR IN THE 'NEG' CALCULATION HAS BEEN CORRECTED.  THE ERROR
ONLY OCCURRED WHEN 'NEG' WAS APPLIED TO A TWO-PORT THAT WAS FORMED
BY A CASCADE CONNECTION USING EITHER 'CAS' OR 'CAX'.  FOR EXAMPLE,
THE RESULT OF
          RES AA SE 5
          NEG AA AA
WAS CORRECT.  HOWEVER, THE RESULT OF
          RES AA SE 5
          RES BB PA 10
          CAS AA BB
          NEG AA AA
WAS NOT CORRECT.  THE 'NEG' CODE IS EXPLAINED AS FOLOWS:  SUPPOSE
THREE MATRICES A, B AND C ARE CASCADED TOGETHER TO FORM D=A*B*C.
LET INV(A), INV(B) AND INV(C) REPRESENT THE INVERSES OF THE THREE
ABCD MATRICES A, B AND C.  'NEG' APPLIED TO MATRIX D PRODUCES THE
MATRIX
          INV(A)*INV(B)*INV(C)
BEFORE CORRECTION, 'NEG' INCORRECTLY PRODUCED THE MATRIX
          INV(C)*INV(B)*INV(A)
6. AN ERROR IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CODES 'X1G' AND 'X2G' HAS BEEN
CORRECTED.  THIS ERROR ONLY OCCURRRED WHEN THE ORIGINAL AND
TRANSFORMED TWO-PORTS WERE THE SAME.  FOR EXAMPLE, 'X1G BB AA' WAS
EXECUTED CORRECTLY.  HOWEVER, 'X1G AA AA' WAS NOT EXECUTED CORRECTLY
PRIOR TO CORRECTION IN VERSION 4.80.
7. THE GOAL FOR NOISE OPTIMIZATION HAS BEEN CHANGED.  THIS IS AN INTERNAL
PROGRAM CHANGE, AND DOES NOT REQUIRE A CHANGE IN THE USER'S DATA FILE.
IN GENERAL, THIS CHANGE SHOULD CAUSE THE OPTIMIZER TO FIND CONDITIONS
FOR A LOWER OVERALL NOISE FIGURE.
8. THE MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO PROVIDE MORE MEANINGFUL
RESULTS.  THE PRINT-OUT IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT SHOWN IN APPENDIX VII
OF COMPACT REFERENCE MANUAL, VERSION 5, DATED JULY 1978.
9. BOTH ANGLE AND MAGNITUDE OF S-PARAMETERS OF ACTIVE DEVICES ARE
SUBJECTED TO STATISTICAL VARIATION IN THE MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS, IF
THE PERCENT TOLERANCE OF S-PARAMETERS IS SPECIFIED INTERACTIVELY AS
BEING DIFFERENT FROM ZERO.
10. A QUESTION MARK, ?, IS NOW PRINTED AS A PROMPT FOR USER INPUT TO THE
COMPACT EDITOR.
11. AN ERROR IN THE COMPACT EDITOR WAS CORRECTED.  THE ERROR WHICH WAS
CORRECTED OCCURRED WHEN SPECIFIED NUMBER OF LINES WAS LISTED; THAT
IS, AFTER AN EDIT COMMAND OF THE FORM 'L,N' WHERE 'N' IS AN INTEGER.
12. A CHANGE WAS MADE IN THE COUPLED LINES 'MS' CALCULATION.  THIS CHANGE
WAS MADE TO OBTAIN AGREEMENT WITH OTHER VERSIONS OF 'COMPACT'.
13. THE 'S3' PRINT OPTION WAS CORRECTED.
14. SOME LINEFEEDS WERE ELIMINATED TO PROVIDE A MORE CONCISE TERMINAL
RECORD.

 EARLY REGISTRATION SINCE THE ATTENDANCES ARE LIMITED.
 FOR DETAILED INFORMATION CONTACT OUR OFFICE AT 415-941-6223
 .
 VERSION 4.7 UPDATE:
 .
 ===MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS=== 
 THIS STATISTICAL TECHNIQUE CAN BE REQUESTED BY TYPING OPTION 
 CODE "7", FOLLOWING THE NAME OF THE DATA FILE. 
 THIS OPTION WILL ALLOW USERS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF TOLERANCES 
 ON THEIR CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE AND GATHER STATISTICAL INFORMATION
 UPON THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE VARIATIONS.  THE ACCURACY OF THE RANDOM
 PREDICTION DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER OF "TRIALS" (SPECIFIED BY THE USER).
 WE RECOMMEND AT LEAST 150-250 TRIALS TO GAIN A REASONABLE STATISTICAL
 EVALUATION OF THE CIRCUIT. 
 LIMITS MAY BE PLACED ON (UP TO) ALL 15 VARIABLES THAT COMPACT
 CURRENTLY ACCEPTS. 
  THE VARIABLES ARE INDICATED WITH NEGATIVE SIGNS (JUST AS FOR AN 
  OPTIMIZATION) AND THE RANGE OR TOLARENCES MUST FOLLOW BETWEEN TWO 
  PARANTHESES, AS SHOWN BELOW 
 .
     RES AA SE -50(40,60)   OR   RES AA SE -50(10,15,%)
 .
 THE FIRST EXAMPLE SHOWS A 50 OHM RESISTOR,HAVING A TOLERANCE 
 RANGE OF 40 TO 60 OHMS, THE SECOND CASE SHOWS AN ALTERNATIVE INPUT 
 FORM WHERE THE TWO NUMBERS IN THE PARANTHESES ARE THE MINUS AND PLUS 
 PRECENTAGE LIMITS (-10 AND +15).  NOTE THAT THIS SECOND FORM REQUIRES
 A PRECENTAGE (%) SIGN AFTER THE LIMITS. IN BOTH CASES, THE LIMITS MUST
 FOLLOW DIRECTLY BEHIND THE NOMINAL VALUE OF THE VARIABLE.  THE USER IS 
 ALLOWED MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE PER DATA FILE LINE, BUT ONLY ALLOWED
 ONE TOLERANCE PAIR PER VARIABLE. 
   THE PRINTOUT WILL SHOW AN ANALYSIS OF THE INPUT/OUTPUT REFLECTION
 COEFFICIENTS AND THE GAIN IN DB. AT PRESENT, THE TOLERANCE RANGE SPECIFIED 
 IS DIVIDED UP INTO 20 EQUAL PARTS FOR THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
 THE S11, AND S22 ARE PRINTED OUT AS CONFIDENCE LEVEL CIRCLES.
 FOR EXAMPLE: 
   FREQ       (NOM VALUE)     99%     95%     90%     75%     50%    SIGMA 
     200       .262  -24.     .17     .13     .11     .08     .05    .65
 MEANS THAT AT 200 MHZ, THE NOMINAL VALUE IS .262 AT -24 DEGREES: AND 
 THE TOLERANCES CAUSE CIRCLES AROUND THE NOMINAL POINT AS FOLLOWS:
         99% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .17
         95% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .13
         90% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .11
         75% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .08
         50% OF THE UNITS WILL FALL IN A CIRCLE OF RADIUS .05
    THE SIGMA IS THE STANDARD DEVIATION ASSUMING A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. 
 THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION FOR THE CIRCUIT PARAMETERS. 
 THE PROBABILITY OF FINDING ANY VALUE IN THE TOLERANCE RANGE IS CONSTANT. 
    THE PRINTOUT FORMAT OF THE DB GAIN (S21 OR VOLTAGE) IS DIFFERENT: 
   FREQ      (NOM VALUE)    99%     95%     90%     75%     50%     SIGMA
    200        15.07 DB+   1.44    1.08     .91     .64     .39  .553 
                       -   1.37    1.03     .87     .61     .37  .526 
   THIS INDICATES THE DB GAIN LIMITS: 
          99% OF UNITS FALL BETWEEN +1.44 AND -1.37 DB OF NOMINAL
          95% OF UNITS FALL BETWEEN +1.08 AND -1.03 DB OF NOMINAL
   AND SO ON... 
   A SIMILIAR FORM IS AVAILABLE FOR THE OTHER PRINTOUT OPTIONS
      THE S-PARAMETERS FOR THE TWO-PORTS (OR TRANSISTORS FROM THE DATA- 
 BANK) MAY BE TOLERANCED BY ANSWERING THE QUESTION 'ENTER TOLERANCE ON
 S-PARAMETERS ' BY ENTERING FOUR NUMBERS, REPRESENTING THE TOLERANCE
 PLUS AND MINUS FOR EACH S-PARAMETER  IN THE ORDER S11,S21,S12,S22. 
 THE TOLERANCE IS APPLIED ON THE S-PARAMETERS FOR ALL FREQUENCIES,
 IN MAGNITUE ONLY, NOT ON THE PHASE.
 .
 ===CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION=== 
    THE VARIABLES CAN NOW BE KEPT WITHIN SPECIFIED BOUNDRIES.  THE
 LIMITS MUST BE PLACED IN PARANTHESES, DIRECTLY AFTER THE VARIABLE, 
 SAME AS FOR THE MONTE CARLO ANALYSIS (SEE ABOVE).
 THE SEARCH CONVERGENCE IS SLOWER IF ONE OF THE VARIABLES HITS A
 BOUNDARY, BUT ONLY IF IT HITS A BOUNDARY.  THEREFORE, THERE IS NO
 EFFECT FROM THE LIMITS UNTIL ONE OF THE VARIABLES EXCEEDS ITS
 UNDER TEST, AND SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.  THE "TRUE OPTIMUM" OF
 THE CIRCUIT MAY NOT BE FOUND USING THE CONSTRAINED SEARCH. 
 .
 ===LOSSY NOISE FIGURE CALCULATIONS===
   THE NOISE FIGURE COMPUTATIONS WILL NOW INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF 
 LOSSY ELEMENTS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF
 DATA FILE FOR TWO-STAGE AMPLIFIERS (ONLY WHEN NOISE IS SPECIFIED 
 FOR BOTH TRANSISTORS), AND THE REFERENCE PLANE OF THE PRINTED OPTI-
 MUM NOISE SOURCE IS NOW DEFINED AT THE INPUT OF THE CIRCUIT. 
 PREVIOUSLY, THE REFERENCE PLANE WAS AT THE INPUT OF THE FIRST TRAN-
 SISTOR, AS SHOWN IN EXAMPLE 12 IN THE USER MANUAL. 
 FOR EXAMPLE, THE DATA FILE OF A TWO-STAGE AMPLIFIER IS THE FOLLOWING:
      PREVIOUS METHOD                      NEW METHOD 
      TRL AA SE ...                        TRL AA SE ...
      SST BB PA ...                        SST BB PA ...
      CAX AA BB                            CAX AA BB
      NOF AA RN 50                         NOF AA RN 50 
      TWO BB S1 50                         TWO BB S1 50 
      TRL CC SE ...                        TRL CC SE ...
      .          (INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT)      .
      .                                    .
      IND GG SE ...                        IND GG SE ...
 ---> CAX AA GG                       ---> CAX CC GG
 ---> NOF AA RN 50                    ---> NOF CC RN 50 
 ---> TWO BB S1 50                    ---> TWO DD S1
 ---> TRL CC SE ...                   ---> TRL EE SE ...
      REST OF DATA FILE                    REST OF DATA FILE IS SAME
                                           EXCEPT THE SECOND "TWO"
                                           ELEMENT IS NOW "DD"
. 
  NOTE THAT THE CHANGE ONLY AFFECTS THE SECOND STAGE PART OF THE
 CIRCUIT.  PREVIOUSLY, THE CIRCUIT WAS CASCADED UP TO THE INPUT OF
 THE SECOND TRANSISTOR BEFORE THE SECOND "NOF" CALL WAS PLACED.  NOW, 
 THE INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT MUST BE CASCADED WITHOUT THE FIRST TRANSISTOR 
 (CAX CC GG) BEFORE THE SECOND "NOF" CALL.
 THE ACTUAL NOISE FIGURE OF THE CIRCUIT.
 .
 ===VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS=== 
 VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS ARE AVAILABLE FOR CASCADING INTO
 CIRCUITS, WHICH HAVE NO EFFECT UPON MATCH, ONLY UPON THE GAIN OR PHASE 
 OF S21 AND S12.  THE CODING IS THE FOLLOWING:
      VGB AA PO G1 SP SN F1 F2         VPB BB NE P1 P2 P3 F3 F4 
 WHERE FOR THE VGB CODE:
      G1 IS FLAT GAIN ACROSS THE FREQUENCY RANGE
      (PO IN COLUMN THREE INDICATES G1 IS POSITIVE DB OF GAIN)
      (NE WOULD INDICATE IN COLUMN THREE THAT G1 IS IN MINUS DB)
      SP IS UPSLOPE IN DB/OCTAVE STARTING AT FREQUENCY F1 IN MHZ
         (SP HAS NO EFFECT BELOW F1)
      SN IS DOWNSLOPE WITH FREQUENCY(MINUS DBS) IN DB/OCTAVE STARTING AT F2 
 FOR VPB: 
      NE INDICATES THAT P1 IS NEGATIVE PHASE
      P1 IS FLAT PHASE ACROSS THE FREQ. RANGE IN DEGREES OF PHASE 
      P2 IS ADDITIVE PHASE WITH FREQUENCY IN DEG/OCTAVE START AT F3 IN MHZ
      P3 IS MINUS PHASE IH DEG/OCTAVE STARTING AT F4 IN MHZ 
 SEVERAL VGB AND VPB BLOCKS MAY BE CASCADED TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED FORM. 
 EXAMPLE: 
      VGB AA NE 10 6 6 100 200
 WOULD INDICATE A -10 DB FLAT GAIN, WITH AN UPSLOPE OF 6 DB/OCT STARTING
 AT 100 MHZ, AND THEN FLAT GAIN AGAIN OF -4 DB STARTING AT 200 MHZ. 
 A TYPICAL APPLICATION OF THE VARIABLE GAIN BLOCK IS THE OPTIMIZATION 
 OF AN AMPLIFIER WHERE THE TARGET IS MAXIMUM GAIN FLATNESS REGARD-
 LESS OF THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE GAIN.  IN THIS CASE, WE CASCADE
 A VARIABLE GAIN BLOCK TO THE AMPLIFIER AND SET ITS GAIN TO A VARIABLE
 QUANTITY.  WE SPECIFY THE DESIRED OVERALL FLAT GAIN FOR THE CASCADE
 COMBINATION.  DURING THE OPTIMIZATION, THE GAIN OF "VGB" WILL BE SET 
 TO THE OPTIMUM VALUE AND THE NET GAIN OF THE AMPLIFIER WILL BE THE 
 FINAL OVERALL GAIN LESS THE GAIN OF "VGB".  FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HAVE
 OUR AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT DEFINED BY TWO-PORT BLOCKS AA THROUGH FF, AND
 WE DEFINE THE GG BLOCK FOR VGB 
 ...... 
 VGB GG PO -10 0 0 0 0           (+10DB VARIABLE GAIN FOR GG) 
 CAX AA GG                      (WE CASCADE VGB TO THE OUTPUT)
 PRI AA S1 50 
 END
 100 500 100
 END
 .001 
 1 1 1 20 
 END
 .
 AND WE ARE ASKING FOR A 20 FLAT GAIN FOR THE OVERALL CIRCUIT.
 WHEN THE OPTIMIZATION CONVERGED (ENDED), WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE FINAL
 GAIN OF VGB.  LET'S ASSUME IT IS 7.22 DB.  THEN, THE NET GAIN OF 
 THE AMPLIFIER IS 20-7.22=12.78 DB. 
 NOTE THAT THE VARIABLE GAIN AND PHASE BLOCKS MAY ALSO BE USED
 WITH THE CONSTRAINED SEARCH DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO KEEP THE OVERALL 
 GAIN OF THE AMPLIFIER WITHIN DESIRED LIMITS. 
 S11 AND S22 OF VGB ARE ALWAYS SET TO THE IMPEDANCE SPECIFIED ON THE
 PRINT (PRI) LINE AND THE S21*S12 PRODUCT IS SET TO 1.0 INTERNALLY. 
 THIS WILL ASSURE A "SEE-THROUGH" CONDITION FOR THE IMPEDANCES, 
 WHICH MEANS THAT WE SHALL GET THE TRUE S22 OF THE AMPLIFIER EVEN THOUGH
 WE CASCADED VGB TO ITS OUTPUT. 
 ANOTHER POSSIBLE APPLICATION IS AN EQUALIZER DESIGN (MAGNITUDE 
 AND/OR PHASE). 
 .
 WE MODIFIED THE COMPUTATIONS OF THE CIRCULAR STUB (CST) ELEMENT. 
 PREVIOUSLY, THE THIRD COLUMN CODE WAS ALWAYS "PA".  NOW, THE 
 USER HAS AN OPTION OF SPECIFYING MICROSTRIP OR STRIPLINE (MS OR SL)
 MODES.  A WORD OF CAUTION: THE EXPRESSIONS INVOLVED ARE BASED ON 
 APPROXIMATIONS RATHER THAN EXACT CALCULATIONS. 
 .
 WHEN AN EDITED OR OPTIMIZED FILE IS SAVED, COMPACT CAN ONLY HANDLE 
 SIX NUMERICAL ENTRIES ON EACH LINE OF THE CIRCUIT DEFINITION SECTION 
 OF THE DATA FILE.  THIS MEANS THAT IF LIMITS ARE PLACED ON MORE THAN 
 ONE VARIABLE FOR A COMPLEX ELEMENT (CPL, GEN, VGB, ETC.) THAT REQUIRES 
 FOUR OR MORE ENTRIES, THE FILE CAN NOT BE SAVED FROM COMPACT.  AN ERROR
 MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED WHEN THIS PROBLEM OCCURS.  OF COURSE, THE
 EXECUTION IS NOT AFFECTED, ONLY THE STORAGE PROCEDURE IS HALTED.

NEWS OF JULY 21, 1977:
A NEW ALGORITHM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE -SEO- CODE.  THIS SHOULD
IMPROVE THE CONVERGENCE AND OPERATION OF THE CODE.
NEWS OF JUNE 13, 1977:
A PROBLEM WAS FIXED WITH THE S2/S4 PRINT OPTION WHEN USING MORE
THAN ONE PRI COMMAND IN A SINGLE DATA FILE.  ERRONEOUS NUMBERS WERE
PRINTED OUT FOR THE STABILITY RESULTS.  
A CORRECTION WAS MADE FOR ELECTRICAL LENGTH CALCULATIONS IN
.
COMPACT NOW OFFERS TWO-STAGE NOISE FIGURE CALCULATION AND
OPTIMIZATION.  THE USE OF THIS CALULATION FOLLOWS THE NORMAL
USAGE THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE MANUAL (EAMPLE #12), EXCEPT THAT
NOW UP TO TWO #NOF# CODES MAY BE DEFINED IN A DATA FILE. FIRST, STAGE
1 INPUT CIRCUIT IS DEFINED AND INTERCONNECTED. AT THAT POINT, THE
#NOF# CODE IS USED, FOLLOWED BY THE TWO-PORT AND THE REST OF THE
INTERSTAGE CIRCUIT.  THEN, AFTER INTERCONNECTION, THE SECOND
NOF CODE IS USED, FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF THE CIRCUIT AND THEN
INTERCONNECTED.  (SINGLE STAGE APPLICATIONS AND THE #NOS#
OR #NOP# CODES ARE NOT AFFECTED ).
.
MICROSTRIP AND STRIPLINE MODES FOR COUPLED LINES.
NEWS OF APRIL 21, 1977:
THE FILE HANDLING OF THE COMPACT DATABANK HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVED.  USERS SHOULD NOTICE REDUCED TRU COST WHEN USING THE DATABANK.
.
SMITH CHART PLOTTING OF S11 OR S22 IS NOW AVAILABLE.  THE CHART PRINTS 
AS POINTS, WHICH ARE MAJOR LINE INTERSECTIONS ON A 7 INCH SMITH CHART.
 A TRANSPARENT OVERLAY CAN BE MADE AND USED WITH THE CHART.
THE CHART IS ACCESSED WITH THE "PLO" COMMAND, AND AN ADDITIONAL
QUESTION IS ASKED TO ACCESS THE SMITH CHART . THE DATA IS REPRESENTED
BY THE ALPHABET, WITH "A" REPRESENTING THE FIRST FREQUENCY POINT, "B"
REPRESENTING THE SECOND DATA POINT, AND SO ON.  (THE SEQUENCE REPEATS
AFTER 26 FREQUENCIES).  IF TWO DATA POINTS OCCUR IN THE SAME
CHARACTER LOCATION, THIS IS REPRESENTED BY A "#".
.
NEW TRANSISTORS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE DATABANK BY HP, NEC,AND TRW.
PLEASE RUN THE CATALOG USING THE TRXINFO COMMAND.
.
PLEASE CHANGE THE FOLLOWING IN THE COMPACT MANUAL UPDATE SHEETS IN
APPENDIX IV, PAGE 1:
IN THE DATA FILE DEFINITIONS OF TRL, OST,SST, AND CPL ELEMENTS(MS AND SL MODES ONLY) THE RELATIVE DIELECTRIC CONSTANT, K(R), IS
MISSING. INSERT "K(R)" BETWEEN "F(0)" AND "H" EVERY PLACE WHERE THE
LINE IS DEFINED BY ELECTRICAL LENGTH. THERE ARE FOUR CHANGES IN
APPENDIX IV. ALSO, ON PAGE IV-1, "H" IS MISSING FROM THE DEFINITION
OF "OST" IN THE "SL" MODE. "H" SHOULD PRECEDE THE LOSS TERM, THE SAME
WAY AS IT DOES FOR THE "TRL" ELEMENT IN THE "MS" MODE. IN THIS SAME
LINE, CHANGE THE ZO TO W, SINCE THE FOURTH DATA COLUMN REPRESENTS
THE WIDTH OF THE LINE.
.
A CORRECTION WAS MADE ON COMPACT TO STORE THE OPTIMIZATION DATA OF AN
EDITED FILE, EVEN IF THE OPTIMIZATION WAS NOT REQUESTED (OPTION 1, ETC)
.
A NEW VOLTAGE GAIN DEFINITION IS NOW AVAILABLE (INSERTION VOLTAGE GAIN.)
THE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED GAIN WAS DEFINED AS V(OUT)/V(S) FOR ANY SPECIFIED
RESISTIVE TERMINATIONS.  THE NEW OPTION IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE
OUTPUT VOLTAGES WITH AND WITHOUT THE TWO-PORT IN THE CIRCUIT. THIS NEW
FORM IS TYPICALLY USED IN FILTER DESIGN.
THE PRINT FORMAT IS THE SAME FOR BOTH OPTIONS (PRI AA VG RS RL).  THE
PROGRAM WILL ASK THE USER TO SPECIFY THE DESIRED FORM, DURING THE
EXECUTION.
UPDATE PACKAGE (BEING PRINTED)  IN EXAMPLE 18.  IF YOU NEED THE 
DESCRIPTION NOW, CALL OUR OFFICE (415-968-7025), OR CONTACT YOUR LOCAL
