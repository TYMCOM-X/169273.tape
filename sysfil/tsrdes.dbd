  900594,01,Because of the way TITO is coded, files can be                                 
  900594,02,truncated when stored.  This appears to happen                                 
  900594,03,because of a time lag between the time TITO does

  900604,01,Program did not work on 7 Jan 81.  Why?  Ans:                                  
  900604,02,There is no way of telling after the fact.                                     
  900604,03,Possibly network problems.

  900607,02,future?  Ans:  Due to kludge to fix the 1980                                   
  900607,03,problems.  2.  Are files with future dates

  900608,01,TITO can truncate files in some circumstances.                                 
  900608,02,This has caused serious problems for SLIGOS

  900611,01,TIO will not allow the user to set a baud rate                                 
  900611,02,of 4800.  Needed to permit testing of Tymnet's

  900613,01,In some cases, printing to CDC printer does not                                
  900613,02,work for TRW.  Due to directory (*1BATCH) being                                
  900613,03,created on TRW XX with the wrong PPN.                                          
  900614,01,When using CENTER, a <CR> without a <LF> is                                    
  900614,02,handled properly (i.e., the following text is                                  
  900614,03,overprinted or underlined).  But when using                                    
  900614,04,REMOTE, SPOOL supplies a <LF> which is not the                                 
  900614,05,right thing to do.                                                             
  900615,01,1.  Have PERFROM echo all commands to the TTY.                                 
  900615,02,2.  Even nicer if it would send all output to a                                
  900615,03,disk file.                                                                     
  900616,01,If a non-existant directory is used in the R or                                
  900616,02,RUN commands, the user gets "?FILENAME NOT                                     
  900616,03,FOUND".  It should be "NO USER NAMED...".                                      
  900617,01,PERFORM will not accept lower-case input.  Also                                
  900617,02,have to type PERFORM since perform doesn't work.                               
  900617,03,This one has been reported before by others.                                   
  900618,01,This ITSR suggests several improvements that                                   
  900618,02,would make FINE more useful, e.g., permit                                      
  900618,03,display of text past column 79.

  900619,02,sometimes hangs and times out at the point where                               
  900619,03,SPOOL is accepting the list of file names.                                     
  900619,04,Possibly due to a missing <CRLF> not sent from                                 
  900619,05,the 940.

  900620,03,which forced correcting by repeatedly giving                                   
  900620,04,"CANCEL 0" until all of the bad records went

  900621,03,than to zap the whole system.                                                  
  900622,01,The SOURCE needs ^H character settable for

  900623,02,versions of SCAN, ! is a comment char, so the                                  
  900623,03,proper command to send is "/RUN:LOADER".  This                                 
  900623,04,could affect other languages also.

  952028,02,performing a "read" function; TAPE had been                                    
  952028,03,transmitted with the wrong protection.                                         
  955002,01,Records urgently needed bug fixes to 1BCHARGE                                  
  955002,02,and 1RCHARGE.                                                                  
  958001,01,TAPCHG was missing from (SSPAMBIN:38) and close                                
  958001,02,to 100 stuck TAPE requests were mounting in                                    
  958001,03,SPOOL; new command added to the SPOOL FIXER,                                   
  958001,04,"CREATE (SPOOL.TAP)".                                                          
  958002,01,A non-existeng filename in ':com<filename>' causes PCOM to drop into           
  958002,02,SAIL runtimes with an I/O device error.                                        
  958005,01,It does NOT remove licence from a file.  Example included.                     
  958006,01,1PNUPD won't accept internal node 4037 and won't report external node          
  958006,02,properly!  (1PNUPD AND NODPRI are not set up for node numbers>4000, SPOOL      
  958006,03,can handle the external but not the internal nodes.)                           
  958006,04,CEGI noe has two nodes with numbers > 4000.                                    
  958007,01,changes to make:  (1) allow 'TAB' and 'BLANK' as field separators;             
  958007,02,(2) allow lowercase characters within text strings;  (3) translate             
  958007,03,lowercase to uppercase outside text strings (including commands)               
  958007,04,(4) allow 'Q' as a valid abbreviation for 'QUIT'                               
  958008,01,Filcom doesn't seem to recognize semicolons at the ends of lines when          
  958008,02,doing an ASCII compare but finds them in binary mode.                          
  958009,01,The TTYUP function seems to set the user's terminal to uppercase mode          
  958009,02,regardless of the user's initial setting.  Thus, if the user does not          
  958009,03,do a TTYUP(false) before exiting, they are stuck in uppercase mode.            
  958009,04,Of course, this means they are stuck in lowercase mode if they do              
  958009,05,do do a TTYUP(false).

  958012,01,MAGCON apparently does not accept a change to the "unload tape"                
  958012,02,parameter.  It accepts user input, then does the wrong thing.                  
  958013,01,A carriage return given ahead to "parts" puts SPOOL in a loop.
