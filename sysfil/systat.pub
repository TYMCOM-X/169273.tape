.sec DESCRIPTION;
.skip 1;

SYSTAT is a versatile Tymshare utility program
on the TYMCOM-X system.  It displays at a terminal extensive and
detailed information about activity on the TYMCOM-X system 
at any time.

This document supersedes all other Tymshare documentation of
SYSTAT and all DEC documentation of SYSTAT which has
been used by Tymshare.

.sec GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS;

.ss Calling the program;

SYSTAT is called from the Monitor or Executive mode
with a command in the following general form:
.byhand;

-SYSTAT [search command] [job status control command(s)]
	[system information control command(s)]
.endhand;

where the bracketed portions are any of those commands listed
in {secref commands}.  Any SYSTAT command can be abbreviated to
the shortest form which distinguishes it from any other SYSTAT
command.  In this manual, a carriage return completes a command
unless stated otherwise.

SYSTAT will, in general, print a preamble followed
by a summary of activity and then return to the executive.  The
various commands given to SYSTAT when calling it as well as the
license of the user determine the type and quantity of
information which is printed.  The SYSTAT program
leaves the terminal in the Executive or Monitor mode
throughout the operation of the program.
The activity summary is a combination of the optional reports that
can be obtained from SYSTAT.  These are a job status
display and numerous other system information displays that are
selected by the user.

.ss System commands which access SYSTAT;

The following commands to the Monitor also access
SYSTAT:
.byhand;
	PSP
	SYSNO
	USERS
	WHERE [names (user or device)]
	WHO
.endhand;

These commands are explained in {ssref execom}.
.sec VALID COMMANDS, commands:
.ss Search commands;

The following commands (options) select the jobs about which
information will be printed.  Normally, all jobs which the
user is authorized to see will be listed.  Using a search
command causes a job status display to be done (without headings)
subject to the options selected.
.byhand;

Command		  Meaning

[GAN,UUN]		List all jobs under the specified global
			account number and universal user
			number.  Either the GAN or the UUN may
			be replaced by an asterisk designating a
			wild half; for example: [6], [7,*],
			[*,122], [1,21].

job number		Prints the specified job number.

<program>		List all jobs running the specified
			specified program; for example:  <SYSTAT>.

#teletype number	 List job associated with the specified
			teletype number; for example:  #52.

(user name)		List all jobs under the specified user
			name.
.endhand;
.ss Job status report control commands;

The following commands indicate which fields in the job status
report are to be printed.  One or more of these commands may
be entered at a time, and the fields listed will be an
IOR combination of the ones requested.  The default option
is NORMAL.  The job numbers are always listed in the first
column.  Some of the
commands also affect the other reports
available from SYSTAT and are described again in {ssref sysinf}.

individual job field commands are used.  PERFOR and
shared segment information (which can't be requested specifically)
is printed when no search command is used and one or more of the
job status commands for individual fields are used.

monitor level calls.
.byhand;

SYSTAT UP		Gives system up time.

SYSTAT ME		Does a WHO command on the user's
			job (see {ssref execom}).
.endhand;

.ss Executive or Monitor level commands, execom:

	The following commands, which access SYSTAT, are given at
the Executive level.  A question
mark can be typed following any of the commands
listed below in order to obtain help.

.sss PSP;

This command lists all errors on the system (Prints System
Problems).

.sss SYSNO;

This command prints name of system, monitor number, and date
the system was generated.

.sss USERS;

This command prints information about any users on the system
in the following format:
.byhand;

Users=A Det=B [C,D], Queues: RUN=E DIO=F, TIO=G IO=H SPC=I

where:	A = number of jobs logged into the system
	B = number of jobs logged in that are detached
	C = number of jobs logged in with user's global account
	D = number of jobs logged in under your user name
	E = jobs running (monitor states:  RN WS TS DS)
	F = jobs doing disk I/O (MQ DA CB DI MO)
	G = jobs doing TTY I/O or idle (TI ^C)
	H = jobs doing non-disk/TTY I/O (DT DC MT IO)
	I = jobs in special queues (SL AX)

.endhand;

.sss WHERE;

This command prints information about a specified device or
user name.  If a user name is given, SYSTAT verifies if the
user is logged in and prints the job number; if a TTY, SYSTAT
names the job which is attached to the TTY.

Arguments to the WHERE command are separated by commas
and may be any of the following:
.byhand;

	device name:
	user name
	TTYnn:		(where nn is a number)
	OPR:
.endhand;

Information is reported in corresponding order to the arguments.  If
the user forgets to use arguments or leaves a trailing comma,
SYSTAT will prompt for the information by typing
"ENTER NAME:  ".

.sss WHO;

This command lists all users on the system about whom the user
is authorized to obtain information.  Arguments to the
command are:
.byhand;

nnn		Given job number.
nnn-nnn		Any range of job numbers.
.		 List the user's name and number.
*		Same as "."

The default case is to list all users.
.endhand;
.ss Obtaining HELP information;

SYSTAT and the Monitor level calls which access
SYSTAT accept the command "?" which gives a brief set
of instructions and indicates how more information may be
obtained.  To get a copy of all HELP documentation
available, use the command "?HELP".

.sec CLARIFICATION OF OUTPUT DISPLAYS;
.ss Special characters;

At the end of each line of the job status report, SYSTAT may
print any of the following special characters as messages.
.byhand;

Character	  Meaning

#		 Non-system high segment
$		User running RUN ONLY program
*		MAIL WAITING message waiting to be typed
+		Tymshare in-house user
!		Controlled user
.endhand;

In addition, SYSTAT prints a "*" immediately following the job
number of the user on a job status printout.

.ss Job status fields;

.sss TYMNET FIELD;

This field identifies the node from which the associated
job originated.  It contains the node name

second entry gives additional detail about the program
condition.

.endhand;

.sss FILES command;

The summary of information printed by the FILES command
is divided into five fields.  The following is an explanation
of the four possible modes which could appear in the
MODE field.
.byhand;

Mode		Explanation

DUMP		The file is opened without any Input/Output
		buffers.
IN		File is opened with just an input buffer.
OUT		File is opened with just an output buffer.
UPD		File is opened with both input and
		output buffers (UPDATE mode).

.sec NOTES ON OPERATION;

.ss Effects of user license on status reports, userlicense:

SYSTAT license is required to obtain some of the system
information such as complete disk
status reports and to get a job status report on jobs outside
one's own GAN.  Performance statistics that are reported
will not reflect the total system load if the user has inadequate license to
obtain the necessary information.

Read files license is necessary to obtain all the file information
(such as shared directories).
