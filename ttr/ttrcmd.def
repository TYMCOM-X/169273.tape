            before any tape action commands will work.  The
            format for this command is:

            This command rewinds the tape and verifies that it
            is in TITO format.  If the format is not recognized,
            the tape will be unloaded and the program will prompt
            for a new tape device name.

            creation date, tape-write date, size in pages and the

            are entered on the following line.  A range of positions
            is indicated by a dash between two positions and multiple
            positions are separated by commas.  For example:

                1,6-10,22-44,77,120

$$C$CMD( Forget, "      Forget the translation of usernames", ["

            translation for FOO, type:

            format is:

                OUTPUT mode file-name

            where mode is one of TERMINAL, FILE or BOTH (HELP or ? will
            give a brief list of the available modes), and file-name is
	    the name of the listing file.

            Note:  If TERMINAL is specified for the mode, then the
                   file-name should not be specified.  If it is, then

                RESTORE file-list

            where file-list is a TYMCOM-X file specification in the

$$C$CMD( Rewind, "      Rewind the current tape", ["
            To rewind the magnetic tape to the beginning of tape.
            This operation is done automatically when the device
            is initialized.

            To reposition the magnetic tape at the point just before

            the requested position, a rewind is done first."],

$$C$CMD( Translate, "   Translate usernames to directory names", ["
            To specify a directory name on disk to be used to restore
            files from a specific username on tape.

            Normally, files are restored from tape into the users
            current default directory.  However, in order to restore
            files into another directory, or to specify that some files
            should be restored to one directory and other files should
            be restored to a second directory, the user must translate
            the usernames on tape to match physical directory names on
            disk.  Any number of usernames may be translated.  This is
            done by making entries in the TTR translation table.  The
            format of the command is:

                TRANSLATE diskname=tapename

            To list the current translation table, simply type:

                TRANSLATE

            Refer to the FORGET command for information about erasing
            entries from the TTR translation table."]  )


$$C$CMD( Unload, "      Rewind and unload the current tape", ["
            To rewind the magnetic tape to the beginning and then
            unload the tape from the drive.  This function will only
            work on those tape devices which have an unload function."],
	 CMD$NeedTape )


$$C$CMD( Verbosity, "   Set the RESTORE verbosity level", ["
            To specify the amount of information that should be
            typed on the terminal during a RESTORE operation.  The
            default is to only type TYMCOM-X directory usernames.
            However, this may be changed to see any combination of
            file names, directory usernames, dates, file sizes and
            checksums.  The command format is:

                VERBOSITY item-list

            where item-list is one or more of the following:

                ALL,      CHECKSUMS,  DATES,    DIRECTORY,
                FILES,    NAMES,      SIZES,    USERNAMES"]  )


$$C$CMD( Zone, "        Set the current time zone", ["
            To change the default time zone used for the file-creation
            and tape-written dates.   The default time zone is GMT.
            To have the dates printed in local time, use the command:

                ZONE local-time daylight-modifier

            where daylight-modifier is optional and designates that
            daylight-savings should be calculated into the time as
            well.  Local-time is one of the standard abbreviations
            for each of the time zones.  For example, in California
	    PACIFIC, PST, PDT, and PACIFIC DAYLIGHT may be used."]  )
