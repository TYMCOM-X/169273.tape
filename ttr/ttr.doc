INTRODUCTION


     1.0  INTRODUCTION

          The TTR program is designed to  allow  users  of  TOPS-20  and
     TENEX  to  transfer  files  written  in  TYMCOM-X  TITO format from
     magnetic tapes directly to disk.   TTR  can  perform  most  of  the
     useful  directory  and  restoration  commands  available  in  TITO.
     However, commands to the TTR program are  NOT  identical  to  those
     found in TITO.



     2.0  PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

          This document is intended for reference ONLY.  Each command is
     described  below  and  some  pertinent  examples  are given.  It is
     assumed  that  the  user  is  familiar  with  magnetic  tapes,  the
     operating  system  commands,  and  procedures  for  running  system
     utilities.



     3.0  NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS AND DEFINITIONS

          Square brackets, [ and ], are used to enclose  optional  items
     or optional syntax.

          Angle brackets, <  and  >,  are  used  to  enclose  conceptual
     entities and are not part of the syntax.

     NOTE:  On TOPS-20, directory names are enclosed in angle  brackets;
     however,  this  is  not  so  in  the  TTR  program.   Directory and
     usernames are specified without enclosing  brackets  of  any  kind,
     except   when   specified   as   part   of  a  full  TYMCOM-X  file
     specification, in which case the  directory  name  is  enclosed  in
     parentheses ().



     4.0  USER COMMANDS

     Each TTR command may be abbreviated to the shortest  unique  string
     of  characters.   For  example, QUIT may be abbreviated to Q, while
     RESTORE and REWIND must be specified to at least 3 letters, RES and
     REW.

         The command prompt is "TTR>".

USER COMMANDS


     4.1  The HELP Command

          To obtain a list of commands with a brief description of their
     functions, the user should type "HELP" or "?".

         TTR> HELP

         TITO Tape Reader %1.15
         Commands:
           Device     Select a magnetic tape device
           Directory  List the files found on the tape
           Forget     Forget the translation of usernames
           Output     Change output designation (Terminal,File,Both)
           Restore    Restore the following files from tape
           Rewind     Rewind the current tape
           Translate  Translate usernames
           Unload     Rewind and unload the current tape
           Verbosity  Set the RESTORE verbosity level
           Zone       Set the current time zone
           Help or ?  Reprint this message
           Quit       Exit from the program


          Additional HELP is also available for each individual command.
     The  standard  one-line  message shown above is augmented by a more
     in-depth description.  Simply type "HELP" followed by the  name  of
     the command.

         TTR> HELP REWIND

         Rewind  Rewind the current tape

                 To rewind the magnetic tape to the beginning of tape.
                 This operation is done automatically when the device
                 is initialized.

                 Note:  Some other tape action commands will rewind
                        the tape in order to reposition the tape.




     4.2  The QUIT Command

          After completing the appropriate tape "action"  commands,  the
     user may use either QUIT or EXIT to leave the program and return to
     the EXEC level.  These commands will close  any  open  output  file
     (thus the data will not be lost).
TTR - TITO Tape Reader                                            Page 3
The DEVICE command


     4.3  The DEVICE Command

          The DEVICE command is used to select a magnetic  tape  device.
     This  command  must  be  specified  before  any  of the tape action
     commands can be used (i.e.  DIRECTORY, RESTORE or  REWIND).   If  a
     tape device is already selected, this command may be used to select
     another device.  The format of the DEVICE command is as follows:

         DEVICE tape-device

     The user should specify the tape-device name.  On TOPS-20 the colon
     (:)  character  is usually required following the device name.  TTR
     will accept the device name with or without the colon.  If the user
     merely types:

         DEVICE

     then TTR will prompt the user for a tape-device name:

         Tape Input Device:  MTA0:

     If the device is not available to the user, (for example, the  user
     has not MOUNTED or ASSIGNED the tape drive), then TTR will print an
     error message and ask for another input device:

         Tape Input Device: MTA0:
         Device "MTA0" not available.
         Please enter another device name or "NO".
         Tape Input Device:

     If the user responds with NO, then TTR will abort the operation and
     exit  to command level.  The user may then correct the problem with
     the tape device and re-enter the same (or another) device name.

          If the tape device is accessible, then  TTR  reads  the  first
     record  from  the  tape to verify that the tape was written in TITO
     format.  If the tape is not a  properly-formatted  TITO  tape,  TTR
     prints the message:

         Tape NOT in TITO format.
         Please mount another tape and try again...
         Tape Input Device:

     TTR also rewinds and unloads the current tape from  the  drive  and
     prompts  for  another  device  name.  Again, this may be aborted by
     entering "NO" as the device name.  If the tape is in  TITO  format,
     TTR  prints  a  message  to  identify  the tape and then returns to
     command level:

         Tape  1 from TITO version 16

The DIRECTORY and RESTORE commands


     4.4  The DIRECTORY And RESTORE Commands

          The DIRECTORY command is used to list the tape position  of  a
     file  (or  all  files) on a tape or to list the name of a file at a
     specific tape  position  (or  range  of  positions).   The  RESTORE
     command  is  used  to copy files from magnetic tape to disk.  Files
     may be specified by range or by name  (or  both).   The  syntax  is
     simply:

         DIRECTORY [ file-specification-list ]
             and
         RESTORE [ file-specification-list ]

     where the file-specification-list is an optional list  of  TYMCOM-X
     file specifications.  Specifications may contain wildcard filenames
     and extensions using "*", "#" or "?" where appropriate.   Usernames
     are  enclosed  in  parentheses.   The  following are legal TYMCOM-X
     file-specification-lists:

         (USERNAME)FILE.EXT
         (USER1)FILE.*,(USER2)FIL???.SAI,(USER3)###PCO.BAK
         (USERNAME)
         FILE.EXT,FOO.BAR

     If DIRECTORY is entered without a file-specification-list, then all
     files  on  the  tape  will  be  searched.   If  just  a username is
     specified (line #3 in the above example), then all  files  in  that
     username  will  be  searched.   If the username is omitted (line #4
     above), then all usernames will be searched.

          To speed up tape processing, TTR prompts the user for a  range
     of tape positions.  A carriage return means to search from position
     1 through the end-of-tape.  (EOT can be specified as "END").   Each
     position  (or  range)  should be separated by a comma, using a dash
     (or minus sign) to indicate a range of positions.   Note  that  the
     user need not specify the positions in numerical order.

The TRANSLATE and FORGET commands


     4.5  The TRANSLATE And FORGET Commands

          Tapes  written  in  TITO  format  contain  files   which   are
     associated  with TYMCOM-X usernames.  These usernames generally are
     not the same as the usernames on TENEX or TOPS-20  and  will  often
     require  some  type  of  translation.  By default, TTR will restore
     files from all usernames  on  the  tape  to  the  user's  connected
     directory.   However,to  restore  an  entire  account  or  group of
     accounts, the TRANSLATE command would be used to associate TYMCOM-X
     usernames with individual TENEX or TOPS-20 directory names:

         TTR> TRANSLATE DISKNAME=TAPENAME
         TTR> TRANS DISK1=TAPE1,DISK2=TAPE2

     To print out a list of current translations,  enter  the  TRANSLATE
     command without specifying any username:

         TTR> TRANS

         Usernames will be translated as follows:
         DISKNAME <== TAPENAME
         DISK1 <== TAPE1
         DISK2 <== TAPE2


          To "turn off" a translation, the user should  use  the  FORGET
     command.   The  TYMCOM-X  username  found  on  the  tape  should be
     specified with this command.  For example, given  the  translations
     shown  above,  the  user  could  FORGET  the username "TAPENAME" by
     typing:

         TTR> FORGET TAPENAME

         Forgetting... DISKNAME <== TAPENAME

         TTR> TRANSLATE

         Usernames will be translated as follows:
         DISK1 <== TAPE1
         DISK2 <== TAPE2

     In order to forget all translations, the user need  only  type  the
     FORGET command without specifying any usernames.

         TTR> FORGET

         Forgetting all translations

The VERBOSITY command


     4.6  The VERBOSITY Command

          The user has the option of setting the amount  of  information
     typed  on the terminal while performing a restore.  This is done by
     using the VERBOSITY command.  The default is to print the usernames
     found  on  the tape as the files are restored.  If more information
     is desired, then it may be changed as follows:

         TTR> VERBOSITY ?

         Unrecognized verbosity value "".
         -- Please enter one of --
             ALL,    DIRECTORY,    FILES,    NAMES
             USERNAMES,    DATES,    SIZES,    CHECKSUMS

         TTR> VERBOSITY NAMES DATES CHECKSUMS
         TTR> RESTORE SWITCH.INI

         Done!

     If a full listing (similar to the DIRECTORY  command)  is  desired,
     then the user should enter:

         VERBOSITY ALL

     Note:  Each new VERBOSITY  command  will  completely  override  any
     previous  command.  However, if more than one field is specified in
     a single command, then all of the specified fields will be printed.

The ZONE command


     4.7  The ZONE Command

          Files stored on  TITO  tapes  contain  information  about  the
     creation  of  the  individual  file  as  well  as when the tape was
     written.  This date and time  information  is  stored  in  TYMCOM-X
     format  for  GMT  time  rather  than  system local time.  Thus, for
     directory  purposes  and  on  the  restore  command,  it   may   be
     appropriate  to  show  this  information in system local time.  The
     ZONE command allows the user to specify which time zone to use  for
     local  time.  After execution of the ZONE command, TTR will convert
     all date and time information into local area time.

The OUTPUT command


     4.8  The OUTPUT Command

          The user may specify that the output should  be  sent  to  the
     terminal (T), to a disk file (F) or to both the terminal and a disk
     file (B).  This is done using the  OUTPUT  command.   The  complete
     syntax is:

         OUTPUT [ mode [ logfile ] ]

     where mode is one of:  TERMINAL, FILE or BOTH, and logfile  is  the
     name  of the current output logging file (needed for modes FILE and
     BOTH).  If part of the command is  not  completely  specified,  TTR
     will prompt the user for the next missing part.

         TTR> OUTPUT

         Change output to (T,F,B,?): ?

         Output modes are:
           Terminal  - output to user's terminal
           File      - output to file (prompts for filename)
           Both      - output to both terminal and file

         Change output to (T,F,B,?): BOTH
         Output file name: TTR.OUT

     This command could also have been specified on one line as:

         TTR> OUTPUT BOTH TTR.OUT

     Thus, to print a directory into a file and not have the long output
     appear on the terminal, do the following:

         TTR> OUTPUT FILE TTR.DIR
         TTR> DIR
         Tape positions: 5-10

         Done!

     To restore full listing to the terminal,  of  course,  the  command
     "OUTPUT  TERMINAL"  should  be used.  This will also close any open
     listing files created by "OUTPUT FILE" or "OUTPUT BOTH".



     4.9  Tape Positioning Commands

          To reposition the tape at the beginning  of  the  reel  or  to
     completely unload the tape, use the REWIND and UNLOAD commands.
