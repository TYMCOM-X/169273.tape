Some commands use the value of the argument, but do something peculiar
when there is no argument.  For example, the C-K (Kill Line) command
with an argument <n> kills <n> lines and the line separators that
follow them.  But C-K with no argument is special; it kills the text up
to the next line separator, or, if point is right at the end of the
line, it kills the line separator itself.  Thus, two C-K commands with
no arguments can kill a nonblank line, just like C-K with an argument
of one.
